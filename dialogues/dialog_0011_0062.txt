DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding the requirements at my place of work. It has to do with the masks and other protective gear they are asking us to wear. I need to discuss a possible exemption, or at least, understand what my options are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. We can absolutely discuss that. Workplace safety requirements and potential exemptions are important. To best understand your situation, could you elaborate on why you feel you might need an exemption?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not that I want one, understand. I take my work very seriously. I protect people, and I wouldn't do anything to put them, or myself, at risk. But I’ve been having… difficulties. With my breathing, specifically. It’s hard to explain, but the masks make it… harder. It feels like I can't get enough air. It causes a bit of panic, truthfully. I've never experienced anything like it before this new requirement started.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knabenshue. It's good that you're taking this seriously and are proactively addressing it. Experiencing difficulty breathing is certainly concerning, and it’s important to investigate that, especially when it's new and related to a specific trigger like mask use. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the type of mask you are required to wear at work?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. They are… the blue surgical masks, I believe you call them. The ones with the little pleats and the ties. They fit around the ears and have a metal strip to pinch around the nose. They’re… fairly standard, I suppose. I believe they are single-use, we get a new one each shift. They've also mentioned N95 masks might be required soon, for certain situations, but so far, it's mostly been these blue ones. I’ve tried adjusting them, tightening, loosening… it doesn’t seem to make much difference. The feeling is still there.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Knabenshue. That's helpful. And to clarify, this difficulty breathing only occurs when you're wearing the mask?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is correct. When I am not at work, I have no trouble breathing whatsoever. I walk quite a bit, enjoy being outdoors… I've never had any issues with shortness of breath or feeling like I can’t get enough air until these masks became required. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I’m a large man, and I pride myself on my physical health.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Knabenshue. It is unsettling when something new like this develops, especially given your usual good health. To get a more complete picture, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. Never. I’ve been generally healthy my entire life. Had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I've never been hospitalized for anything lung-related, and I've never been prescribed any inhalers or medications for breathing difficulties. I had a fairly thorough physical just last year for my work, and everything was normal. They check our lungs with the… the listening tube, I suppose you call it? And all was clear then. This is completely new.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Knabenshue. That’s very helpful. And to confirm, that physical last year included auscultation of your lungs, meaning the doctor listened to your breathing with a stethoscope?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is correct. They listen to my chest every year as part of the work requirements. It’s a fairly standard procedure. They check my heart as well, and everything is always… good. They always tell me I have a strong heartbeat. A little loud, perhaps, but strong. It’s good to know, but it doesn’t help me breathe when I'm wearing one of these masks, does it?
DOCTOR: No, unfortunately not, Mr. Knabenshue. A strong heartbeat is certainly reassuring, but it doesn't address the breathing difficulty you're experiencing with the masks. Let’s move on to a brief review of your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have asthma, COPD, allergies, or other respiratory conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had allergies, seasonal ones, mostly. Pollen, dust… things like that. She would take over-the-counter medications for them. But no asthma, no COPD. And my father, he was very healthy as well. Lived to be 85, never had any breathing problems. I have a sister, she’s doing well, no history of lung issues either. As far as I know, there’s no family history of serious respiratory conditions. We're a fairly hardy bunch, usually. I do have some distant relatives on the reservation who… well, they smoke, but I wouldn’t consider that a hereditary condition, would you?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. That's good to know. And you are correct; smoking is a lifestyle factor, not a hereditary condition. To be thorough, do you have any allergies yourself – to medications, foods, insect stings, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. Never had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I can recall. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, been stung by a few bees… never had a problem. I'm fairly certain I'm not allergic to anything. I eat a lot of berries, especially in the summer, and I've never had a reaction to those. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, actually. A lot of people I know have sensitivities and allergies… I seem to have avoided all of that. It’s just this mask thing… it’s baffling.
DOCTOR: That is good to know, Mr. Knabenshue. It does sound quite perplexing, especially given your overall good health and lack of allergy history. To finish up with your medical background, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take an aspirin for a headache, but that’s about it. I try to stay away from medications as much as possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself whenever I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s more for general health, not for any specific condition. Nothing prescribed, nothing long-term. Just the occasional aspirin and sometimes a multivitamin. That’s it. I'm a fairly simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. That’s very helpful. Now, to understand what's happening, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and look at your oxygen saturation level. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, please do. I want to figure out what's going on. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment, and I want to get to the bottom of this mask issue as soon as possible. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me, that would be great. First, I’ll listen to your lungs. Okay, Mr. Knabenshue, your lung sounds are clear bilaterally. I don’t hear any wheezing, crackles, or other abnormal sounds. Your breathing is a bit labored, but that could be related to your anxiety about the difficulty you're experiencing. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within the normal range. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is also within the normal range. However, it's important to note that this is at rest. We may need to check it again while you're simulating wearing a mask. Now, could you please try to put on a surgical mask, just like the one you use at work, and take a few deep breaths?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Oh… There it is. I… I don’t like that feeling. It’s… tight. It’s hard to explain. It’s not painful, exactly, but… restricting. Like I’m not getting enough air. My chest feels… constricted. It’s… unsettling. It feels like I need to take another breath, but it's difficult to do so.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue, your oxygen saturation dropped to 92% while wearing the mask. That’s a bit concerning, although not immediately life-threatening. Alright, Mr. Knabenshue, that was helpful. Your oxygen saturation is already returning to 96% now that the mask is off. It appears the mask is contributing to some degree of respiratory distress. It's possible you have a mild form of obstructive lung disease that is being exacerbated by the mask, or that the mask is triggering anxiety that is leading to hyperventilation and a feeling of breathlessness. It could also be a combination of both. Given your history of generally good health and normal lung exam at rest, I think it’s important to get some further testing done to rule out any underlying lung conditions. I would like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. This will help us determine if you have any obstructive lung disease or other respiratory issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. A chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test… yes, please. I want to figure out what’s going on, and if that’s what it takes, then so be it. I appreciate you taking this seriously and not dismissing my concerns. It’s… reassuring. I’m happy to do whatever testing you deem necessary. Can you tell me a little bit more about those tests? What exactly will they involve?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. Let me explain those tests in more detail. A chest X-ray is a quick and painless imaging procedure. You’ll stand in front of an X-ray machine while a technician takes a picture of your lungs and heart. It doesn’t involve any radiation exposure that is harmful, and it can help us identify any abnormalities in your lungs, such as fluid buildup or inflammation. It takes only a few minutes. The pulmonary function test, or PFT, is a bit more involved. You'll breathe into a mouthpiece connected to a machine that measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. It involves several different maneuvers, such as taking a deep breath and blowing out as hard and as long as you can. It will take about 30-45 minutes. A respiratory therapist will guide you through the process. Both tests are relatively safe and can provide valuable information about your lung function. I’ll write the orders for these tests now, and I’ll have my nurse schedule them for you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding wearing a mask as much as possible until we have the results of these tests. Do you have any questions about these tests or anything else we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That explanation was very clear. I understand what those tests involve, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain them to me. Avoiding the mask until we have the results… yes, that sounds sensible as well. I'm relieved to hear that. Thank you. I suppose… one question. What if they do find something? What would that mean for my work? I’m a Protective Service Worker, and it requires a certain level of physical fitness. Would I be… unable to continue?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Knabenshue, and I understand why you’re asking that. It’s important to address those anxieties. If the tests do reveal an underlying lung condition, the implications for your work will depend on the severity of the condition. A mild case of asthma, for example, might be manageable with medication and reasonable accommodations, such as avoiding certain triggers or wearing a different type of mask. However, a more severe condition could potentially limit your ability to perform certain tasks. I can’t give you a definitive answer right now, as we don’t know what the tests will show. But if we do find something, I will work with you to develop a plan that is tailored to your specific needs and limitations. I can also provide you with documentation to share with your employer, outlining your medical condition and any necessary accommodations. And, if needed, I can refer you to a specialist in occupational medicine who can provide further guidance. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. We'll take things one step at a time. We'll have a clearer understanding once we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds alright. One step at a time. I appreciate your honesty, and your willingness to work with me. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re not just dismissing my concerns, and that you’re willing to explore all possibilities. Alright. Let’s get these tests scheduled. Whenever you’re ready. Thank you, Doctor Neppl. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help. My nurse, Sarah, will come in shortly to schedule those tests for you. She'll also provide you with any necessary paperwork or instructions. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all for now. You’ve answered all of my questions, and I appreciate your thoroughness and compassion. I’ll wait for Sarah, and follow her instructions. Thank you again, Doctor Neppl.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, please don’t hesitate to reach out if any questions arise before your appointment. Take care, Mr. Knabenshue, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. .
