DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… wanted to check things out. Been feelin' okay, mostly. Just thought it was a good idea to come in, you know? See how things are doin'. It's been a while since I had a proper look-over.
DOCTOR: That's… sensible. Preventative care is always good. “Feelin’ okay, mostly” is a little vague, though. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, work's been the same. On the boats, keepin' things oiled and runnin'. Gets kinda tiring, but it’s work. No real pain or nothin’. Just… sometimes I feel a little more tired than usual, I guess. And maybe a bit more… forgetful? But nothin’ serious, really. Like, where I put my keys, things like that. It happens, right?
DOCTOR: Right, happens to everyone. Fatigue and… occasional memory lapses. Okay. When did you start noticing this increased tiredness?
PATIENT: Let me think… probably… a couple months ago? Around June, maybe? It wasn’t sudden, just kinda crept up on me. At first I thought it was just the heat, you know? Summer bein' hot and all. But it didn’t really go away when it cooled off a bit. That’s when I started thinkin’ maybe somethin’ was up.
DOCTOR: June… okay. And has this fatigue been interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Not really interferin’, no. I still get my work done. Still do everything I need to. Just… it takes a little more effort, you know? Like, I need a longer nap on my days off than I used to. And sometimes I just… feel kinda sluggish. Not sick, just… slow. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Sluggish” is a good way to put it. Okay. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… not that I can think of, right now. Maybe… I’ve been kinda thirsty more often, but I figured that was just from bein’ out in the sun too. I eat okay, I think. Mostly just normal food. Not much fancy goin’ on, but… nothin’ I’ve noticed that's really different. Is there somethin' specific I should be lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Increased thirst… alright. And any changes in your… bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… well, yeah, actually. Now that you mention it… I've been goin' to the bathroom a bit more often, too. Both kinds, I guess. Not a lot more, just… more frequent. I thought it was just somethin' I was drinkin’ or somethin’. Didn’t think much of it. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s… useful information. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, just to get a broader picture. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much whatever, thankfully. My ex-wife was always tryin’ to get me to eat healthier, but I was always fine with everything she made, or didn’t make. Heh. Sorry, didn't mean to ramble.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. No need to apologize. And what about any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ at all. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. Always try to tough things out, you know? That’s how my grandpa was, and he lived a long life. Just… basic stuff, like maybe an aspirin if I get a bad headache, but that’s about it. Haven’t needed much lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications. Now, have you had any serious illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a kid, I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree, but that was a long time ago. And… I had the flu a couple of times, I guess. Not really serious stuff, though. Never been in the hospital for nothin’ major. Just the usual bumps and bruises, workin’ on the boats.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mom's still around, she's doin' okay. Lives a couple of towns over. My dad passed away a few years back. He had… heart problems, I think. And my brother, he’s got high blood pressure, but he doesn't really take care of himself. Besides that… nothin' I can think of, really. My grandpa on my mom's side lived to be 90, so maybe good genes?
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your brother, heart problems in your father. Alright. Just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' like that. Never been much of a smoker. Tried it once or twice when I was younger, didn’t like it. And I don’t really drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with the guys every now and then, but that’s about it. And definitely no drugs. Never been into any of that. I like keepin' my head clear, you know? Gotta be sharp on the boats.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s… helpful. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable or somethin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up on the examination table, that would be great. I'll start with your blood pressure. Now, I’m listening to your heart now. … Your heart rate is a little elevated, but nothing alarming. And your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look in your ears… … Everything looks normal there. And finally, open your mouth for me… … Your throat looks a little dry, but nothing significant. Alright. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit on the higher side.
PATIENT: 140/90? Is that… bad? My dad always had high blood pressure, like I said. I guess I got that from him. What does that mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s… elevated, yes. Not critically high, but it’s something we need to monitor. And given your father’s history, it’s certainly something to pay attention to. The fatigue, increased thirst, frequent urination, and now this blood pressure… I want to run some blood tests just to rule out anything serious. We’ll check your blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… smart. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. If it’ll help figure out what’s goin' on, then yeah, let’s do the blood tests. I just wanna know what’s wrong, you know? And if it’s somethin' like my dad, I wanna know what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. And we can discuss your options once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated and… trying to reduce your stress levels as much as possible. I’m also going to give you a referral to a cardiologist just for a preliminary evaluation, given your family history and slightly elevated blood pressure. I’ll have the lab slip and referral ready for you before you leave. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. A cardiologist, huh? Okay. I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry. So, just blood tests and see a heart doctor. Got it. How long do you think it’ll take to get the blood test results back? And… how do I schedule an appointment with the heart doctor? Do you have a number I can call?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within three to five business days. The referral form has the cardiologist’s number and instructions on scheduling an appointment. They’re quite busy, so it might take a week or so to get an appointment, but they’ll call you to confirm. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Chest pain, shortness of breath… got it. I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me, and for not brushin’ me off. I’ll go get the blood tests done right away. I’ll let you know how it goes. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Heindel. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And please, take care of yourself. Have a good day.
