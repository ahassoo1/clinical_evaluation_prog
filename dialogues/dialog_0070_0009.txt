DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Though, I must say, this suburban location is… underwhelming. But never mind that. I’m here because of my vision. It’s been… deteriorating. Not rapidly, mind you, but noticeably. It’s becoming rather inconvenient, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I see. Deteriorating vision, becoming inconvenient… that’s certainly something we should investigate. And you say this has been a gradual process, not sudden?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. It’s not as though I woke up one morning unable to see. It’s… subtle. Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, especially in low light. And reading… well, let’s just say the print seems to be getting smaller and smaller, despite my best efforts. I do find myself holding things further and further away, if that makes any sense. It's been going on for...oh, I’d say the better part of a year now, maybe longer. I don’t pay terribly close attention to such things.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual decline in sharpness, especially with low light and reading, and needing to hold things further away... that gives us a good starting point. Have you noticed any other changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm. Let me think. Well… occasionally, things seem… distorted. Not constantly, mind you, and not severely. It’s as though I’m looking through slightly rippled glass. And sometimes, I get… floaters, I believe they call them? Little specks drifting across my field of vision. Annoying, but hardly debilitating. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always had excellent eyesight. This is quite a bother. And rather inconvenient, as I mentioned. I have important documents to review, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, distorted vision and floaters are helpful to know. It’s good you’ve noticed those. And you said this has been going on for around a year now?
PATIENT: Approximately. Perhaps a little longer, truthfully. I haven't marked it on a calendar, Doctor. I’m a professional, not a… a record keeper of my own failing eyesight. It simply is. And it’s been… progressing, shall we say. Slowly, thankfully. But noticeably enough to be a nuisance. I used to be able to read the fine print on contracts without so much as a glance. Now… now it requires effort. An indignity, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. It's certainly concerning when changes occur that affect your daily life, especially something as important as your work. Let's go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or glaucoma?
PATIENT: Medical history, you say? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been a rather healthy individual. I maintain a… disciplined lifestyle. As for diagnoses… I had a bout of influenza a few years back, but that hardly qualifies as a medical condition. High blood pressure? No. Glaucoma? I don’t believe so. I’ve seen doctors, periodically, but they never mentioned anything of the sort. I suspect they simply couldn’t find anything wrong with me. A rare occurrence, I assure you. I’m not one for… ailments.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Alcorta. And it’s helpful to know you haven’t had any prior diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… No, nothing significant. I had my tonsils removed as a child, a rather common procedure, I believe. And… oh, a minor skin tag removed from my back a few years ago. But hardly a surgery, Doctor. A quick snip with a scalpel, that’s all. Nothing that would… affect my vision, certainly. I maintain a careful appearance, you understand. Preventative measures, mostly. I am not one for letting things… deteriorate.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils as a child and a minor skin tag removal. Good to know. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? A rather… complicated subject, Doctor. My mother… she was not one for discussing such things. And my father… well, let’s just say he wasn’t around much. As far as I am aware, there’s no history of… eye problems, specifically. A few cases of arthritis on my mother’s side, perhaps. And my uncle, I believe, had something with his… digestion. But nothing pertaining to the eyes. A rather unremarkable lineage, truthfully. Not prone to… fragility.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Alcorta. It sounds like there isn't a strong family history of eye issues. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What precisely do you mean, Doctor? I maintain a… professional demeanor, if that’s what you’re asking. I’m divorced, if that’s relevant. And I don’t partake in… frivolous activities. I find solace in my work and… quiet contemplation. I don't smoke, and I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. And I prefer intellectual pursuits to… social gatherings. Is that the sort of… history you require?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Alcorta. Now, just one final question regarding your medical background. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I am, thankfully, immune to such… inconveniences. I've never experienced an allergic reaction in my life. Though, I recall a slight… discomfort after consuming shellfish a few years ago. But that hardly qualifies as an allergy, Doctor. More of a… temporary indiscretion. I maintain a rather… refined palate, and rarely indulge in anything questionable. I assure you, I am not prone to… sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Alcorta, thank you for providing that information. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination of your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination, you say? Very well. Though, I must warn you, Doctor, I have rather… sensitive eyes. And I do have important meetings scheduled for this afternoon. I trust this won’t be a… lengthy procedure? Proceed, but be gentle, if you would. And please, explain what you’re doing as you go along. I find a lack of transparency… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible, and I will explain everything as I go along. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity - essentially, how well you can see at different distances. Then I’ll examine your pupils and their reaction to light. Finally, I’ll use this instrument – the ophthalmoscope – to look inside your eyes and examine the retina. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Examining the retina… yes, that sounds… thorough. As long as it doesn’t involve any… discomfort. And please, refrain from shining any excessively bright lights directly into my eyes. I have a rather… important appearance to maintain. Proceed, Doctor, but with caution. And do explain what you are observing, as you mentioned. I expect a… comprehensive assessment, not merely a cursory glance.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. Alright, please cover your left eye with your hand, and read the smallest line you can see on this chart. Don't strain, just read what you can make out. Okay. With your right eye, you read to 20/30, and with your left eye to 20/25. That means you have some mild vision loss in both eyes, but it’s not significant. Now, I’m going to check your peripheral vision. I will ask you to look straight ahead and tell me when you see my finger in your peripheral vision.
PATIENT: 20/30, you say? Hmm. Not ideal, but… acceptable. I suppose. My vision has been… deteriorating, as I mentioned. 20/25, then. As for this… peripheral vision test. Proceed, Doctor. But do be quick about it. I have a rather important meeting scheduled for this afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be… distracted. Tell me when you wish me to acknowledge your finger.
DOCTOR: Okay, your peripheral vision appears normal. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to check your pupils. Your pupils are equal in size and react normally to light. No noticeable abnormalities there. Now, I'm going to use this instrument to look at the back of your eyes – the retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels. It won't be painful, but it might be a little uncomfortable if I get too close. It’s also a bit dark in here, looking in the light. Okay. I'm seeing some mild drusen – those are small deposits under the retina – in both eyes. This is fairly common as people age, and often doesn't cause any problems. But I also notice some slight blurring of the optic nerve margin, which is something we should monitor. Your macula, which is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision, looks okay, but there is some mild pigmentary change.
PATIENT: Drusen… and blurring of the optic nerve margin? Pigmentary change, you say? These terms… they aren’t particularly reassuring, Doctor. Are we discussing a… serious condition? As I mentioned, I have important obligations. I require clarity, not… medical jargon. Is this something that will impede my ability to… function? And will it require… invasive procedures? Please, Doctor, be frank. I prefer to be… prepared. And what, precisely, does “monitor” entail? Frequent examinations? Medication? I trust you have a… comprehensive plan to address this, whatever it may be.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, it's understandable to be concerned when you hear medical terms you're not familiar with. Let me explain everything as clearly as possible. The drusen are very common, as I mentioned, and in most cases, they don't cause any vision loss. We’ll want to monitor them to make sure they don't progress. The mild blurring of the optic nerve margin is a bit more concerning, and could be a sign of early glaucoma, or potentially other optic nerve issues. That’s why I want to do a few more tests. The pigmentary change in the macula is also something we’ll want to monitor. It could be a sign of early age-related macular degeneration, but it’s too early to say for sure. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few additional tests: visual field testing to assess your peripheral vision more accurately, and optical coherence tomography, or OCT, which is a non-invasive scan that provides detailed images of the layers of the retina. That will allow me to evaluate the optic nerve and macula in more detail. Right now, there’s no need for invasive procedures or medication. However, depending on the results of these tests, we may need to consider treatment options in the future. But let's not jump to conclusions. These are just precautionary measures to get a more accurate diagnosis. “Monitor” means we’ll schedule follow-up appointments, likely every six to twelve months, to repeat the tests and track any changes. We’ll also discuss any new symptoms you may experience. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Visual field testing… and this “OCT” scan. More tests, then. It seems my afternoon is… increasingly compromised. And these “treatment options” you mentioned? Are we discussing… injections? Surgery? Because I must confess, Doctor, I have a rather… aversion to invasive procedures. And the thought of injections directly into my eye… it’s rather unsettling. And what is the likelihood of… significant vision loss? Be frank, Doctor. I require a realistic assessment, not… platitudes. Will I be able to continue my professional obligations? Will I require… assistance? I trust you understand the importance of clarity in this matter. It’s not merely a matter of… convenience. It’s a matter of… livelihood. And what, precisely, is the cost of these… tests? I trust they are covered by… some form of insurance? Though, I must confess, my coverage is… limited.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your anxieties. Let me address your questions as clearly as possible. The visual field testing is a non-invasive scan that measures your peripheral vision. It’s like looking into a darkened room and indicating when you see lights appear. The OCT scan uses light waves to create detailed images of your retina – it's not painful or invasive. Regarding treatment options, it’s too early to say what might be necessary. If you are diagnosed with glaucoma, treatment options could include eye drops, laser therapy, or, in some cases, surgery. If it's age-related macular degeneration, treatment options could include injections or laser therapy. But again, we don’t know yet if those diagnoses are accurate. As for the likelihood of significant vision loss, it's difficult to say at this stage. The mild changes I observed could be stable and never progress, or they could worsen over time. That’s why these tests are so important – they will help us determine the severity of the condition and the risk of future vision loss. Regarding your ability to continue your professional obligations, that will depend on the diagnosis and the effectiveness of any treatment. In most cases, people with early-stage glaucoma or macular degeneration can continue to work and live active lives. Regarding the cost of the tests, the visual field test typically costs around $150 - $200, and the OCT scan is around $300 - $500. Unfortunately, I understand your insurance coverage is limited. I can provide you with a referral to a specialist who may have financial assistance programs available, or we can discuss options for self-pay. I can also try to help you find lower-cost testing facilities. Mr. Alcorta, it's important to remember that we are taking these precautionary steps to get a clear diagnosis and develop a treatment plan if necessary. I understand your concerns, and I will do everything I can to provide you with the best possible care. Does that address your concerns for now?
PATIENT: Financial assistance programs… lower-cost facilities… you speak of options, Doctor, but it all sounds rather… complicated. And frankly, inconvenient. I prefer… direct solutions. And you say “treatment plan” as though it’s a foregone conclusion. What is the likelihood of these tests revealing… a severe condition? Be frank, Doctor. I’ve always prided myself on my… resilience, but I confess, the prospect of significant vision loss is… unsettling. Will I require… assistance with daily tasks? Will I be able to continue my work? I require a realistic assessment, not… platitudes. And this specialist you mention… are they… competent? I trust they have a… reputable practice? I’ve had unfortunate experiences with… substandard medical care in the past. Before we proceed any further, I require assurance that these tests are absolutely necessary. Are there… alternative methods of diagnosis? Perhaps a… second opinion? I prefer to explore all options before committing to… invasive procedures. And what is the timeframe for these tests? I have important obligations, as you know. I cannot afford to… disrupt my schedule unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your anxieties and your desire for direct solutions. Let me address your concerns as thoroughly as possible. Regarding the likelihood of a severe condition, it's impossible to say at this stage. The changes I observed are mild, and many people with similar findings have stable vision and require no treatment. However, it’s important to rule out serious conditions like glaucoma or macular degeneration. That’s why these tests are necessary – they will provide us with a clearer picture and allow us to make an informed decision. Regarding alternative methods of diagnosis, there are no other reliable methods to assess the optic nerve and macula as accurately as these tests. A second opinion is always an option, and I would be happy to provide you with a referral to another specialist. However, I am confident in my assessment and believe these tests are the most appropriate next step. Regarding the timeframe, the visual field test typically takes about 30 minutes, and the OCT scan takes about 15-20 minutes. I can schedule both tests on the same day, if desired, and the results will be available within a few days. Regarding the specialist, I can refer you to Dr. Evelyn Reed at the Eye Care Center of Suburban. She is a highly respected ophthalmologist with extensive experience in diagnosing and treating glaucoma and macular degeneration. Her practice has a strong reputation for providing excellent care. I've worked with her previously and trust her expertise implicitly. Regarding your concerns about disrupting your schedule, I will do everything I can to accommodate your needs. I can schedule the tests at a time that is convenient for you, and I will ensure that the process is as efficient as possible. I understand the importance of minimizing disruption to your professional obligations. Mr. Alcorta, I believe these tests are necessary to rule out serious conditions and ensure the long-term health of your vision. I am confident in my assessment, and I will do everything I can to provide you with the best possible care. Would you like me to schedule the tests for you now?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Schedule the tests. But do ensure they are… efficient. I have important obligations, as you know. And I trust Dr. Reed is… competent. I will not tolerate… substandard medical care. And please, Doctor, provide me with a detailed explanation of the costs involved. I wish to avoid… unpleasant surprises. And a contact number for Dr. Reed’s office. I prefer to… verify her credentials myself. Proceed, Doctor. But do be swift. My time is… valuable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will schedule the tests for you right away. I'll do my best to accommodate your schedule and ensure the process is as efficient as possible. Okay, I have scheduled you for a visual field test and OCT scan at the Eye Care Center of Suburban next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Dr. Reed will be the ophthalmologist performing the tests. Here is the referral slip with the date, time, and address of the Eye Care Center. The cost of the visual field test is approximately $180, and the OCT scan is around $400. Your insurance may cover a portion of these costs, but you will be responsible for any remaining balance. Here is Dr. Reed’s office contact number: 555-123-4567. You can contact them directly to verify her credentials and insurance coverage. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That should suffice… for now. I trust the process will be… efficient. I appreciate your… assistance. Though, I confess, I find the prospect of these tests… unsettling. Should the tests reveal… an unfavorable diagnosis, I will… reconsider my options. And I trust you will… respect my decision. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good day to you as well, Mr. Alcorta.
