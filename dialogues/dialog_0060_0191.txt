DOCTOR: Alright, Tierney, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Nooruddin, thank you for seeing me. I… I requested to come in for an HIV test. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, just to be sure, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. An HIV test. Okay. And what prompted you to want to get tested now, specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to say, exactly. It hasn’t been anything specific, not a particular incident. Just… a feeling, I suppose. My husband and I, we’ve been together a very long time, but… one can never be too careful, can one? It’s better to know, even if it's not what you hope for. I feel it’s a responsible thing to do, for both of us.
DOCTOR: Responsible, yes, I suppose. Though after so many years of marriage… well, statistically, it’s unlikely. But we’ll do the test. Have you ever been tested before?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I don’t believe so, not that I recall. Perhaps when I was younger, but honestly, I can’t say for certain. It was before my husband and I were married, certainly. A very long time ago. Is that important? Would it have been in my records somewhere?
DOCTOR: It could be. We’ll check. It’s helpful to know for interpretation, naturally. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, Doctor. My knees bother me a bit, especially when the weather is cold, but I’ve never been officially diagnosed with anything. And I take a small tablet for my blood pressure, but it’s very low, and the doctor said it's nothing to worry about. He just likes to keep an eye on it. Is that something you need more detail on? I don't remember the name of the tablet, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication… alright. We’ll need to get that name. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… allergies… No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. Not that I can recall, anyway. My husband always says I'm lucky, he's allergic to everything! Dust, pollen, certain foods… it's a long list. But me, no. None that I know of. Would that include reactions to penicillin? Sometimes I forget… it was so long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And just to confirm, you're currently taking medication for blood pressure, but you don’t recall the name?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I apologize for not remembering, Doctor. My husband handles most of those things, you see. He’s very organized. I just take the little pill every morning. Perhaps he could call the clinic later with the name? Would that be alright? I don’t want to hold things up.
DOCTOR: That’s… less than ideal, but alright. We’ll need it eventually. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. I did grow up around it, my father smoked a pipe, but I always stayed well away from it. It's a dreadful thing, really. No, I don't smoke. And I very rarely drink alcohol, just a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol. And do you have any recent travel history?
PATIENT: Recent travel? No, not really. We used to travel a lot when we were younger, to visit family in Nigeria, but it’s been years since I’ve been back. We haven’t had the funds, you see, and it’s quite a long journey. No, I haven't been anywhere recently. Just here, in the village. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Just routine, Mrs. Shaub. Now, before we proceed with the test, I need to explain the procedure. We’ll take a small blood sample… It’s a standard finger prick, very quick. Do you have a history of fainting or feeling lightheaded when you have blood drawn?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I don’t like needles, I must admit. But I’ve never actually fainted. I do get a little… shaky sometimes, and I might close my eyes, but I’ve always managed. My husband usually holds my hand. No, I haven’t ever actually fainted. But please, be quick, if you would be so kind. And gentle. That would be wonderful.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s get this over with then. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Here we are. I do hope it won’t hurt too much. It’s just… I’ve always been a bit squeamish, you see. Is there anything I can do to distract myself? Perhaps if you tell me what you’re doing?
DOCTOR: Just a small prick. Don’t tense up. Alright. Now, we’ll put a bandage on this. It’ll stop bleeding shortly. I’ll send the sample to the lab. Results usually take about a week. We’ll call you with the findings.
PATIENT: Oh! That was… a little sharper than I expected. Thank you, Doctor. A week, you say? Very well. I’ll be waiting for the phone call. I do hope everything is alright. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Or avoiding? Should I be concerned about… anything?
DOCTOR: No, just carry on as usual. Avoid any unnecessary risks, naturally. And if you develop any flu-like symptoms in the next few weeks, let us know. Otherwise, there’s nothing further you need to do. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor Nooruddin. For everything. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the phone call, then. A week, you said? And if I develop any flu-like symptoms… I'll be sure to let you know. Thank you again. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Goodbye.
