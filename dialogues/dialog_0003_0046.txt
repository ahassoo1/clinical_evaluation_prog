DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I’ve been having some…pressure on my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s not painful, exactly, just…constant.
DOCTOR: Constant pressure, you say. Alright. And how long has this “constant pressure” been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started, I believe, around the end of May. So, roughly two months now. It’s been gradually getting…more noticeable, if that makes sense. Not suddenly worse, just…steadier.
DOCTOR: "Gradually getting more noticeable." I see. And can you describe the sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: It feels like…a fullness, even when I don’t need to go. Like my bladder isn’t emptying completely, perhaps? And then, sometimes, I feel like I have to go very urgently, even if I just went a little while ago. It’s a bit confusing, honestly. It doesn’t hurt, it’s just…uncomfortable and unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a sensation of fullness despite recent voiding, and episodes of urgency. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think…no, I don’t believe so. The color seems normal, and I haven't noticed any unusual odor. It looks…like it usually does, if that makes sense. I haven’t been paying particularly close attention, I suppose, until recently with this pressure.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and my back has been fine. It really is just this…bladder sensation. It hasn’t interfered with my work too much, but it’s starting to be a little distracting, and frankly, a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Distracting and worrying, alright. Now, Ms. Creagh, let’s go through some basic medical history. Do you have any significant past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing major. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have mild seasonal allergies, and I was diagnosed with high blood pressure last year, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Otherwise, no.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. And I’ve only been hospitalized once, when I was a teenager, for a bad case of pneumonia. It was quite a while ago, and I recovered fully. It hasn't given me any lasting trouble.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a teenager, resolved. Now, family history. Are there any instances of bladder problems, kidney disease, or similar conditions in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had some urinary tract infections when she was older, but nothing serious. My grandmother on my father's side had diabetes, but I don't believe it affected her kidneys. Otherwise, I don't recall any major kidney or bladder issues in the family. It’s…not something we talked about much, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Creagh, let's discuss your current medications. Could you please list everything you are taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily, for my blood pressure. And occasionally, when I have a headache, I’ll take Ibuprofen, maybe 200 milligrams. And I take a Vitamin D supplement, one thousand IU, during the winter months, as my levels are a little low. That’s it, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, Ibuprofen as needed, and Vitamin D. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No known allergies to medications, food, or anything else. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Creagh, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. We’ll start with a basic abdominal palpation, and then I’ll need a urine sample. Do you have a full bladder at the moment?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. And yes, I do. I made sure to drink a glass of water before coming in, knowing you might ask for a sample. I've been trying to hold it for a little bit, but it is becoming increasingly difficult, naturally.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just disrobe from the waist down, and lie on the examination table, we can proceed. I'll need you to let me know if you feel any discomfort during the palpation.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position at all. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. I’m palpating your lower abdomen now. Do you feel any tenderness or pain in this area?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. It doesn’t hurt, but it feels…a little full, I suppose. Like there’s pressure, which I’ve already mentioned. It’s not a sharp pain, just…a sensation of fullness, especially lower down, near my bladder. It’s a bit uncomfortable, but not acutely painful.
DOCTOR: I note a mild fullness upon palpation, consistent with your report. Now, if you could please provide a urine sample. There’s a collection cup in the restroom. I’ll excuse myself briefly.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'll be right back with the sample. Just let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. Thank you. I’ll send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. We’ll look for signs of infection, blood, or other abnormalities. While we wait for the results, I'll briefly review your EHR. Hmm…your blood pressure readings have been consistently well-controlled, as you stated. No recent unusual lab values. I note you had a routine checkup six months ago, and everything appeared normal at that time.
PATIENT: That's good to hear, Doctor. I'm glad my blood pressure is under control. I try to be diligent about taking my medication. And yes, I remember the checkup six months ago, Dr. Ramirez said everything looked fine then. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious this time either. I'm a little anxious, naturally, but I appreciate you taking the time to look into it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Creagh, preliminary urinalysis results are back. No evidence of infection. No blood present. However, there is a slightly elevated level of protein. This could be a number of things – dehydration, strenuous exercise, even stress. But it could also indicate early kidney damage or a problem with bladder function. I’d like to order a complete metabolic panel and a kidney function test, just to be thorough. Also, a bladder ultrasound to visualize your bladder and kidneys. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… elevated protein? That doesn’t sound good. A complete metabolic panel and a kidney function test…and an ultrasound? That sounds…more serious than I expected. No, I haven’t been exercising particularly strenuously, and I haven’t been more stressed than usual. What could be causing the elevated protein, Doctor? And…what are we looking for with the ultrasound specifically? I’m just trying to understand everything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Creagh, I understand your concern. Elevated protein in the urine, or proteinuria, can be indicative of several things. As I mentioned, it can be benign – temporary changes due to hydration status or even a recent illness. However, it can also signal early kidney disease, problems with the filtering units in your kidneys, or even issues with your bladder itself, though those are less likely. The kidney function test will give us a more accurate assessment of how well your kidneys are working. It measures creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. The ultrasound will allow us to visualize the structure of your kidneys and bladder. We'll look for any abnormalities in size, shape, or the presence of any blockages or masses. I want to rule out anything serious, and these tests are the most appropriate next step. We'll get the results back in a few days. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. That…makes sense. So, it’s not necessarily something terrible, but you want to be thorough and rule things out. Yes, that’s…reassuring, I suppose. When you say “blockages or masses,” that sounds…worrisome. Is that common? And…will these tests require any preparation on my end? Do I need to fast, or…anything like that? I just want to be prepared. And…how long will the ultrasound take? I have a work meeting on Friday that I need to reschedule if it takes a long time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Creagh, the possibility of blockages or masses is unlikely, but it’s my job to consider all possibilities. I assure you, we are proceeding with caution, not alarm. The ultrasound typically takes about 30-45 minutes. No special preparation is required; you can eat and drink normally beforehand. You do not need to fast. As for the work meeting, 30-45 minutes should be sufficient time to accommodate it, but it's always best to be prepared. Here is a requisition for the blood work. You can get that done at any lab that accepts your Medicare insurance. I will schedule the ultrasound for you. We’ll review the results when they come back. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Okay. Thirty to forty-five minutes…that should be manageable. And I can get the blood work done anytime? That’s good. No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to address all my concerns. It’s… a relief to have a plan in place, even if it involves more tests. I'll schedule the bloodwork right away. Thank you again, Doctor Yackey. I believe that concludes our visit.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow up with the lab results as soon as they are available. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, chills, severe pain, difficulty urinating – please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, Ms. Creagh.
