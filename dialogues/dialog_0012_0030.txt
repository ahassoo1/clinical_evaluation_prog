DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Yoshino, it's nice to meet you too. Well, this is a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It just doesn’t smell like me anymore, if that makes sense. I can’t really describe it, but it’s definitely different.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's not embarrassing at all to bring something like this up – changes in body odor can be a sign of something going on, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. “Not smelling like yourself” is a perfectly valid way to describe it. To help me figure out what might be going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe about a month ago? Definitely within the last six weeks, I’d say. It wasn’t sudden, more like a gradual thing. I didn't really pay attention at first, but my daughter, Selam, mentioned it when she visited. She just said I smelled… different. She’s very observant, that one.
DOCTOR: That’s good Selam noticed and felt comfortable enough to mention it to you. Gradual changes are sometimes harder to pinpoint, so a month ago is helpful. Has the odor remained consistent over the past six weeks, or has it gotten worse, better, or changed at all?
PATIENT: It’s… gotten a little stronger, I think. Not dramatically, but I find myself noticing it more throughout the day, even after showering. And it's not just sweat, you know? It's… there even when I haven’t been doing anything strenuous. It’s mostly under my arms, but sometimes I smell it… well, all over, a little bit. It’s hard to explain. It's not a bad smell, exactly, just… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it's been gradually increasing in strength, is present even with minimal activity, and you’re noticing it in multiple areas, not just under your arms. And you describe it as “not right” rather than an unpleasant odor. To get a better understanding, let’s talk a little bit about your general health. Have you experienced any other changes recently – like changes in your weight, appetite, energy levels, or skin?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, my weight has been pretty stable, thankfully. No change there. My appetite is okay, maybe a little less than usual, but nothing major. I’ve been feeling…tired, I guess. Just generally more sluggish than I used to be. It’s hard to say if that’s just getting older, though. I'm 49, you know. And my skin… I don't think so. Nothing unusual there.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight, slightly decreased appetite, and increased fatigue. Fatigue can certainly be caused by a lot of things, and it’s good you’re aware of it. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes, thyroid problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but I’ve been managing it with medication for years now. Other than that… nothing serious. No diabetes, no thyroid problems, and as far as I know, my kidneys are fine. I see Dr. Abernathy for my blood pressure, and he runs tests regularly. He hasn’t mentioned anything being wrong. I have Medicare, so they check a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Well-managed hypertension and regular check-ups with Dr. Abernathy are both positive. Let’s quickly go through a few other things. Are you currently taking any medications besides your blood pressure medication, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. Maybe once or twice a month, if I’ve been doing a lot of work. Nothing else. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly vegetables and fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen. That’s helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me that question, too, because she's a little worried, but no, nothing. I eat everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk briefly about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like certain types of cancer, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had heart disease, unfortunately. She passed away when she was 78. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had kidney problems later in life. Other than that, not really. My family is pretty healthy, actually. We all live a long time. Oh! And my aunt has diabetes, type 2, but she got it later in life too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, kidney problems, and type 2 diabetes are noted. Finally, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once a month, but that's it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a floor layer, you know. I need a clear head for that! It's hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. You're a floor layer – that is hard work! Alright, Kerriann, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good starting point. Based on what you’ve told me – the gradual change in body odor, the fatigue, and your family history – there are a few possibilities we should consider. One possibility is a change in your metabolism, which can sometimes happen as we age. However, it's also important to rule out other causes, like kidney issues or even certain infections. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and then I’m going to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. A physical exam and blood tests seem sensible. I just want to find out what’s causing this, you know? It’s a little unsettling, not feeling like myself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. Let's start with the physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Then we’ll get the blood work ordered. Your heart rate is regular, and I’m not hearing any murmurs or unusual sounds. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Skin looks good – no rashes, lesions, or unusual discoloration. I’m not noticing anything concerning on the surface. Now, let’s check your lymph nodes… Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Okay, everything seems normal so far. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests will help us check your kidney function, liver function, blood sugar levels, and thyroid function. Do you have a preference for where you’d like to get the blood work done?
PATIENT: No preference, really. Wherever is most convenient. I think there’s a lab down the street, near the pharmacy? If that’s easy, that would be good. I just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. I'll send the order to the lab down the street – that should be the most convenient. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. The results usually take a few days, so we should have them back by the end of next week. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms – like fever, weight loss, or changes in your urine – please give the office a call right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explaining everything so clearly. I'm a little anxious, of course, but I feel better knowing we're looking into it. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I understand your anxiety, and I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. We'll get these tests done, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. I'll make a note to follow up with you next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. You too. I will.
