DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’d rather not be here. But alright. I woke up yesterday morning, and I couldn't hear out of my left ear. And my face… well, it feels droopy on that side. It’s quite embarrassing, really. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Stephane. It's certainly frustrating to deal with something like that, especially when you're busy. Not being able to hear and experiencing facial drooping… that sounds concerning. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. To help me understand, could you tell me when exactly yesterday morning you noticed this?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't recall the exact time. It was sometime between 6 and 7 am, I suppose. I was getting ready for my… errands. It wasn't a gradual thing, it just was. One minute I could hear, the next, nothing. And then I looked in the mirror… honestly, it was dreadful. Do you need me to be more specific than that? Because frankly, I don’t have a lot of patience for detailed recollections.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, Stephane. A timeframe is helpful, and it’s perfectly understandable if you don’t have a precise memory. Sudden onset is important information. Just between 6 and 7 am, that's good. And you said “nothing” – is there any sound at all in that ear, or is it completely silent?
PATIENT: Completely silent. Like someone flipped a switch. It’s… unsettling. And, frankly, quite rude of my body to do this without warning. I have important appointments, you know. I don’t have time for… malfunctions. Do you have any idea what could cause something like this? I’d prefer a straightforward answer, if possible. No rambling.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… those symptoms can certainly be alarming. While I can’t give you a definitive answer without further examination, those symptoms together raise a concern for something called Bell’s palsy, or possibly a stroke. It's important to rule out the more serious possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, and then perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Would you mind if we start with your past medical history?
PATIENT: Bell’s palsy? Is that… serious? And a stroke? Honestly, you're frightening me now. I’m perfectly healthy, or I was before this morning. I don’t have time to be ill. My medical history? Hmm. I had… a bout of the flu, oh, maybe five years ago. Nothing major. And my husband… well, he had heart problems. Passed away three years ago. Other than that, I’m quite robust, thank you very much. No ongoing conditions. I don't take any medications. Are you sure you need to ask all these questions? It feels rather intrusive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’ve alarmed you, Stephane. It’s my job to consider all possibilities, and it’s better to be thorough. Bell’s palsy is often temporary, and many people recover fully, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. A stroke, as you mentioned, is a very serious condition, which is why we need to investigate. Thank you for sharing that information about the flu and your husband. I’m very sorry for your loss. Knowing you don't take any medications and don’t have ongoing conditions is helpful. Just a few more quick questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any dizziness, weakness in other parts of your body, or difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Weakness? No, just… this droopy face, which is quite enough, thank you. Difficulty speaking? No, I’m speaking perfectly clearly, aren't I? Though it's rather difficult to articulate myself when I'm being bombarded with alarming questions. Honestly, this is all very unnecessary. Are you going to do something, or are you just going to keep asking me questions? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Stephane. I apologize for the delay. We are going to do something. I’ve gathered enough information for a preliminary examination. I’d like to check your facial movements, listen to your ears, and take your blood pressure. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with quickly, please. I haven’t got all day. And please, try not to poke me too much. I have sensitive skin. Honestly, I don’t understand why a simple earache requires so much… fuss. Is this standard procedure? It feels rather… demeaning.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane, and I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. It’s important to be thorough, even if it seems like a lot for a simple ear issue, as we need to rule out other possibilities. First, I’m going to listen to your ears with this instrument. I don’t see any obvious obstructions or signs of infection. Now, let’s check those facial movements. Could you try to smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? As you can see, it’s… not ideal. It feels quite ridiculous, actually. Like a poorly drawn caricature. Honestly, is this going to take much longer? I’m starting to feel quite faint. And could you perhaps dim the light? It’s rather harsh.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Stephane. I see what you mean. And yes, I’ll dim the light. Now, could you try to close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? It feels… strained. Honestly, this is rather uncomfortable. I’m not usually subjected to such… scrutiny. Are you getting anywhere with this? I would like a diagnosis, if possible. And perhaps some reassurance that I haven’t suffered a debilitating stroke.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Stephane. I'm noting everything. And now, can you try to raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Honestly! It's barely budging! Are you sure you're a doctor? This is all very… unsettling. I feel like a laboratory specimen. Is this what you do to all your patients? I expect a certain level of professionalism, you know. And perhaps a little sympathy. This is quite distressing.
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Stephane. It's perfectly normal to feel upset and frustrated when experiencing something like this. I assure you, I am a doctor, and I’m doing my best to determine the cause of your symptoms. Based on what I’ve observed during the examination – the sudden onset of hearing loss, the asymmetry of your facial movements, the incomplete eyelid closure, and the difficulty raising your eyebrow – it is most likely Bell’s palsy. However, to be absolutely certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a blood test and potentially an MRI. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? A blood test? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. All this fuss over a… a slight inconvenience. Is this absolutely necessary? I have appointments to keep, you know. And I’m not particularly fond of needles. Bell’s palsy, you say? What does that even mean? Is it… serious? Will I be disfigured? Will I be able to hear again? Honestly, you’re not making me feel any better. Just tell me, straight and simple: what are my options? And how long is all this going to take? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane. Let me explain. Bell’s palsy is a condition where the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of your face becomes inflamed, causing weakness or paralysis. It's not caused by a stroke, and it's usually temporary. The blood test will help rule out other potential causes of facial paralysis, like Lyme disease or a viral infection. The MRI will give us a more detailed look at the nerve to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other underlying problems. Most people with Bell’s palsy do recover fully, often within a few weeks to a few months. In some cases, the recovery may not be complete, but we can work with physical therapy to help improve muscle strength and function. We can start with the blood test today. The MRI can be scheduled for tomorrow. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood test today. MRI tomorrow. But I expect prompt results. And I want a detailed explanation of everything. No medical jargon, please. Just… straight and simple. And if it turns out to be something serious, I expect the best possible care. I’m not one to suffer in silence. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. Is there anything else you need from me? Because I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible. I have a schedule to keep, you know. A very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand, Stephane. I will ensure you receive prompt results and a clear explanation, free of medical jargon. And you can rest assured, we will provide the best possible care, whatever the outcome. For now, let's get the blood test ordered. The nurse will be in shortly to draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take long. Is there anything else I can address for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. And please, try not to poke me too much. Honestly, this has been a most unpleasant experience. I’m starting to feel quite faint again. I think I need a chair. Is there a comfortable chair available? And perhaps a glass of water? This is all very… distressing. And frankly, I’m not accustomed to being treated this way. I expect a certain level of… consideration. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Stephane. I apologize again for the distress this is causing you. Please, have a seat. The nurse will be with you shortly. And I will remain available if you have any further questions or concerns. Let’s take things one step at a time. .
