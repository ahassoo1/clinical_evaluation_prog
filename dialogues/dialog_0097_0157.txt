DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, welcome. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t really understand why I’m here. My husband made the appointment. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good your husband is looking out for you, even if it feels a bit much sometimes. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is something we definitely want to understand and manage, even if you're not feeling any symptoms right now. It's often called a "silent killer" because that's how it can be. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first found out your blood pressure was high?
PATIENT: Found out? Well, the nurse took it today, and it was…high, she said. Before that? I haven’t been to a doctor in…a long time. My husband mentioned something about it being high at a check-up last year, maybe? He handles all that. I just…show up when told.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like this is a relatively new thing as far as you're aware, and your husband may have mentioned it briefly before. That's helpful to know. It's completely fine if you don't keep track of these things – that's what we're here for. Just to be thorough, and since it’s been a while since you've been seen, let’s go over some general health questions. Do you have any medical conditions that you know of, like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I work. I’m a civil engineering tech. Out in the field. It's a physical job. I don’t have time for medical conditions. And like I said, my husband would know if I did. He's very… thorough.
DOCTOR: I hear you – a physical job keeps you busy, that's for sure. It's good that you're active. And it's good you have someone who keeps track of things. Okay, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, grandparents, siblings – has high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My grandmother, on my mother's side, had… something. With her legs. Swelling, I think. My mother always said it was because she ate too much frybread. Other than that, no. Everyone else was fine. Worked hard, lived long lives. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know about your grandmother. Leg swelling can sometimes be related to circulation issues, which can be linked to blood pressure, so it’s good you remember that. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious? I'm a professional. I don’t have time for those things. I have projects to finish, deadlines to meet. I barely have time to sleep as it is. Honestly, I find these questions a little insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel insulting, Tasmia. That’s absolutely not my intention. I understand you’re busy and lead a very healthy lifestyle, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. I ask everyone these questions as part of a complete health assessment – it’s standard procedure, and it helps me get a full picture of your overall health, even if the answers are “no.” Okay, let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Sometimes. When I remember. My husband buys them. He's always telling me I need more…something. Iron, I think. And that’s it. Really. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel…off.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin occasionally and maybe some iron. That's good to know. And I understand not liking to take pills – many people feel that way. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat whatever I want. Frybread, mostly. And sometimes mutton stew. I grew up on Navajo land, Doctor. We don't have a lot of…delicate sensitivities. It was survive or starve.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Tasmia. Growing up in a different environment certainly shapes your experiences. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again just to get a baseline. Then I’ll take a look at your throat and listen to your lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a site visit tomorrow. Early. The sooner I’m out of here, the better. Honestly, all this feels like a waste of time. My husband is going to be annoyed I was gone so long.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a listen. Breathe normally for me… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is elevated – 148 over 92. That’s consistent with what the nurse measured. Pulse is 78, which is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax… any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just…hurry. I feel like I’m wasting a valuable work day. My time is worth money, you know. This feels…patronizing. Like you don’t believe me when I say I’m fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. I truly do. I’m not trying to be patronizing, and I do believe you when you say you feel fine. That's why I’m trying to be thorough. High blood pressure often doesn't have any symptoms, which is why it's called a "silent killer." We’re just trying to get a baseline and figure out if we need to take any steps to protect your health in the long run. I'm going to finish the exam quickly, if that's alright. Then we can discuss a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. And don’t tell me to change my diet or exercise more. I work for a living. It's physical labor. I don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Okay, your abdomen is soft and there’s no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Based on this quick exam, and what you’ve told me, it does sound like you’re generally healthy. However, your blood pressure is consistently elevated, which is something we need to address. It’s not about lecturing you on your lifestyle, it’s about preventing potential problems down the road, like heart attack, stroke, or kidney problems. I want to order some blood tests just to get a more detailed picture of your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and other important factors. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Seriously? Look, I told you, I work. I don't have time for a lot of lab visits. Can’t you just…give me something to take? A pill, or something? I need to get back to my job. My crew is waiting on me. I’m losing money sitting here. Is there a quick fix?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I want to be respectful of your time and work commitments. I wish there was a quick fix, but unfortunately, managing high blood pressure usually requires a combination of lifestyle adjustments and, often, medication. Giving you a pill without knowing the underlying cause of your high blood pressure wouldn't be responsible medical care. The blood tests will help us determine if there’s a specific reason for it, like kidney problems or hormone imbalances. It’s also important to rule out other potential issues. The blood draw will take about fifteen minutes, and the results usually come back within a few days. In the meantime, I can give you a referral to a cardiologist just to get a second opinion, if you’d like. Would that be something you’re open to?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Now you’re just trying to scare me. Look, I don't want a second opinion. I just want a pill. Something to make this go away. My husband is going to be furious if I come home empty-handed. He warned me about this. He knew I would end up needing something. Just…write me a prescription. For whatever you think will fix it. I don't care. Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Tasmia, I understand your husband is concerned, and you're feeling pressured. But I have a professional and ethical obligation to provide you with the best possible care, and that means making informed decisions together. Prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis could be harmful. I am concerned about your blood pressure, and I want to help you manage it effectively. However, I cannot simply write a prescription without knowing what we’re treating. Perhaps we can start with a trial of a low-dose medication and schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to recheck your blood pressure and see how you're responding?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…make it a low dose. I have a job to do. And don't bother explaining all the side effects. I don’t have time for that. Just write the prescription. And please, don’t call my husband. He’ll just…make things worse. I can barely tolerate him breathing down my neck as it is. Can I leave now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Tasmia. I am prescribing a low dose of Lisinopril, a common blood pressure medication. It's important to take it as directed, even if you're not feeling any different. I will also give you a handout with basic information about the medication, including potential side effects. I will not contact your husband. However, I strongly encourage you to come back for a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can monitor your blood pressure and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Here's the prescription for the pharmacy. And please, if you experience any unusual side effects, call my office immediately. You are free to leave now. I hope you have a safe drive, and please, take care of yourself. .
