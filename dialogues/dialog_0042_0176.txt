DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups. They just… won't stop. Been going on for two days now, which is… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for two days. That is a bit unusual. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started… let me think… Tuesday afternoon, I believe. I was setting up for the karaoke night at the bar – you know, making sure the mics were working and the sound was good. And then, hic… they just started. At first, I didn't think much of it, you know? Hiccups happen. But they haven't gone away since. They're… fairly regular, I guess. About every two or three minutes. hic There doesn’t seem to be anything that makes them worse or better, either. I've tried drinking water fast, holding my breath… nothing's worked.
DOCTOR: I see. So they began Tuesday afternoon while you were setting up for karaoke, and you've tried the usual remedies – drinking water quickly, holding your breath – without success. About every two to three minutes, you said. And nothing seems to trigger them or make them subside?
PATIENT: That’s right. Exactly. hic It’s just… annoying, mostly. But two days is a long time to hiccup, isn’t it? I’m starting to worry a little. And the customers… well, they don't appreciate it much during the quieter songs. hic It's a bar, so it's not exactly a quiet environment normally, but still.
DOCTOR: Yes, two days is a bit prolonged for hiccups. Annoying is a good way to put it, but we want to make sure there isn't something else going on. Let's get a little more detail. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no cough, no chest pain. hic My stomach feels… normal. I haven't had any heartburn or indigestion. I did feel a little tired yesterday, but that could just be from… well, running a bar, honestly. hic And I haven't eaten anything unusual, not that I can recall. Just the usual bar snacks, you know - chips, pretzels… maybe a little too much coffee, but I drink coffee every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, cough, or chest pain. Stomach feels normal, no heartburn. A little tired yesterday, but you attribute that to work. And no recent changes to your diet. That's helpful. Now, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I’m… generally okay, I suppose. I try to keep active, running around the bar keeps me moving. hic I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit about fifteen years ago. And I don't really have any serious health problems, as far as I know. hic I haven't been to the doctor in… a while. Probably a check-up about five years ago? Maybe more. I just avoid it when I can, to be honest. It's not my favorite thing. I'm divorced, if that matters, and… I don't have insurance. So, I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're generally active, you quit smoking fifteen years ago, and haven't seen a doctor in about five years. You don't have insurance. I appreciate you sharing that. Knowing your history helps. Let’s talk a bit about past medical problems. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. hic Never been diagnosed with anything, not ever. I've been lucky, I think. My mother had high blood pressure when she was older, but that’s the only thing I can think of. hic And my father… he was just a strong, healthy man. He lived to be eighty-five. I’ve always been pretty resilient, to be honest. I mean, running a bar is stressful! hic It's a lot of work. I do get a bit anxious sometimes, about the business, you know? But I manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of diagnosed medical conditions, your mother had high blood pressure, and your father was healthy. You do experience some anxiety related to the business. That's good information. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. hic Not a single surgery, not a single hospital stay. I’ve broken a bone or two as a kid, a wrist and an arm, but that was it. Nothing serious. Just… typical childhood stuff. hic I’m a pretty careful person, honestly. I don’t take a lot of risks. Running a bar is risky enough, you know? hic Dealing with people... that can be dangerous sometimes. But generally, I’m pretty healthy. This hiccup thing is really unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations aside from typical childhood injuries. So, no major medical history that we've discussed. Let's quickly go over any medications you’re taking, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements. And also, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not a single thing. hic I don’t take any medications at all. Vitamins, no. Supplements, no. I don’t believe in taking a lot of pills. hic I just try to eat healthy and get enough sleep when I can. And no allergies, not to anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, ever. hic I'm very careful about what I put in my body. Coffee, yes, but that doesn't count, right? hic It's a necessity.
DOCTOR: No medications, vitamins, or supplements. No allergies. Just coffee. Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and just do a general neurological assessment. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Please go ahead. hic I’m a bit embarrassed about the hiccups during the exam, but… what can you do? hic I'll try to be as still as possible. Let me know if you need me to do anything. hic I hope you can figure out what’s causing this. It’s really annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. No problem at all about the hiccups. We’ll work around them. Your heart sounds regular and there's no wheezing or crackling in your lungs. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination appears good. Everything seems normal on the physical exam. It’s… unusual, given the persistent hiccups. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Does that sound about right to you, typically?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. I think my blood pressure is usually around there. hic My mother always used to check it, and it was always in that range. hic 72 sounds normal too, I guess. I don't really pay attention to numbers, to be honest. hic I just know when I feel okay, and when I don't. And right now, I feel… tired. Mostly. And… hiccupy. hic If everything seems normal, what could be causing this? It’s been two days! Is it something serious? hic I really need to get back to the bar soon. Karaoke night is tonight.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the cause and whether it's serious. Given the normal physical exam, the prolonged nature of the hiccups is a bit concerning, but unlikely to be life-threatening. There are a number of possibilities, even with no other symptoms. Sometimes, hiccups can be caused by irritation of the phrenic nerve – that's the nerve that controls the diaphragm. That can happen with things like acid reflux, even if you don’t feel heartburn. Other causes can be dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, certain medications , or even stress, although that usually doesn't cause hiccups for this long. Because you haven't been to the doctor in a while, and to rule out anything more serious, I think it would be prudent to order some basic blood work. Just to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any underlying infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that sounds reasonable. hic If it will help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do it. hic I just… I’m worried about leaving the bar unattended for too long. hic I have a bartender, but he's not as reliable as I am. hic And karaoke night… it's the busiest night of the week. hic How long will it take? And will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, remember. hic I can probably afford it, but… it would be a strain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the bar and the cost. The blood work should be relatively quick – we can get it drawn right here in the clinic, and the results usually come back within a day or two. As for the cost, I’ll do my best to keep it as affordable as possible. We have a cash price for basic blood work that's around $150. I can also see if there are any assistance programs available in the area, although I can’t guarantee anything. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, I recommend staying well-hydrated. Sip on water throughout the day. And try to manage your stress as best as you can. If the hiccups continue for more than a few more days despite these measures, or if you develop any other symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: $150… okay, I can manage that. hic Thank you for checking for assistance programs, that's very kind of you. hic Hydrate and manage stress… easier said than done when you run a bar! hic But I'll try. And I will come back if anything changes. Shortness of breath, chest pain… hic I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out, Doctor. hic So, do we just do the blood work now? And then I can go back to dealing with karaoke singers? hic They can be a handful, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's get the blood work done now. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available, and I’ll give you a call to discuss them. And yes, you can get back to dealing with the karaoke singers. Hopefully, they'll be a little more forgiving than the hiccups! We just need a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count, please. It was nice meeting you, Ivette. And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Vodzak. It was nice meeting you too. hic I really hope this gets sorted out soon. hic Okay, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. The technician will take good care of you. I'll be here if you need anything. Take a deep breath, and we’ll get it done quickly.
