DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day. I come 'bout... well, lookin' at myself in the mirror these days, it ain't a pretty sight. Things is droopin' where they shouldn't, and saggin' everywhere. I want somethin' done 'bout it. Simple as that. Don't need to waste time explainin' every little detail, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I understand you'd like to discuss some changes you've noticed in your physical appearance. I assure you, we will respect your time. To help me understand what’s concerning you, could you be a bit more specific about where you’ve noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Specific? Everywhere, man! Look at my neck, it's all loose. And my belly... used to be flat, now it's hangin' over my belt. And these arms... flabby, just flabby. You a doctor, you see these things, don't you? I don't need a lecture on muscles and whatnot, just tell me if you can fix it. I want to look… presentable. Like I used to.
DOCTOR: I do see those areas, Mr. Trendler, and I appreciate you pointing them out. It sounds like you're concerned about some laxity in your skin and some changes in body contour. Before we discuss potential options, could you tell me if these changes have happened gradually over time, or were they more sudden?
PATIENT: Gradually. Very gradually. I ain't fall down and break somethin', if that's what you thinkin'. Just... years passin', I suppose. Ain't been doin' much since my wife pass… not much reason to, really. Used to be active, buildin' things, workin' hard. Now... not so much. But that ain't an excuse for lookin' like a melted candle, is it? Just tell me what can be done. I don't need a life story, just fix the problem.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’ve experienced some significant life changes, and it’s perfectly natural for our bodies to change alongside those experiences. There are several options we could consider, ranging from non-surgical to surgical approaches. Before we delve into those, let’s just quickly review your medical history to ensure we’re proceeding safely. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor gave me pills for it, been takin' 'em regular. And... arthritis in my knees, makes walkin' a bit of a bother sometimes. Other than that, I'm alright for a man my age. Worked hard all my life, never really sick. But I ain't wantin' no fancy tests or nothin', just tell me if these conditions will stop you from fixin' my… appearance. Don't got time for complications.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Trendler. That’s important information. Both high blood pressure and arthritis will factor into our discussion of potential treatments. We’ll need to ensure any procedure we consider is safe given your medical history. Now, regarding medications, can you tell me the name and dosage of the pill you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Look, you wantin' a list of every little pill I ever swallowed? I don't remember! It's a white one, small, I take one every mornin'. Doctor told me what it was, but my mind ain't what it used to be. It keeps the pressure down, that's all that matters. I go to the pharmacy, they give me the pills, I take 'em. You need to ask them, not me. Honestly, this is gettin' ridiculous. I just want to know if you can fix my neck and belly, not run a pharmacy inventory.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Mr. Trendler. My apologies. It’s not my intention to frustrate you. Knowing the name of the medication is helpful, but not essential at this stage. Let’s focus on your concerns. You mentioned laxity in your neck and abdomen. To help me understand the extent of these changes and determine the best course of action, would you be comfortable if I conducted a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Examination? You mean poke and prod at my saggin' skin? Look, I ain't shy, but I ain't exactly lookin' for a demonstration. If you can tell me what can be done just by lookin' at me, that'd be fine. I ain't payin' for you to measure my wrinkles, you know? I'm a practical man. Tell me straight: can you tighten this neck, flatten this belly, and how much it will cost? Skip the fancy tests and the pokin'. That’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to avoid a detailed examination, Mr. Trendler. While a thorough assessment is ideal, I can certainly offer some initial thoughts based on my observation. From what I see, you have some degree of skin laxity in both your neck and abdomen, which is common with age and weight fluctuations. Options for addressing this could include non-surgical treatments like skin tightening procedures or, for more significant improvement, surgical options like a neck lift or abdominoplasty – a tummy tuck. However, without a more detailed assessment, it’s difficult to determine the best approach for you, and to give you an accurate cost estimate. Would you be willing to allow me to at least briefly palpate the skin in these areas to assess its elasticity?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a simple man. I don’t need fancy words like “palpate.” If you think you can fix it, tell me what it will cost. Give me a ballpark figure for both the non-surgical and the… tummy tuck, as you call it. And tell me the risks involved. I want to know what I’m gettin’ myself into. No hidden fees, no surprises. Straight talk. That’s all I ask. And if it’s gonna cost me a fortune, I’ll just live with the sag, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I appreciate your directness. Let's discuss costs and risks. Non-surgical skin tightening procedures, such as radiofrequency or ultrasound treatments, typically range from $800 to $2,000 per session, and you may require multiple sessions for optimal results. The risks are generally mild – some temporary redness, swelling, or bruising. An abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, is a more involved procedure. The cost typically ranges from $6,000 to $10,000, depending on the extent of the repair. It involves surgical incisions, and carries risks such as infection, bleeding, scarring, and potential complications related to anesthesia. A neck lift would be in the $4,000 - $8,000 range, and shares similar risks. It’s important to understand these are estimates, and a precise quote would require a consultation with a qualified surgeon. Given your high blood pressure and arthritis, a thorough medical evaluation by your primary care physician would be necessary to ensure you are a suitable candidate for any surgical procedure. Would you be willing to obtain a medical clearance?
PATIENT: So, it’s gonna cost me thousands either way, and there’s a risk of… bleedin’ and scarin’? And I need to go back to the doctor just to get permission? Look, I ain’t got time for all this. I appreciate you tellin’ me straight, though. Seems like a lot of trouble for a little sag. Tell you what. Forget the surgery. Too much risk, too much hassle. Maybe one of those… radiofrequency things. Just the one area, though. My neck. That’s botherin’ me the most. What’s the chance it will actually do somethin’? Don't wanna waste my money on somethin’ that won’t work. And if it don’t work, I want my money back. Understand? .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like radiofrequency treatment for your neck is the most appealing option at this time. To manage expectations, the results of radiofrequency treatment are subtle to moderate. It can help to tighten skin and improve its texture, but it won't provide the dramatic results of surgery. Regarding your concerns about effectiveness, we do have a satisfaction guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results after a series of treatments, we can discuss a partial refund. To proceed, I will schedule you for a consultation with our aesthetician, who will assess your skin and determine the appropriate number of treatments. She will also explain the procedure in detail and answer any remaining questions you may have. Would that be acceptable?
