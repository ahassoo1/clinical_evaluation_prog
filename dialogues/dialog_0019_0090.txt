DOCTOR: Well hello there, Mackenzi. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Renzi. It’s very kind of you to meet me as well. Um, well, I'm here for… a clearance, I believe? For a surgery. It’s… cosmetic, I think. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy, and my memory isn’t what it used to be. But it's something I've been considering for a while now.
DOCTOR: Ah, a pre-operative clearance. Right, right. That’s perfectly alright about the fuzziness – things can be a bit overwhelming. Cosmetic surgery, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Cosmetic. It’s… well, it’s something personal. I don’t recall all the specifics, but my… my husband, before he passed, he thought it would be a good thing. And I’ve been wanting to… honor that, I suppose. Does that make sense? It's a little difficult to explain, I apologize.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mackenzi. Absolutely. Honoring a loved one is a wonderful reason. Don’t apologize at all. So, to get started… do you happen to know what type of surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a good question. I… I truly don’t. I remember talking with a surgeon, a lovely woman, but the details… they just slip away. I believe it had something to do with… my face? Perhaps my nose? It's terribly frustrating. I wish I could be more helpful. Is there a record somewhere, perhaps? From the surgeon's office?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mackenzi. It happens. Let me see if we have anything on file here at the clinic. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem we have any records from a surgeon's office. Perhaps they sent it directly to the surgical center?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… not ideal. I suppose I should have been more organized. Perhaps the surgical center would have it then. Do you… do you need any information from me right now? About my health, perhaps? I want to be as helpful as possible, even if I'm a bit… scattered.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with a general overview then. That's perfectly fine, we'll work with what you do remember. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I believe I was told, a few years ago, that my blood pressure was a little high, but I’ve been trying to watch my salt intake. And… I don’t think I have asthma. I get a little breathless sometimes when I’m doing a lot of gardening, but I just assumed it was from the exertion. Nothing that requires an inhaler or anything. Oh! And I had a rather unpleasant bout of the flu last winter, but I recovered fully. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Slightly elevated blood pressure is good to know. We’ll want to check that today. And gardening – alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… that’s another tricky one. I don't think I have any major food allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything that I recall. As for medications… I haven’t taken anything regularly in years, except for over-the-counter pain relievers when my arthritis flares up. And I’m not allergic to… bees, I don’t think. I've been stung a few times in the garden, and it just stings! I really am sorry for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright. We’re just gathering information. Alright, any past surgeries or hospitalizations you can recall?
PATIENT: Past surgeries… Hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I remember that vividly. And… oh! And when I broke my wrist a few years back, after a rather clumsy fall while pruning roses. It wasn't too serious, just a cast for a few weeks. Other than that… I don’t think so. I've been quite fortunate, all things considered. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: That’s good, thank you. Tonsils and a wrist fracture – noted. Now, a little bit about your family… do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That’s… a bit complicated. My mother had some heart problems towards the end of her life, I believe. And my grandfather on my father’s side… he had diabetes. I don’t recall much else, to be honest. My family wasn't very forthcoming with medical details, even when they were needed. It was just… not discussed. I wish I could provide more information. It feels like I’m failing this test already.
DOCTOR: Don't feel that way at all, Mackenzi. It’s very common for families to not discuss those things. We’ll work with what we have. Alright. And finally, just a quick overview… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, definitely not. I've never been a smoker. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And no, absolutely no recreational drugs. I’ve always preferred a quiet evening in the garden, to be honest. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Very satisfactory. Thank you, Mackenzi. Now, perhaps we should do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds… wonderful. Whatever you need. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute. Your lungs sound clear, but there's some mild wheezing on exhale. I'll need to take your blood pressure now. Blood pressure is a little high, as you mentioned. Now, let’s take a look at your throat, ears, and eyes. Open wide for me, please. Your throat looks clear, ears are normal. Eyes look good as well, no signs of cataracts or glaucoma. Alright, one more thing... I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No abnormalities detected.
PATIENT: Oh… is my blood pressure very high, Doctor? I do get a little anxious at the doctor sometimes, perhaps that’s contributing? And the wheezing… is that serious? I haven’t been feeling unwell, just a bit tired lately. I'm glad you're checking everything so thoroughly. It does put my mind at ease, even if it's a little unsettling to hear about these things.
DOCTOR: It’s slightly elevated, Mackenzi, but not drastically so. And you’re right, anxiety can certainly contribute to blood pressure fluctuations. We'll get a better reading after you've had a chance to relax for a few minutes. As for the mild wheezing, it's not necessarily serious, but it could indicate some mild asthma or bronchitis. It could also be a result of allergies. We may want to consider a chest X-ray just to rule anything out, if you’re comfortable with that. Would you be alright with a chest X-ray, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… I suppose… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I’ve never had one before. Is it… uncomfortable? And is there any radiation involved? I'm always a little worried about those things. I trust your judgment, of course, but it’s just… a little daunting.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. A chest X-ray is very quick and painless. You'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture. There is a very small amount of radiation involved, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits of ruling out any potential problems far outweigh the risks. We take every precaution to minimize exposure. If you’re still hesitant, we can certainly postpone it for now and see how you feel. But it would give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on with your lungs. What are you thinking?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you truly think it’s best, Doctor, then yes. Let's do the X-ray. I'd rather know one way or another, I suppose. I trust your expertise. But… could you explain the process to me one more time, just so I know what to expect? And… will I need to change clothes?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. Of course. The process is very straightforward. You'll stand in front of the X-ray machine, and a technician will position you so that the machine can take a picture of your chest. You'll need to take a deep breath and hold it still for a few seconds while the picture is taken. You won’t need to change clothes. Just remove any jewelry or metal objects from around your neck and chest area, as they can interfere with the image. The technician will be right there to guide you through the process and answer any questions you may have. It should only take a few minutes. After the X-ray, we’ll review the results together. If everything looks normal, we can focus on managing your blood pressure and addressing any potential anxiety. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does sound alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience with me. Alright. Let’s get it over with, then. Where do I need to go? And should I wait here afterwards, or will someone come and get me?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The X-ray technician, Sarah, is just down the hall in Room 3. I’ll let her know you’re on your way. After the X-ray, you can come straight back here, and we’ll review the images together. You can wait here, or if you prefer, you can wait in the waiting room, it’s up to you. Just let the receptionist know you're with me, and they'll let me know when you're ready. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I'll go find Sarah now.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask Sarah if you have any questions. I’ll be right here when you get back. .
PATIENT: .
