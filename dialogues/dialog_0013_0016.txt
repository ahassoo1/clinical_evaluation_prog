DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though, honestly, I’ve seen…better equipped offices. But never mind that. It’s about my patient, Mr. Henderson. He’s been on warfarin for a while now, a blood thinner, and he’s started bruising…a lot more easily than usual. It's concerning, frankly. He's a bit of a worrywart, so I wanted to get a professional opinion before he completely falls apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Mr. Henderson’s increased bruising while on warfarin is definitely something we should look into. Eight years in Family Medicine has taught me it’s always best to investigate changes in bleeding patterns with these medications. Just to confirm, is he currently taking anything else alongside the warfarin?
PATIENT: Alongside the warfarin? Hmm. Let me think… He does take something for his blood pressure, an ACE inhibitor, I believe. Lisinopril, that's it. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for his arthritis. Though I always warn him to be careful with that, obviously. He doesn't always listen, to be perfectly frank. Old men, you know? They think they know best.
DOCTOR: Right, Lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen. Okay, that’s helpful. The ibuprofen is a definite concern, even infrequent use can impact bleeding. And has he had any recent changes in his diet – any significant increases in leafy green vegetable consumption, for example?
PATIENT: Leafy greens? Really, Doctor? You think an old man is suddenly going to start gorging himself on spinach? Honestly. But…now that you mention it, he did mention something about his daughter sending him a lot of salads lately. She’s on one of those health kicks, you see. Trying to “improve” his diet. It’s probably nothing, but…yes, he’s been eating more salads. Though I doubt that’s the root of the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – dietary changes, even seemingly small ones, can affect INR levels. Let's take a look at his recent INR values. I see a recent check on July 15th was 2.1, which is within the therapeutic range, but… the one before that, June 20th, was 1.6, a bit low. Has he been consistent with getting his INR checked regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Well, he says he is. He’s supposed to come to my office every two weeks, but you know how patients are. They “forget,” they get busy, they claim the weather was bad… Honestly, keeping track of these things is half the battle. I’d hazard a guess he missed a check or two between June and July. He's not the most reliable fellow. Though, I do try to remind him.
DOCTOR: Right, inconsistent monitoring can definitely explain some fluctuation. Before we get too far down the line of possibilities, I want to get a better clinical picture. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well, I suppose it can’t hurt. Though, frankly, I’m a pathologist. I spend my days looking at tissues under a microscope, not poking and prodding patients. But…yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, alright? He bruises easily, as you know. I’d rather not add to the problem.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, gentle is the priority. Okay, I’m going to quickly check his blood pressure, listen to his heart and lungs, and then take a look at the areas where he’s been bruising. We'll just quickly assess for any other signs of bleeding or underlying issues. First, let’s start with his blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here. Though I'm telling you, his blood pressure is probably just fine. He's a bit of a hypochondriac, always worried about something. It's exhausting, to be honest. But go ahead, do what you need to do. Just try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: 138 over 82. Not bad at all. Now, I’m going to listen to his heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds clear. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can you show me the areas where you’ve noticed the most bruising?
PATIENT: Right, perfectly normal. As I said, he worries too much. Here. This is the worst of it. He got this just a couple of days ago, bumped into the coffee table. He claims it was a minor bump, but it looks like a plum. And there’s some smaller bruising on his arms, but that’s less concerning. It's just…more extensive than usual. And it happened so quickly. He usually doesn’t bruise this easily.
DOCTOR: Hmm, that is a fairly significant bruise for what sounds like a minor impact. And you're right, the extent of bruising elsewhere is also a bit concerning. Any pain with this palpation?
PATIENT: Just a little. It's not agonizing, but it's definitely tender. He complained a bit when I asked him about it yesterday, but he’s generally… stoic. Doesn’t like to admit when something’s bothering him. Honestly, I suspect he exaggerates the bumps to get more attention. But, yes, there’s some tenderness. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. There, see?
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with palpation. Given his warfarin use, the recent changes in diet, and the more extensive bruising with what appears to be minor trauma, I want to be cautious. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule out some possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel, including PT and INR, just to get a baseline and confirm his current levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test? Well, I suppose so. It’s just…more poking and prodding. Honestly, the man is probably stressed from all this attention. He likes things quiet and predictable. But, yes. Go ahead with the blood test. Just…try to make it quick, alright? And could you explain the results to me in…layman’s terms? I don’t need a lecture on hematology. Just tell me if it’s something to worry about.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No lecture, I promise. A CBC will give us a look at his red and white blood cell counts, and the coagulation panel will tell us how quickly his blood is clotting. The lab should have the results back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend he avoid any activities that could lead to injury, and definitely limit his ibuprofen use. And please encourage him to be honest about his diet – even small changes can be helpful. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… keep me informed. And try not to overwhelm him with too much information when you get the results. He gets anxious easily. Really, easily. And please, remind him that ibuprofen is a bad idea. He seems to forget that every five minutes. That's all, really. Just keep me in the loop. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will. I’ll be sure to keep you informed and explain everything in a clear and concise way. And I will reinforce the importance of avoiding ibuprofen. We’ll take things one step at a time. Thank you for bringing him in today. You've been very helpful. .
