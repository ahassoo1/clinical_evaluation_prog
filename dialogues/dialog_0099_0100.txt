DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. It's... a test, isn't it? Something about making sure... things are alright. Medicare sent me, I think. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something about drugs, maybe? I don’t really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Right. A preventative check-up, prompted by Medicare. That's perfectly alright. It is often a bit confusing with all the reminders and programs. So, even though it's a general check-up, is there anything specific you’ve been experiencing that you'd like me to take a look at?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. Not really, no. I feel… okay, I guess. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I work out in the sun a lot, you know, with the paving equipment. Maybe that. Honestly, I can’t recall anything troubling me enough to come see a doctor. It’s just… this test. Is it going to take long?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, "okay" is good to hear, but even if you feel generally well, it's still important to go through a standard assessment. Fatigue can have a lot of causes, and your work does involve sun exposure, which is relevant. It will take a bit of time—we'll need to check your vitals, do a brief physical exam, and likely draw some blood for lab work. Just routine things, Ms. Hughston. Before we start, let’s just go over a bit of your medical history. I see here you’re 51 years old. Any significant past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. History… That's a tough one. I… lost my husband a few years back, and that was hard. Health-wise… I had my tonsils out when I was little, I think. And a broken arm once, falling off a… a bicycle, maybe? I don’t really remember much beyond that. Nothing major, I don’t think. He handled all the doctor stuff when we were together. I'm sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Hughston. It’s common for patients to not recall everything precisely. Let’s try this. Any surgeries other than your tonsils?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… No, I don't believe so. Nothing that I remember, anyway. Maybe something small? A mole removed once, perhaps? It was years ago, and I really don’t pay attention to those things. My husband always said I was terrible with remembering dates and medical stuff. He’s… he’s gone now, you see. So it’s all a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we can certainly piece things together. How about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, my sister, Elise, lives in France. We don't see each other much anymore. She’s… healthy, I think. We talk on the phone sometimes. My parents are both gone, sadly. They… well, they had… heart problems, I think? Both of them. It was a long time ago. And that's about it, really. I don’t have any children. I kept pretty busy with work. Does that help? I feel like I’m just rambling now.
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Hughston. It's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. I take a… a little pill for my blood pressure, I think? The doctor prescribed it a while back. A small, white one. And sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take… ibuprofen, I guess? The kind you get at the store. And… oh! Sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement, because of the sun. Is that everything? I really struggle to remember these things. It's awful, I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed, and vitamin D. And how about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me see. I think I'm allergic to penicillin, but I haven’t had it in years, so I'm not entirely sure. I remember getting a rash once, a long time ago. Other than that… No, I don't think so. I like cats, and I'm fine with them, so it’s probably not a cat allergy. I feel like I'm failing this test, Doctor. I'm so sorry.
DOCTOR: You are not failing anything, Ms. Hughston. These are just routine questions to get a complete picture of your health. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember everything precisely. Now, let's move on to some more immediate concerns. You mentioned working with paving equipment in the sun. Do you use any sun protection—hats, sunscreen, protective clothing—when you're working outside?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I try to. I wear a hat, a big floppy one, usually. And I put on sunscreen, sometimes. Not every time, I confess. It gets so hot, and it’s sticky. And I wear long sleeves when I can, but it gets too warm. Honestly, I should probably be better about it, I know. It’s just… it’s a lot of work, and you forget things. And the sun is so strong. It’s a bit of a battle, really. Is that a bad thing? Should I be wearing more protection?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're taking some precautions. Prolonged sun exposure is a significant risk factor for skin cancer, so minimizing it is important. Let's do a quick examination of your skin, just to get a baseline. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs as well. If you don’t mind, could you please sit up and lean forward slightly?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that's fine. Anything to help, right? It's just… I don't like doctors very much. It always feels like something is wrong, even when nothing is. But I'm trying to be good, Doctor. You just let me know what you need me to do. And try not to be too rough, please? My knees are a bit achy today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I'm just listening to your heart and lungs now. Breathing seems a little shallow, but within normal limits. I’m now going to quickly examine your skin for any unusual moles or lesions. There’s some sun damage present – expected, given your work. I see a few small, benign moles, nothing immediately concerning. Do you notice any changes in your moles – size, shape, color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I don’t really pay attention to my moles. No, I don’t think so. They all look pretty much the same to me, I guess. Maybe some are a little darker than others? It’s hard to tell. Is something wrong? You're looking at my arm very intently. It's just a bit of a sunburn, isn't it? I was out in the sun all last week. It probably just needs some aloe vera. Is that what you’re thinking?
DOCTOR: It appears to be a combination of sun damage and some mild dryness, Ms. Hughston. Nothing acutely alarming, but it’s something we need to address proactively. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/88. That’s why you’re on medication, I presume?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. The doctor told me my blood pressure was high a while back. I try to take the pill every day, but sometimes I forget. Is it bad? Is it really high? My husband always took care of all this. He knew what to do. I’m just terrible with remembering things, Doctor. I'm so sorry.
DOCTOR: It's slightly elevated, Ms. Hughston. It's important to manage your blood pressure to prevent more serious complications. We can adjust your medication dosage if needed, and I’ll review some lifestyle modifications that can help—diet, exercise, stress management. To get a more comprehensive picture of your health, I’d like to order some blood work. It will check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, liver function, and blood sugar. Also, given your history and sun exposure, I recommend a skin biopsy of that slightly irregular mole on your left arm – just as a precaution. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A biopsy? Is that… is that serious? More blood work, too? I really don’t like needles, Doctor. And I don't understand all this… cholesterol and liver stuff. Is everything alright? Is something terribly wrong? I’m starting to get really worried now. I think… I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, please sit down. It’s understandable that you’re worried, and I apologize if I’m causing you any anxiety. A biopsy is a routine procedure – we take a small sample of skin to examine it under a microscope. It's the best way to determine if that mole is benign or requires further treatment. It's a precautionary measure, Ms. Hughston, not an indication that anything is seriously wrong. The blood work will simply provide a more detailed assessment of your overall health. We can discuss the results together and create a plan tailored to your needs. If you’re uncomfortable with any of these tests, we can certainly discuss alternatives, but I strongly recommend proceeding with them to ensure your well-being. Would you like me to explain the procedures in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, please. Explain it to me again. Slowly. I just… I get so flustered. And the needles… and the biopsy… It all sounds so scary. Is it going to hurt? Will it leave a big scar? I really, really don't like hospitals or doctors. It just reminds me of… of my husband. He always knew what to do, and I just followed his lead. I feel so lost without him.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, it’s perfectly alright to feel anxious, and it’s understandable that this brings back difficult memories. I apologize for any distress this is causing you. Let’s start with the biopsy. It’s a very simple procedure. I’ll numb the area with a local anesthetic – a small injection that will sting briefly, like a mosquito bite. Then, I’ll use a small instrument to remove a tiny sample of skin – about the size of a pinhead. It’s a quick procedure, usually taking less than five minutes. You might feel a slight pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. We’ll apply a bandage afterward, and you’ll receive instructions on how to care for the area. It will leave a small scar, but it will usually be faint and can be minimized with proper care. As for the blood work, it involves drawing a small amount of blood from your arm. A phlebotomist – a trained professional – will perform the procedure. It’s quick and relatively painless, although you might feel a brief pinch. I understand you're uncomfortable with hospitals and doctors, and I'll do everything I can to make this experience as comfortable as possible. We’ll take things at your pace, and I’ll explain each step before we proceed. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, please let me know, and we can take a break or reschedule the appointment. Would you like me to schedule the blood work and biopsy now, or would you prefer to think about it first?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you promise it won’t hurt too much, and you promise to explain everything… then, yes. Let’s just get it over with. But please, go slowly. And explain everything. Every single step. And if I start to feel… faint, or something, you’ll tell me, right? You won’t just leave me alone? I just… I don’t want to be alone. It’s silly, I know, but… It just reminds me of… everything.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Hughston. I will explain every step, and I will be with you the entire time. We will go at your pace, and I will stop immediately if you feel uncomfortable. If you feel faint or dizzy, please tell me right away, and we will stop and take a break. You won’t be alone. First, let’s schedule the blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. Then, we’ll proceed with the skin biopsy. Before we begin, I’ll explain the procedure in detail again, and I’ll answer any questions you may have. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… alright. Let’s just get it over with, please. The blood work first, then… then the biopsy. But slowly. And please, explain everything. Every single step. I'm really not good with needles. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's head to the lab. I'll walk you through the process and be there with you every step of the way. The phlebotomist is very skilled and gentle. Before they draw your blood, I'll explain everything to you again, and I’ll make sure you're comfortable. The first step is to fill out a brief form with your insurance information. Then, the phlebotomist will ask you a few questions to ensure your safety. They’ll clean the area on your arm with an antiseptic wipe, and then they'll tie a tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more visible. Then, they’ll insert a small needle into your vein to draw a few vials of blood. It might feel like a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. Once they’ve collected the blood, they’ll remove the needle and apply a bandage. It’s a quick procedure, usually taking less than five minutes. Do you have any questions before we head in?
PATIENT: Will it… will it bruise a lot? I bruise so easily. And… will it hurt afterwards? I have to go back to work, you know. I can’t afford to take too much time off. And… what if I faint? What if I… scream? I really don’t like needles, Doctor. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, it’s alright to feel anxious. Let's address your concerns one by one. Bruising is possible, but it usually isn't significant. We'll apply pressure to the area after the blood draw to minimize bruising. If you do bruise, it will usually resolve within a few days. Pain is minimal. You might feel a slight pinch when the needle is inserted, but it shouldn't be painful. If you feel any discomfort, please let the phlebotomist know immediately. If you feel faint or dizzy, please tell me or the phlebotomist right away. We can have you lie down and take a break. Screaming is perfectly fine, Ms. Hughston. There's no shame in expressing your discomfort. We're here to support you, and we want to make this experience as comfortable as possible. I understand you need to return to work, and we'll do everything we can to minimize your downtime. Take a deep breath, Ms. Hughston. You're doing great. I'll be right there with you every step of the way. Are you ready to head in?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. But you promise you'll be right there? And you promise you'll explain everything to the… the needle person? I really don't like surprises. And… if I faint, you won't laugh, will you? It's silly, I know, but… I'm just really scared.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Ms. Hughston. I will be right there with you, every step of the way. I will explain everything to the phlebotomist, and I will make sure you're comfortable and informed throughout the entire procedure. And I certainly won’t laugh if you faint. That would be very unprofessional. We're a team, Ms. Hughston. We'll get through this together. Let’s take a deep breath and head in. I'll introduce you to the phlebotomist, and we'll get started. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright… let’s just get it over with. But slowly, please. And… be gentle. I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Maria. This is Ms. Hughston. She’s a little nervous about the blood draw. Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I understand. It's perfectly normal to be nervous. We'll take things slowly and make sure you're comfortable. Maria is very skilled and gentle. She'll explain everything to you before we begin. “First, I’m going to ask you a few questions to confirm your identity and ensure your safety. Then, I’ll clean the area on your arm with an antiseptic wipe. After that, I’ll tie a tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more visible. Then, I’ll insert a small needle into your vein to draw a few vials of blood. You might feel a slight pinch when the needle is inserted, but it shouldn't be painful. Once I’ve collected the blood, I’ll remove the needle and apply a bandage. It’s a quick procedure, usually taking less than five minutes. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Will it hurt a lot? And… will it take a long time? I have to get back to work, you know. I can't afford to be late. And… what if I scream? Will everyone stare? I really don't like needles. Not at all.
DOCTOR: “It shouldn’t hurt a lot, Ms. Hughston. It’s usually just a quick pinch, like a mosquito bite. Some people feel a little discomfort, but it’s very brief. I'll be as gentle as possible. It won’t take long at all – usually just a few minutes. We’ll get you in and out quickly so you can get back to work. And it’s perfectly okay to scream if you need to. No one will stare. We’re used to it! It’s perfectly normal to be nervous, and we understand. We’re here to support you. Do you want me to show you the needle?
PATIENT: No! No, I don't want to see it! Please, just... just get it over with. Quickly, please. And gently. I really, really don't like needles. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. No problem at all. We'll get this over with quickly. Just a little cold, Ms. Hughston. This will help me find your vein. Just a little pinch... You’re doing great, Ms. Hughston. Just take a deep breath. It will be over in just a few minutes.
PATIENT: Ouch! That… that hurts! Please… please hurry. And… be gentle. It… it really hurts.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Ms. Hughston. Just a few more seconds. You’re doing great. Just focus on your breathing, Ms. Hughston. You’re doing wonderfully. All done! Here you go. Just keep this on for a few minutes. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: It… it stings. And… I feel a little dizzy. I think… I need to sit down for a few minutes. Is it over? Really over?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s over now, Ms. Hughston. Really over. You did wonderfully. Here, drink this. It will help you feel better. Your blood pressure is a little low, but it's within a normal range. Just rest for a few minutes and you’ll feel much better. Thank you, Maria. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: A little… a little shaky, but… better. It’s just… I really don’t like needles. I think… I need to go home. And… maybe take a nap. Is there anything else I need to do? Is it… is it all over now?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's all over now, Ms. Hughston. You don’t need to do anything else. Just go home and rest. Here’s a discharge instruction sheet with some information about what to expect after a blood draw. If you experience any excessive bleeding, swelling, or signs of infection, please contact our office. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your blood work results. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Hughston. You were very brave. Get some rest, and feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you… thank you both. I just… I need a nap. .
