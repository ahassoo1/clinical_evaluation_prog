DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Hainley, is it?
PATIENT: Yep, that's me. Courtnye Hainley. Look, I appreciate you seeing me, but I really don't have a lot of time today. It's about the bruising, yeah? It's just… been happening more lately.
DOCTOR: Bruising… yes, I see a note here. “Increased bruising.” Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Okay. Well, I'm on… that blood thinner stuff, right? Warfarin, I think it is? And usually, a little bump, a little scrape, okay, a bruise happens. But now? I just look in the mirror and bam, another one. It's like a tiny little thing'll give me a bruise the size of my hand. It's mostly on my arms and legs, but I swear I got one on my hip yesterday from… I don't even remember doing anything. It's worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, yes. And you say this is a recent increase?
PATIENT: Recent as in… the last month or so? It’s hard to say exactly. It wasn’t this bad before, definitely. Like, I used to get a bruise if I banged my shin, you know? Normal stuff. Now it's just… appearing. I haven't changed anything, I haven’t started any new pills or anything. And I try to be careful. Really I do.
DOCTOR: Right. And how closely do you monitor your INR?
PATIENT: My… what now? The… number thing? Look, the nurse calls me, tells me what to take. I write it down, I take the pills when she says to. I don’t… do the number thing myself. I just… follow instructions. Is that bad? I’m not good with… numbers and medical stuff, I’m just saying.
DOCTOR: It's... less than ideal. It's important to understand your medication and how it's working. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to assess the bruising. Then we’ll need to get some blood work done to check your INR and rule out anything else. If you’ll just let me examine your arms and legs…
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just… try to be quick, okay? I got a thing I gotta get to later. And… please don't poke too hard. I'm already tender. There. Arms are good, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see several ecchymoses in various stages of healing. Some are recent, some appear older. Size ranges from approximately 2-5 centimeters. No signs of acute trauma currently. Similar findings on the legs. Ecchymoses present, varying sizes, no acute signs of injury. Do you experience any pain with these bruises?
PATIENT: Not a lot of pain, no. It's more… sore, kinda? Like a really bad ache. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. And sometimes itchy, if they're healing. But no, not like, “ow!” pain. It’s just… annoying, and worrying, you know? Like I said, I'm careful. Is this gonna take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay. Soreness and itching are consistent with bruising. Given your history of Warfarin use and the recent increase in bruising without a clear cause, we need to investigate further. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a repeat INR. We’ll also check your coagulation studies. It's important to rule out any underlying bleeding disorders or other causes for this.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds… complicated. So, blood work, huh? Fine. Where do I go to get that done? And how long will it take? I really need to know, because, like I said, I got stuff. Hopefully it doesn’t take all day.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 3B. They should be able to draw the blood relatively quickly – it shouldn’t take more than an hour, including the wait time. Once the results are back, we’ll review them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I advise avoiding any activities that could lead to injury. Do not change your Warfarin dosage without consulting with me or the nurse. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes! Clear. No changing the pills. Got it. Room 3B, right. Okay. And… will someone call me when it’s done? I don’t wanna sit around all day waiting. Seriously, that would be great. I gotta go now, so… thanks. I hope everything's okay.
DOCTOR: They will call you with the results. We'll discuss them as soon as they're available. And please, try not to worry unduly. We're simply being thorough. Have a good day, Ms. Hainley.
