DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 60 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, sixty years old, that is correct. I am here because of my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of liquid comes out, you see? It has been happening for maybe… three days now? It is not painful, but it is… worrying me.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say. Three days, and no pain. Alright. To clarify, Mr. Radillo, is this discharge clear, or is there any color to it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Color… let me think. It is not… bright red. More… yellowish, I think. A very pale yellow. Like… old tea, maybe? Is that a good description, Doctor? I am not good with colors. But it is not clear, definitely not clear.
DOCTOR: Pale yellow, like old tea. I appreciate your attempt to describe it. And it's been consistent for three days now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Consistent. Every day, I notice a little bit on my pillow. And when I clean my ear with a cloth, the cloth is… yellowish. It does not stop on its own, you see? I try to be very gentle when I clean it, but… it keeps happening. It is only from the left ear, by the way. The right ear is perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just the left ear. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms associated with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. No, not really. No pain, as I said. No… ringing in my ear. No trouble hearing. My head feels normal. No fever, I think. I have not taken my temperature, but I feel… alright, otherwise. Just the liquid coming from my ear. Is that… bad, Doctor? I am a teacher, you see. I need to be able to hear my students.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo. It’s good you haven’t experienced any pain or hearing loss. However, any discharge from the ear warrants investigation. Now, have you had any ear infections previously?
PATIENT: Ear infections… that is a good question. I think… when I was a young boy, maybe? In Somalia. But it was a long time ago. I do not remember much. The doctor… he gave me some drops, I think. It went away. But I have not had any trouble with my ears since then, until now. It was many, many years ago. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know. Prior infections can sometimes be related. Now, I’d like to take a look at your ear, if you don’t mind. Please sit forward slightly. I’m going to gently pull on your earlobe to get a better view. Hmm. Yes, I see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum appears slightly… dull. There’s also a little bit of redness. Your right ear looks perfectly normal, as you mentioned.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I sat forward, as you asked. The ear feels… normal. It does not hurt when you look inside. So… what does that mean? Is it serious? Dull, you said? And redness? I am a bit worried now, I must admit. What will you do, Doctor? Will I need… medicine?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Radillo, based on what I'm seeing, it appears you likely have otitis externa, more commonly known as swimmer's ear, though one doesn't necessarily need to swim to get it. It's an inflammation of the outer ear canal, often caused by bacteria or fungi. The redness and fluid are consistent with that. The “dull” appearance of the eardrum is due to the fluid behind it. Now, it's not immediately life-threatening, but it does need treatment to prevent it from worsening and potentially affecting your hearing. I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. I’ll also recommend keeping your ear dry and avoiding putting anything in your ear – no cotton swabs, no fingers, nothing.
PATIENT: Antibiotic drops… alright. That sounds… good. To make it go away. No cotton swabs, you say? I sometimes use them to clean my ears, I must admit. But I will stop, if you think it is best. So… just the drops? And keep it dry? For how long, Doctor? And… will it be painful to put the drops in? I worry about discomfort, you see. And… is it contagious? Will I pass it to my students if they get close to my ear?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Just the drops. And avoiding anything in the ear canal. You’re right to stop the cotton swabs, they often exacerbate the problem. As for the duration, use the drops twice a day for seven days, even if it seems to be improving before then. The drops may feel slightly cool or tingly when you put them in, but they shouldn’t be painful. If you experience any significant discomfort, redness, or swelling outside of the ear, contact me immediately. And no, it is not typically contagious. It’s not caused by a virus, so you don’t need to worry about spreading it to your students. However, it’s always a good idea to practice good hygiene. I'm sending the prescription to your pharmacy now. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. No, none at all. That is good. Seven days… twice a day. I will remember that. Not painful, you said? Just cool or tingly. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I was very worried, but I feel… much better now. I will pick up the drops from the pharmacy. Is there anything else I need to do? Or know? Before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. The main things are to follow the instructions carefully – twice a day for seven days, keep the ear dry, and avoid inserting anything into the ear canal. If your symptoms don’t improve after a few days, or if they worsen at any point, please schedule a follow-up appointment. I’ll also document that you're a teacher, so if you need a note for work, the receptionist can provide one. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You answered all my questions. Thank you again for your time and kindness. I will pick up the drops and follow your instructions carefully. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Radillo. Get well soon. Goodbye.
