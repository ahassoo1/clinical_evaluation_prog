DOCTOR: Hello Angelle, welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, frankly, I don't have all day. I’m Angelle SHTEYNBERG. I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens easily. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I read somewhere that things get harder as you get older, and I’d like to avoid…complications. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear, Angelle. You're hoping to conceive and want to discuss optimizing your chances and avoiding potential difficulties, given your age. That's a very sensible approach. Okay. So, just to start, have you been trying for a while now, or is this more of a pre-planning conversation?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not precisely. I just…figured I should get a check-up before I start. Preventative, you see? I’m not one for wasting time. I’m 51, not 21. I expect things to…work, and I'd like to know if there’s anything wrong if they don’t. And quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right, preventative care – excellent. And you want to identify any potential roadblocks before beginning to try. I understand completely. Okay. Let's start with a bit of your medical history then. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? That’s rather vague, isn’t it? Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A very unpleasant experience, I assure you. And… a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back. But nothing serious. Divorced husband, does that count? Honestly, I’m a perfectly healthy woman. I eat reasonably, I walk sometimes… what exactly are you fishing for?
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing like that! Just trying to get a complete picture. Tonsils out is good to know, thank you. And the flu…okay. Let's move on then. Any major medical conditions currently?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. None whatsoever. I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because the sun isn’t very strong in August, but that’s it. I'm on Medicare, if that’s relevant. I’m not frail, if that’s what you're thinking. I can still manage my bicycle perfectly well, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medical conditions, vitamin D supplement, and on Medicare. Good to know. And you're active – that's wonderful. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, besides the vitamin D?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary. A bit of common sense and a healthy lifestyle are far more effective, in my opinion. I occasionally take something for a headache, but that’s it. And those are… infrequent. Really. I pride myself on my good health. Do you have a list of questions, or are we just going to chat all day?
DOCTOR: No, we're getting there, Angelle. Just trying to be thorough. No regular medications besides the occasional headache remedy. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really. No. I eat everything. I travel extensively, you know. I’ve had food all over the world. And I’ve never had a reaction. Honestly, I think people exaggerate allergies. It’s probably just… fussiness. But no, I have no allergies. Next?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family. A long and complicated story. My mother had… something with her heart, I believe. She wasn't very forthcoming about these things. My father… well, he smoked. A lot. And my aunt… I think she had high blood pressure. But frankly, I don’t pay much attention to family history. People live and die. What’s the point of worrying about it? It won't change anything. Is this really necessary? I'm perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart issues in your mother, smoking in your father, and possible high blood pressure in an aunt. We’ll make a note of that. It’s helpful to have even vague information. Alright. Just a few more questions, then perhaps we can move on to a physical exam. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. Yes. Once. A very long time ago. It… didn’t last. And I have no intention of discussing the details. It was a… difficult time. And frankly, irrelevant. I’m 51, not 21. I want to have a baby now, not relive ancient history. Can we please move on?
DOCTOR: Okay, one previous pregnancy. I understand you don’t want to discuss details, and that’s perfectly fine. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam then, if you’re comfortable. We'll just check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And perhaps a quick abdominal exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. But don’t expect anything exciting. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. Just… be quick about it. And don't poke too hard. My bicycle awaits.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just a routine check. Please have a seat on the table. Okay, blood pressure is 135/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Everything feels…normal. But, just to be thorough, I would like to check your weight and height, if that’s alright.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this poking and prodding. Very unnecessary. Fine. Weight and height. Get it over with. I already told you, I'm perfectly healthy. But hurry up. My bicycle is calling my name. And I’d like a straight answer, Doctor. Am I going to have trouble getting pregnant, or not? Stop fiddling with the scales and tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay, your height is 186 centimeters, and your weight is 86 kilograms. That gives you a BMI of… 25.1. That’s in the overweight category. Alright, Angelle. Based on what we’ve discussed, and the quick exam, everything seems normal. However, your BMI is slightly elevated, and being overweight can sometimes make it harder to conceive. It can also increase the risk of complications during pregnancy. I wouldn’t say there will definitely be trouble getting pregnant, but it could potentially be more challenging. I would recommend some blood work to check your hormone levels and overall health. Also, discussing weight management strategies might be beneficial. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Weight management? Honestly. I told you, I'm perfectly healthy. I eat reasonably and I walk. This is ridiculous. You’re trying to tell me I’m too… large to have a baby? I’ve heard enough. Just tell me what blood work needs to be done. And make it quick. I have things to do. I don't have time for lectures on healthy eating and exercise. Get on with it. What tests? And when can I have the results? I need to get this settled, now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Angelle. I understand your frustration. We'll proceed with the blood work. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a follicle-stimulating hormone test. Those will give us a good baseline understanding of your overall health and hormone levels. I'll also include a vitamin D level, just to confirm your supplement is adequate. We should have the results back within three to five business days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
