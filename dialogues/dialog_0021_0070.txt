DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Szmyd, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Sit. Good. Doctor… Havird, yes? I… new here. Just moved. Old doctor… far away. This is… social visit, I think. Medicare said to come. Not sick, exactly. Just… checking. Everything feels old, you know? Like everything is slowing down. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Normal is… a broad term. And Medicare sending you in isn’t exactly a robust medical assessment, is it?
PATIENT: Robust? What does that mean? Like… strong? I just want to make sure… things are still… working. You know, for… my job. Makeup. Theatrical. Very important to look… presentable. People expect things. Is that what you mean? I need to be able to do things. Not… fall apart.
DOCTOR: It means a general suggestion from an insurance company isn’t the same as a thorough medical evaluation. Look, “presentable” and “working” are subjective. Let's try to be specific. What exactly feels… slow?
PATIENT: Specific… ugh. Everything. Just… slower. Like when I used to… well, I used to move quicker, put on makeup quicker. Now? Takes longer. Hands… they don’t listen as well. Sometimes… tremble a little. It’s… annoying. And everything aches. But aches all the time, so… it’s hard to say what’s new. Is this getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: "Tremor," you say. And general aches. Okay. And you said your hands take longer… to apply makeup?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. Used to be… wham, eyeshadow. Swish, foundation. Now… takes two tries. Three. And the colors… sometimes not as bright. They blend… wrong. Very frustrating. Very. It’s… hard to explain. It’s feelings, not… things you can measure. My wife… she used to say I was very precise. Very steady hand. That was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Precision and steadiness…right. Has this… change in steadiness or precision affected other things besides applying makeup?
PATIENT: Other things…? Hmm. Let me think. I… used to build model ships. Very small ships. Detailed. Used tweezers. Used to be able to hold them… steady as a rock. Now? I… stopped. Too fiddly. Dropped a lot of little pieces. Very small pieces. Didn't want to bother. Also, buttoning my coat… sometimes takes a few tries. Small buttons. Not a big problem, really. But… it’s all little things. Adds up, I guess.
DOCTOR: Small things… I see. Any other noticeable changes?
PATIENT: Changes… well, I… forget things. Not important things, usually. Just… names. Faces. What I had for breakfast. Small things! Like the buttons. Or what I was going to say. It happens more now. My wife… she did all the remembering. Used to get mad at me for forgetting things. But that was a long time ago. She… she's gone now.
DOCTOR: You’re dwelling on the past a great deal. And frankly, some memory lapses are normal with… life. Let’s try to focus on current difficulties. Do you have any difficulty with walking, balance, or coordination?
PATIENT: Coordination? No. Not really. I still walk. Still… get around. Though, sometimes… my legs feel heavy. Like walking through water. It’s not… painful. Just… slow. Like everything else! And I… maybe stumble a little more. But who doesn't? It’s old age, right? This is what happens when you get old. Everything… slows down and… falls apart. You can’t expect… things to stay the same.
DOCTOR: We'll do a brief neurological exam, just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure. Please follow the light with your eyes – don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Neurological… what now? Exam? Oh. The light. Yes, okay. Follow the light. Like a little… game. Though I always did hate games. Never had much patience for them.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Squeeze…? Yes, okay. It’s… not as strong, is it? But it works. Still works. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little… diminished, but not concerning at this stage. Now, stand up for me, if you can. Let’s just see your balance.
PATIENT: Balance…? Oh. Right. Getting old is… not for the faint of heart. Everything creaks. Everything hurts. Don't fall, don’t fall…
DOCTOR: All right. Please sit back down. This is all just preliminary. Have you experienced any dizziness, headaches, or vision changes recently?
PATIENT: Dizziness…? No, not really. Sometimes… feel a little lightheaded when I stand up too fast. But everyone gets that, right? Headaches? No. Not much for headaches. Vision… maybe a little blurry sometimes. But I always needed glasses. Old age, you know. Everything… going. Blurry vision, blurry memories… blurry everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you've told me, and my brief examination, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related decline in muscle strength, reflexes, and balance. It's not unusual. It is likely contributing to the feelings of slowness you are experiencing.
PATIENT: Decline…? Is that… bad? I just wanted to make sure I wasn't falling apart. And… was the wife wrong? Am I… less precise? Will my hands just… stop working? I liked building ships. It was… something.
DOCTOR: "Falling apart" is dramatic. And frankly, dwelling on the past won't help. Precision…will diminish with age, yes. But that's normal. We can explore some options for physical therapy to improve your strength and balance, which may help with some of the functional difficulties you’re experiencing. And honestly?
PATIENT: Physical… therapy? Like… exercises? I’m not very good at exercises. Never was. Always preferred… working with my hands. Still. Fine. Exercises, I guess. If it… helps. But I don’t want to waste my time. And I don’t want to fall over.
DOCTOR: They will assess you and tailor a program specifically to your needs. Here is the referral. I also recommend a check-up with an ophthalmologist to address the blurry vision. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. My wife… she handled all the medications. Always told me what to take. Didn't really pay attention. Penicillin, maybe? I think she said something about penicillin once. But it was a long time ago. No, probably not. I don’t really take much medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Not right now. Just… a little something for my… stomach. Sometimes gets upset. But it's… over-the-counter. Can’t remember the name. Little blue pill, maybe? Or white. Something small. I just take it when I need it. Doesn’t matter much, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, to summarize, we’ve discussed age-related decline in strength and balance, the possibility of a penicillin allergy, and a minor stomach issue. You have a referral for physical therapy, and I recommend you schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm. No, I don’t think so. Just… will the exercises… help? And will my hands… be okay? That’s all. I just… want to be able to do things. Even small things.
DOCTOR: Exercises may improve your strength and balance. As for your hands... they will adapt. It’s unlikely to return to prior function, but physical therapy may slow further decline. That’s all I can say for certain. I suggest you focus on what you can do, rather than what you’ve lost. Here is the discharge summary with the referral information. I expect you to follow up with the specialists. .
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I think. Will it hurt? The exercises?
