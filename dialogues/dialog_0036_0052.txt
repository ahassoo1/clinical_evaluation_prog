DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet ye as well. Well, it's this nausea I've been havin’ o’ a mornin’. It’s been botherin’ me for a bit now, and my heart's not been the strongest, so I thought I'd best get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Nausea in the mornings and some concerns about your heart. Let's start with the nausea. How long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now… it started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? It’s not every mornin’, mind ye. More like… three or four times a week. And it’s not a terrible sickness, just… uncomfortable, ye ken? Enough to put me off my breakfast, mostly. I usually have a wee bowl o’ porridge, but… not so keen on it these days when I'm feelin’ a bit queasy.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, three or four times a week. And it's enough to affect your appetite, specifically your porridge in the morning. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or anything that seems to help it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Now that ye mention it… it seems worse if I lie flat for too long. If I get up fairly quickly after wakin’, it's not so bad. And a bit o’ ginger ale seems to settle it, though it doesn’t always work. I had a wee sip this mornin’ before comin’ in, actually. Though it could just be the thought o’ seein’ ye that settled it! Heh.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the ginger ale, and interesting about lying flat. So, it’s worse with prolonged lying down, better with getting up quickly, and ginger ale provides some relief. Now, let's talk about your heart. You mentioned it hasn't been the strongest. Can you describe what you're feeling when you say that?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it's not a pain, exactly. More like… a heaviness, ye ken? And sometimes a bit o’ shortness o’ breath, especially if I’ve been doin’ a bit o’ walkin’. I used to manage a good ramble up the hills, but these days I have to take a few more stops. It's been gettin' worse gradually, over the past year or so, I'd say. I get a wee flutterin' now and then too, like a bird trapped in my chest. Not often, mind ye, but enough to notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, heaviness in the chest, shortness of breath with exertion, and occasional fluttering. It sounds like it's been a gradual worsening over the past year. Have you ever had any chest pain that radiates to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. It's always been right here, in the middle o' my chest. Not spreadin’ anywhere. I've never had any pain in my arm or jaw, thankfully. It's just… uncomfortable. And tiring, ye ken? It takes a lot o' energy to do things I used to do without a second thought. I used to enjoy workin' in the library, shelvin’ books and helpin’ folks, but even that leaves me a bit breathless these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the discomfort is localized to the chest, no radiating pain. It’s causing fatigue and shortness of breath. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Aye, well, Doctor, I was diagnosed with heart failure about five years ago now. The doctor – Dr. MacIntyre, lovely man – put me on some water tablets and a beta-blocker. I’ve been takin’ them regular as clockwork ever since. He said it was somethin' to do with the muscle bein’ weakened. I've not seen him in a while, though. Just been keepin’ on with the medication and hopin’ for the best. I don't have diabetes or high blood pressure, as far as I know. And I’ve not had much trouble with other illnesses, thankfully. Just the usual coughs and colds.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart failure diagnosed five years ago, managed with water tablets and a beta-blocker. That’s important information. Do you remember the names of those medications, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Aye, let me see… the water tablet is furosemide, I think. And the beta-blocker is bisoprolol. I’ve got a wee list here in my wallet, actually. Aye, there we are. Furosemide 40mg once a day, and bisoprolol 5mg once a day. I try to take them at the same time every mornin’, with a bit o’ water. Though sometimes I forget, if I’m honest! But I usually remember before lunchtime.
DOCTOR: Okay, furosemide 40mg and bisoprolol 5mg. And you mentioned occasional forgetfulness, which is understandable. Let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I used to be a bit sniffly with pollen in the spring, but that's just a wee bit o' hay fever. Not a proper allergy, I don't think. And I can eat most things, thankfully. I enjoy a good bit o' Scottish tablet now and then, though maybe I shouldn't! Heh. But seriously, no, no known allergies. I've never had a rash or any trouble breathin' after takin’ a medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, bless her soul, but I always thought it was a terrible habit. Always preferred a good book and a cup of tea, myself. And I've always tried to stay active, as much as my heart allows. I enjoy a bit o' gardenin', and I used to walk a lot. Not so much these days, as I said, but I try to get out and about when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked, enjoy gardening and used to walk a lot. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Aye, well, I enjoy a wee dram now and then. A bit o' whisky, ye ken? Mostly on special occasions – Hogmanay, birthdays, that sort o' thing. I wouldn't say I drink regularly, maybe a couple o' glasses a month, if that. I don’t go out to the pub or anythin’. Just a quiet dram at home with a good book. Nothing excessive, I assure ye. I'm a pretty moderate drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that's fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've had my blood pressure taken before, so I know what to expect. My heart's been a bit noisy lately, as I said, so don't be surprised if it sounds a bit… rumblin’. Just let me know if ye hear anythin’ unusual. I’m ready when ye are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic, your heart rate is 78 beats per minute, a little irregular. I hear a bit of a murmur, which we knew about, but it seems a bit louder than I would expect. Your lungs are clear, but you are breathing a little rapidly. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a bit elevated. I don't feel any tenderness in your abdomen, and it doesn't seem distended. I'm also going to check your legs for any swelling. There is some mild swelling in your ankles and feet. Now, I'd like to review your medications again to make sure everything is correct. You’re currently taking furosemide 40mg and bisoprolol 5mg, correct?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Furosemide 40mg and bisoprolol 5mg. I’ve been takin’ them for years, as I said. But ye’re right, the swellin’ in my ankles has been worse lately. I thought it was just the warm weather, but maybe it's somethin' more serious. And the mornin' nausea… I hadn’t really connected that to the heart trouble, to be honest. Is that possible, Doctor? The heart causin' the sickness? And the blood pressure bein’ up too… It all seems a bit worrisome, now that ye mention it.
DOCTOR: It is possible, Mr. Benic. Several things could be contributing to your symptoms. The swelling in your ankles suggests your heart failure might not be as well-controlled as we'd like. The elevated blood pressure can also worsen heart failure and contribute to nausea. Nausea itself can sometimes be a symptom of heart failure, especially if it's related to fluid buildup and decreased blood flow to the stomach. The irregular heartbeat could also be playing a role. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think we need to do some further investigation. I'd like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, kidney function tests, and a BNP level – that's a blood test that helps assess the severity of heart failure. I also recommend an electrocardiogram to check your heart rhythm more closely and an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart, to get a better look at its structure and function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If ye think it's best to get some more tests done, then I’m happy to go along with it. I trust yer judgement. I've not had an echocardiogram before, have I? Is it… uncomfortable? And the ECG… is that the one with the sticky pads on my chest? I don’t mind a bit o' discomfort if it helps to figure out what's goin’ on. I just want to get this sorted, ye ken? I’m not gettin’ any younger, and I'd like to enjoy a bit o' peace o' mind. So aye, let’s do the tests. Whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: That's a good attitude, Mr. Benic. And you’re right, we want to get to the bottom of this. The echocardiogram is a painless procedure. A technician will apply some gel to your chest and move a probe around to create images of your heart on a screen. It doesn’t involve any needles or electricity. And yes, the ECG involves sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs – it records your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. I’ll get the orders for these tests sent to the lab, and the receptionist will schedule you for them. They’ll likely be able to do the ECG today, and the echocardiogram can be scheduled for later this week. In the meantime, I want you to continue taking your medications as prescribed. I also recommend reducing your sodium intake – that means less salt in your diet – and limiting your fluid intake to about 60 ounces a day. We’ll discuss the results of the tests at a follow-up appointment, which I'll schedule for a week from today. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds a good plan, Doctor. Less salt and less fluid… I can manage that. I’ve got a bit o’ a sweet tooth, mind ye, but I'll try to cut back on the biscuits and cakes. And a follow-up appointment in a week… that gives me somethin’ to look forward to, at least. Thank ye for takin’ the time to listen to me, Doctor Bacy. I feel a bit reassured now, knowin’ that we’re gettin’ to the bottom o’ this. Ye've been very kind and patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it. I'll go and see the receptionist now and get these tests arranged. Is there anythin’ else I should be doin’ in the meantime, or anythin’ I should be watchin’ out for? A particular symptom I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad I could help. And you’re not an “old man” – just a man who deserves good care. Yes, there are a few things to watch out for. If you experience any chest pain that doesn’t go away with rest, shortness of breath that gets significantly worse, dizziness or lightheadedness, or any sudden swelling in your legs or abdomen, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t wait for your follow-up appointment. Otherwise, just focus on resting, staying hydrated within the limits we discussed, and following a low-sodium diet. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I’ll see you next week. Take care, Mr. Benic. .
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye again, Doctor. I will keep a close eye on those symptoms, and I won't hesitate to call if anythin' concerns me. I appreciate yer kindness and attention. Right then. I'll be off to see the receptionist. Take care yerself too, Doctor Bacy. .
