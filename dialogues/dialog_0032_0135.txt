DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pipkorn. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking. A liquid comes out. It started maybe… two days ago? It does not hurt, but it is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say. Two days, and no pain… Hmm. Alright. Can you describe the liquid for me, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: It is… clear. Not blood, Doctor. And not… thick. It is like… water. Maybe a little… yellowish? It is difficult to explain. It comes out when I… move my head sometimes. Or when I… push on the ear a little bit. I do not do this on purpose, just… when I touch it.
DOCTOR: "Like water, a little yellowish…" I see. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms accompanying this discharge?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. No pain, like I said. No… ringing in the ear. My hearing… seems normal. I have not felt… dizzy. I eat normally. I sleep normally. Everything else is… the same. It is only this liquid. It is… strange. I have never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I felt… a little cold last month, maybe? But it was very small. Just… a sniffle. It went away quickly. Nothing serious. I did not go to the doctor for it. It was just a… little cold. I take vitamins, but… that is all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Radillo, I’m going to need to examine your ear. Please lie down on the examination table over there. I’ll need to use an otoscope. It will allow me to have a better look.
PATIENT: An… otoscope? What does it… do, Doctor? Is it… painful? I am… not good with things in my ear. I have… small ears.
DOCTOR: It's a simple instrument, Mr. Radillo. It has a light and a magnifying lens. It will allow me to see inside your ear. It's not painful at all; it’s quite routine. I simply insert it gently into the ear canal. It’s a necessary step to determine the cause of your discharge. Please, try not to worry. It will only take a moment. Now, if you could just lie down…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you say it is not painful… I will try. But… be gentle, please. My ears… they are sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I’m going to insert this into your ear canal now. Just try to remain still. Hmm. Well, the tympanic membrane is… erythematous. And there is some effusion present. I also observe some cerumen impacted in the canal. This could be contributing to the issue. Now, let's examine the other ear. The right ear appears similarly affected. Some redness and… yes, cerumen impaction on this side as well. It seems you have otitis externa in both ears, likely secondary to cerumen buildup.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? What does that… mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Will I… go deaf? And cerumen… is that… ear wax? My ears are… very clean normally. I use a cotton swab sometimes, but… not often.
DOCTOR: Otitis externa, Mr. Radillo, is simply an infection of the outer ear canal – the ear canal. It’s not typically serious, although it can be quite uncomfortable. And no, you will not go deaf. Don't be so dramatic. And yes, cerumen is ear wax. It's a natural substance produced by your ears to protect them. However, excessive buildup, particularly if you are using cotton swabs – which, I might add, push the wax further in – can lead to infection. It's quite common, really. You are not a special case. I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. Use them as directed – twice daily for seven days. Avoid getting water in your ears during this time, and refrain from using cotton swabs altogether. Follow up with me in one week if you do not see improvement. Now, do you have any further questions, or can we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Seven days… twice a day… No… cotton swabs… I understand, Doctor. Will the… drops sting? And… what should I do if the… pain gets worse? Should I call you? I do not… like things in my ears.
DOCTOR: The drops may cause a slight stinging sensation initially, Mr. Radillo, but it should subside quickly. It is a minor discomfort. And if the pain becomes severe, or if you develop a fever, then you should call the clinic. Otherwise, simply complete the course of antibiotics as prescribed. I believe that covers everything. Please, schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist on your way out. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… think that is all. Thank you for… seeing me. I will… schedule the follow-up. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. .
