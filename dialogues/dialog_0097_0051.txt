DOCTOR: “Good morning, Darl! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It is lovely to meet you as well. Let me see... My mind isn't what it used to be, you know. My daughter, she said I really ought to get my blood type written down… something about needing to know, just in case. That's all I really remember. Something about blood… for the doctors. Is that right?
DOCTOR: “That’s a very sensible thing for your daughter to suggest, Darl. Knowing your blood type is important information for medical care. No worries at all about your mind not being what it used to be – that’s perfectly normal as we get older, and it’s wonderful that you have such a thoughtful daughter looking out for you. So, we can definitely get that documented for you today. Just to be thorough, and to make sure there isn't anything else going on, can you tell me a little more about why your daughter suggested this specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, she's a good girl, my Elena. Always thinking ahead. Now, let me think… hmm. It wasn’t anything specific, not that I recall. She just said... something about a new doctor moving to town, and that everyone should have it written down, you know? For emergencies. I think she was worried about… well, I used to do a lot of rigging, dangerous work, up high. Maybe that's it? I haven't done that work in years though, goodness knows. It was… a long time ago. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: “That absolutely makes sense, Darl. It’s smart of her to think ahead, especially with your history of rigging work, even if it was a long time ago. Falls can happen, and knowing your blood type is crucial in those situations. It's good you came in. So, just to confirm, you haven’t had any recent falls or injuries that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: No, no falls, dear. Not recently. I’m pretty steady on my feet, for an old woman! It hasn't been anything like that, thankfully. Just… Elena being Elena, always prepared for the worst. She worries so much. I think she's a little nervous about me living out here on my own, you know? This little farm is… quiet. But I like the quiet.
DOCTOR: “It sounds like you’re doing wonderfully, staying active and enjoying your independence! That’s fantastic, Darl. It's lovely to hear. And it's very understandable that your daughter worries – that’s what good daughters do. Now, aside from your daughter's suggestion about the blood type, are you experiencing any other health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees get a bit creaky sometimes, especially in the cold weather. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, of course. But those are just… old age things, aren't they? Nothing to fuss about. I get a bit tired sometimes, too, but who doesn’t? I mostly just rest when I need to. Is that the sort of thing you're asking about, dear? More than just the… knees and eyes?
DOCTOR: “Yes, that’s exactly the sort of thing I’m asking about, Darl. It’s good you're aware of those things – it's important to mention everything, even if you think it's just ‘old age’. Knee creakiness, changes in vision, and feeling tired are all things we should discuss. Let’s start with the tiredness. Has that been getting worse lately, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. It's… always been there, a little bit. But maybe a little more lately? Hard to say, really. It’s been quite warm, hasn’t it? I tend to nap in the afternoons, especially after tending the garden. And I do worry a bit sometimes, about… things. Just old woman worries, you know? The farm, the animals… making sure everything is alright. I suppose that tires me out too, the fretting.
DOCTOR: “That makes perfect sense, Darl. Warm weather can definitely make you feel more tired, and worrying about your farm and animals is a very valid cause of fatigue. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, when you say ‘tired,’ do you mean just physically tired, or are you also feeling mentally fatigued – having trouble concentrating, or feeling a bit ‘foggy’?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question, dear. It’s… both, I think. Physically, my body aches a little more after working in the garden, yes. But it’s also… hard to focus sometimes. Like my thoughts are… drifting. And I forget things more easily, of course. Names, mostly. And where I put my glasses! It’s frustrating, I tell you. Not like I used to be, sharp as a tack. It's just… slow, everything feels a little slow. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “That makes perfect sense, Darl, and it’s very helpful to know. It sounds like you're experiencing both physical and mental fatigue, and some difficulty with memory, which is perfectly normal as we age, but we want to make sure there's nothing else contributing to it. Before we move on, are you experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… hmm. It's a little smaller than it used to be, I suppose. I don’t eat as much as Elena would like! Mostly just… simple things. Soup, bread, a bit of fruit. I haven't been losing weight, not that I've noticed. Maybe a little, but nothing drastic. I bake a lot, you see. And I always taste-test everything! So, it balances out, probably. Elena says I need more protein, but… well, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: “It sounds like you're maintaining a fairly stable weight despite a slightly smaller appetite, which is good. It's not unusual for appetite to decrease with age. We can discuss ways to make sure you're getting enough nutrients, if you'd like. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a good question. Let me see… My doctor, Dr. Ramirez, he… well, he retired a few years back. I saw him regularly, of course, for check-ups. He said my blood pressure was a little high sometimes, and he gave me some pills for it. I think… yes, pills for the blood pressure. I don’t remember the name of them, goodness knows. And… I think he mentioned my cholesterol, but I don’t recall anything else, really. It was all a long time ago. He was a very good doctor, Dr. Ramirez. Very thorough.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Darl. It’s common to forget the names of medications, especially when they were prescribed a while ago. It's good that you were being treated for high blood pressure, though. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me see… rummages in her purse Here it is. Just these little white ones. shows a small bottle of pills The pharmacist told me what they were for, but… my memory, you know. Something for my pressure, I think. I take one every morning. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take something else for the pain. But not every day. Just when I need to. A little blue one. That’s all. I’m pretty good about taking them, mostly. Elena reminds me, just in case!
DOCTOR: “That’s wonderful, Darl. It's good you're so diligent about your medications, and helpful that Elena checks in with you. Let me take a look at these… examines the pill bottles. Okay, these are Lisinopril 10mg for your blood pressure, and Naproxen 500mg for pain. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… A long time ago, when I was still working as a rigger… I fell, yes. Not a very bad fall, thankfully. Just a broken wrist. They had to put a cast on it. It was… a long time ago. And… hmm. I think I was hospitalized once for the flu, many years back. But that was just for a few days. Nothing serious. That’s all I can really remember, dear. It was a long, long time ago. So many years… everything gets a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Darl. That's helpful to know. A broken wrist and a bout of the flu. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she died when I was quite young, I'm afraid. I don’t really remember her being sick, but she was… old. And my father… he was a fisherman. Very strong man. He lived a long life, but I don’t recall him having any particular illnesses either. My brother… he had some trouble with his heart, I think. Yes, heart problems. He needed to take pills, like me. But other than that… I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history, dear. We weren’t very good at keeping track of such things. It was a long time ago, you know. Everyone just… lived their lives.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Darl. It’s common for family medical history to be unknown, especially if it wasn't discussed much when you were growing up. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. I never touched a cigarette in my life, and I only drink a little wine with my supper sometimes. Just a small glass, really. And… recreational drugs? Oh, no, no, no. Never. I always believed in living a clean, healthy life. Hard work, good food, and a little bit of sunshine. That’s what I always did. And… well, a little bit of worry, maybe. But nothing serious. I always took care of myself, you know. I didn't need any of those things.
DOCTOR: “That’s wonderful, Darl! That’s a very healthy lifestyle, and I commend you for it. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. pauses, tapping her chin No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I eat just about everything, and I’ve taken plenty of pills over the years, like we discussed. No, I don’t think I have any allergies, dear. No, none at all. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose. smiles weakly Though, sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy in the summer, but that’s just the heat, I think. Not a true allergy, you know. Just… itchy skin.
DOCTOR: “That’s good to know, Darl. Alright, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that's perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I'm not afraid of a little check-up. It's good to make sure everything is working properly, you know. Though, don't expect too much! I'm an old woman, after all. chuckles softly But do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: “Wonderful. I gesture to the examination table. If you could just sit here for me, that would be great. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. I proceed to take her blood pressure. After a moment, I state: “Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/85. That’s not drastically high, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. I listen to her heart with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we'll document it. I listen to her lungs. Your lungs are clear. I palpate her abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I check her reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. I examine her hands and feet. There's some mild swelling in your ankles and a bit of redness on your hands. I state as I finish the exam: “Okay, Darl. Everything seems generally okay, but there are a few things we’ll want to address. The elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur, and the slight swelling in your ankles. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and swelling.”
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… a bit concerning, doesn’t it? Elevated blood pressure, a murmur… goodness. Well, you’re the doctor, dear. You know what’s best. Blood work, you say? Alright, if that’s what you think is necessary, then go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Will it be painful? I don’t like needles very much, you know. And… what exactly will the blood work tell us? About my fatigue, you said? And my ankles? Is it something serious? I do worry, you know. Elena will be so concerned if I come home with a long list of problems. But… if it will help, then I’ll do it. Just… be gentle with the needle, alright?
DOCTOR: “I understand your concerns, Darl. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about blood work, especially if you don't like needles. It's not meant to be painful, but there will be a brief pinch. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. The blood work will give us a lot of information. We’ll check your complete blood count to look for any signs of anemia or infection. We'll also check your kidney and liver function, your thyroid levels, and your electrolytes. And we’ll check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. This will help us understand the cause of your fatigue and swelling, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll also be checking your A1C, which gives us an average of your blood sugar over the last three months. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, Darl, but it's always best to be thorough. We want to make sure you're as healthy as can be. And we'll discuss the results with you as soon as they come back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a lot of things. Anemia, kidney function, thyroid… it’s a bit overwhelming, isn’t it? But if it will help, then alright. I suppose I can handle a little blood work. But you promise me it won't be too painful? And you’ll explain everything to me afterwards, in plain English, not all those medical terms? I don’t understand half of them, you know. Elena always tells me I need to ask more questions. She's a very sensible girl. So… what happens now? Do I just sit here and wait for the phlebotomist? And… how long will it take? I have a little garden to tend to this afternoon, if I'm not too tired. It's just… I like keeping busy. It keeps my mind occupied. But… I'll do whatever you think is best. You're the doctor, after all.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Darl. I promise to explain everything in plain English, and you are absolutely right to ask questions. Elena is very wise to encourage that. It’s your health, and you deserve to understand everything that's going on. Yes, just sit here comfortably, and I’ll have the phlebotomist come in shortly. It shouldn’t take long, maybe 10-15 minutes for the blood draw itself. Then it will be sent to the lab, and the results usually come back within a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. And yes, you can tend to your garden afterwards, as long as you're feeling up to it. Just listen to your body and don’t overexert yourself. Would you like a glass of water while you wait?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, dear. A glass of water sounds perfect. smiles weakly It's good to know it won't take too long, and I can still get some gardening done this afternoon. I do enjoy puttering around in my little patch. It’s… calming, you know? Just the smell of the earth and the flowers. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. You’re a very kind doctor. pauses, then adds with a sigh: I just hope it's nothing serious. Elena will be so worried. She’s a good girl, my Elena. Always looking out for me. Looks down at her hands, then back up with a small smile. But… I’m sure it will be alright. I’m a tough old woman, you know. chuckles softly. I’ve survived a lot in my life. waits quietly, looking around the room.
DOCTOR: “You are a tough old woman, Darl. I can tell. And you have a wonderful daughter looking after you, which is a huge blessing. I pause as I hear footsteps approaching. Here comes the phlebotomist now. Her name is Sarah, and she’s very gentle. I’ll let you two get acquainted, and I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. Just let me know. I smile reassuringly and step aside as Sarah enters the room. .
