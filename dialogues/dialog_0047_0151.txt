DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s this… tingling. In my hands, mostly. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… bothersome, you know? It doesn’t hurt hurt, just… feels like pins and needles all the time. I figured I should get it checked out. I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Right. Tingling in your hands. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? It comes and goes, but it's been pretty consistent the last month or so. It's worse when I’m… well, when I'm doing my mail route, I suppose. All that sorting and holding… You know how it is. Lots of little things with my hands all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so three months with increased consistency the last month, and exacerbated by activity – specifically your mail route. Do you notice it in both hands, or is it more prominent in one?
PATIENT: Both, actually. But… the right one is a bit worse. Not by a lot, but… yeah, the right hand definitely gets it more. Sometimes it goes up my arm a little bit, too, on that side. It’s hard to explain, it's not like a sharp pain or anything. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Right. And does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Well… resting does help. When I finally get home and can just sit and put my feet up, it calms down a bit. And sometimes… sometimes if I shake my hands out, it gets a little better for a few minutes. But it always comes back, especially the next day after work. Is that… normal? I don't even know what is normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Hm. Resting and shaking them out provide temporary relief. Alright. Let's get a bit more information. Do you have any weakness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Weakness? Not… not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I carry those mailbags all day, every day. It's a lot of weight, but I've been doing it so long… I suppose it could be a little harder than it used to be, but I just figured that’s getting older, you know? It's not like I can't do things, but maybe I drop things a little more often? It's hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no significant weakness, but perhaps some difficulty with grip or dropping things more frequently. Have you noticed any pain in your neck, shoulders, or upper back?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Actually… my neck gets pretty stiff sometimes. Especially after a long day. And my shoulder on the right side, the same side as the worse tingling, gets sore. I just thought it was from the bag rubbing, or sleeping in a funny position. It’s just one of those things, I suppose. Old age, right? I don't want to bother you with all this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, it's my job to bother with these things, Ms. Uzarski. Let’s not dismiss things as "old age" just yet. Now, do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not that I know of. My mother had some problems with her blood sugar later in life, but I don't think it was full-blown diabetes. I've never been diagnosed with it, and I don't think my regular doctor has ever mentioned it. Why do you ask? Is that what this could be?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications, no. Never really needed any, thankfully. And no allergies, as far as I know. I’ve had a few scrapes and bruises over the years, but never had a bad reaction to anything. I just take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Is this taking a long time? I have to get back and make dinner for my grandson. He’s coming over.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, no allergies. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. We'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and arms. And I'll take a look at your neck and shoulders, if that’s alright. It shouldn’t take long. If you could just sit up here for me.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds good. Just try to be quick, please? My grandson loves my borscht, and it takes a while to make. I don’t want to keep him waiting. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your arm. Two plus. And now the other side. Two plus as well. Now, can you squeeze my fingers as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm trying… There. Is that okay? It feels a little bit… funny. Not painful, just… a little awkward. Like it's harder than it used to be. But I am getting old, remember?
DOCTOR: Right hand grip is slightly weaker than the left. Now, I'm going to test sensation. Close your eyes, please. Tell me when you feel this. And tell me if it feels the same on both hands.
PATIENT: Alright, eyes closed. Okay… yes, I feel it. And… hmm. It feels… a little bit fainter on the right hand. Not by a lot, but… yeah, definitely not as strong. And it feels… tingly, even when you're touching me. Does that make sense? I’m not sure I’m being very helpful. This is strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. And I'm just going to feel along your neck and shoulders. Tell me if anything feels particularly sore. Hmm. That's tender, isn't it?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! That’s it right there. That's where it gets sore, especially after a long day. It feels… knotted up, almost. Like a big muscle cramp. I always just thought it was from the weight of the mailbag. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the exam, it sounds like you likely have some cervical radiculopathy – that is, irritation of a nerve in your neck. The tenderness in your trapezius muscle, combined with the weakness and altered sensation in your hand, points to that. The repetitive movements and weight from your mail route are likely contributing factors. It's not necessarily serious, but it needs to be addressed. We'll need to get an x-ray of your neck to rule out any structural issues. And I’m going to order some blood work to check for underlying conditions like diabetes.
PATIENT: Oh. X-ray? Blood work? Is it… bad? I mean, I just thought it was a pinched nerve or something. Is it something I did? I’ve been carrying mail for thirty years! And diabetes? I don't feel sick. This is more than I expected, Doctor. I just wanted something simple.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Uzarski, it's important to be thorough. Carrying mail for thirty years certainly contributes to these types of problems – repetitive strain injuries are common. The x-ray will help us see if there's any arthritis or other changes in your cervical spine. And the blood work is just a routine precaution. We need to rule out anything else that could be contributing to your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it’s better to be safe. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a course of anti-inflammatory medication and recommend you start physical therapy twice a week. And try to avoid heavy lifting as much as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Heavy lifting? Doctor, I carry mail! That is my job! Physical therapy… and medication… and x-rays… and blood work… It's a lot. Will the medication make me drowsy? I have to drive. And can I still go to work? My boss is… particular. And what about the borscht? My grandson is expecting it. This is all just… overwhelming. Is there anything else I can do? Some kind of cream, maybe? Something simple? .
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Uzarski, I understand you're overwhelmed, but these tests and treatments are necessary. The medication I'm prescribing – naproxen – may cause some drowsiness, but it's generally mild. If you feel too drowsy to drive, do not drive. As for work, you may need to adjust your lifting and carrying for a while. Perhaps request some assistance with heavier routes. And unfortunately, a cream won't be sufficient in this case. This is more than just a superficial issue. The nurse will review the medication side effects with you. I'll also provide a referral to a physical therapist, and they will create a customized treatment plan. We need to address the underlying cause of the problem, not just mask the symptoms. Do you understand?
