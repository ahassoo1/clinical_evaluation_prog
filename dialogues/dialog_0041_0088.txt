DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, I’ve been getting this ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a little while now and it’s starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears… that’s definitely something we want to look into. Hmm… a little while now, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe… a month or so? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's really loud, other times I barely notice it. It's hard to say exactly, to be honest. It's just… annoying. Especially when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Right, intermittent, and worse at night. That’s helpful to know. And is it… just ringing, or is it more like buzzing, clicking, or something else?
PATIENT: Just ringing, mostly. A high-pitched whine, really. Sometimes it feels like a buzzing, but it’s not very often. It's always in both ears, not just one. I don’t think it’s gotten worse recently, but like I said, it’s hard to tell. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, both ears, high-pitched whine, sometimes a buzz... I see. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: To be honest, not really. I work as a waiter, so it’s pretty noisy sometimes in the restaurant. Maybe that? But I've been doing that job for years and it only started recently. I’m divorced, so it's not like stress is new to me either. I really don't know. It just… started happening.
DOCTOR: Right, noisy work environment, but long-term… and stress isn't new. Okay. Let's see… have you noticed any changes in your hearing – like difficulty hearing conversations, or needing to turn the volume up louder than usual?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, a little. My ex and I used to watch movies pretty loud, and I think I’ve been asking people to repeat themselves a bit more lately. But I figured it was just getting older, you know? I’m not as young as I used to be. I don’t think it’s bad, but maybe it is?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some possible hearing changes along with the ringing. That does give us something to work with. Hmm… Alright, let’s do a quick exam. I’ll just take a look in your ears and do a basic hearing test, just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Let’s get it done. I just want to figure out what’s going on and, hopefully, get it sorted.
DOCTOR: Great. First, let's just take a look in your ears to make sure there’s no wax buildup or anything obvious going on. This might be a little chilly. Okay, ears look clear. No excessive wax, no signs of infection. Now, I’m going to do a quick tuning fork test. I'll tap this and place it on the bone behind your ear. Just let me know when you can’t hear it anymore. Alright?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Let me know if I need to do anything. I'm ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, can you hear the tone?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can hear it. It’s… a ringing, kind of like what I've been experiencing, but sharper. It’s still pretty clear now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And is it still clear now?
PATIENT: Yeah, still clear. Actually… it’s fading a little. It’s getting quieter… yeah, I can barely hear it now. I think that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, and now the other side. Let me know when you can't hear it anymore.
PATIENT: Yep, I can hear it… it’s… the same, I guess. A little sharper than normal, but definitely noticeable. It’s… fading now, yeah, it’s getting quieter. I think it’s gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Both sides seem… slightly diminished compared to what I’d expect, but not dramatically. It's subtle. Alright, Jaylyne, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tinnitus, which is ringing in the ears. The slight decrease in hearing response on the tuning fork test suggests there might be some mild hearing loss contributing to it. It's common, and often linked to noise exposure, even if it's long-term. Do you have any history of ear infections or exposure to really loud sounds, like concerts or explosions?
PATIENT: No ear infections that I remember, no. And… not really, no. I mean, the restaurant is loud, but nothing crazy. I don’t go to concerts, and I’ve never been near an explosion. I used to listen to music pretty loud with headphones, maybe that? But I haven’t done that in years. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a bit confused. I don’t really do anything that would cause this.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s fair. Sometimes it’s hard to pinpoint a specific cause. It’s possible it’s a combination of factors. We’ll do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I want to order an audiogram, which is a more detailed hearing test. It will tell us exactly what frequencies you might be having trouble with. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. If it helps figure out what’s going on, definitely. How long will that take to schedule? I’ve got work most evenings. I’m trying to get this sorted quickly if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll have my assistant schedule that for you. She'll find a time that works with your schedule. It usually takes about an hour, and they'll send the results back to me. In the meantime, try to avoid loud noises as much as possible, and if you are exposed to them, wear earplugs. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be cautious. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally pretty healthy. I had a bad back a few years ago, but that’s sorted now. No medications. Just… divorced life, you know? That’s stressful enough. But no actual medical stuff. Private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Right, back sorted, no meds, private insurance… good to know. Alright, Jaylyne, so we’ll get that audiogram scheduled, and I’ll review the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, if the ringing gets significantly worse, or you notice any dizziness, hearing loss, or pain, please give us a call right away. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. I appreciate it. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. I just want to get back to normal. Dizzy spells or pain, I'll keep an eye out. Thanks for your help. Can I go now? I’ve got a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Yes, you can head out. My assistant will stop by with the appointment information for the audiogram before you leave. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Get some rest, and I'll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Okay, thanks again, Doctor. Bye.
