DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer, you know? It’s in my leg. It’s been getting bigger. I hope it’s nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: "After the cancer," you say. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, I had breast cancer, maybe five years ago now? They did… treatments. Pills, mostly. And some radiation. It was all… a while ago. I thought it was gone, but now this leg… it’s bothering me. It feels tight, you know? And it’s puffy.
DOCTOR: Right, breast cancer five years ago, treated with pills and radiation. And now swelling in your leg. Is this swelling in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just one! My right leg. The left is fine. It started… maybe a month ago? It was just a little bit at first, I didn’t think much of it. But now… well, now it’s hard to wear my normal shoes.
DOCTOR: And has anything changed about the swelling recently?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. It’s been getting worse the last week, I think. And… it feels warm sometimes. Not hot, just… warmer than my other leg. And a little bit achy, if I stand for too long. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Getting worse over the last week, warmth, and achiness with prolonged standing. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in the skin of your right leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The skin… I don’t know. It looks… normal, I guess? Maybe a little bit redder than my other leg, but I put lotion on it, so… it’s hard to tell. I don't think so, though. No open sores or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no chest pain. And I can breathe fine, thank you. Blood clots… I don’t think so? The doctor never said anything about that. I had some tests after the cancer, but… I don't remember all the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to examine your leg and check a few things. If you don’t mind, please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with a quick look, then I’ll feel for any tenderness or warmth.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that’s fine. Is it going to hurt? I hope not.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt, Ms. Queener. Just a simple physical exam. I'll be gentle. Please position yourself lying flat. Circumference is 38 centimeters at the calf, and 32 centimeters at the ankle. There is mild pitting edema present, and the skin is slightly warm to the touch. No visible rash or lesions. Palpation reveals some tenderness along the calf muscles. Dorsalis pedis pulse is present and 2+ on both sides. Alright, Ms. Queener. Everything seems to be structurally sound, but there is some swelling and tenderness present. I want to rule out a few things. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just as a precaution.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear it's structurally sound. Yes, of course, listen to my heart and lungs. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It just worries me, you know? After everything. I don’t want the cancer to… come back.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your heart and lungs sound fine, which is reassuring. Based on what you've told me, and my initial examination, it's possible this is simply venous insufficiency – meaning the valves in your veins aren’t working as efficiently as they should, causing fluid to pool in your leg. However, given your history of cancer, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg to check for deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot. It’s a non-invasive test. Also, a CBC and CMP blood work. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, contrast dye… I don’t think so? I’ve had tests before, but I don’t remember them using dye. I might be allergic to… penicillin? Yes, penicillin. It gives me a rash. And… is a blood clot very bad? You’re scaring me a little bit, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, penicillin allergy noted. And yes, a blood clot can be serious, but we’re not saying you have one. It’s just a precaution to rule it out. If it is a blood clot, we can treat it. It’s far better to know for sure. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and staying well-hydrated. I will also write you a prescription for a mild diuretic to help reduce fluid retention. I'll order the blood work and ultrasound now. The lab should be able to accommodate you today and the imaging center can likely fit you in tomorrow. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, a diuretic… that’s a water pill, right? I’ve taken those before. Yes, that’s good. Elevate my leg, compression stockings… I can do that. Um… will the ultrasound hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know if it’s serious, you know? I don’t want to worry about this all weekend.
DOCTOR: No, the ultrasound won't hurt at all. It’s completely non-invasive. A technician will simply move a probe over your leg. It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes or so. The results are typically available within 24 hours. I will have the results faxed to my office, and my nurse will call you as soon as we have them. Now, based on your history of breast cancer, I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment with your oncologist just to make sure everything is stable. It's a precaution, but it's best to be thorough. Would you like me to help arrange that for you?
PATIENT: Oh, good. No hurt, that’s good. And 24 hours… I can wait for that. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, please. That would be wonderful if you could arrange that for me. I always forget to make those appointments myself. It’s just… a lot to keep track of. Thank you so much for everything. I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Queener. I've already sent a request to your oncologist’s office for an appointment. They will contact you directly to schedule a time. Here are your prescriptions for the diuretic and a written summary of today’s discussion, as well as instructions for leg elevation and compression stocking use. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased pain, redness, or swelling – or develop a fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
