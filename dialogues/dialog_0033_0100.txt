DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Hughston, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um... well, the nice lady on the phone said something about a check-up? A screening, I think she called it. It's about... things. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It's been a long few years since... well, never mind. Is this about work? Because they sometimes ask for these things.
DOCTOR: A screening… yes. Medicare does have a few preventative measures they cover. And frankly, it is good you’re here. Though, frankly, relying on the receptionist for details isn't ideal. Work-related?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I wish I could remember better. I think so? I operate some of the big machinery… for paving, you know? Roads and such. It's... heavy work. They sent me here, I believe, to make sure I'm still okay to be doing it. But honestly, I get so mixed up these days. Is this a test of… my brain? Because that's what feels tired, not my arms.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a work evaluation, potentially. And you're concerned about cognitive function. It’s… good you’re self-aware, I suppose. Though, it’s usually them who raise those concerns. Let’s start with the basics, shall we?
PATIENT: Basics… yes, good. I'm not very good with complicated things. Um... what kind of basics? Like, my height and weight? I think I haven't changed much, but it's hard to say for sure. I'm tall, always have been. And... fairly light for my size, I suppose. Is this going to be a physical? Because I had a bit of a fall last winter… nothing major, just a tumble in the snow.
DOCTOR: Height and weight are a good place to start, yes. The receptionist did put down 197 centimeters and 138 pounds. We’ll confirm those, of course. And yes, a brief physical is standard. The fall… you said ‘nothing major’, but we need specifics. When was it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you have all the details written down! That’s a relief. Um… the fall… let me think. It was… January, I believe? Maybe February. It was a snowy day, very slippery. I was walking to the equipment shed, and just… went down. Landed on my… hip, I think. It hurt for a bit, but I iced it and it seemed alright. I didn’t go to the doctor, though. I’m not one for fussing. Does that help? I honestly don’t remember much beyond that. It's all a bit of a blur, you know?
DOCTOR: January/February, hip impact, no medical attention. Alright. We’ll need to assess that hip. If you'll just lie down on the table, please. We’ll start with a range of motion test.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A test, yes. Range of motion… is that bending and stretching? My joints sometimes creak a bit, you know? Especially in the cold. I hope it's not too much trouble. I'm not very flexible these days. Is this going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't hurt, no. Discomfort is possible, given your… history. Just tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Now, can you bend your left knee up towards your chest?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a bit sore, yes. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Like an old bruise. Oh, goodness. That’s… not as easy as it used to be. It feels… stiff. There’s a bit of a clicking sound, too. Is that normal? I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Clicking is… not ideal, but not necessarily alarming. The stiffness is more concerning, given the fall. Now, let's try the right hip. Can you lift your right leg straight up, keeping it extended?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a bit tighter on this side. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it feels… restricted. Like something is holding it back. It's hard to explain. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… pulling sensation. Is this what you’re looking for? I'm sorry if I'm not being very helpful. It's hard to describe these things.
DOCTOR: Restricted range of motion, yes. And a reported pulling sensation. Alright. We’ll need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order some basic blood work and an X-ray of both hips. The blood work will check for inflammation. The X-ray will assess the bone structure.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and an X-ray? That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I don't like needles very much. And I've always been a bit worried about radiation. Is it safe? I just wanted a simple check-up, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Hughston. We’re simply being thorough. The blood work is a small vial – barely noticeable. And the X-ray exposure is minimal. It’s far more dangerous to ignore potential problems. The lab technician will take the blood sample. And the radiology department will handle the X-ray. I’ll write the orders now. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, no. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was a long time ago. I think I might be slightly allergic to… dust? It makes me sneeze sometimes, but it's not serious. Nothing I need medication for, you know? Is this going to take long? I have to get back to work eventually, you know? The roads aren't going to pave themselves.
DOCTOR: Mild hay fever and a possible dust allergy… noted. The lab shouldn’t take long. The X-ray… depends on their schedule. Here are the orders. Take these to the lab and radiology departments. They’re just down the hall. Once you have the results, schedule a follow-up appointment with me. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Down the hall… that's good. So, I just… go to those departments? And they’ll know what to do? I’m not very good with directions, you know. And I don’t want to bother anyone. Is there a map, perhaps? And… what am I supposed to do while I’m waiting?
DOCTOR: Just follow the signs. Lab is straight ahead, radiology is to the left. They're used to patients. And frankly, Ms. Hughston, I have other appointments. You can sit in the waiting room. Read a magazine. Once the results are available, the departments will contact you to schedule a follow-up. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I… I don't think so. Just… thank you. I hope I can find the lab… and the radiology department. Magazines… right. .
