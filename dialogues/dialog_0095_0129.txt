DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. Honestly, it’s about my… well, you know. What goes out. It's black. Like tar, nearly. And it’s been going on for a bit, now. I take those pills, you see – for my arthritis. Been on 'em for years. Don’t know what else to tell ya. Get on with it, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you’re taking medication for arthritis. And you’re mentioning a change in your bowel movements – specifically, black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Tarry. That’s a good word for it. And yes, the pills. Those little red ones. I take 'em with my breakfast, usually. Look, are we going to figure this out or what? I have errands to run, you know. It's not like I sit around thinking about this all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Black, tarry stools are something we definitely need to investigate. It often indicates bleeding somewhere in the upper digestive tract. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – like weakness, fatigue, stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Bleeding? Now you're scaring me! Look, I’m 73 years old, everything aches. Fatigue? Always tired, naturally. And my stomach… well, it gurgles sometimes, like a washing machine. But that's just old age, isn't it? I don't go throwing up or anything dramatic like that. Honestly, I just want to know if I'm going to die from this. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me all of this. And no, that's not too much to ask at all. We’ll take things step-by-step. The gurgling is good to know. And while fatigue can be normal, it’s important to rule things out. Now, just to be clear, have you noticed any blood in your stool – separate from the black, tarry color?
PATIENT: Separate? Like…bright red? No. Never that. It's just…dark. Like coffee grounds, almost, but darker. And it smells…well, you know. Not pleasant. Look, I’ve been using the same pills for years. Why would it suddenly start doing this now? It’s probably just something I ate. I had a bit of liver pâté last week. Could that be it? Honestly, doctors always make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistently black, tarry stools, no bright red blood, and the change seems relatively recent. And you’re on arthritis medication long-term. Liver pâté is unlikely to cause this, but we need to investigate further. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, heavens no! If anything, I’ve gained a few pounds. My husband keeps bringing me cookies, you see. He thinks I’m too thin. Honestly, I’m a sturdy woman. Always have been. Look, are you going to give me some kind of test or what? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. I’d like to order a stool test to check for blood, as well as some blood work to assess your overall health and look for any signs of anemia – that’s a low red blood cell count, which can happen with bleeding. And I’m going to do a quick physical exam of your abdomen, just to see if there’s any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood work? Fine, fine. Just get it over with. And poking and prodding? Really? Look, I trust you’re a doctor and all, but I don’t like being touched. Quick as you can, please. My husband is expecting me for lunch. And tell me, honestly, is this something serious? Don’t sugarcoat it, just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It's important to rule out any serious causes, and that's why we're doing these tests. While it could be something relatively minor, the black stools are a sign that needs investigation. I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes, right… there. A little bit tender. Not awful, but…uncomfortable. It feels… tight, almost. Like a knot. Honestly, it’s been like that for a few days now. Just thought it was gas, maybe. My husband says I eat too much cabbage. Is that what this is? Cabbage? Honestly, men.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in that area is good to know. While cabbage can cause gas, tenderness like this warrants further investigation. I'm concerned enough to recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist – that’s a specialist in digestive health. They can perform a colonoscopy to directly visualize your colon and determine the cause of the bleeding. It's the most accurate way to diagnose this. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A…a colonoscopy? You want to look at my… down there? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I don’t think so. That sounds… awful. And invasive. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe just more blood work? Or a scan? Anything but that… that procedure. Honestly, I’d rather just live with it, if you want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and it's perfectly valid to feel that way. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it’s not the only option. We can start with more extensive blood work, including a fecal immunochemical test – that’s a test for hidden blood in the stool. And a CT scan can give us some information, although it’s not as accurate as a colonoscopy. However, I need to be very clear: if we don’t determine the cause of the bleeding, it could lead to serious complications. The gastroenterologist will discuss all the options with you and help you make the best decision. I can give you a referral and you can schedule a consultation at your convenience. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A referral, then. Just… don’t push me into anything, understand? I want to think about it. And I want a good doctor, someone who explains things. Not one of those rushed ones who just poke and prod and tell you everything’s fine. Fine. Give me the referral. And tell me…is this something to be really worried about? Honestly, I just want to know if I’m going to be okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma – she’s an excellent gastroenterologist, very thorough and patient-focused. I've included her contact information and a note about your concerns. As for your question... The black stools indicate bleeding, which could be caused by a number of things – from relatively minor issues like ulcers to more serious conditions. That's why it’s important to get it checked out. The risk of it being something serious is why I'm recommending the colonoscopy, but ultimately, the decision is yours. I’ll also order the additional blood work I mentioned. We’ll get those results back as quickly as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I've given you the referral form and ordered the blood work. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as you can. And don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was nice meeting you, Dawnetta. I hope you feel better soon.
