DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s…nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about my… a patient of mine. He's been looking quite yellow, you see. It’s concerning, really. I believe it’s something to do with his liver, or perhaps hepatitis? I… I don’t recall all the specifics at the moment, truthfully. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Yellow… alright. And you said a patient of yours?
PATIENT: Yes, a patient. I… work with radiation, you see. Dosimetry, it’s called. He’s under my care for… treatments. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a case like this, so I wanted to get a proper opinion. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps you could ask me specific questions? It might jog something loose.
DOCTOR: Of course, that’s perfectly alright. We'll take it slow. So, this patient… can you tell me his age and gender, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… age… he’s… older. Not very old, but… past sixty, certainly. And… a man, yes. Definitely a man. A bit… stout, if I remember correctly. Not frail, but… solid. I truly wish I could be more precise, but it escapes me at the moment. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And when did you first notice the yellowing – the jaundice, as we call it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The timing… It was… not recent, certainly. A few weeks, perhaps? It was gradual. He didn’t come in complaining of anything specifically at first, just a general unwell feeling. Then I noticed the colour of his skin during a routine check-up. It concerned me enough to send him here, naturally. It's… it feels like it was some time ago now. Perhaps a month? I truly cannot say with certainty.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has he had any other symptoms that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me see. He did mention feeling… tired, yes. Very tired. And a bit… achy. Nothing dramatic, just a general malaise. I… vaguely recall something about his appetite being off, but I can’t be certain. He's not one to complain, that patient, so it was difficult to get much information from him initially. Perhaps it would be best to speak to him directly?
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be ideal. Do you happen to know his full name and date of birth, so we can pull up his records?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I should have that information, but… it's not coming to me. I believe it starts with a ‘B’… but beyond that, I’m afraid I’m drawing a blank. I am so very frustrated with myself. Perhaps he has a card with his information? Or his medical paperwork? I do apologise. I’m not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Annelle. These things happen. We'll do our best. Let's try this. Do you recall anything about the type of radiation treatment he's receiving?
PATIENT: Radiation… yes, he’s had… external beam, I believe. For… something in his chest, if I remember correctly. It’s been a long course, you see. Several weeks now, perhaps months. I… I handled the dosimetry calculations, of course, but the specifics of the treatment plan… that was Dr. Elmsworth’s responsibility. He retired last year, I believe. It’s all rather muddled in my head, I’m afraid. Honestly, I wish I could be of more assistance. It’s terribly frustrating to feel so… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s focus on what we do know. External beam radiation to the chest for some time, and he’s been experiencing fatigue and jaundice. I’d like to examine him, if you don’t mind. Perhaps a physical assessment will help us narrow things down. Is he here with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, he is. He’s… in the waiting room, I believe. He’s a very stoic man, quite independent. He wouldn’t want me fussing over him, I assure you. But… yes, he’s here. Please, examine him at your leisure. I do hope you can discover the cause of this jaundice. It’s troubling, you see. Very troubling. I’ve said all I can recall at this point, I fear. If you need me to clarify anything, please do ask, but I doubt I will be of much further assistance. .
DOCTOR: Alright then. If you’ll excuse me, I'll go and speak with him. Thank you for your time, Annelle. Even with the difficulty recalling details, your observations have been helpful. .
