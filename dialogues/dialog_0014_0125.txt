DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, well, I requested the HIV test. Just… wanted to get it done, you know? Better safe than sorry, I always say. Though, honestly, I doubt it’ll be anything. I’m a pretty careful guy.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you requested an HIV test. Routine screening is… sensible, I suppose. Though, frankly, most people who think they're careful aren't. Still. Alright. Have you had any… risky behaviors recently?
PATIENT: Risky behaviors? What is this, a questionnaire? Look, I’m married. Very happily married. And I haven’t… well, it’s none of your business what I do with my wife, is it? I just want the test. I don’t need a lecture about… things. It’s a precaution, that’s all. A responsible thing to do, frankly.
DOCTOR: Well, someone's defensive. It's standard procedure, Mr. Belan. We need to understand your risk factors to properly interpret the results. It’s not a judgment, it’s medicine. But alright, if you’re so… insistent. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, diagnosed or not?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking about… that. Look, I’ve never needed to go to the doctor for… anything like that. Ever. I take care of myself. My wife and I… we’re both very healthy people. Honestly, I find the line of questioning rather… insulting. Are you implying something? Because I assure you, I’m a very trustworthy person, and I take preventative measures. It’s just a test, right? Let’s just get the test done.
DOCTOR: Fine. We’ll do the test. But I need a complete medical history, regardless of your… self-assessment. Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: A blood transfusion? Goodness, no. Why would I have had a blood transfusion? Are you seriously asking me about things that haven’t even remotely happened? I’m a healthy man! I eat well, I exercise, I don’t go around getting… transfused. This is getting ridiculous. What exactly are you hoping to find, Doctor? Just give me the test and let's be done with this. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No transfusions. Have you ever shared needles?
PATIENT: Shared needles?! Are you accusing me of… of that? Honestly! What kind of doctor asks these things? It’s preposterous. I am a compliance officer, for goodness sake! I ensure others follow the rules, I certainly don’t break them myself. It’s utterly insulting. I'm starting to regret coming here. Just… the test, please. Is that so hard to understand? I’m a responsible adult, and this interrogation is completely unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Belan, I understand you find these questions… unpleasant. But I am obligated to gather a thorough history. It’s not about accusing you of anything, it's about accurate medicine. Have you ever used intravenous drugs, even recreationally?
PATIENT: Intravenous drugs?! Seriously? This is beyond absurd. Are you implying I'm some kind of… addict? I work in compliance! I write the regulations about this sort of thing! I haven't the slightest interest in… in those sorts of activities. This is completely unprofessional, frankly. I am a respectable member of society. You are wasting my time, and frankly, causing me distress. I requested an HIV test, not a character assassination. Just… give me the test. NOW. Or I’m leaving. I'll find another doctor. .
DOCTOR: Fine. Fine! We’ll do the test. But don’t come complaining to me if the results are… unexpected. I need a blood sample. And frankly, I strongly advise you consider… lifestyle factors, regardless of your protestations. Go ahead and roll up your sleeve. It's the one on the left. I’ll need to draw about 10 milliliters.
