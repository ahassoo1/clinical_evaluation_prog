DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch, good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Memmolo. Well, it's about the smoking, you see. I've been... at it for a very long time, and I think it’s finally time I tried to put a stop to it. It’s becoming rather bothersome, both to my health and, frankly, my wallet.
DOCTOR: Smoking, yes. A common enough problem. And you’re finally deciding to address it… good. How much have you been smoking, and for how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think now… It’s been… sixty years, at least. Started when I was a boy, barely fourteen. As for how much… usually a pack a day, maybe a little more if I’m stressed. Sometimes less, if I’m feeling unwell. It varies, but a pack a day is a safe estimate, I’d say. Chesterfield, usually. Though sometimes I’ll have a Lucky Strike if they’re on sale. A habit, you see. A very long habit.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… a considerable length of time. And Chesterfield, occasionally Lucky Strike. Right. Have you attempted to quit before, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many times. Several attempts, over the years. Patches, gum… even those things you inhale. I don’t recall the name now. They didn’t… quite take. I’d manage a few days, sometimes a week, but then… the craving would return. It's a difficult thing to shake, you understand. A very difficult thing. And truthfully, I never really tried to try, if that makes any sense. I’d start, get discouraged, and then… well, start again. A cycle, really.
DOCTOR: A cycle, yes. Many patients find that’s how it is. And these methods… they don’t work for everyone. Do you have any other health problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My knees ache, especially in the cold weather. The doctor said it's just wear and tear, nothing too serious. And my breathing isn’t what it used to be, naturally. But other than that… no. No heart trouble, no diabetes. I used to have a bit of indigestion, but that’s settled down. I'm fairly healthy for a man of my age, I believe. I’ve always been a strong man, you see. Worked in the factory for forty years, lifting and carrying. Though I suppose all that lifting isn’t doing my knees any favors now.
DOCTOR: Knees… breathing… typical for someone with your history. Alright. Let’s have a quick listen to your lungs, if you don’t mind. Just sit up there for me, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I hope it won’t be too unpleasant. My lungs haven’t been the same since… well, since I started, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay… take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Hmm. Reduced breath sounds bilaterally, some scattered wheezing. Not surprising, given the smoking history. Have you noticed any coughing, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do cough, quite frequently, actually. Mostly in the mornings, a rather deep, rattling cough. It’s worse in the winter, when the air is cold and damp. And sometimes, if I exert myself too much, I’ll start coughing. It’s not… a pleasant sound, I assure you. I've always dismissed it as just a smoker’s cough, but perhaps it’s more serious than I thought.
DOCTOR: A smoker’s cough, yes. Predictable. Given your history and the wheezing I heard, we should get a chest X-ray. Just to rule out anything… more significant. It's standard procedure. Do you have any allergies to medications, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any trouble with medications, thankfully. Not that I take many. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache, and sometimes a cream for my knees when they’re particularly sore. No allergies, no. Though, I suppose I've never had a proper allergy test. Is that something I should consider?
DOCTOR: No, not at this time. Alright. I'll write you a referral for a chest X-ray. The order will be sent electronically to the radiology department at City General. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss further options for quitting smoking. It’s going to require commitment, Mr. Knoch. It won't be easy.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Commitment, you say? Yes, I suppose you're right. It won't be easy. Sixty years is a long time to build a habit. I’m prepared to try, though. I truly am. It’s just… a little daunting, to be honest. Sixty years… What happens after the X-ray, then? Will you… prescribe something? A patch, perhaps? Or one of those inhalers?
DOCTOR: We'll see what the X-ray shows first. Then we can discuss medication options, if necessary. There are patches, inhalers, even oral medications available. But it’s important to remember that medication is just one piece of the puzzle. You need to be motivated, Mr. Knoch. And realistically, given your age and smoking history, I would also recommend a consultation with a pulmonologist. Just to be certain. I’ll put in a referral for that as well. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: A pulmonologist, you say? Another specialist… Well, if that's what you recommend, Doctor, I suppose I’ll do it. It sounds… rather serious, all this. But I appreciate you being thorough. No, I don't think I have any other questions at the moment. Just… when do you think I should schedule these appointments? Should I call City General immediately?
DOCTOR: Yes, call City General as soon as possible to schedule the X-ray. And they will contact you to schedule the pulmonology appointment. Don’t delay, Mr. Knoch. The sooner we get this addressed, the better. Here’s a summary of today’s visit and the referrals. I have other patients waiting, so I’m going to have to ask you to excuse me. Good luck.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your time. I will call City General immediately, as you suggested. Good day to you. .
