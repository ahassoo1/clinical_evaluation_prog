DOCTOR: Hi Elijiah, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hey, Dr. Condray. Good to meet you too. Uh… well, it’s kinda weird, to be honest. It’s just… I been havin’ trouble gettin’ out of chairs. Like, I sit down, and then… it’s a struggle to stand up. Not every time, but often enough it’s worryin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit unusual. Trouble getting out of chairs, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah. It’s not a pain thing, exactly. It’s more like… my legs feel stuck for a second. Or like they don’t wanna listen to me right away. It’s hard to explain. It started a couple months ago, maybe? I don’t really keep track of dates so good. But definitely after… after my wife passed. It’s been gettin’ a little worse lately, that’s why I figured I should come in.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this started around the time of a significant loss, and that’s important to note. It can be related. “Stuck” and delayed response from your legs… okay. Just to clarify, does this happen with all chairs?
PATIENT: Not all chairs, no. It's worse with the lower ones, like… kitchen chairs. Or those folding ones, you know? The ones you take to the park. High ones, like an office chair with arms, I can usually get outta pretty easy. It’s like… the harder it is to get into the chair, the harder it is to get out. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, actually. That gives me a bit more to work with. So, lower chairs, particularly folding ones, are more problematic. And it seems there’s a connection to the effort it takes to sit down. Okay. Now, aside from the difficulty standing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I mean, I get tired easier, but I’ve been workin’ pretty hard, oil rigs ain't easy, right? No pain in my legs, no numbness, no weakness… just… the stuck feelin’. And kinda dizzy sometimes when I do manage to stand up quick, but that doesn’t happen every time either. I’ve just been tryin’ to take it slow, but it’s kinda hard when you gotta, you know, work.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, and occasional dizziness when standing quickly… I’m noting all of this. You mentioned you work on oil rigs, which is physically demanding. Have you experienced any falls, even minor ones, since this started?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no falls. I’ve gotten close a couple times, kinda stumbled, but I always managed to catch myself or hold onto somethin’. I’m pretty careful. I don’t wanna end up hurtin’ myself, especially not out there. It’s already dangerous enough as it is. That’s why I came in, before somethin’ does happen.
DOCTOR: That's very smart of you to come in proactively. Alright, let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I had the flu when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Never been in the hospital, never had any surgeries. Just the usual cuts and scrapes from work, but nothin’ serious. My wife, she used to take me to the doctor for check-ups, but I never really needed anything. She was the healthy one, always watchin' what she ate and stuff. Sorry, just… gets me thinkin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely natural to be thinking of her. We can move at your pace. Okay, so no significant medical history, no surgeries… What about medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never taken any regular medication. Not even vitamins, to be honest. I figured if I was feelin’ good, that was good enough. Like I said, never really needed anything. And after… well, after my wife passed, I just kinda stopped botherin’ with stuff like that. I’ve been mostly just tryin’ to keep workin’, keep busy. It’s easier that way, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, no allergies to medications, and no current medications. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Uh… that’s kinda tough. I didn't know my dad, he left when I was little. And my mom, she passed away when I was young too, before I really got to know her. My wife, she had some trouble with her heart, but that was… genetic, I think? Her mom had it too. As for anyone else… I don’t really have any family close by, so I don’t know much about their medical history, if that makes sense. I mostly grew up on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a general idea. Limited family history, wife had some heart issues. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll check your strength, reflexes, and balance. It'll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I just wanna figure out what's goin' on with my legs. I don’t want it gettin’ worse, especially not out there. I'm kinda worried it'll get me fired, if I can't keep up.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from talking, or from the physical nature of your work. Lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like that? I try to keep ‘em strong, gotta be for the job. Pullin' cables and stuff, it takes a lot. Used to be stronger, maybe, but I’m still pretty good, I think.
DOCTOR: Good, good strength in both hands. Now, could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright. This chair feels kinda high, actually. Hope this isn’t one of those ones that’ll get me stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap lightly on your knees with this little hammer. It’s a normal part of the exam, just to see how your nerves are responding. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are good. Now, I want you to try and stand up from the chair five times. Do it at your normal pace. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Whew. Okay, that was… harder than it should be. Not terrible, but definitely not easy. Like I said, it gets worse the more I do it. And this chair… kinda makes it harder, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you. And that was helpful. Now, one last thing, I want you to walk a few steps for me, heel-to-toe, like you’re walking on a tightrope. I'm looking for balance and coordination.
PATIENT: Kinda hard to do, honestly. I don't usually walk like this. Feels… off. I’m not usually this clumsy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing what we call orthostatic intolerance, potentially with a component of peripheral neuropathy. Now, that sounds complicated, I know. Essentially, it means your body isn’t adjusting to changes in position as smoothly as it should, and there may be some nerve involvement. It’s not necessarily a serious condition, but we need to investigate further to get a clear picture. We’re going to start with some blood tests to rule out any underlying deficiencies or conditions, and I'd like to also order a nerve conduction study to check the function of the nerves in your legs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Whoa… okay. Ortho-… what was it again? And… nerve tests? Look, I don't really understand any of that. All I know is my legs are makin’ it hard to do my job. Is it… serious? Like, am I gonna be able to keep workin’? And what’s a “deficiency”? I don’t really… have the money for a lot of tests, either. Or a lot of time off.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s break it down. "Orthostatic intolerance" just means your body has trouble with changes in position – like when you stand up. It's not necessarily a disease, but a symptom of something else. As for deficiencies, that just means we'll check your vitamin and mineral levels to see if anything's low. A simple blood test will tell us. Now, regarding your job, it's too early to say definitively if this will affect your ability to work. That's why we need to get some tests done to understand what's going on. As for the cost, I understand your concerns. I can write a referral to a lab that offers financial assistance, and we can discuss options for getting you the care you need without breaking the bank. And I can write you a note for limited duty work if needed while we investigate. I want to be upfront: peripheral neuropathy can be serious, but it also has many treatable causes. The nerve conduction study will help us determine if that’s what’s going on, and if so, what the best course of action is. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Okay… financial assistance, that would be… really good. And a note for limited duty, yeah, that’d help. I don’t wanna lose my job over this. So, blood tests and… nerve tests. And you’ll help me figure out the cost stuff? And what about… what causes all this? Like, is it from the work? Or… something else?
DOCTOR: Yes, I will absolutely help you with the cost. We have resources available to help patients get the care they need. Now, as for the cause… that's what we need to find out. It could be related to your work, particularly the physical demands and repetitive movements, but it could also be due to other factors like vitamin deficiencies, dehydration, or even a previous illness. It's less common, but it can also be a sign of other underlying conditions. That’s why we need those tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your electrolytes, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a nerve conduction study. We’ll also check your blood pressure lying down and standing up to see how your body responds to positional changes. To start, I'm going to give you a referral to [Name of Lab] for the blood tests. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. And I'll write a referral for the nerve conduction study to [Name of Neurologist] at [Hospital Name]. They specialize in diagnosing and treating nerve conditions. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated – drink plenty of water throughout the day. And try to avoid sudden changes in position – get up slowly from sitting or lying down. If you feel dizzy, sit back down immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… [Name of Lab], [Name of Neurologist]… got it. Hydrate… slow changes… Um… how long does the nerve test take? And… is it gonna hurt? I don’t really like needles, to be honest. And… what if they find somethin’ bad? I’m kinda nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions. The nerve conduction study typically takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on how many nerves they test. It does involve small electrodes being placed on your skin, and a mild electrical stimulation is used to measure the nerve signals. It's not usually painful, but you might feel a slight tingling or buzzing sensation. It's similar to a static shock, and it’s very brief. They'll minimize any discomfort as much as possible. As for finding something bad… we don't know what we’ll find yet, and it’s important not to jump to conclusions. If they do find any abnormalities, it doesn't necessarily mean it’s something serious. It just means we need to investigate further and determine the best course of action. We’ll discuss the results together in detail, and I'll explain everything clearly. We will come up with a plan. I want you to know that I'm here to support you throughout this process. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll answer any questions you have along the way. Do you feel comfortable scheduling those appointments, or would you like me to help you?
PATIENT: I… I think I can schedule ‘em myself. It’s just… a lot to take in, you know? Okay. So, hydrate, slow changes, schedule the tests… and don’t panic. Thank you, Dr. Condray. You’ve been… really helpful. I appreciate it. I think that’s all I need for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. And you’re right to take it one step at a time. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. We're here to help. And please, take care of yourself. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment, once we have the test results.
PATIENT: .
