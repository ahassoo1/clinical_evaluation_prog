DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just…chest hurt. And heart…jump-jump. Doctor say blood pressure high too. Old man problem, I think. Let’s get this over with, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic. I understand you’re having some chest pain and feeling like your heart is racing, and you know your blood pressure is high. We’ll get through this as efficiently as we can. When did this chest pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm…maybe two, three weeks now? Not every day. When I get…upset. Or after I eat big dinner. My wife, she makes good food. Too good, maybe. It’s not bad bad, you know? Just…uncomfortable. Like someone sitting on my chest. Not all the time, though.
DOCTOR: So, it comes and goes, triggered by stress or a large meal. And you describe it as pressure, like someone sitting on your chest. How long does it usually last when it happens?
PATIENT: Five…ten minutes? Sometimes longer if I really worry about it. Then it go away. I take my pills, the ones for pressure. They help a little. Not much, but a little. You know…old man things. Everything slow.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what pills are you taking for your blood pressure, Mr. Sobkowic?
PATIENT: Ugh. So many. Let me think… the white one…and the little blue one. And a yellow one too, I think. My wife gets them for me. She knows the doctor. I just… swallow. I don’t remember the names. Too much trouble. Do I need to remember? Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know the names, yes, so we can make sure you're on the right medications and dosages. But we can look it up. Do you have a list with you, or perhaps the bottles themselves?
PATIENT: No. I don’t carry pills around. My wife has them at home. I told you, she handles everything. She's very organized. Look, can we just…check my heart? Is it going to be a long wait? I have appointment with the gardener this afternoon. Very important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. We can certainly check your heart. It won’t be long. I just need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Then we can discuss what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…hurry, please. My time is valuable. And don’t tell me to exercise or eat less. I hear that enough.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just sit up on the table for me, please. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me, please.
PATIENT: Ugh. This thing always tight. Feels like… cutting off my arm. Is it high? Is it very high? My wife said it was bad last week. She worry too much. Everything is always a problem with her.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 95. I'm listening to your heart now. Breathing normally, please. I hear a slight murmur, but it's not new based on the records. And I do hear some… congestion in your lungs.
PATIENT: Congestion? What congestion? I don’t have congestion. I don’t cough! Maybe a little dust from the garden. That’s all. I work outside, you know. Fresh air. Not like inside with all the germs. Is it serious? Tell me straight. No beating around the bush. I don’t have time for long explanations.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking directly. The congestion could be from a number of things – allergies, a mild respiratory infection, or, potentially, something related to your heart. Given your chest pain, elevated blood pressure, and the congestion, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? EKG? More tests? Ugh. My wife is going to be so happy. She loves tests. I just want a pill, Doctor. One pill to fix it. Is that too much to ask? Fine. Do the tests. But make it quick. I have a life, you know. And tell them not to poke me too much. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. I've ordered the X-ray and EKG. The nurse will be in shortly to take you down for those tests. It shouldn't take too long. While we wait, can you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? What do you want to know? I eat. My wife cooks. She makes everything. Rice, soup, meat… sometimes fish. She likes fish. It’s… normal food. I don’t know what else to tell you. It’s not like I eat dirt or something. Are you suspecting something? This is ridiculous. Just check my heart and give me a pill. That’s all I need. .
