DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Just... a cough. Been coughin' up stuff. Not good stuff. Got… red in it. I smoke, so… I dunno. Just want it checked. Quick as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some redness in the mucus, and you smoke. I understand wanting to get this checked out quickly. No problem at all, we’ll do our best. First, let’s talk a little more about this cough. How long have you had it?
PATIENT: Long…? Seems like… a while now. Maybe a couple months? Hard to say for sure. I don’t really… keep track. Gets worse when I… you know, when I’m doin’ stuff. Like, movin’ around. Or when it's cold. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A couple of months, and it worsens with activity and cold weather. That gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned it’s not just any stuff you're coughing up – it’s red. Is it bright red, like fresh blood, or more of a darker, rusty color?
PATIENT: Uh… it's… not bright bright. More… kinda dark. Rusty, yeah, that’s a good word. Like old metal, I guess. Not a lot of it, usually. Just… enough to worry me. It ain't happened every time I cough, just… sometimes. Mostly in the mornin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker, rusty-colored mucus, mostly in the mornings, and not with every cough. Thank you for being so specific, Mr. Reyno – that’s very helpful. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. I get… tired, easy. More than usual. And… sometimes a little short of breath. Not all the time, but when I walk up hills, definitely. Does that count? I ain't been feelin' great, overall.
DOCTOR: Yes, fatigue and shortness of breath absolutely count. Getting tired easily and feeling winded going uphill… Alright. Now, have you had a fever at all?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t taken my temperature or nothin'. I just… feel warm sometimes, but that could be the weather. Or just… me. I don’t usually get sick, you know? Not like a real fever, with chills and all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent fever, chills, or significant sickness. Let's talk about your past medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems… I don’t think so. Doctors always told me I was okay. Just… regular check-ups. I’ve had a little trouble with my… heart, a few years back. But that’s been taken care of. They gave me some pills for it. Nothing else, really. I don’t remember nothin’ about lungs.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some heart trouble in the past, treated with medication, but no known lung issues. And you said “a few years back” - do you remember roughly when that heart issue was diagnosed?
PATIENT: Uh… jeez. Time… slips my mind. Maybe… ten years ago? Maybe a little more. It was before… before my mom got sick. That was… a long time back. I ain’t good with dates, sorry. It was just a little somethin', they gave me pills and told me to take 'em. I still do.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Reyno. Don’t worry about the dates; we’re getting what we need. You’re taking medication for a past heart issue. Do you know the name of that medication, or could you tell me what it looks like?
PATIENT: Uh… looks like… a little white pill. Round. That’s all I remember. I take it every day. The doctor just tells me to keep takin' it. I don't bother with names, it just goes in my mouth. Sorry. I don’t really like messin’ with pills and stuff. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can look it up based on your pharmacy information if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a reaction to nothin'. Mom used to give me all sorts of stuff when I was little, and I never got sick. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but that’s it. I don't think I'm allergic to nothin'. Can we just… get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you'd like to get this consultation moving, I understand. Alright. And just to finish up with your history, do you smoke currently?
PATIENT: Yeah, I smoke. Been smokin’ a long time. Don’t smoke as much as I used to, but… still do. Bad habit. I know. Just… helps with the stress. What else do you need to know? I'm gettin' tired of talkin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, you currently smoke, and it helps with stress. Thank you for being honest, Mr. Reyno. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it done. I don't like bein' poked and prodded, but… if you gotta. Hurry, though. I got stuff to do. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, and your heart sounds a little… distant. Nothing terribly alarming at this point, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now I'm going to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is 92%. That’s a little on the lower side of normal. Given your cough, the red mucus, your smoking history, the wheezing I heard, and your slightly low oxygen level, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Lookin’ inside…? I don’t know. Does it hurt? I don’t like machines. I ain’t good with all that stuff. What will it show? And how long will it take? I really need to get goin’. Is it really necessary? I just thought it was a bad cough.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Reyno. An X-ray doesn’t hurt at all. You simply stand or sit while a machine takes a picture of your chest. It doesn't involve anything going inside your body. It's a quick, painless procedure. It will show us what's going on in your lungs – if there’s any sign of infection, inflammation, or other problems that could be causing your cough and the red mucus. Given your smoking history and the findings of the exam, it's the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on, and rule out anything serious. It usually takes just a few minutes to perform, and we should have the results within a couple of hours. I want to be thorough and make sure we’re not missing anything important. Do you think you’d be willing to proceed with the X-ray?
PATIENT: …Couple of hours…? Fine. Okay, fine. Just… get it over with. But if it takes any longer than a couple of hours, I'm leavin'. And I don't want no needles or nothin'. Just a picture. Promise? Just… get it done quickly. I got things to do, remember? And tell me when I can leave. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Just a picture, no needles. I promise. And we’ll aim for a quick turnaround – under two hours. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are in. Okay, let's head over to the X-ray room. I’ll walk you over there and explain the process to the technician. Before we go, do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. Seriously. Let's go. No more talkin'. I need to get back to work. The sooner I get this done, the sooner I can leave. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's go then.
PATIENT: .
