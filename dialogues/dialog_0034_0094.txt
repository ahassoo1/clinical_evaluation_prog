DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. Doctor Seil, right? Yes. My husband… he said I should come. Something about… learning things? I don’t really remember. It’s just a check-up, I think? He worries too much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s good your husband encourages you to prioritize your health. A general check-up is a wonderful idea. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Lately? Hmm. Work is… work. Lots of metal. Cutting, bending… it’s loud. And hot. I’m always tired, I guess. But everyone is tired, no? Nothing wrong wrong. Just… normal tired. My hands hurt sometimes, but that’s from the metal. I don’t know what you want me to say.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Fontanazza. It sounds like your work is physically demanding. We'll definitely take that into account. When you say “tired,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it…? Like… heavy. My eyes feel heavy. And my legs. Even when I sleep, I don't feel… rested. Like I could sleep for a week and still be tired. Is that… normal? I don't know what normal is anymore. It's been like this for… a long time, I think. Maybe months? I lose track.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good information. Feeling persistently tired, even after sleep, is something we should investigate further. You mentioned this has been going on for months. Has anything changed in your life recently that might be contributing to this, even something seemingly small?
PATIENT: Changed…? Not really. Husband’s the same. Work is the same. Same house, same everything. Oh! We did get a new neighbor. Loud music sometimes. But that’s not… important, is it? I don't think so. Everything is just… the same. Boring, even. I eat, I sleep, I work. Repeat. That’s my life. Is this a waste of time? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It's not a waste of time at all, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes for your fatigue, even if things seem consistent in your daily life. Let's talk about your diet for a moment. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Diet…? I eat. Husband cooks. Usually rice. And… meat. Sometimes vegetables. He tries to make me eat healthy. I don’t really pay attention. It all tastes the same. We have… dumplings sometimes. And noodles. I drink tea. Lots of tea. Is that enough information? I don’t measure things. I just… eat what he gives me. He worries too much about everything. .
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And you mentioned drinking a lot of tea – what kind of tea do you usually drink?
