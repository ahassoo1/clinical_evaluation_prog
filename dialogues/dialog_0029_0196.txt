DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for a while now, I think. Honestly, it’s hard to say how long. Everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tired" is pretty broad. Can you tell me a little more specifically what that feels like?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's… not just needing a nap, you know? It's like… dragging myself through mud all the time. Even after I sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. And everything… everything just takes so much effort. Even simple things. I don't know, it's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first start noticing this… dragging feeling?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It feels like… after my husband passed, maybe? It's all a bit mixed up. A few years, I guess? Definitely after… everything. I'm sorry, I’m not very good with dates. It just… slowly got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few years ago, after your husband passed. That gives us a starting point. And has anything else changed around the same time, or even since then?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my appetite isn't what it used to be, that's for sure. I don’t really feel hungry much anymore. And I seem to be… losing weight, I think? I haven’t weighed myself in ages, though. Medicare pays for that, right? Does this clinic do weights? I mean, weigh you… not weights to lift.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can definitely weigh you today. We’ll get that done in just a moment. So, loss of appetite and weight loss along with the tiredness… Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms… Sometimes I get a bit dizzy, especially when I stand up too quickly. And… oh, yes! My muscles ache, just a general ache, all over. Not like a specific injury, just… sore. It's hard to explain. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness when standing and general muscle aches. Let's get a bit more detail. When you get dizzy, how long does it last?
PATIENT: Just a few seconds, usually. Long enough to make me grab onto something, you know? It doesn’t happen every time I stand, just sometimes. It's… annoying, mostly. I’m careful now, try to move slowly. And the aches… they’re just… there, all the time. A dull kind of pain. I take some over-the-counter stuff sometimes, but it doesn't really help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or any problems with urination?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking! Um… well, things haven’t been… regular, I guess. A bit… backed up, sometimes. And I go to the bathroom more often at night than I used to. But I thought that was just… old age! Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, changes in bowel habits and increased nighttime urination. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Hmm… I had… the usual, I suppose. High blood pressure, years ago. They put me on medication for it, but I stopped taking it a while back. I didn't really like how it made me feel. And… arthritis in my knees, but that’s just getting old, I think. Nothing major, really. I don’t really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago. That's about it, I think. I really don't remember much about them, to be honest. It was all so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My husband had heart trouble, that’s why he… well, that’s why he’s gone. And my mother… she had diabetes. I think. It was a long time ago. I don't really keep track of those things. Not much family left, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, just the arthritis cream sometimes. And… occasionally some ibuprofen for the aches. Not every day, though. Just when it's really bad. I try not to take too much. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. And that arthritis cream doesn't really seem to do much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes with certain perfumes, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I don’t really have much trouble with allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone now, as I said. I used to work at the pharmacy, but I retired a few years ago. Mostly I just stay home, read, watch TV. I don't get out much anymore. It's quiet, mostly. Not a lot going on. I try to eat healthy, but… like I said, my appetite isn't very good. I take walks around the block sometimes, but not very often. It's just… hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And I want to feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just… try not to take too long, alright? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a little distant. No murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are normal. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but slightly distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Everything seems… unremarkable, but your blood pressure is a bit high, and your abdomen feels a little full. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better idea of what’s going on. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid levels, kidney function, liver function, and electrolytes. And a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Blood work is fine. As long as it doesn't take too long to get the results, Doctor. I'm not good at waiting. Is it going to be a long time?
DOCTOR: The lab usually gets the results back within 24 to 48 hours. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild diuretic to help lower your blood pressure. We can also discuss your diet and exercise, but let’s get these blood results back first. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. A diuretic, alright. As long as it doesn’t make me… need to go to the bathroom all the time. Because that would be… inconvenient. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Can I… go now?
DOCTOR: The diuretic is a low dose, so it shouldn't cause too much trouble. But if you do experience any side effects, please call the office immediately. Yes, you can go now. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results of your blood work. If anything changes or gets worse before your appointment, don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Licano.
