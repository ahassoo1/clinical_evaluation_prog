DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, to be honest, it’s a little difficult for me to recall precisely. My… my solicitor suggested I come. Something about making sure my wishes are… documented? I believe it has to do with future medical care, should… should something happen. I’m hoping to get one of those forms… an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form, I was told. I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds as though your solicitor has advised you to establish an Advance Directive and perhaps a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, or POLST form. These are excellent steps to take, ensuring your healthcare preferences are known and respected. To best assist you, let's gather some information. First, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, um… overall health. Well, I am quite tall, as you can see – six feet, actually. And rather thin, I suppose. I work with… etching, mostly. Very detailed work, which keeps me focused, but can be… taxing on the hands. I don’t recall any major illnesses, thankfully. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, though I do get rather tired sometimes. A bit forgetful, if I’m being honest. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m afraid details… escape me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Buoniconti. Six feet and a slender build. And you mentioned etching – detailed work that can be taxing on your hands, and some fatigue and forgetfulness. We’ll certainly address those concerns as well. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That’s… difficult. I truly don’t remember much, Doctor. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose – measles, mumps… things of that nature. But nothing significant that I can recall. I’ve not been hospitalized… not that I remember, anyway. I did see a doctor regularly for a time, some years ago, but for what… I simply cannot say. It was… before the divorce, I believe. Would it help if I spoke to my solicitor? Perhaps he has records? I feel rather… inadequate not being able to provide you with more information.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. Memory can be unreliable, and it’s not uncommon for patients to have difficulty recalling details from the past. Your solicitor’s records would be very helpful, should you wish to pursue that. We can certainly work with whatever information you can provide. For now, let's move on to past surgical history. Have you ever undergone any operations or had any major procedures performed?
PATIENT: Surgical history… No. I am quite certain I haven’t. I… I have a distinct recollection of avoiding hospitals whenever possible. I don't believe I've ever been under anesthesia. I was always rather… squeamish, you see. Not that I have any particular aversion to doctors now, of course. It’s just… the idea of being unconscious… unsettling. I believe I’ve been fortunate in that regard. No surgeries, to the best of my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's good to know. Now, let's discuss family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… another difficult area, Doctor. My family… we weren't very close. My parents… they are both deceased, and I didn’t have much contact with them later in life. I know my mother… suffered from headaches, often quite severe, but beyond that… I truly don’t know. I didn’t discuss medical matters with them. And I have no siblings, so there’s no one to ask. I’m afraid I’m a rather isolated case, in that regard. No known family history of significant medical conditions, if that’s any help. It’s just… a blank, really. I apologize for my uselessness.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconta. It’s not always possible to have a complete family medical history, and it’s understandable that you don't have that information. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with a special meal, but very infrequently. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I find… concentration is best maintained with a clear mind. I’ve always been… rather disciplined in that regard. I have a small studio, where I work. It’s quiet, peaceful. And I spend a great deal of time… lost in my work. Not a very exciting life, perhaps, but it suits me. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and absolutely no drugs. I hope that’s… satisfactory, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is very satisfactory, Ms. Buoniconta. It's good to know. Finally, let's discuss allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t believe so. I’ve never experienced any… severe reactions to anything. I recall a mild rash once, many years ago, but I don’t recall what caused it. And I'm certain I haven't had any issues with medications. I've only taken… over-the-counter remedies for minor ailments, really – aspirin, perhaps, or something for a cold. No known allergies to medications, food, or anything else, to the best of my knowledge. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It's… frustrating, not being able to recall more details. Perhaps my solicitor does have something useful.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Ms. Buoniconta. It's completely understandable that you don't recall every detail. And your solicitor’s records would certainly be helpful if you wish to share them. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Yes, I suppose so. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of… examinations. But if it’s necessary… then yes, proceed. I trust your professional judgment, Doctor. I'm merely… a bit apprehensive. Perhaps if you could explain what you’re doing as you go? That might… ease my nerves. Though I warn you, I tend to flinch easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconta. I will explain everything as I go, and we'll take things at your pace. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 120/80, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat appears clear, no signs of infection. Ears are normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, neurological function appears intact. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. However, I do notice you are quite thin, as we discussed. Is this weight loss intentional?
PATIENT: Unremarkable… That’s… good. Very good. Weight loss… No, not intentional. I… simply don’t have much of an appetite, I suppose. I become so engrossed in my work… I often forget to eat. And when I do, it’s usually something small, easily consumed at my studio. I’ve noticed the weight loss myself, of course, but I hadn’t given it much thought. It hasn’t… bothered me, to be honest. Though I suppose it should be addressed. Is it… a concern, Doctor? I confess, I’m rather oblivious to such matters.
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of the weight loss. While not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, unintentional weight loss can be a sign of underlying issues. Given your fatigue and forgetfulness as well, I think it would be prudent to order some routine blood work to rule out any deficiencies or other medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… Yes, I suppose so. If it’s necessary to… rule things out, then yes. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of needles. But if it’s for the best… then proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Perhaps if you could explain the process beforehand? And… tell me what you’re looking for? I find it… reassuring to understand what’s happening. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a commission I’m working on, and I need to manage my time accordingly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconta. I understand your apprehension. The blood work is a relatively quick and painless procedure. We'll draw a small sample of blood from your arm, and it will take just a few minutes. We’ll be looking at a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and thyroid stimulating hormone to evaluate your thyroid function. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels, as deficiencies can cause fatigue. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if any further action is needed. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate more protein and nutrient-rich foods into your diet, even if you don't feel particularly hungry. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Two to three business days… I can manage that. And incorporating more protein… I suppose I could try. Though my meals are usually… rather small, easily consumed at my studio. But I’ll make an effort. And the results… you’ll contact me to schedule a follow-up appointment? I’ll need to clear my schedule. Very well. Let’s proceed with the blood work, Doctor. Though I warn you, I tend to flinch. And… try to be quick, if you would be so kind. Perhaps a distraction would be helpful? I find discussing my etching process… rather calming.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconta. We'll take things at your pace, and I'll be as quick as possible. And I would be very interested to hear about your etching process – it sounds fascinating. If you’ll have a seat here, I’ll have the phlebotomist come in shortly. She’s very skilled and gentle. And while you're waiting, perhaps you could tell me a bit about your work?
PATIENT: Very well. I specialize in… portraiture, mostly. Though I’ve also done landscapes and still lifes. I work with copper plates, etching the design with acid. It’s a… meticulous process, requiring great patience and precision. I often work from photographs, though I prefer to capture the essence of the subject, rather than a perfect likeness. It’s… a way of preserving a memory, I suppose. I use a variety of techniques – aquatint, drypoint, soft ground – to create different textures and effects. It’s… a rather solitary occupation, but I find it… deeply satisfying. I lose myself in the work, forgetting the world around me. I’ve been etching for… many years now. It’s… a passion, I suppose. Though it’s… rather difficult to explain. It's… visual. Perhaps seeing my work would be… more helpful. Do you… appreciate art, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I do indeed, Ms. Buoniconta. It sounds absolutely fascinating. The level of detail and precision you describe is truly remarkable. It’s wonderful that you have found such a fulfilling passion. I can certainly appreciate the solitude and focus it requires – it sounds very restorative. Ah, here’s Sarah, our phlebotomist. Sarah, this is Ms. Buoniconta. She’ll be needing a routine blood draw. As we discussed, she’s a bit apprehensive, so please take your time and be gentle. Sarah will explain the process. Just let me know if you have any questions or concerns. And perhaps while you’re getting your blood drawn, we can continue discussing your etching process. It sounds like a wonderful distraction.
PATIENT: Very well. Please… be gentle. And… I do tend to flinch. Perhaps if you could explain each step beforehand? I find it… reassuring to know what to expect. And… yes. Please do continue discussing my etching process, Doctor. It’s… a welcome distraction, indeed. I suppose it’s… better to focus on something… visual. It helps… to calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconta. I'll be right here, and we'll continue our conversation. And Sarah is very skilled, as I mentioned. She'll explain everything carefully. Sarah, perhaps you could start by explaining the process and showing Ms. Buoniconta the materials?
