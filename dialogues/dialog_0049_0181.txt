DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanted to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Proactive is good, yes. A very sensible approach. A full lab panel… right. And have you been experiencing any particular symptoms that prompted this, or is it purely preventative?
PATIENT: No symptoms at all, thankfully. Truly. I feel quite well, all things considered. My wife, Elena, she insisted, really. She's a very… thorough woman. Always looking out for my well-being. But I agreed, of course. It's good to have everything checked, even if nothing feels wrong. A little peace of mind goes a long way.
DOCTOR: Wives. Yes. Well, a thorough history is always beneficial. Let’s get some background then. Do you have any significant past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That’s a fair point about wives, Doctor! Elena will be pleased to hear you say so. As for medical problems… not really, no. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, living in Venezuela, but that was decades ago. Recovered fully. A few aches and pains, naturally – being a construction laborer for so long will do that to a man! – but nothing that ever required serious attention. No major surgeries, no chronic illnesses. I’ve been quite fortunate, I think.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia… yes. And any hospitalizations besides that bout of pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. That pneumonia was when I was maybe eight or nine years old. I haven’t been back in a hospital since. I’ve always prided myself on being… robust. Avoiding doctors as much as possible, if I'm honest! Elena doesn't approve of that last part, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. Yes. My father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life. High blood pressure, eventually needed a pacemaker. Mother was healthy as a horse until she was nearly ninety. She always said it was the arepas. No heart trouble on her side, but Elena’s mother… she struggled with diabetes. She wasn’t as careful with her diet as she should have been, I’m afraid. That's something Elena is very mindful of, and she keeps me on a rather strict regimen, to be perfectly frank.
DOCTOR: Heart disease, diabetes… noted. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. The cardiologist recommended it a few years back, as a preventative measure, given my father’s history. That’s it, really. I take it every morning with my coffee. And occasionally, if I have a bad headache, I’ll take some ibuprofen, but that’s rather infrequent. Mostly, I prefer a strong cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Aspirin… and ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. Elena always checks, of course, before I try anything new. She's very thorough, as I mentioned. I've eaten just about everything over the years – Venezuelan cuisine is quite varied! – and never had a reaction. No trouble with penicillin, no pollen allergies, no sensitivities of any kind. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, as well.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your lifestyle… do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My father smoked, unfortunately, and it caused him a great deal of trouble. I saw the effects firsthand, and it completely discouraged me. I enjoy a good cafecito and the occasional glass of wine with dinner, but that’s it. What about my alcohol intake is there anything specific you would like to know?
DOCTOR: Alcohol intake… Moderate. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Moderate is a fair assessment, yes. Perhaps a glass or two of wine with dinner three or four times a week. As for exercise… well, that’s where things get a little complicated. My construction work is physical, of course. Lifting, bending, carrying… it keeps me moving. But it’s not… structured exercise. I don't have a particular routine. I enjoy a leisurely walk with Elena on weekends, but that’s about it. I'm not a gym man, I'm afraid. I leave the gym to the young ones.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss the lab panel results when they come back. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I hope my knees aren’t too creaky this morning!
DOCTOR: Eyes appear clear. Ears are normal. Throat… a little dry. Lungs sound clear to auscultation, but with slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Heart rate is regular, but slightly rapid. Mild systolic murmur noted… likely benign, but will note it. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated. Okay, Mr. Mombrun. Your weight is 90 kilograms, and your height is 193 centimeters. BMI is… 22.8. Within the normal range. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I heard a mild murmur. We'll need to keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate the thoroughness. The blood pressure doesn’t surprise me much, to be honest. I do get a bit anxious at the doctor's office, and I suppose that could be it. The murmur… well, I hadn't noticed anything myself. Should we be concerned about it? And regarding the anxiety... is there anything I should do, or is it simply something to be aware of? Elena will certainly have an opinion on the matter, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: It’s likely just “white coat hypertension,” as we call it. We’ll repeat it later. As for the murmur… it's mild. It’s probably nothing, but we’ll do an EKG just to be safe. As for your anxiety... try to relax. And as for your wife, well, I am a doctor, not a marriage counselor. We'll get the lab work done, and we’ll review the results when they come back. It'll give us a clearer picture.
PATIENT: “White coat hypertension,” you say? Elena will be pleased to have a medical term for it! She always insists on knowing the precise terminology. I’ll try to relax, Doctor, I truly will. Perhaps a stronger cafecito beforehand next time. And you're right to avoid marital counseling. She’s a very capable woman. Very well. An EKG sounds sensible. Let’s proceed with the lab work, then. When can I expect the results? And is there anything I should be doing or avoiding beforehand – fasting, avoiding certain foods, that sort of thing?
DOCTOR: You’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, just water. As for the results… it usually takes about 48-72 hours, depending on the lab. We’ll call you when they’re back. We'll get the nurse to set you up for the EKG. And please, try to relax during the exam. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. Fasting for 12 hours… noted. I’ll make sure to comply. And I’ll attempt to embrace a more relaxed demeanor during the EKG. Thank you for your thoroughness and your patience. I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns. And please, tell the nurse Elena sent you. It will make things considerably smoother.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. I'll make a note about your wife. Please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Next. .
