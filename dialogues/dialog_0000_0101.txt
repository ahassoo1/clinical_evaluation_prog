DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Popova, good afternoon. I'm Dr. Batara. So, you're 87 years young, which is… remarkable, frankly. But tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Remarkable, eh? Well, I try to keep myself active. It’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come… ooh, it's a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A headache, you say. At the back of the head, intermittent… “a bit of a bother” isn’t terribly specific, Mr. Popova. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Right, right, sorry 'bout that. I ain't one for makin’ a fuss, usually. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not like a throbbing thing. More like… pressure, you know? Like someone’s got a hand pressin’ on the back of my skull. And sometimes it goes all the way up the back of my neck a little bit. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: Pressure… alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think now… it started… oh, maybe a month ago? A little over, perhaps. At first it was just now and then, like after I’d been doin’ a lot of nails, bendin’ over the table all day. But lately it’s been happenin’ more often, even when I ain’t been workin’. That’s what worried me enough to come see you. I usually just tough it out, but… well, at my age, you start thinkin’ about things, don’t you?
DOCTOR: “Doing a lot of nails?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I’m a manicurist, Doctor. Been doin’ nails for… well, a long time now. Almost sixty years! I have a little shop downtown. Keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble. And, you know, folks always need their nails done. It’s a good life, mostly. But bendin’ over for hours… I reckon it can’t be good for the back of your head.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… right. And has anything changed recently with your work?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Same customers, same hours, same everything. I did switch to a new brand of polish a couple months back, a gel kind. Some young lady recommended it, said it lasts longer. It smells a bit stronger, maybe? I don’t know if that could be it. I usually have the window open, though, so there’s plenty of air. It's a lovely shade of coral, actually. Makes everyone’s hands look so pretty. But no, nothin’ else has changed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… no dizziness, no blurry vision. No nausea or anything like that. I haven't been feelin' any different, really. Just tired sometimes, but that's to be expected, isn't it? At my age. No fever, no stiff neck, nothin' like that. Just… the headache. And a little bit of worry, I suppose. It’s just… it feels different this time. Usually a little rest fixes things, but it’s not goin' away like it used to.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had high blood pressure for a bit, years ago. The doctor put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped takin' it after a while. It made me feel a bit sluggish, and it wasn’t botherin’ me too much. I haven't been back to see a doctor regularly since then, to be honest. Just go to the chemist when I need somethin'. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ like that. And I've never had any major surgeries or anything. I’m a pretty healthy man, all things considered. I always eat my vegetables, you know? My wife makes sure of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of… headaches, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Now that's a good question. My mother used to get migraines something awful. Real bad ones. Couldn't get out of bed for days, she said. And my brother, he had a stroke a few years back, but he was a heavy drinker, so… I don’t know if that counts. No one else in the family that I can recall had headaches like hers, though. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? Not like the kind that knock you off your feet.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Popova, I think it’s best if I have a quick look at you. I'm going to check your reflexes, your vision, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just a routine check, to be sure. Could you sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Sit up straight, you say? No problem at all. I always try to keep good posture. My wife says it’s important for the back. Go ahead, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… normal. Not particularly brisk, but normal for your age. Ears look clear. Heart sounds… a little faint, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Blood pressure is 140/90. Elevated, but not alarmingly so. And your weight… 54 kilograms?
PATIENT: Yes, 54 kilograms. I'm a bit of a small man, always have been. I used to weigh more, but I lost a bit of weight after I retired. My wife worries about it, says I need to eat more. But I don't have much of an appetite these days. As long as I'm feelin' alright, that's what matters, isn't it? But, back to this headache... what do you think it could be, Doctor? I’m starting to worry it's something serious.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Popova, honestly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor? Go on. I’m listenin’. I understand you have other patients, and I don't want to take up too much of your time. But any thoughts at all would be greatly appreciated. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It’s just… unsettling, this headache.
DOCTOR: Given your history, your age, and the intermittent nature of the pain… it’s likely tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by your work. The new polish could be a factor, though I find that unlikely. However, given your weight and the slightly elevated blood pressure… and your mother’s history of migraines… I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of the head, just to rule out anything more serious. And I want you to start taking a daily multivitamin. It won't hurt. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? Oh dear. That sounds… rather involved. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. Complete blood count and… what was the other one? Basic metabolic panel, yes. And a multivitamin. Alright. I can do that. Will the scan be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it's nothing too serious, you understand. I've got a busy schedule with my shop and all…
DOCTOR: The CT scan is painless, Mr. Popova. You’ll lie on a table and a machine takes pictures. It’s quick. The results should be back in a few days. I'll have the nurse schedule you for it before you leave. In the meantime, try to manage your stress, get plenty of rest, and stay hydrated. And I’ll write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, just in case. If the headache gets significantly worse—severe, accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or confusion—go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Stress, rest, hydration. And if it gets worse, emergency room. Right. Pain reliever, good. That will be helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease just knowing what we're lookin' for. I'll go and see the nurse now to schedule the scan, then. Thank you again.
