DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Glowka. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…it’s my water. I just…can’t get it all out when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. It’s not painful, just…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with complete bladder emptying. That can certainly be frustrating. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It…happens most times, not every time, but most. I feel like I gotta go, and I go, but then it feels like there’s still some left. I have to…wait a little bit, and then try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. It’s…hard to explain. It’s not a strong urge, more like…a feeling of fullness that won't go away completely.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. So, it sounds like you’re not experiencing a strong urge to urinate, but more a sensation of incomplete emptying, and you often need to try again to feel fully relieved. And this has been happening for a “little while” – could you estimate how long?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…maybe six months ago? It was slow at first, barely noticeable. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s gotten worse the last couple of months, maybe two or three. Not suddenly, just…gradually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six months overall, with a noticeable worsening over the last two to three months. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me see. No pain, like I said. No fever. Sometimes…sometimes I feel a little weak after trying to go. Not all the time, just…sometimes. And…I get up a couple of times at night to go, maybe two or three times. That’s new too, wasn’t doing that before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain or fever, occasional weakness after attempting to urinate, and you’ve developed nocturia – needing to get up two to three times at night to urinate. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well…not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was okay now. Just gotta watch my salt, she said. Other than that…nothing much. I try to stay healthy, mostly fish and berries. My wife…she took care of most of the doctor stuff before she passed. I don’t remember much about it.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It’s understandable that you might not remember all the details. So, you had high blood pressure in the past, which is now controlled with diet. That's good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never been in the hospital, not even as a kid. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. My wife…she had her gallbladder out years ago, but that was her.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations for you. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like diabetes, kidney problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a hard one. My family…we didn’t talk much about that stuff. We were more about fishing and hunting than doctors. My father…he got old, that’s all I remember. My mother…she died young, from a sickness. I don’t know what it was. I don’t think anyone in my family had…prostate issues. My brothers…they were strong, healthy men.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you don’t have a lot of information about your family's medical history. That’s alright, we can still proceed. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints, sometimes. It’s called…glucosamine, I think? For my knees. And sometimes I take aspirin if I have a headache. That’s it. Nothing else. The doctor gave me the glucosamine, said it might help.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine for your knees as prescribed by a doctor, and aspirin as needed for headaches. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I eat all sorts of berries and fish, no problem. My wife…she was allergic to bee stings, but I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief neurological exam. We'll also check your blood pressure and pulse. Finally, I’d like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A…digital rectal exam? What does that involve, exactly? I’ve never had one of those before.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It involves a gloved, lubricated finger being inserted into your rectum to gently feel the size and shape of your prostate gland. It helps us assess for any enlargement or abnormalities. It can be uncomfortable, but it’s usually quick and provides valuable information. It’s a standard part of evaluating urinary symptoms in men. We can skip it if you’re truly uncomfortable, but it would help me narrow down the potential causes of your symptoms. It's important for ruling out some things. Would you like me to explain anything further, or would you prefer to proceed?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, I trust you, Doctor. If it’s important, I guess I can do it. It just…sounds unpleasant. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your willingness to proceed. It is generally not painful, but it can be uncomfortable, like a brief pressure. I will explain each step as I go, and you can let me know if you feel any significant discomfort at any time. Okay, let’s begin. If you could lie on your left side with your knees bent towards your chest, please. I'll get some lubricant and gloves. We’ll take it slowly.
PATIENT: Alright. It's alright. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber, I’m going to gently insert my finger into your rectum. I’m just feeling for the size and shape of your prostate. This will only take a moment. …Okay. Your prostate feels mildly enlarged, but not significantly hard or irregular. There is no obvious tenderness. Okay, that’s finished. It sounds like your prostate is slightly enlarged, which is common with age. Now, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for any infection, and a PSA blood test to get a better idea of your prostate health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test and a…urine test? That sounds alright. Is the blood test just to check my prostate, or other things too? I’m not a big fan of needles, you know.
DOCTOR: The blood test will include a PSA level specifically to assess your prostate. It will also include a basic metabolic panel which gives us information about your kidney function and overall health. We need that to make sure everything is functioning properly and rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. I understand your aversion to needles. It's common. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as quick and painless as possible. I'll write the orders for the urinalysis and PSA blood test now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. So, the prostate is a little big, that's why I can't empty my bladder? Is that what you’re thinking? And the tests will help you figure out if it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. An enlarged prostate can certainly contribute to difficulty emptying your bladder, by pressing on the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of your body. However, it’s not always the cause. Other things can contribute as well, like changes in bladder function or nerve supply. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and if any further investigation is needed. The PSA will give us a baseline, and the urinalysis will rule out infection. Depending on those results, we may consider a referral to a urologist – a specialist in urinary problems. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done. We'll discuss the results as soon as they're available, and formulate a plan based on those findings. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable. I just…want to get this figured out. It’s annoying, and I don’t want it to get worse. So, just the blood test and the urine test for now, then we’ll see what the doctor says?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just the blood test and the urine test for now. We’ll review the results together, and if needed, discuss the possibility of seeing a urologist. I’ll also recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as those can sometimes irritate the bladder. The nurse will be in shortly to explain the process for the blood draw and urine collection. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good for now. Thank you, Doctor Glowka. You explained everything very well. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. It’s important to me that you feel heard and understood. The nurse will be right in. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns once you leave. Have a good day.
