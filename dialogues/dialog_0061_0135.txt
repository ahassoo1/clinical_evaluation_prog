DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Gerhard. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Kimm. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because of my ear. It is… leaking something. A liquid, you see. It started a few days ago, maybe four. It is… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've been experiencing some discharge from your ear for about four days now, and it's causing you some trouble. Can you tell me a little more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Four days, I believe. The liquid… it is not… blood, thankfully. More… clear, but a little… yellowish. And sometimes, there is a small… smell. Not a bad smell, but… present. It is difficult to explain. And it makes my ear feel… full.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear or yellowish discharge with a slight smell and a feeling of fullness in your ear. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain, thankfully. Not a sharp pain, or a dull ache, nothing like that. Just… uncomfortable. Like something is inside. And… I do not hear as well from that ear. Not much, but… noticeable. Perhaps ten percent less? I do not know the exact number, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just discomfort and a decrease in hearing. About ten percent, you estimate. Have you had any fever, or any dizziness or ringing in your ear alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I checked myself this morning. And no dizziness. I walk straight, I assure you. And… no ringing. Not that I have noticed. Sometimes the house is noisy, you see. But not a ringing in the ear, no. It is just… the leaking, and the hearing. Those are the problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, dizziness, or ringing. That's helpful to know. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, injuries, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was a young man, in Somalia, I had… an infection. Many years ago. The doctor… he cleaned it with something. It was very painful. I do not remember much else. And… once, a bee flew into my ear! A very small bee. They removed it, thankfully. But nothing else. Just those two things, long ago. Is that… important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, an ear infection in your youth and a bee in your ear – both a long time ago. Yes, that's good information, thank you. Do you recall if you’ve had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, before this ear issue started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes! Now you mention it, I had a small cold. Perhaps a week before the leaking began. Just a little sniffle, you see. And a cough. But it went away quickly. I did not go to the doctor for it. Just rested and drank tea. It was… a small cold. Not like the flu, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold about a week before the ear discharge started. That could be related. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ear to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. I will… remain still. Just tell me if it will be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gerhard. This might be a little cool, and I’ll try to be as gentle as possible. Just let me know if anything feels painful. I’m going to gently pull your ear back and up a little. Okay… I see some redness inside your ear canal, and some fluid. The eardrum itself looks a little cloudy, but I don’t see any holes or major damage. It looks like you have fluid buildup in the middle ear, likely from some swelling. It's consistent with an ear infection, although the lack of pain is a bit unusual. I see some cerumen as well. I’m going to need to clear that out to get a better look.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds concerning. No pain is… strange, you are right. The wax… if it is blocking your view, please remove it. I want you to be able to see properly. I trust your expertise. Please, do what you need to do. Just… be gentle, if you would. It is… sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m going to gently flush your ear with some warm water. This might feel a little strange, a little full. Just breathe normally. Okay, that's much better. Now I can see the eardrum clearly. It’s still a little cloudy, and there’s definitely some inflammation. I don’t see any signs of a ruptured eardrum, which is good. It does appear to be a middle ear infection – otitis media, we call it. The fact that you don’t have a lot of pain could be because it's mild, or because you've already started to fight it off. Now, based on what I’m seeing, I think a course of antibiotics would be the best course of action. What are your allergies, if any?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… feels better, to have it cleaned. Thank you. Antibiotics… that sounds… sensible. Allergies… let me think. I had a reaction to… penicillin, many years ago. A rash, you see. Very itchy. And… I am not fond of shellfish. Not an allergy, but… it makes me unwell. I avoid it. Penicillin… that is the important one, I think. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy with a rash, and shellfish intolerance. That’s very helpful. We’ll definitely avoid penicillin then. I’m going to prescribe you amoxicillin – it’s a different type of antibiotic, and should be safe for you. We'll start with a 7-day course. I’m also going to recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, if you start to feel any discomfort. And try to keep your ear dry – avoid swimming and wearing earplugs for a few days. I also recommend gentle decongestants if you still have any nasal congestion. Do you have any questions about the medication, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin… seven days. I will… write that down. Keep it dry… that makes sense. And the pain reliever… if I need it. I believe I understand, Doctor. Just… one question. Will this… affect my hearing? I teach, you see. I need to be able to hear clearly. Will it return to normal? And… is this something… contagious? I do not want to share this with my students.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. It's unlikely to cause any permanent hearing loss. The fluid buildup is what's muffling the sound, and the antibiotics should clear that up. Your hearing should return to normal once the infection is gone, typically within a week or two of finishing the medication. And yes, it is contagious, though it's usually spread through close contact – things like coughing or sneezing. Being diligent about handwashing and avoiding close face-to-face contact with others will help prevent spreading it. It's especially important to be careful around your students. I'll also give you a work excuse note for a couple of days, to allow your body to rest. Do you have any other concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: A work excuse… that is… very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Handwashing… I will be very careful. And rest… yes, that is a good idea. No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have answered all my questions. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your kindness. Thank you for your help. I will… follow your instructions carefully.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, like severe pain, fever, or if your hearing doesn’t improve after finishing the antibiotics. I'll have the nurse print out the prescription and the work excuse note for you. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. Bula vinaka.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Kimm. I will. Bula vinaka to you as well. Goodbye.
