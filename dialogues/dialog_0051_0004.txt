DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's just for my shots, you know? Routine stuff. I figured it was time to get it taken care of. It’s been a while, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right, routine vaccinations. Good idea to stay up-to-date. It has been a while for many people, especially with everything going on these past few years. To make sure we get you the right ones, could you tell me a little bit about which shots you’re thinking of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's the thing… I don't really know. I just remember my husband said I was due for some boosters, and I figured this was a good time since we’re finally getting around to things. I haven't really kept track, to be honest. Is there a list somewhere of what folks my age usually need?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fornes. That’s perfectly alright – many people aren’t sure. We can definitely figure it out. I’ll pull up your record here... Hmm, it appears we have some notes from a visit about ten years ago, but it doesn’t detail specific vaccinations given. Okay. Generally, for someone your age, we’d consider tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis – that's Tdap – influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines. And depending on your history, potentially shingles as well. Do any of those names ring a bell?
PATIENT: Oh, those all sound familiar, vaguely. I think I had a tetanus shot… maybe when I was younger? And I get a flu shot every year, usually at the pharmacy. Pneumococcal… that one doesn’t sound right. And shingles… well, my Aunt Millie had that, and it looked awful. I haven’t had that one, I don’t think. Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, a yearly flu shot is excellent. And it's good to know you're aware of the shingles vaccine. It's recommended for most adults over 50, as the risk of shingles increases with age. It can be quite painful, as you mentioned with your Aunt Millie. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you've ever had the pneumococcal vaccine?
PATIENT: You know, I really can’t say for sure. I go to the doctor for checkups, and I get my flu shot, but I don’t usually pay attention to what shots I’m getting. I just let them do it, honestly. Is there a way to find out? Maybe in old records somewhere? I'm terrible with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Fornes. Many people don’t keep track. We can try to look at past records, but as you said, if they weren't documented thoroughly it may be difficult. Let’s do this: to be safe, and since you aren’t certain, I recommend we give you the pneumococcal vaccine today. It’s generally given as a one-time dose, and then a booster in five years. It helps protect against pneumonia and other serious infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmm. If it’s just the one shot now, and then one later, that sounds alright. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. I don’t want to get pneumonia, that’s for sure. Just let me know if it’s gonna be a painful one, okay? I’m not a fan of needles, but I’ll get through it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s not the most pleasant sensation, but it’s very quick. It’s usually a slight pinch in the upper arm. We can also put some numbing cream on beforehand if you'd like, to minimize discomfort. Okay, so we’ll go ahead with the pneumococcal vaccine today. Before we do that, just a quick check – do you have any allergies to any medications or vaccines?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m pretty lucky that way. I do get mosquito bites that swell up something awful, but I don’t think that counts as an allergy, does it? I've always just used calamine lotion on those.
DOCTOR: No, mosquito bites don’t count as an allergy in this case. Good to know you haven’t had any reactions to medications or vaccines. Okay, one last quick question before we proceed. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, every now and then. It’s called… let me think… Naproxen, I think. It’s an over-the-counter one, helps with the aches and pains. And sometimes I take vitamin D, especially in the winter. That’s about it, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen as needed for arthritis and vitamin D. That's good to know. Naproxen is an NSAID, so it’s good we are aware of that, though a single pneumococcal vaccine shouldn’t interact with it. Alright, Ms. Fornes, I think we have everything we need. Let’s go ahead and get this vaccine administered. I'll have the nurse prepare it, and she'll explain the possible side effects to you. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. Just… try to be quick, okay? I’m not a big fan of this whole thing, but I appreciate you taking the time to explain it all. I just want to get it over with and be protected.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fornes. I assure you, the nurse is very efficient. And we'll be as quick as possible. It really is a small inconvenience for a lot of protection. I’ll just step out for a moment while the nurse gets everything ready. She’ll be right in.
