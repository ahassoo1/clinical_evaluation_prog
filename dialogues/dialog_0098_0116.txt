DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Oh dear… what did bring me in? Let me see… It's my legs, mostly. They bother me at night. Cramp up something awful, they do. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. Not new, but… more frequent lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, leg cramps, especially at night, and they've been increasing recently. I see. Can you tell me a little more about the cramps themselves?
PATIENT: Well… they just hurt. A sharp pain, mostly in the calf, I think. Sometimes in the foot too. They come on suddenly, and I just have to… wait it out. I try to stretch them, but it doesn’t always help. It wakes me up, of course. My husband… he used to help me stretch, but… oh. It’s been a while since he…
DOCTOR: I understand. Sharp pain in the calf and sometimes the foot, comes on suddenly, wakes you up at night. And stretching doesn’t always provide relief. I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Bilstein. That must be difficult. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It is difficult. Time passes, I suppose. Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, my feet do get cold easily. And sometimes they feel a little… numb. Not all the time, just… occasionally. I don’t know if that’s related. I used to walk a lot, you know. But… not so much these days.
DOCTOR: Cold feet and occasional numbness…okay. And you mentioned you used to walk a lot, but aren't doing as much now. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… well, I eat less, I think. Not because I want to, you know, just… not as much appetite. And I get tired easier. A lot easier. Used to be I could be on my feet all day, but now… a little bit of gardening and I have to sit down. I don’t sleep as well either, now that I think of it. Those cramps don’t help, of course.
DOCTOR: Reduced appetite, increased fatigue, difficulty sleeping… and those nighttime cramps, of course. Okay. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Let me see… Doctor… I think I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you can see. But other than that… no, not that I recall. I try to stay healthy, you know. I drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the past and some vision issues. Do you take any medications currently, or have you had any recent surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, dear, no medications. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. And no, no other surgeries. Just the gallbladder, many, many years ago. I’m not a fan of doctors, you see. Only come when I have to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Bilstein. Many people feel the same way. And it's good you've been able to avoid needing medications. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. We didn't have much in the way of fancy foods when I was growing up, you see. Mostly fish and berries. I don't recall ever having trouble with those.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had problems with diabetes, heart disease, or problems with their circulation?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a hard one. My family… we didn’t talk much about health, not really. My mother, she… passed away young. I think it was a fever, but I wasn’t very old. My father… he was a fisherman. Strong as an ox, but he worked very hard. I don't recall him ever being sick, really. As for… diabetes or heart trouble… I don’t think so. But it was a long time ago, you see. We didn’t have doctors like we do now.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it’s difficult to recall much detail about your family's health history. That’s alright. One last question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no dear, not me. Never smoked a day in my life. And only a little sip of wine on special occasions. My husband… he liked a beer now and then, but not me. I prefer tea, you see. A nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, Ms. Bilstein, thank you for all that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your feet and legs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Well… alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. But please be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bilstein. I will be very gentle. Okay, let's start with your feet. I'm just going to feel for a pulse here… and here. Your pulses feel a little weak, Ms. Bilstein, but not alarmingly so. Your skin is a little dry, and I notice some mild discoloration on your toes. Now, I’m going to check the temperature of your feet. They are a little cooler than I'd like. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Finally, I’ll take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. Everything else seems within normal limits, but the weak pulses, cool feet, and elevated blood pressure are something we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear… elevated blood pressure? That doesn’t sound good. What does that mean, Doctor? And weak pulses… What could be causing all that? It's just my legs cramping, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're asking, Ms. Bilstein. Elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, means your heart is working a little harder to pump blood through your arteries. It’s fairly common, especially as we get older, but it’s important to manage. Weak pulses and cool feet can be related to circulation issues. Now, the leg cramps could be related, or they could be something separate. The combination of symptoms makes me think we should rule out a few possibilities. One is Peripheral Artery Disease, or PAD. It's a narrowing of the arteries in your legs, which can reduce blood flow and cause pain, cramping, and other symptoms. Another possibility is simply poor circulation due to age and inactivity. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your overall health and kidney function. I also want to order an Ankle-Brachial Index, or ABI, test. It’s a simple, non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. It helps us assess the blood flow in your legs. Would you be willing to do those tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… those sound like a lot of tests. Kidney function? What if something is wrong with my kidneys? And what about this… Ankle-Brachial Index? Is it painful? I don't like tests, Doctor. I always worry about what they'll find.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Bilstein. It’s natural to feel anxious about tests. We’re not necessarily looking for anything wrong, just gathering information to understand what might be causing your symptoms. The kidney function test is a routine check, and many people have perfectly normal results. It helps us rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. The Ankle-Brachial Index is completely painless. It just involves taking blood pressure readings on your arms and ankles using a cuff, just like we did today. It doesn't involve any needles or injections. It’s a very quick and simple test. I want to assure you that we'll discuss the results thoroughly, and we'll work together to create a plan that’s right for you. If the tests show something concerning, we'll discuss your options and refer you to a specialist if needed. But let's not worry about that right now. Let’s just focus on getting the information we need to make an informed decision. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… no needles? That's… good. I really don’t like needles. And you said it’s quick? Just blood pressure again? Well… alright, Doctor. If it’s just blood pressure, and it’s quick, I suppose I can do that. But please, no surprises. And you'll explain everything to me afterward, won't you? I worry easily, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bilstein. No needles, quick blood pressure readings on your arms and ankles, and I promise to explain everything to you afterward, in detail. I understand you worry easily, and I’ll make sure you’re fully informed every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for the routine tests and schedule you for the Ankle-Brachial Index. It can be done right here in the clinic. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend you try to stay as active as possible, within your comfort level. Walking is good, if you can manage it. And I also want you to monitor your blood pressure at home, if you have a cuff available. I’ll also give you a handout with some information about leg cramps, and some simple stretches you can try. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that's kind of you, Doctor. A handout… yes, that's good. I do have a blood pressure cuff, my son bought it for me last year. I don't use it much, though. I tend to worry about the numbers. And stretches… yes, I'll try those. But if my leg cramps get worse, should I call you?
DOCTOR: Yes, definitely. If your leg cramps get significantly worse, or if they are accompanied by any redness, swelling, or warmth in your leg, please call the office immediately. Also, if you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath, please call 911. We'll review the blood test results and ABI results at your follow-up appointment, which we'll schedule for about a week from today. In the meantime, please try to stay active, monitor your blood pressure, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Here's the handout about leg cramps. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I always worry so much about these things. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I'll just try to take things one step at a time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. That’s all the best approach – one step at a time. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the ABI test. Please don't hesitate to call if any questions come up before your appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. It was pleasant to meet you.
