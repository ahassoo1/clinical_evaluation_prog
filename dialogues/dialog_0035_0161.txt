DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? A friend mentioned something about… a way to really lower the risk, and I thought I should look into it. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but better safe than sorry, you know? It's about HIV prevention, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It’s very proactive of you to think about this, and you’re right – better safe than sorry. There’s no shame in wanting to protect your health. So, you're interested in learning about HIV prevention options?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. My friend said something about a pill you take… before things happen? Is that… PrEP? She used a lot of medical words, and I didn’t want to bother her again. I just want to understand if it’s right for me, and what it even is.
DOCTOR: Yes, PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Your friend is right – it’s a pill you take before potential exposure to HIV to significantly reduce your risk. It’s a very effective method of prevention. To see if it’s right for you, we need to talk a little bit about your risk factors and your overall health. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That makes sense. I… well, I haven’t been with anyone regularly in a long time, but you never know, right? And it’s good to be prepared, especially now. What kind of things do you need to know? I’m pretty open, just ask.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach. Okay, let’s start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any current medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, honestly. My knees ache a bit sometimes, the doctor says it’s just getting old. And I have some mild arthritis, but it's pretty well-managed with over-the-counter stuff. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. Medicare keeps a close eye on me, so they'd know if anything was really wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and arthritis noted. And that’s good Medicare is keeping an eye on things. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections - STIs?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of, anyway. I… wasn’t very active in my younger years, and I’ve been pretty careful since. It’s something I always thought about, though. I’m glad you're asking, it's good to be thorough.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had a test for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one a few years back, maybe five or six years ago? It was negative. I think it was through my primary care doctor, just a routine thing. I can’t remember exactly when, though. I get a lot of tests done, you know, with getting older. They all start to blur together after a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, a negative HIV test five or six years ago. Good. And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis cream for my knees, and a multivitamin every day. Nothing else, really. I try to eat healthy, so I don’t need much. And I always check with the pharmacist if anything new comes along, just to be safe. I don't want anything to interact with each other.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I've never had to worry about allergies, luckily.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Helaina, this is good information. Before we talk about PrEP specifically, and whether it's a good fit for you, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline of your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s good to know everything is working alright, even if I feel okay. Do you need me to change into a gown or anything?
DOCTOR: No gown needed today. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a brief exam. It will only take a few minutes. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. 130/80. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning, given your age. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Some mild tenderness to palpation of both knees, consistent with arthritis. Range of motion is slightly limited. Everything sounds and feels pretty good overall. Just the expected findings with a little bit of arthritis.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s reassuring to hear. I figured my knees would be the worst part. So, about this PrEP… is it something I’d have to take every day, or just when…? I'm trying to figure out if it would fit into my routine, you know? And are there any… side effects? I’ve heard some things.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question. PrEP is most effective when taken consistently, ideally daily. There are now different formulations, including one that can be taken “on demand” before and after sexual activity if you don't take it every day. It requires more planning though, and it’s important to follow the schedule carefully for it to be effective. As for side effects, most people have very few. The most common are mild, like nausea, diarrhea, or headache, especially in the first few weeks. These usually go away on their own. Rarely, there can be more serious side effects, like kidney problems, but we would monitor you closely with regular blood tests to catch anything early. Before we start, we would also need to do a blood test to confirm you’re HIV negative and check your kidney function. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot more sense. The daily pill sounds… easier, honestly. Less to remember. And the blood tests are fine, I get those done all the time anyway. So if I'm taking it daily, would I have to come in regularly to make sure everything's okay? How often? I just… I don't want any surprises, you know? I’m getting too old for surprises. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. If you choose to start PrEP, we'd schedule blood tests every three months for the first year, then every six months after that, to monitor your kidney function and screen for any other sexually transmitted infections. We'll also discuss safe sex practices and any potential risks. It’s important to have a check-in with me regularly as well, just to make sure you're tolerating the medication and have no concerns. Do you feel comfortable moving forward with the blood tests today, to see if PrEP is a good fit for you?
