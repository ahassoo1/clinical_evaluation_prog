DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Or, Delron, if you prefer. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Delron is fine. Look, I need a check-up. For the… the army thing. They want me to get this exam done before I can even think about signing up. Don’t see why they need to bother with all this, but rules are rules, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right, the army… a pre-enlistment physical. Yes, perfectly understandable. They’re quite thorough, as you’ve likely heard. Okay. Let’s start with the basics then. Can you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What do you mean, "bit"? I work. Hard work, building engines. Been doing it since I was a young man. I don’t sit around feeling sorry for myself, if that’s what you’re asking. I eat, I sleep, I work. Never really been sick, not properly sick, you know? A bit of a cold now and then, but nothing a bit of strong tea can't fix. Honestly, seems like a waste of time to be asking me this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Delron. It does feel like a lot of questions when you’re feeling well. But it’s important for us to have a complete picture. Just helps us make sure everything is as good as it seems, and to identify anything we might need to address before you start, if anything comes up. Okay. Let's try this... any major illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses? No. Nothing major. Like I said, a cold. Maybe the flu once, a long time ago. My wife gets a bit worried about everything, always telling me to take vitamins and whatnot. But I'm a strong Swedish man, I can handle a bit of sniffles. No hospitals, no… what do you call them… specialists. I don't do specialists. Is this going to take long? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major illnesses, that’s good to know. And you’ve been avoiding specialists, which is perfectly your prerogative. We're just covering all bases here. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. What would I need surgery for? I build things with my hands, I don’t have things taken apart. Seems a bit daft to go and get cut open unless it's absolutely necessary. My wife suggested getting my eyes looked at once, thought I might need glasses. But I told her I could see perfectly fine. Are you questioning my fitness, doctor?
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all, Delron. I’m not questioning anything. It's just a standard part of the exam, asking about your medical history. A lot of people have procedures they’ve had done over the years, and it's helpful to know. Okay… then, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father, he was… strong. Worked on the boats, mostly. Lived a long life, I suppose. My mother, she had… aches, when she got older. Just old age stuff, I think. Nothing exciting. No one had anything… serious, you know? No heart trouble, no cancers, nothing like that. Mostly just… people living normal lives. My wife's side, I don't really know them well enough to say. She worries a lot, so probably thinks everyone’s got something. Is this really important? It feels like you're fishing around for problems that aren’t there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major illnesses in the family, that’s helpful. I understand your frustration, Delron, and I'm trying to be as efficient as possible. Just want to rule things out. Okay, last bit of history before we do a quick physical… Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat pretty much everything. Sometimes my wife makes me eat these… strange things, full of vegetables. But I don't react to them, if that’s what you mean. No hives, no swelling, nothing. I’ve never had to go to the hospital for an allergy. Never needed to. Honestly, doctor, I think I’m wasting my time here. This is all very… unnecessary. Can we just get on with it? I need to know if I’m fit enough for the army, not talk about vegetables.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. I understand your impatience. No allergies, good. Let’s move on to a physical exam then. Just a quick check of your vitals and a listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn't take long. If you could just hop up on the table for me, please.
PATIENT: Hop up on the table? Is that really necessary? I feel perfectly fine standing. Are you going to poke and prod me? Honestly, I don’t see the point of all this. But… alright, fine. Get it over with. But don't expect anything exciting. I’m a strong man, remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, you mentioned that. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is… 130 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. Nothing alarming, but we'll make a note of it. Lungs are clear. Now, just going to take a look in your ears… Ears look clear. Now, can you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: What's the matter now? Everything's fine. I told you, I’m a strong man. No cavities, no swelling, no… whatever you're looking for. Just get on with it. This is ridiculous. My wife makes me brush my teeth twice a day, I assure you. Are you going to check my reflexes or something? Because I’m a very quick thinker, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything appears normal so far. Yes, I’m going to check your reflexes now. And just a quick assessment of your range of motion. Reflexes are normal, and your range of motion appears good. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: There. See? Perfectly fine. Strong as an ox. No problems whatsoever. You’re wasting your time, doctor. Honestly, I could be out lifting weights right now. So? What’s the verdict? Am I fit enough to join the army, or what? Don’t tell me you need to poke around some more.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. Physically, you are quite strong, as you’ve pointed out. However, I did detect a slight heart murmur, and your blood pressure is a little elevated. While not immediately disqualifying, these things do warrant further investigation before you start intensive physical training. I would recommend an EKG and possibly a consultation with a cardiologist, just to be on the safe side. We need to rule out anything serious before you put your body through the demands of army service.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Are you serious? For a slight murmur? My father had a murmur, lived to be eighty! This is just… ridiculous. You're trying to find something wrong where there isn't anything wrong. I don't need specialists, I told you that. I’m a strong Swedish man! Intensive training won't hurt me, it'll make me stronger! Look, I need this exam signed off. I have things to do, a life to get on with. Are you going to sign the form, or do I need to find another doctor? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Delron, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional responsibility to ensure your health and safety. I can't, in good conscience, sign off on this exam without addressing these findings. While your father's history is relevant, it doesn't eliminate the need for a proper evaluation. A cardiologist can provide a definitive answer, and it's a relatively simple test. I am concerned about the potential risks of ignoring these issues. We're talking about your long-term health, Delron, and pushing yourself too hard with an underlying condition could be dangerous. I can provide you with a referral to a local cardiologist, and we can revisit this exam once we have the results. I’m not trying to impede your progress, but I need to be sure you are healthy enough for this level of physical activity.
PATIENT: You're making a big deal out of nothing. Absolutely nothing. I’ve lived a full life, worked hard, been strong my whole life. A simple murmur isn’t going to stop me. Look, if you won’t sign the form, then fine. I'll find a doctor who understands that a man can take care of himself. You’re just trying to get me to spend money on unnecessary tests. This is ridiculous. I’m wasting my time here. Don't expect me to come back. And frankly, I’ll be telling everyone what a waste of time this clinic is.
