DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Georgiou. Well, my wife and I were talking, and… honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I wanted to get tested for… you know… the HIV thing. Just to be safe, really. It's better to know, isn't it? Though, I highly doubt I have it. I'm a pretty careful person.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Jacquille, and you’re absolutely right – it is always better to know. It takes courage to come in and get tested, and I commend you for taking that step. And being careful is excellent. Just to clarify, is there anything specific that made you think about getting tested now?
PATIENT: Specific? Not really. It’s just… well, you hear things, don’t you? Stories. And my wife, she’s… a worrier. She suggested it, and frankly, it put the idea in my head. It’s probably nothing, but she gets anxious about everything. I just want to reassure her, and myself, I suppose. It’s really just a formality, if you ask me. I eat well, don't go around… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like this is primarily for peace of mind, and to ease your wife’s anxieties, which is a very thoughtful thing to do. And it's always good to be proactive about your health, even if you don’t have specific concerns. Okay. So, just to get a good history, have you ever had any previous HIV tests?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven’t really needed to, have I? I mean, I’ve been married for ten years, very happily, and before that… well, let’s just say I wasn't exactly running around with a lot of people. It’s not something I’ve ever considered before this. Honestly, it feels a bit ridiculous, going through all this for something that’s so… unlikely. But my wife...she's very insistent.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound ridiculous at all, Jacquille. Everyone has different levels of comfort and concern, and it’s wonderful that you’re willing to address your wife’s worries. And it’s perfectly reasonable to not have considered it before now if you haven’t had any specific risk factors. Okay. And just to be thorough, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Right. Well, nothing major. I had chickenpox as a kid, standard stuff. Broke my arm once falling off a bicycle. No serious illnesses, no hospital stays, nothing like that. I get a yearly check-up with my GP, all normal results. Blood pressure’s fine, cholesterol’s good. I take a multivitamin, that’s it. I’m generally very healthy, as I said. I'm a pretty active person, I enjoy hiking in the hills when I have the time. I’m Medicare eligible, of course, being my age. Does that cover all the usual stuff? I wouldn't want any surprises with the bill.
DOCTOR: That’s all very good to know, thank you. It sounds like you take excellent care of yourself. Hiking is fantastic! And yes, Medicare should cover the HIV test with no issues. We'll double-check everything with the billing department, but I don’t anticipate any problems. Now, just to complete the picture, are there any allergies I should be aware of – medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Not a single one. I eat everything, I take most medications without issue. My wife always tries to get me to take more vitamins, but I’m fine as I am. I'm not one of those people who’s sensitive to everything. Honestly, I think she worries too much. But, to answer your question, no allergies. None whatsoever. It’s one of the few things I don’t have to worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No allergies is always good to hear. Okay, Jacquille, so to recap, you’re here for HIV testing primarily for peace of mind and to reassure your wife. You have no previous HIV tests, no known allergies, and you generally enjoy good health. You take a multivitamin and have a yearly check-up with your GP. Is that all accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… perfectly accurate, yes. You’ve got it all down. You’re a very thorough doctor, I must say. Though, I still maintain this is a bit unnecessary, but my wife will be pleased you’re being so careful. She’ll probably want to know everything you’ve written down, too. She’s like that. Very… meticulous. Can we just get on with the test now? I have a few things I need to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I'm glad I've captured everything accurately. And yes, meticulous is good! I completely understand wanting to get this done quickly, and we certainly can. Before we proceed with the test, I just want to briefly explain the process and what to expect. We'll do a simple blood draw. It’s a standard test, and the results usually take a few days to come back. And of course, everything will be kept completely confidential. Do you have any questions before we move forward?
PATIENT: No, not really. Blood draw is blood draw. I’ve had those before. A few days is… acceptable, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take weeks. And confidential, yes, that’s important. My wife knows I’m here, of course, but… well, it’s a personal matter, isn’t it? Is there anything I need to do beforehand? Fasting, or anything like that? I hate those sorts of things. I had to fast for twelve hours for my cholesterol test last year, it was dreadful.
DOCTOR: No fasting required, thankfully! You can eat and drink as normal. And yes, you're right, it is a personal matter, and your privacy is paramount. We'll make sure everything is handled with the utmost discretion. Okay, great. Let’s head over to the examination room, and we can get the blood draw done. It will only take a few minutes. I’ll need you to roll up your sleeve, and we'll get started. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Right. Good. No fasting is excellent news. And yes, my left arm is usually better, I think. I had a blood pressure test on my right arm last week, and it was a bit sore afterwards. Though it's probably nothing, I just… prefer my left arm, if that’s alright. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have a meeting this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late. Hopefully, it won’t take long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, your left arm is perfectly fine. And we’ll be as quick as possible, I promise. If you could sit here on the examination table, please. And just relax your arm. We'll use a standard tourniquet to help locate the vein. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Okay, this might sting for a moment, but it will be very quick. I'm going to insert the needle here… Alright, all done! Just apply gentle pressure to this spot for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. And that's it! The sample will be sent to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. We’ll contact you as soon as we have them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Right. That wasn’t so bad, was it? A little pinch, but nothing major. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… when you said a few days, is that business days, or calendar days? My wife will be asking, you see. She’s very precise about these things. And will the results be sent to me directly, or should I expect a phone call? I suppose a phone call is easier, as she tends to overanalyze everything in writing.
DOCTOR: No, it wasn't bad at all! And yes, "a few days" means business days. So, we should have the results back to you by the end of next week, most likely. And we'll definitely give you a phone call with the results. That way, we can discuss them together and answer any questions you might have. It's always better to talk things through, especially if you're concerned, and I understand your wife prefers a conversation. We won't send anything in writing unless you specifically request it. Is there a particular time of day that would be best to reach you?
