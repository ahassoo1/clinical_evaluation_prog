DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, I must say, this clinic is… rather out of the way, isn’t it? But never mind that. I am here because my husband and I have been discussing… planning for the inevitable. We want to have some paperwork completed, just in case. Something about making sure my wishes are known if… well, you understand. I believe it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I’m not entirely sure, honestly. My husband did the research.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It's very responsible of you both to think ahead and plan for these things. An Advance Directive, often including a Living Will and Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, and a POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – are both excellent ways to ensure your wishes are respected. It sounds like your husband has a good grasp of things. To be certain I have the correct information, could you tell me a little more about why you are wanting to complete these forms now?
PATIENT: Well, frankly, Doctor, it’s about control. My husband, bless his heart, worries excessively. And I… I prefer to be prepared. I’ve seen too many situations where family members are left arguing over things, making decisions they think I would want, but truly don’t know. It’s… undignified. I want to be very clear about what I expect, so there’s no… fuss. And truthfully, I’ve been feeling… a little more tired lately. Nothing serious, mind you, but it’s a good time to get these matters sorted, just in case. It’s best to be proactive, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I wholeheartedly agree. Being proactive about these things is incredibly wise, and you are right to want to maintain control and ensure your wishes are honored. It’s far better to have these conversations before a crisis occurs. You mentioned feeling more tired lately. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to explain. It's not a debilitating fatigue, not at all. More of a… persistent weariness. I find myself needing an afternoon nap more often than I used to, and I simply lack the energy for some of my hobbies. I used to enjoy long walks in the garden, but now… I prefer to sit and read. It's subtle, Doctor, truly. And I'm sure it's just age catching up with me. I’m forty-four, after all. Still, my husband insists I mention it to a doctor, so here I am. It's likely nothing, but I suppose it's best to rule out anything serious, especially as we’re discussing these… end-of-life arrangements. Don't want to give anyone a false alarm, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re mentioning it, and it’s very thoughtful of your husband to encourage you to get it checked out. Even subtle changes can be important. To get a better understanding, could you describe how long this fatigue has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It began gradually, perhaps six months ago? At first, I attributed it to a particularly busy semester at the university. Grading papers is exhausting, you know. But it hasn’t improved, even with the summer break. Perhaps four or five months of this consistent tiredness, I would say. It fluctuates, of course. Some days are better than others, but it’s always there, lurking in the background. It doesn’t interfere with my daily life, exactly, but it’s… bothersome. And a little worrying, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, four to five months of gradual onset fatigue. And it hasn't improved with the break from the university. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more… short of breath recently. Not during exertion, mind you. Just… sometimes, when I’m sitting quietly, I realize I’ve been holding my breath, or that my breathing is a little shallow. It’s fleeting, really. I hardly notice it most of the time. And I’ve been having a rather persistent dry cough, but I dismissed it as allergies. The pollen count has been terribly high this year. I suppose it’s likely nothing serious, but you’re a doctor, you ask these things. And I do try to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's good you're mentioning everything, even if it seems minor. A dry cough and occasional shortness of breath along with the fatigue are worth investigating. Just to get a clearer picture, have you had any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. No fever, no chills, no night sweats. And my weight has remained perfectly stable. I do enjoy my couscous, you see. I maintain a very healthy appetite. Honestly, Doctor, I think it’s simply… the stress of getting older. My mother, God rest her soul, always said forty is when things start to… decline. Perhaps I’ve inherited her anxieties as well as her excellent cooking skills. But I assure you, there’s nothing dramatic going on. I’m perfectly healthy, all things considered. I simply want to have these… papers in order. Can we please move on to that, if you don’t mind? This medical interrogation is rather tiresome, and I have a book club meeting this evening.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to focus on the Advance Directive, and we certainly can. However, given the fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath, even if subtle, I do feel it’s important to perform a brief physical exam and perhaps order a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It's a precaution, and it will give us both peace of mind. It won't take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find this rather… unnecessary. I’ve already explained that I’m perfectly healthy. And I am not fond of needles. But… my husband would insist. He’s terribly insistent about these things. Very well. If it will appease him, and if it truly won’t take long, I suppose I can endure a brief examination and a few blood tests. But I must warn you, I faint easily. And please, no surprises. I detest surprises. Proceed, but be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. We will proceed gently and at your pace. I assure you, we’ll take every precaution to make you comfortable. We’ll start with a listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen levels, and then a quick look in your ears and throat. We’ll then do the blood work, which will only take a few minutes. I’ll explain everything as we go. Could you please sit back and relax for me?
PATIENT: Very well. But do be quick about it. I have a first edition of Proust waiting for me, you know. And I find medical waiting rooms dreadfully depressing. Begin, then. But please, no sudden movements. And do explain what you’re doing, as you promised. I’m not entirely comfortable with… being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. This helps me assess your heart rhythm and listen for any unusual sounds in your lungs – like wheezing or crackles. It won’t be uncomfortable at all. Take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly. Another deep breath… and exhale. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds regular. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a very faint… wheeze on your left side. It's subtle, but worth noting. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. I'll just wrap this cuff around your arm… it will tighten momentarily, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Must it be so… constricting? It feels rather unpleasant. And what did you say? A wheeze? What does that mean? Is it serious? I knew I should have stayed home with my Proust. This is precisely why I avoid doctors. Always something… worrisome. And please, be quick. I have a rather low tolerance for medical anxiety.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 135/85, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. And the faint wheeze simply means there's a slight narrowing of the airways in your left lung. It could be due to a number of things – allergies, a mild irritation, or even just a variation in your breathing. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious, but it's something we should investigate further to rule out any potential problems. That’s why I recommended the blood tests. Now, I'm just going to clip this small device to your finger. It measures your oxygen saturation level, which tells us how well your lungs are delivering oxygen to your blood. It doesn't hurt at all. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is within the normal range. That’s good. Now, if you’re willing, we can proceed with the blood tests. It will just be a small sample from your arm. Would you prefer to lie down for those, or remain seated?
PATIENT: Remaining seated, please. I dislike being prone. And must you explain every single detail? It’s rather… unnerving. A small sample, you say? Is it a great deal of blood? I faint at the sight of needles, you know. And I have a book club meeting. Honestly, this is taking far too long. Proceed, but be exceedingly gentle. And do try to be swift. My Proust is waiting.
DOCTOR: Of course. It will just be a small amount of blood – a few vials, that’s all. And I assure you, I’ll be as gentle and swift as possible. I’ll warn you before I insert the needle. This might feel a little cold. Alright, you’ll feel a brief pinch. Just relax your arm. We’re almost done. There you go. All finished. Hold this gauze pad in place for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. That’s it. Just a little pressure for a few minutes. All done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Rather faint, actually. And my arm feels… strangely weak. Honestly, I detest needles. Absolutely detest them. I believe I’m developing a headache. And I still have a book club meeting. Now, about those papers. The Advance Directive. Can we finally proceed with that? I have wasted enough time here already. This medical ordeal has been most unpleasant. Let’s get it over with, if you please. The sooner I can return to my Proust, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I apologize for the unpleasant experience, and I assure you, we’ll make this part as smooth as possible. We’ll go through the Advance Directive form together, and I’ll explain each section to you. This document allows you to specify your wishes regarding your future medical care, should you become unable to make decisions for yourself. It includes sections for designating a healthcare proxy, outlining your treatment preferences, and specifying whether or not you want life-sustaining measures. Let’s start with the healthcare proxy. This is the person you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so. Do you have someone in mind?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My husband, Antoine. He is… exceedingly thorough. And quite insistent, as I mentioned. He’s already filled out his portion, naturally. He has a… rather detailed understanding of these matters. There. He is perfectly capable of making decisions on my behalf. Proceed with the next section. Though, I must warn you, I have rather strong opinions about life-sustaining measures. I believe in a dignified exit, not a prolonged, undignified struggle. And I detest being poked and prodded. Perhaps you should simply skip to the end and have me sign the document. My husband will be most relieved.
DOCTOR: Very good. Antoine has clearly thought this through. This section allows you to specify your wishes regarding various medical interventions, such as CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. We’ll go through each option, and you can indicate your preferences. Do you wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, if your heart stops beating?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. None of it. No CPR, no mechanical ventilation, no artificial nutrition. I have made my wishes perfectly clear to Antoine. I believe in allowing nature to take its course. A dignified exit, remember? No prolonged suffering, no undignified interventions. I simply want to be comfortable, surrounded by my books, and allowed to… fade away peacefully. Is that perfectly clear? And please, do not attempt to persuade me otherwise. I have thought about this extensively. My husband agrees, naturally. He has a very… pragmatic outlook. Now, can we simply skip to the signature line? I believe I have wasted enough time here already. This entire ordeal has been most… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand and respect your wishes. We will document your preferences regarding CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. If you’re ready, you can sign here to indicate your acceptance of these directives. This document will be placed in your medical record and shared with Antoine, ensuring that your wishes are honored. Excellent. We have now completed your Advance Directive. It's a very important step in ensuring your future care aligns with your wishes. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. I believe we have exhausted all necessary… formalities. My husband will handle any further questions, should they arise. He is exceptionally thorough, as I mentioned. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a first edition of Proust waiting for me. And I must confess, I am feeling rather faint. This entire ordeal has been most… unsettling. I trust you will keep this document safe and secure? And that Antoine will have access to it when necessary? Good day.
