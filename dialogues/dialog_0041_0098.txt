DOCTOR: Hi Demondre, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Uh, well, I just… wanted to check things out, you know? Never really been to a doctor before, just curious, I guess. Been workin’ on the boats, feelin’ okay, just thought I should see what this is all about.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Preventative care is fantastic. "Feelin' okay" is good to hear, but let's dig a little deeper, just to be sure. When you say "workin' on the boats," what kind of work do you typically do?
PATIENT: Mostly oilin’ stuff, makin’ sure the machines run smooth. It's a lot of bendin’ and reachin’, and sometimes it's kinda hot down there. Been doin’ it for… maybe five years now? Not too bad, usually. We switch off a lot, so it's not always heavy liftin’, but sometimes it is. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Bendin’, reachin’, heat, occasional heavy lifting… alright. And have you noticed anything different lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe… my back feels a little stiff sometimes when I wake up? But I just figured it was from sleepin’ funny. It goes away pretty quick. And I get tired, but workin’ on the boats is tiring, you know? So I dunno if that’s new. Everything else feels… normal, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff back in the mornings… and the tiredness. It’s good you’re pointing those things out, even if they might be related to work. Let’s talk about the back stiffness a little more. Where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: It’s mostly… lower back, I guess. Right around here. And it's not like, a bad pain, more like… a creaky feelin’. Like I need to stretch it out. It usually goes away after I’ve been movin’ for a bit. Does that sound weird?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound weird at all. Lower back, creaky feeling that improves with movement… alright. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, what would you say it is when it's at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm… probably a two or three, I think. It's never really bad enough to stop me from doin' things. Like I said, just a little stiff. Sometimes I just gotta take a few extra minutes to get goin’ in the mornin’. Zero would be… nothin’, right? And ten… that sounds awful.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Zero is nothing, ten is the worst. A two or three is definitely manageable. Now, let's move on to the tiredness. Is this tiredness all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly at the end of the day, after work. Like, really tired. But I mean, work is hard, so I expect that a little. I just… sometimes I feel a little draggy even on my days off, not as much, but still. I dunno if that makes sense. It's not like I can't get up and do things, just… not as much energy, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness mostly at the end of the day, some lingering fatigue on days off… I understand. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just tell me what I gotta do. I ain’t been to a doctor before, so I don't really know what to expect.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. We’ll take it slow. If you don’t mind, could you change into this gown?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Where is that changin’ room? I'll just go change then, right? Let me know if I need to do somethin’ special.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. It’s right over there. I’ll be just outside when you’re ready. Take your time. Just leave your clothes in the room, and I'll be right back to do a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Thanks, Doctor. I’ll be right out.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see… 25 year old male, works on boats, lower back stiffness, fatigue… preventative care checkup… It's good he's coming in now, even if it's just to get a baseline. I'll check his range of motion, too. Vague symptoms… could be musculoskeletal, could be a lot of things.
PATIENT: All ready! You can come in when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Demondre, if you’re ready, you can come on out when you’re comfortable. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Okay, all set. Uh… what do I do now? Do I lie down?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. Just relax, and I’ll get started. First, I'm just going to check your blood pressure and pulse. It might feel a little tight on your arm, but it won’t hurt. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay. That didn't feel bad at all. Is that good? I don't really know what those numbers mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good. 128 over 76 is a perfectly healthy blood pressure. And a pulse of 72 is also right where it should be. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. This won't hurt either, just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. Alright, everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your back and see if I can pinpoint where that stiffness is coming from. Can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: It’s kinda hard to say exactly. It’s more like a general ache, but I guess it’s right around here. Maybe a little bit more to the left side. Does that make sense? It's not a sharp pain, just… stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. General ache, a little more to the left. Let’s see… Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… kinda tender. Not awful, but yeah, that’s where it feels tight. It's like a deep ache when you press there. It's not always sore like that, just when you push on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so there's definitely some tenderness there. And I feel a little bit of muscle spasm as well. Let's see if we can identify what's causing it. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Uh… I can get pretty close, but not all the way. It kinda hurts in my lower back when I bend like that. That kinda makes it worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion and pain with forward bending. That suggests some muscle strain or inflammation. Now, let's try bending backwards. Just gently lean back as far as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: Uh… that's okay. Not bad, just a stretch. I can go pretty far back like this. It feels a little better than bending forward, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, bending backwards is more comfortable. That’s helpful information. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it sounds like you have a muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by the work you do on the boats. It’s not anything serious, but it’s important to take care of it so it doesn’t become chronic. Do you have any history of back problems before?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I tweaked my back a little bit playin’ football in high school, but that was a long time ago. Nothing like this, though. This is just kinda… a constant ache, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… annoying. And it gets worse after a long day at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. So, it sounds like this is a new issue, not a flare-up of an old one. It’s good that you’re addressing it now. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain. Second, applying heat or ice to your lower back can also provide relief. And third, it’s important to stretch your back muscles regularly, even on your days off. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nah, no allergies. I can take ibuprofen, no problem. Heat and ice… yeah, I can do that. Stretching… I guess I haven't really been doin' that enough. I'll try to remember. Is there a specific stretch you recommend? Or a good way to do it without makin' it worse?
DOCTOR: Good. No allergies, that’s great. For stretching, I recommend a gentle knee-to-chest stretch. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Gently pull one knee towards your chest, holding it for about 30 seconds. Repeat with the other knee. You can also try a pelvic tilt, which involves tightening your abdominal muscles and flattening your lower back against the floor. Avoid any stretches that cause sharp pain. Here, let me show you. Do you feel any discomfort while doing these?
PATIENT: Yeah, that feels alright. A little bit of a stretch, but not bad. And the pelvic tilt… yeah, I can do that too. Feels kinda weird, but not painful. Is this somethin' I should do every day? Even on days off?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Doing these stretches every day, even on your days off, is important to help prevent your back muscles from tightening up again. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity of the stretches as your back feels better. Also, pay attention to your posture throughout the day. Try to stand and sit up straight, and avoid lifting heavy objects whenever possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Nah, I think I'm good. That all makes sense. Ibuprofen, heat/ice, stretchin', good posture… I can try to remember all that. I appreciate you explainin' it so clearly, Doctor. I was kinda worried there for a minute, but it sounds like it's nothin' too serious. So, is there anything else I need to do? Like, come back for a follow-up or somethin'?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. I recommend coming back for a follow-up appointment in about two to four weeks, just to make sure your back is improving. If your pain gets worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in your legs, please call the office and schedule an appointment sooner. Otherwise, just focus on following the recommendations I've given you, and hopefully, you'll be feeling much better soon. Here's a handout with some information about back pain and stretching exercises. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that's everything. Thanks again, Doctor Polczynski. You've been a big help. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything so clearly. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day!
