DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Benites, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Avril Benites. Is this about my… the appointment I made on the telephone? For a check-up?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's what the appointment is for. But tell me, what specifically prompted you to schedule it?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well, my back… it has been bothering me. Not all the time, but when I bend over, you know, like when I am working on a car… it gets very stiff. And sometimes a little pain. It’s been like this for maybe… a month now? I am not sure of the exact date. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And you work on cars, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. I am a mechanic. I have been for… a long time. It’s… it’s what I do. I own a small shop just outside of town. It keeps me busy. Is it bad that I am still working? My husband… he always said I should slow down. But what else would I do?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s certainly… something. Being a mechanic is… physically demanding, wouldn't you agree?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Very. A lot of bending and lifting. And sometimes getting into awkward positions. It’s not office work, that is for sure! I try to be careful, but… things happen. Do you need me to tell you how I work? I can explain. I have all my tools organized, you know. Very efficiently.
DOCTOR: No, no, the how isn’t important right now. Let’s focus on the where and when of this back discomfort. Is the pain localized to one specific area, or does it radiate?
PATIENT: Radiate? I… I’m not sure what that means. It hurts mostly in my lower back. Right at the small of my back. Sometimes it feels like it goes a little bit around to my side, but not much. Mostly just… right there. Is that what you mean by radiate? Going to other places? I’m sorry, I do not always understand all the… the words.
DOCTOR: It means does the pain travel. Never mind. Lower back, alright. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Not that I have noticed. My legs feel… normal. Sometimes they are a little tired at the end of the day, but that is probably just from standing. I do a lot of standing. And walking around the shop. Is there something wrong with my legs? Should I be worried about that?
DOCTOR: No, fatigue from standing is… expected. Let's move on. Any bowel or bladder changes?
PATIENT: Changes? You mean… going to the bathroom? I… I am not sure what you are asking. Everything feels… normal. I go to the bathroom when I need to. Is this a normal question to ask? It feels… a little personal. I do not understand why you are asking about that.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mrs. Benites. We rule things out. Just a precaution. Have you had any fever, unexplained weight loss, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No fever. And I haven't lost any weight, I think. Maybe a little, but I have not been eating as much lately. Not much appetite. And… no night sweats. I sleep pretty well, actually. Although sometimes my back aches a little when I roll over. Is that important? I shouldn't have eaten that second piece of pie last night. Maybe that’s why I’m not feeling so good.
DOCTOR: Right. And any previous injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. When I was younger, I fell off a ladder. It was… a long time ago. Maybe thirty years? I landed on my back. It hurt very badly at the time, but I went to the doctor and they said it was just a sprain. I went to physical therapy for a while. It got better, but it has never been quite the same. I try to be careful now. But accidents happen. I do not remember much else. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at your back. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with a basic physical assessment.
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, alright. Where is the… examination table?
DOCTOR: Over there. If you could lie face down, please. I’ll need to examine your spine and the surrounding muscles.
PATIENT: Okay. Face down… yes. This is a little cold. Is it okay if I keep my shirt on? It’s just… a little drafty in here.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can keep your shirt on. Just try to relax. Now, can you tell me where exactly you're feeling the discomfort?
PATIENT: Right here. Mostly right in this spot. And it hurts when I bend over, or when I try to lift something heavy. Even just twisting to look behind me makes it ache. Is it something serious? I need to get back to work, you know. I have customers waiting.
DOCTOR: There's some muscle tenderness here, as you'd expect. Spine feels stable, no obvious step-offs. Range of motion is slightly limited in flexion and extension, but not significantly. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally, which is good. Reflexes are normal. No obvious neurological deficits. It appears to be a musculoskeletal issue, likely a strain or sprain. It doesn’t present with any red flags at this time.
PATIENT: Musculoskeletal… that sounds… complicated. A strain? Like a pulled muscle? What does that mean I need to do? Can I still go to work? I have a car that needs fixing, you know. Mr. Henderson’s wife is relying on it. Is it alright if I just… take it easy? And maybe use a heating pad? I have a very good heating pad.
DOCTOR: Yes, a strain is essentially a pulled muscle. You can continue working, but you'll need to modify your activities. Avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting as much as possible. The heating pad is a good idea, use it for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can also help with the discomfort. I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help ease the tension. Take it as directed. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, you'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment. And if you experience any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs, seek immediate medical attention. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No heavy lifting… heating pad… muscle relaxant. And watch for numbness. Ibuprofen… that’s the one my husband used to take. Will this… will this help me get back to normal? I don’t want to have to close the shop. That’s… that’s all I have. And Mr. Henderson… he’s a good customer.
DOCTOR: It should help, Mrs. Benites. Most strains resolve with conservative management. But you need to be diligent with your self-care and listen to your body. Pushing yourself too hard will only prolong the recovery. Here’s the prescription for the muscle relaxant. And I’m writing a note for your primary care physician outlining my findings. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s not too expensive. Medicare… sometimes they don’t cover everything. And I really need to get back to work. Thank you again. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: That’s a referral to a physical therapist, should you need it. And yes, Medicare can be… complicated. Good day, Mrs. Benites. Try not to strain yourself. .
