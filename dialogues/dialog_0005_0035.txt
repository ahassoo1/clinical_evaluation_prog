DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They started a couple of days ago and they just won’t stop. It’s a bit silly coming to the doctor for hiccups, I know, but they’re really getting to me. It’s exhausting, honestly.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, truly! It's not just the hiccups themselves, though those are annoying enough. It's that they keep interrupting everything. I was trying to read a lovely story to my great-granddaughter yesterday, and I could barely get a sentence out! And then I was making a cup of tea… well, you can imagine. Little splashes everywhere! It makes me feel quite useless, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, these hiccups… when exactly did they start, and can you describe what they're like?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was having my breakfast – a little bit of papaya and some toast – and then hic – there it was! Just one little one to start with. I didn't think much of it, you know? But then another one came a few minutes later, and then another… and they’ve been going pretty much ever since. They're… normal hiccups, I suppose. Just that little jerk of the chest, and the sound. Not painful or anything, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: And have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Everything I could think of, really. I tried holding my breath, of course. And drinking water upside down – that always used to work for my mother. Then my granddaughter told me to breathe into a paper bag, but that didn’t do a thing. I even tried a spoonful of sugar, but no luck there either! Honestly, Doctor, I'm running out of ideas.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, hiccups lasting this long can be… troublesome. Have you noticed anything else going on at the same time?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really, no. I’ve been feeling quite well, all things considered. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just old age, I expect! My appetite is good, and I've been sleeping alright. No pain anywhere, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. Oh, wait a minute… now that you mention it, my tummy has been feeling a little… bubbly, maybe? Not uncomfortable, just… gurgly. Like there's a lot of air in there. But I just put that down to something I ate.
DOCTOR: Bubbly, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit. Like when you’ve had too much fizzy drink, only not as bad. It comes and goes, you know? It's not constant, and it doesn’t hurt. I hadn’t thought much of it, really. I eat a fair bit of fruit, and sometimes that can do it, can’t it? Pineapple, mostly. Delicious stuff, pineapple.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your chest, just to make sure everything’s clear. And I'll just feel your abdomen as well. Don't worry, it's just routine. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Certainly. I always trust your professional opinion. I’m used to these sorts of things, having worked in healthcare myself, you know. Though it's always different when you're the patient! Deep breath… there. And exhale. Is that alright? Am I doing it right?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's fine. Lungs sound… clear enough. Abdomen’s a little… distended, but nothing alarming. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No, not at all. I eat a good meal, no problem. I enjoy my food, you know. I’ve always had a good appetite. Although, now you mention it, sometimes I get a little bit of… heartburn. Just a little burning feeling in my chest, after I eat something spicy. But I take a little something for that, over the counter. It usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: And what “something” are you taking for the heartburn?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just one of those antacids, dear. Something I picked up at the chemist. A little purple tablet. I can’t recall the name exactly – they all look the same, don’t they? It helps to settle my stomach, that’s the main thing. I don’t take it very often, only when I’ve had something a bit… rich, you know? Like curry. I love a good curry!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like indigestion, possibly some acid reflux. The hiccups could be related. But, given how long they’ve been going on, and the bubbling… I think we should rule out a few other things. Let me just pull up your records here…
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. That sounds sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It's just… these hiccups are so exhausting! It's hard to enjoy anything when you’re constantly hic… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Last blood work was… a year ago. Okay. And you said you have private insurance?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My husband – well, my ex-husband – left me quite well provided for, bless his soul. He always was a practical man. It makes things easier, going to the doctor and all. And I’ve always believed in being prepared, you know? It's good to have a little cushion.
DOCTOR: Right. I’m going to order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything serious. And a complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation. And… let's do a test for H. pylori – it's a bacteria that can sometimes cause digestive problems. It's a simple breath test. We'll need to schedule those for you. Do you have any upcoming travel plans?
PATIENT: Oh my, that sounds like a lot of tests! But if you think it’s necessary, dear, then I’m happy to do them. I trust your expertise. Travel plans? No, not at all. Not anymore. I used to travel with my husband, all over the world. Fiji, of course, and Europe, and even a little bit of America. But that was a long time ago. Now I mostly just enjoy pottering around in the garden, and visiting my great-grandchildren. They keep me very busy!
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the requisitions for the tests, and a referral to the lab. The lab will schedule the H. pylori test for you. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street – here's the contact information. And I'm going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor to try and reduce the acid. It's a little purple pill. Try to avoid spicy foods, fizzy drinks, and alcohol for a few weeks. And let's see how you feel after the tests. Come back in two weeks with the results, and we’ll go from there. Any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. That’s very thorough. A purple pill, you say? It seems everything is a purple pill these days! Spicy foods… oh dear. That will be difficult. I do love my curry! But I suppose I can manage for a few weeks if it helps to get rid of these hiccups. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… when should I expect to hear from the lab about scheduling the breath test? And is it… unpleasant? I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: The lab will call you within 24 hours to schedule the test. It’s not unpleasant. You’ll just have to breathe into a bag for a few minutes. It's a bit… tedious, perhaps. But certainly not painful. Alright then. If you don't hear from them tomorrow, give them a call. Here’s the number. Any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you very much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, even if it is a lot of tests! I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old woman and her hiccups. It’s reassuring to know someone is taking it seriously. I do hope this purple pill works, though. And I really, really hope I can have curry again soon!
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure it out. Next!
PATIENT: Right then. Thank you again, Doctor. .
