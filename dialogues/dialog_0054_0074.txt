DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Truth be told, I been feelin’ a little…off. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps tellin’ me I need to get my blood pressure checked. Says it’s gettin’ too high. She’s a worrier, that one. But I reckon she’s probably right. It just feels…tight sometimes, you know? In my head.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Tight” is a good way to describe it. And it's always good to listen to your daughter if she's concerned. We’ll definitely check your blood pressure today, Venna. I see here you've been a patient with Dr. Miller for some time. Do you mind if I quickly review your past medical history, just to get a better understanding of things?
PATIENT: Oh, Dr. Miller. Good man, he was. Retired now, right? Bless his soul. Go right ahead, look at whatever ya need. Don't rightly remember everything myself these days. Been a long ninety years, ya know. Mostly just bakin’ and tryin’ to stay outta trouble. Is that alright? I ain't got nothin’ to hide.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. Dr. Miller was a wonderful doctor. No worries at all. It’s perfectly normal to not remember every detail after so many years. Okay, I see a history of… well, some well-managed arthritis, a bit of mild osteoarthritis, and a previous issue with shingles a few years back. Anything else you recall that might be important?
PATIENT: Arthritis, yeah, it flares up now and then. Mostly in my hands, makes bakin’ a little harder sometimes. Shingles was a misery, I don't recall much else botherin' me though. Nothin' major, I don't think. I've always been pretty lucky, all things considered. Lived a good life, worked hard. Been bakin' since I was a little girl with my mama. Is that the kind of thing you need to know? What are you lookin’ for exactly?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Venna, thank you. Knowing about the baking is actually quite useful – it gives me an idea of how your hands are functioning, and that can tell me a lot. What I'm looking for is anything that might be contributing to how you’re feeling – any other aches and pains, any shortness of breath, any changes in your vision, things like that. Just a general overview to make sure we’re not missing anything. Before we get to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my mama lived to be eighty-five, good long life. Papa didn’t fare as well, heart trouble took him too young, maybe in his sixties. Lots of folks on both sides had… well, just the usual, I reckon. Arthritis, some diabetes here and there. Nobody I can recall with real bad heart problems other than my Papa. My sister, she had high blood pressure too, late in life. She passed on a few years back. Does that help any? I ain't one for rememberin’ dates and names much these days.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful indeed, Venna. Knowing about your father’s heart trouble and your sister’s high blood pressure is important. It does give us some clues. Now, just to cover all the bases, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Well, I take somethin’ for the arthritis, a little white pill. Can’t recall the name of it for the life of me. And sometimes, if my arthritis is real bad, I take an extra one. My daughter, she fills the pill box for me most of the time. I take somethin’ for my water too, somethin’ to help me go to the bathroom easier. That’s about it, I think. I don't take a whole lot. I try to stay natural, ya know? Herbs and teas mostly. Not a fan of takin’ a bunch of pills.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Many people prefer to keep things as natural as possible. And it's completely understandable not to remember all the names. Your daughter filling the pill box is very helpful. Okay, I see here you’re on naproxen for the arthritis and oxybutynin for overactive bladder. That matches what you’ve told me. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Naproxen, that sounds right! Oxy… oh, that long one! That one makes me a little thirsty sometimes. Allergies… hmm. Not to pollen, thankfully. I love bein' outside, workin’ in my garden. Food… well, I don’t think so. Maybe a little heartburn if I eat somethin’ too spicy, but not a real allergy. Nothin’ serious, thankfully. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I just want to feel better, ya know? This tightness in my head is gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: You have been pretty lucky, Venna. And I understand wanting to feel better – that’s why you came to see me. It’s good to know you don’t have any significant allergies. Okay, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Do what ya need to do. I trust ya. My heart’s been beatin’ for ninety years, so it’s probably used to bein’ listened to. Just hope it don't give ya a fright! Just try not to poke too much, my skin's gettin’ thin these days.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Venna. Ninety years is quite a feat – a testament to a strong heart indeed! Okay, first I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 162 over 94. A little elevated, as your daughter mentioned. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and another… Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not a new one, according to Dr. Miller’s notes, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears… Ears look clear. And finally, let’s take a quick look at your throat… Throat looks clear as well.
PATIENT: 162… that don’t sound good, does it? My daughter will be right. A murmur, ya say? Been there a while, you think? Goodness. I just wanna feel better, ya know? This tightness… it worries me sometimes. Makes me feel… old. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? Really serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Venna. 162 over 94 is higher than we’d like, and the murmur is something we need to monitor. However, it’s important to remember that it's been there for some time, as Dr. Miller documented, and we have a baseline to work with. “Serious” is a strong word. It’s not an emergency situation at this moment, but it does mean we need to investigate a bit further to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and ensure the murmur isn’t getting worse. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A basic blood panel to check your kidney function and rule out any underlying issues, and an EKG to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… alright, I guess. As long as they don't poke around too much. I ain't scared of a little pinprick, but I get tired easily these days. Kidney function… and a… EKG? What’s that even do? Is it gonna tell ya if my heart’s workin’ alright? My daughter’s always talkin’ about my heart. She worries somethin’ fierce. Just wanna get this figured out, ya know? So I can get back to bakin'. Gotta keep the folks happy with my pies.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Venna. We’ll take things slowly and keep everything as comfortable as possible. An EKG – that stands for electrocardiogram – is a painless test where we place a few small stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any poking or needles. It just gives us a more detailed picture of how your heart is functioning, whether it’s beating regularly, and if there are any areas of concern. It’s a very common test and shouldn’t take long at all. And yes, your daughter is right to be concerned about your heart – it's important to make sure it's healthy, especially at your age. But we're being proactive, and that's a good thing. I’ll go ahead and order those tests for you. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll let you know when they’re ready. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d also like to start you on a low dose of a blood pressure medication. It’s a very common medication, and it can help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of complications. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Medication… hmm. I don't rightly like takin’ pills, Doctor. But if it’ll help… I reckon I can try. But a low dose, ya hear? I don't want to feel all foggy-headed and slow. I gotta be able to bake, ya know? Can’t have a baker who can’t bake! And what about my kidneys? You said somethin’ about those… will this pill hurt them? I just want to feel better, not worse. Just tell me the truth, ya hear? I’m an old woman, I can handle it.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask those questions, Venna. And I completely understand your reluctance to take medication. You deserve honesty, and I promise to be completely upfront with you. The medication I'm considering is a very gentle one, a low dose of lisinopril. It’s a common medication with minimal side effects, and we'll start with the lowest possible dose to see how you tolerate it. Foggy-headedness is not a common side effect, but it is possible. If you experience any side effects at all, we’ll stop the medication immediately and explore other options. As for your kidneys, that’s why we’re doing the blood panel – to check their function before starting any medication. Lisinopril can sometimes affect kidney function, which is why it’s so important to make sure they’re healthy beforehand. We’ll monitor your kidney function closely while you’re on the medication to ensure it’s safe for you. We’ll start with a very low dose, monitor you closely, and adjust the medication as needed. We’ll work with your body, not against it. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: That… that sounds a little better, yes. Monitorin’ closely, ya say? And a low dose… Alright. I reckon I can try that. But if I start feelin’ all funny, you promise you’ll stop it right away? I don’t wanna be a bother. I just wanna get back to bakin’ my pies. Folks are countin’ on me. So, what do I need to do now? Go to the lab? Then… what?
DOCTOR: I promise, Venna. If you experience any side effects at all – even the slightest feeling of being unwell – we’ll stop the medication immediately. You are not a bother, and your well-being is my top priority. Yes, your next step is to head down to the lab. They’ll take a blood sample to check your kidney function and other important levels. It shouldn’t take long, and they’re very efficient. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. I’ll also give you a prescription for the lisinopril, and we can go over any potential side effects again. For now, just focus on resting and taking it easy. And don’t worry about a thing – we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any questions for me before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: Hmm. Alright. No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything pretty clear. Just gotta get these tests done, and then… see what happens. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate ya takin’ the time to listen to an old woman like me. And thank you for not makin’ me feel like a bother. I guess I’ll head down to the lab now. And… I’ll try not to worry too much. Though it’s hard sometimes. Alright then. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. And please, try to relax and focus on getting some rest. You have a good day as well, and I’ll see you soon. .
