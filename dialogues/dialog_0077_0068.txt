DOCTOR: Good morning, Madame Queener. I am Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… swelling. It’s in my leg, and it started after the cancer treatments. It’s just… puffy, you know? And a little uncomfortable. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling after cancer treatments can be a common side effect, but we need to determine the cause to ensure we manage it appropriately. Let's gather some more information. Could you tell me, approximately when did you complete your cancer treatments?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. It was… last November, I believe. Yes, November. Everything is a bit blurry these days, to be honest. But definitely before Christmas, for sure.
DOCTOR: November… alright. And can you describe the swelling a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s mostly in my right leg. It’s not… all over, more like around my ankle and calf. It feels… tight, like a big rubber band. Sometimes it's worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet. And it’s a little bit red, maybe? I’m not very good at telling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does the swelling come and go, or is it fairly constant?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… like today, it’s pretty bad. It's definitely worse after I've been walking a lot, you know? I try not to walk too much, but… sometimes I have to.
DOCTOR: I see. Have you noticed any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain, exactly. It’s more like a heavy feeling. A sort of… ache. It’s not sharp, you know? Just… uncomfortable. And sometimes it feels a bit warm to the touch, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you experienced any changes in your skin, like sores, blisters, or any discoloration besides the redness you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm... No, I don't think so. My skin feels… normal, really. Except for maybe a little dry sometimes. But that’s just because of the weather, I think. It's been very warm, yes? No sores or blisters, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or any fatigue along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Oh… a little bit tired, yes. But I am always a little bit tired. I thought it was just my age, you know? No fever, though. And I haven’t had chills. Definitely no fever. It's hard to tell sometimes, things come and go...
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, regarding your medical history... do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I had a little bit of high blood pressure, a long time ago, but the doctor said it was okay now. Just… a little bit of arthritis, in my hands. Nothing major, you know? And of course, the cancer, but we’re talking about that already.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual. A little bit of something for my arthritis, when it’s bad. It’s called… oh dear, I forget the name! Something with a 'P', I think. And a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was low. That’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: We can certainly look those up. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh no, no allergies. Never had one! I eat everything, and I can take any medicine. Lucky me, yes? I don't think I’ve ever been allergic to anything in my life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh yes, of course! Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted, you know?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you'll just have a seat here, I'll begin. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll take a closer look at your leg and ankle. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, if you could just point to where the swelling is most prominent... I do feel some warmth and swelling in your right leg, particularly around your ankle and calf. There is some mild pitting edema as well, which means the swelling leaves a slight indentation when I press on it. I don’t feel any significant pain with palpation, but it does feel somewhat tight. Your pulses are good and strong.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Is it bad? What does 'pitting edema' mean exactly? Is it the cancer coming back? I get so worried.
DOCTOR: Please don’t worry, Madame Queener. “Pitting edema” simply means that the swelling holds a little bit of fluid, leaving an indentation when I press on it. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Given your history of cancer treatment, the swelling, and the mild pitting edema, the most likely explanation is lymphedema, which is a buildup of fluid in the tissues due to damage to the lymphatic system. Cancer treatments can sometimes affect the lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels, leading to this condition. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as a blood clot, which could be more serious. I would like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg to assess the blood flow and rule out any clots. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A Doppler… ultrasound? Oh dear. Is it… painful? And what is this… lymph… thing? I'm so confused. I just want my leg to stop feeling like a balloon! And… what if it is a blood clot?
DOCTOR: A Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your leg. It’s completely painless, and you’ll just lie on the table while a technician moves a small device over your skin. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. Your lymphatic system is like a network of pipes that helps drain fluid from your body. When it’s damaged, fluid can build up in certain areas, causing swelling. That's what lymphedema is. Cancer treatment sometimes affects this system. We need to rule out a blood clot to be certain, and the ultrasound will help us do that. It’s important to check, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have one. If it were a blood clot, we would need to start you on medication immediately to prevent complications. However, based on your symptoms, lymphedema is the more likely cause. I’m going to order the ultrasound, and we’ll have the results within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible and wearing compression stockings to help reduce the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Elevation… and stockings? Okay. That sounds… manageable. So, it’s not definitely a blood clot, then? And the… lymph… thing, you can fix it? Or at least make it better? And what kind of stockings? Do I have to get a special prescription?
DOCTOR: No, it is not definitely a blood clot. That’s why we’re doing the ultrasound – to get a clear picture and be certain. Lymphedema is usually managed, not necessarily “fixed,” but we can definitely make it better. Elevation, compression stockings, and gentle exercise can help reduce the swelling and improve the fluid flow. In some cases, physical therapy and specialized massage techniques can also be beneficial. We'll need a prescription for compression stockings to ensure you get the right size and level of compression. I'll write one for you today. We'll start with a moderate level of compression, and we can adjust it if needed. I’m also going to refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema management. They can teach you specific exercises and techniques to help reduce the swelling and improve your quality of life. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Oh yes, that sounds… much better. A plan! A physical therapist… good. And the stockings… are they… comfortable? I don’t like feeling constricted. And when should I call if… it gets worse? What counts as worse?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about feeling constricted. Compression stockings have improved a lot over the years, and there are different types available. We can start with a milder compression and see how you tolerate it. The physical therapist can also help you find a comfortable pair and teach you how to put them on correctly. You should call immediately if you experience any of the following: Sudden, severe pain in your leg Redness or warmth in your leg Fever or chills Any shortness of breath or chest pain A significant increase in swelling that doesn’t improve with elevation If you notice any of these symptoms, don’t hesitate to call. Otherwise, if the swelling gradually increases or doesn't improve with elevation and compression, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to reassess the situation. I’m going to write the prescriptions for the compression stockings and the referral to the physical therapist now. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think… that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. It’s less scary now, knowing what’s going on. And the stockings… I’ll try them. Hopefully they’re not too awful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Madame Queener. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Remember, we’ll monitor the situation closely and adjust the treatment as needed. Here are the prescriptions and the referral. The physical therapist’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye. .
