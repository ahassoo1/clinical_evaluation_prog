DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s about my bruising, Doctor. It’s…more than usual. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, Warfarin. Been on it for years since…well, never you mind. But lately, a little bump will turn into a purple mess. It’s quite concerning, frankly. I keep a tidy house, you know. Don't go around knocking into things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased bruising while on Warfarin is something we need to look into. It’s good you brought it to my attention. “More than usual” is helpful – can you give me a sense of how much more?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? It’s…embarrassing. Used to be, if I bumped a shin, maybe a little discoloration for a day or two. Now? I swear, I looked at a fern the other day – just looked at it – and I had a bruise on my forearm. My housekeeper keeps giving me these worried looks. It’s ridiculous. A fern, Doctor!
DOCTOR: A fern… alright. That is quite a bit of bruising. And it’s good you’re noticing the change. To get a better picture of what's going on, let’s go through some things. First, have you had any recent falls or injuries that you do remember, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I told you, I'm careful. I may be getting on in years, but I’m not clumsy. I watch where I’m going. And I certainly haven't fallen. It's…irritating to even suggest it. I used to be an athlete, you know. A proper one. Before…well, before things. No falls. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no falls. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any other unusual bleeding?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Let me think… hmm. My gums bleed a little when I brush, but that's been happening for ages. Old age, I suppose. And…oh! There was that time I cut myself shaving. Stopped fairly quickly, though. Nothing… dramatic. Why do you ask? Is this Warfarin thing getting worse? It's keeping me from my garden, you know. And that's… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: It's good you mention those things. A little gum bleeding isn't usually a huge concern, but combined with the bruising, it's worth exploring. We need to rule out anything serious. It’s possible the Warfarin dosage needs adjustment, or there could be another reason for the increased bleeding. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to check your INR level – that’s how we measure how well your blood is clotting. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: INR level. More tests. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a pincushion these days. But…fine. If you insist. Just…try to be quick about it. I have appointments, you know. Important ones. And please, tell me what this “INR level” actually means. Don't give me some complicated medical explanation. I just want to know if it's serious or not. And if it’s the Warfarin, can we just…lower the dose? It's not rocket science.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. We'll be as quick as possible. An INR level just tells us how long it takes your blood to clot. The higher the number, the longer it takes, and the more likely you are to bleed. We want to keep it within a certain range to protect you. If you'll just have a seat, I’ll get the nurse to draw a quick sample. While we're waiting for those results, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Other doctors? Honestly, Doctor, you'd think I was falling apart. No. Just my…well, never mind. No other doctors. I manage. I always have. And I resent the implication that I need a whole team of specialists. It’s just this bruising. This fern-induced bruising. Can we please just focus on that? I’m a pathologist, you know. I understand the body. I don’t need a lengthy consultation. Just fix the Warfarin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. No other doctors. I respect your expertise, and we will focus on the bruising. I just want to make sure I have all the information. While we’re waiting for the results, could you tell me about any medications you're taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. This is ridiculous. Just…a little aspirin now and then for a headache. And some vitamin D, the doctor told me to take it. For…bones, I think. That's it. Nothing else. I don’t fill my body with all sorts of…nonsense. Honestly, Doctor, are you suspecting I'm hiding something? Because that's rather insulting. A pathologist, remember? I know what I'm putting into my body.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Farson. Just routine questioning. Aspirin can thin the blood, even a little, so it’s good to know. And the vitamin D is fine. Nurse Ramirez is here to draw your blood now. It’ll just be a quick prick, and then we’ll have those results in about ten minutes. In the meantime, let's quickly review your family history. Were there any bleeding disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor, you're digging now. My mother had…arthritis. That’s about it. A lot of aches and pains. And my father… he was a strong man. Very strong. No bleeding disorders. Never. We were a…sturdy family. Please, let's just get this over with. This whole process is…demeaning. I’m a pathologist, not some… delicate flower.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known bleeding disorders. Thank you, Mr. Farson. Nurse Ramirez, if you could please proceed when you’re ready. While we wait for the results, I do want to ask about any recent changes in your diet. Have you started taking any new foods or drinks, or increased your intake of leafy green vegetables, like spinach or kale?
PATIENT: Leafy green vegetables? Are you serious, Doctor? I am a man of discerning taste. I do not subsist on…rabbit food. I eat a balanced diet. Steak, fish, a little poultry. And a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Nothing else. I haven't suddenly taken up gardening and decided to eat the ferns. Honestly, this is preposterous. You are implying I'm… what? A vegetarian? Do you even look at me? A pathologist doesn’t live on kale.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I’m not implying anything. I simply need to rule out all possibilities. Certain foods can interact with Warfarin. Okay. We’re waiting on the results now. While we wait, let's talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Social history? Now you're asking about my personal life? Really, Doctor? I am here about bruising, not a…morality check. A glass of wine with dinner, as I mentioned. Occasionally. It's a civilized habit. And I resent the implication that it’s somehow contributing to my…fern-induced affliction. I'm a pathologist, I understand moderation. And frankly, this line of questioning is rather insulting. Is this standard practice? Asking a patient about their wine consumption? Preposterous. I think I'd like a second opinion.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson. I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I am simply trying to gather all the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. Alcohol can affect the way Warfarin works, and it’s important for me to know your typical intake. Ah, the results are back. Your INR level is 3.8. The target range is typically between 2 and 3. So it’s a little elevated. That could explain the increased bruising. It means your blood is clotting more slowly than it should be, and we’ll need to make some adjustments to your Warfarin dosage. Before we do that, though, do you recall anything that might have caused this fluctuation?
PATIENT: 3.8? Elevated? So you were right all along. It is the Warfarin. Honestly, this whole ordeal has been… unnecessary. And now you're asking me what caused it? How am I supposed to know? I haven't changed anything! I haven't suddenly started eating… spinach. I haven't been wrestling bears. I take the medication as prescribed. It’s just… a coincidence. A perfectly reasonable coincidence. And frankly, Doctor, I find your persistent questioning rather…condescending. Just adjust the dosage and let me go home. I have a garden to attend to. And ferns to avoid.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. It’s possible it’s simply a fluctuation, but we want to rule out any contributing factors. Sometimes, even minor changes in diet, medications, or illness can affect the INR. Since you haven't noticed any changes, we’ll start by slightly reducing your Warfarin dosage. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to recheck your INR and ensure it’s within the target range. In the meantime, please continue to monitor yourself for any signs of unusual bleeding, such as nosebleeds, blood in your urine or stool, or excessive bruising. I'm going to write you a prescription for the adjusted dosage. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: A week? Another week of worrying about… ferns? Fine. But I expect a significant improvement. And please, Doctor, no more questions about my diet. I assure you, I haven’t suddenly become a vegetarian. Will this adjustment…make me feel tired? Because I have appointments. Important ones. And I haven't got time for fatigue. Just…fix the Warfarin, and let me get on with my life.
DOCTOR: Adjusting the dosage shouldn’t cause significant fatigue, Mr. Farson. However, everyone reacts differently to medication changes. If you do experience any unusual tiredness, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's your prescription. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for any inconvenience. We’re here to help, and we’ll work together to get your INR back within the target range. Thank you for your patience. And please, try not to worry too much about the ferns. .
