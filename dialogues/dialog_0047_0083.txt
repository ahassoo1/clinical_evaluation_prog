DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “get well” card, you know? Or maybe something… encouraging. My daughter thinks I’m being foolish, but… a little note from the doctor might cheer me up.
DOCTOR: A note, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A little something. I’m not sick sick, you understand. Just… low spirits. My ex-wife… she’s always been a difficult woman, and she’s been… making things unpleasant again. A card from a doctor… it would just show her I am taking care of myself, you see? It's… a matter of principle.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, this isn’t quite the typical use of a physician’s time, or frankly, a medical resource. My role is to address health concerns, not… interpersonal disputes. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms alongside these "low spirits"?
PATIENT: Well, now hold on a minute. I am a patient. And a patient can ask for what they need, can’t they? I’m telling you, a little note would do wonders. And yes, actually… my stomach hasn’t been right. Sort of… unsettled. And I’ve been… tired. Very tired. But I figure that’s from the stress, you see? My ex-wife… she just drains all the energy out of a room.
DOCTOR: Unsettled stomach and fatigue… right. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a couple of weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. Everything sort of blends together when she starts… well, when she starts. It comes and goes, you see. Some days are better than others. But the tiredness is pretty constant, if I’m being honest. And the stomach… it just feels… uneasy. Like something’s not sitting right. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I haven’t been sleeping very well. Tossing and turning. And my appetite… it’s not what it used to be. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… food doesn’t seem as appealing. Just… not hungry, you see? It's probably all connected to the… the situation with her. It’s very disruptive.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Now see here, Doctor… I don’t think we need to get into that much detail. I came here for a little encouragement, not a full examination. Is a doctor not allowed to write a cheerful card anymore? Honestly, this is quite… undignified.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you’re frustrated, but I need to gather information to properly assess your health. These questions aren’t about invading your privacy; they’re about ensuring I understand what’s going on. If you’re unwilling to provide necessary details, I’m afraid I can’t assist you. Are you experiencing diarrhea, constipation, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. Yes, alright. Things… haven’t been regular, let’s put it that way. More… less regular, actually. And… yes, there was a little… a little blood. Just once, mind you. But it was enough to upset me. And frankly, it’s all her fault. She knows it upsets me, and she… she does these things on purpose.
DOCTOR: Right. And how much blood was it, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Just… a little. A few drops. On the paper, you see? Not a lot. But enough to… alarm me. And it happened after… well, after a particularly unpleasant phone call with my ex-wife. I’m telling you, Doctor, that woman… she's a menace. It rattled me, alright? It really rattled me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I'm going to press gently on your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels painful. Does this hurt at all?
PATIENT: Ooh, there. Yes, that’s… a little tender. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. It's been bothering me for a few days now, sort of a dull ache. Like something's… pressing. And it feels worse after I… after I have to deal with her. Honestly, Doctor, you're a good doctor, I can tell, but you don't understand the stress that woman puts me through.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your bowel sounds are a little… diminished. And I detect some tenderness in your lower left quadrant. Given your symptoms – fatigue, changes in bowel habits, the presence of blood, and abdominal tenderness – I’m concerned about a possible inflammatory process in your colon. We need to rule out more serious conditions. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a stool sample to check for infection and inflammation, and a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Good heavens, no! That sounds… dreadful. And for a little encouragement card? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. I just want a little note to cheer me up, not… a camera shoved where the sun don't shine. Is there nothing else you can do? Perhaps a strong cup of tea and a few kind words? Really, I think I just need to vent. This is… excessive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your reluctance, but I have a professional obligation to investigate these symptoms. These aren’t things we can simply dismiss. A simple "card" is not a medical intervention. We need to determine the cause of your discomfort and rule out potentially serious conditions like diverticulitis or even colon cancer. Ignoring these symptoms could have significant consequences. I strongly advise you to proceed with the tests. I can refer you to a gastroenterologist who can explain the procedure in detail and answer any concerns you may have. And frankly, your "stress" is a perfectly valid concern, but it doesn’t explain the physical findings.
PATIENT: Colon cancer… oh, dear. Alright. Alright, you’re right. You’re the doctor. I… I suppose I have to do it. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a very long, heartfelt apology. And a very nice get-well card. And perhaps a referral to a… a stress management class. One that doesn't involve cameras.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly-regarded gastroenterologist. She’ll schedule the colonoscopy and discuss the preparation process with you. As for the blood tests, we’ll draw those here today. I’ll also give you a prescription for a stool analysis kit. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully. And while I won’t write a “get well” card specifically, I can document your emotional distress and recommend a therapist specializing in stress management. Mr. Kammer, your health is my priority. We need to address these physical symptoms first. Ignoring them won't solve anything. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No, I don't think so. Just… tell me Dr. Ramirez is a kind woman. And that the tests… won't be too unpleasant. Honestly, I'm starting to think my ex-wife is trying to kill me. I suppose I’ll go and see this Dr. Ramirez then. And thank you… for documenting my distress. It's… something, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Dr. Ramirez is very good, and she is known for her compassionate care. She will explain everything thoroughly and ensure you’re as comfortable as possible. The preparation isn't pleasant, admittedly, but it’s essential for accurate results. And, Mr. Kammer, I want to assure you that we'll get to the bottom of this. We'll explore all possible causes and develop a plan to get you feeling better. Here are the referrals and prescriptions. Please schedule the appointments as soon as possible. And if you experience any severe abdominal pain, bleeding, or fever, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for… not completely dismissing me. It’s been… a difficult time. I suppose I’ll go and… face the music. And perhaps… perhaps a referral to a good lawyer wouldn't go amiss either. Just in case.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. I can provide you with a list of legal resources in the area. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. And remember, we’re here to support you. .
