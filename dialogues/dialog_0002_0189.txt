DOCTOR: Hi Arbie, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my… business. Down there. I saw blood. In the stool, you know? Not a lot, mind you, but enough to bother a man my age. Shouldn't happen, really. I always took care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Seeing blood in your stool can definitely be concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It’s not necessarily something to ignore, even if it wasn't a large amount. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, you think so? I’ve always been a regular fella, you know? Never had trouble with… that sort of thing. But now… It was just… there. Bright red. Like a little streak. Happened twice now, a couple days apart. I eat plenty of fiber, I do. More than most, probably. And drink water. Lots of water. What could cause such a thing? It’s probably nothing, but my ex-wife always said I should get things checked. She was always a worrier.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re proactive about getting it checked, and it's definitely worth looking into, even if you generally feel healthy. Bright red blood usually suggests the bleeding is closer to the end of the digestive tract – so, closer to the rectum or anus. That doesn't necessarily mean it's anything serious, but we need to figure out what's causing it. You mentioned it happened twice, a couple of days apart. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. Not really. I’ve been eating the same things. Same routine. Maybe a little more stressed lately. My grandson… he's got himself into some trouble, legal trouble. Always making bad choices, that boy. I've been… agitated about that, I suppose. Is stress something that could cause that? Seems ridiculous, doesn’t it? Blood from worrying? But he’s a good kid, really, just… easily led. And my bowels haven’t been… regular, exactly. A bit… harder to pass things, you know? But I figured it was the heat. It’s been awfully hot this summer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased stress and a bit of a change in your bowel habits. Stress can definitely contribute to digestive issues, including changes in bowel regularity and, sometimes, bleeding. And the heat could certainly play a role in how things are moving along too. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m completely blocked up, mind you. I’m still… going. But it takes a bit more effort, you understand? And the… consistency. It's not as smooth as it used to be. More… formed, I suppose. And I have to… strain a little. Just a little, though. Not like I'm pushing for my life or anything. I used to go to the bathroom without a thought, you know? Now it feels like… work. It’s just… not right. And honestly, it’s embarrassing to even talk about. A man shouldn’t have to discuss these things. But you’re the doctor, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not easy to talk about these things, Arbie, and I appreciate you being open with me. It's completely normal to experience changes in bowel habits as we get older, but it’s good you’re bringing it up. The straining and change in consistency are helpful things to know. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. More… a bit of a burning sensation, sometimes. Right around the… exit, you know? Just a little. It doesn't last long. And only sometimes, after I… finish. It's not a sharp pain, just… irritated. Like I’ve… wiped too much. Though I don't wipe that hard. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. Just old age catching up with me, I reckon. Everything starts to… wear down eventually. It's just… bothersome. And I’d rather not be thinking about it, to be honest. I have more important things on my mind. My grandson, for one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a burning sensation after bowel movements, and it’s not constant. That’s helpful to know. It could be related to the straining, or something else entirely. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Not really. I’ve been a bit… tired lately, but I always chalked that up to my age. Eighty-eight years takes it out of a man, you know? And maybe a little more… gassy than usual. But that could be anything. I did feel a bit… queasy this morning, but I had a bad egg for breakfast. Probably that. I don’t have any stomach pain, if that’s what you’re asking. And no fever. I feel… normal, mostly. Just a bit… off, I suppose. And bothered. Bothered by all this fuss about my… business. It’s ridiculous. A man shouldn’t have to spend his days worrying about things like this. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue, a bit more gas, and feeling queasy this morning after a bad egg – that all sounds reasonable. No fever, no stomach pain – that’s good. To help me figure out what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It’ll just involve listening to your abdomen and a brief rectal exam. That will help me to see if there's anything obvious going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Honestly, doctor, that sounds… unpleasant. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t we just… try something else? Maybe some medicine? I don’t fancy someone… poking around down there, if you don’t mind me saying so. It feels… intrusive. And what exactly would you be looking for, anyway? I’d rather not dwell on the details. I’m an old man, doctor, not a science experiment. Is there really no other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Arbie, and I completely respect your feelings. It is an unpleasant thought, and I wouldn’t suggest it if it wasn't potentially helpful. A rectal exam allows me to feel for any abnormalities, like hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or masses. It’s also a good way to check for blood, which we know you've been noticing. It’s a quick exam, and I will be as gentle as possible. However, if you are truly uncomfortable with it, we can skip it for now. But without it, it will be harder to determine the cause of the bleeding. We could start with some blood tests to rule out other possibilities and see if the bleeding resolves on its own. It's your body and your decision. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Well… blood tests don’t sound too bad. Better than… that. I suppose. Though I hate needles. Always did. But blood tests, alright. Let’s start with that, then. See if they tell you anything. I still think it’s just stress, if you want to know my opinion. Worrying about that grandson of mine. That boy’s got a knack for getting into trouble. But blood tests… alright. But no poking around, understand? I’m an old man, and I’ve had enough poking and prodding in my lifetime. Let’s just stick to the blood tests for now. Is that agreeable?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly agreeable, Arbie. We'll start with the blood tests. They’ll give us a good starting point. I'll order a complete blood count to check for anemia and signs of inflammation, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. We can also check for something called fecal occult blood, which looks for hidden blood in a stool sample. I’ll need to give you a lab requisition form. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood for you. For the stool sample, I’ll give you a kit with instructions. You'll need to collect a small sample and bring it back to the clinic. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Sounds… alright. A lot of running around for an old man, but alright. A kit, you say? For the… stool? Well, I suppose I can manage that. Just give me the forms and the kit, and I’ll get it done. And tell me how long it takes for the results to come back. I don't want to be waiting around forever. And I'd appreciate a little explanation of what you're looking for, if you don't mind. I’m not a doctor, you know. Just an old man trying to figure out what’s wrong with his… business. So, forms and a kit. And an explanation. That sound fair?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fair, Arbie. Here are the lab requisition forms, and this is the kit for the stool sample. The instructions are inside – it's pretty straightforward. Just collect a small sample – about the size of a walnut – and bring it back to the clinic as soon as possible. As for what we're looking for, the complete blood count checks for anemia, which can happen if you’re losing blood. It also looks for signs of inflammation, which could indicate an infection or other problem. The basic metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, just to make sure everything is working okay. And the fecal occult blood test, as I mentioned, detects hidden blood in your stool. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. Do you have any questions about the forms, the kit, or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think I’ve got it. Forms, kit, three to five days. Don't eat anything funny before the stool sample, I suppose? I read somewhere you have to avoid beets. And… I think that’s it. It’s a lot of bother, but I appreciate you explaining things. Most doctors just talk down to you these days. So, no beets. And I’ll get the sample done as soon as possible. It's just… embarrassing, really. An old man collecting his… business. But alright. Thank you, doctor. I'll see you in a few days, then. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbie. And you’re right to ask questions – it’s important to understand what’s going on. You are right to avoid beets, and also avoid red meat and certain medications for a few days before the sample, as they can cause false positives. I’ll print you out a sheet with more detailed instructions to take with you. Don't worry about the embarrassment – it's a normal part of medical testing. We're here to help, and I'll do my best to get to the bottom of this. You take care, Arbie, and I'll see you in a few days. Please call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
