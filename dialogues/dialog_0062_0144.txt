DOCTOR: Hi Lilly, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. DeCosta, is it? Yes, well… honestly? Just curiosity, I suppose. My daughter kept saying I should get a check-up, but I feel perfectly fine. Though… things have been a little… fuzzy lately, haven’t they? Not that I’m complaining. Just… seeing what all the fuss is about, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilly. It's always a good idea to get a check-up, even if you're feeling well. And it’s smart of your daughter to encourage you! It's wonderful you're proactive about your health. When you say “fuzzy,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Fuzzy… hmm. It’s not like a headache, you understand. More like… I forget where I put my glasses, even though I just had them. Or… what I was going to say mid-sentence. Little things. Happens more and more, I reckon. It’s probably just old age creeping up, though. Not something to worry a doctor about, really. I used to have a very good memory, you know. Back when I was a surgical tech. Years and years of that… maybe that scrambled things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is good you’re noticing these changes, and it’s certainly worth talking about, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. Forgetting things occasionally can be a normal part of aging, but it's always best to investigate when it's a new change, or if it's bothering you. And your history as a surgical tech is interesting! That was a demanding job – lots of focus and memorization. We can explore if there might be any connection, but let’s start with a more thorough picture of what's been going on. To start, have you noticed any changes in your vision besides misplacing your glasses?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not really. Everything looks… the same, I suppose. Maybe a little dimmer sometimes? But I just figured that was the lighting. This apartment doesn't get much sun, you know. And honestly, I haven’t really looked closely. I’ve always had pretty good eyesight, even with all the close work I did. Though now that you mention it… reading the newspaper is a bit harder. I have to hold it further away. But that could be my age too, right? Everything just gets worse eventually.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It is common for vision to change with age, so that could certainly be a factor. Holding the newspaper further away is something we should definitely check out. Okay, let’s shift gears a little. Have you experienced any dizziness, balance problems, or falls recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no falls, thankfully. I’m still quite steady on my feet, thank you very much. Though… I did feel a bit lightheaded the other day when I was standing up quickly. Just a fleeting thing. I brushed it off. Probably didn’t have enough water, you know? I’m terrible at remembering to drink water. It’s one of those things. Doesn’t really seem worth mentioning, does it? I mean, everyone gets a little dizzy sometimes, right? Not a big deal. I just sat down for a bit and it went away.
DOCTOR: You're right, everyone gets a little dizzy sometimes. But it's good you remember that happening, and it’s helpful to know. Lightheadedness can be caused by many things, and it's good to have that information as we sort through things. Now, thinking a little broader… have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Hearing… Well, my daughter keeps telling me I don’t listen. But that’s just her! No, seriously… I suppose things sound a little muffled sometimes? Especially when there’s background noise. Like in the supermarket. It’s hard to make out what people are saying. I just usually nod and smile. Easier that way, you know? I don’t want to bother anyone asking them to repeat themselves. Probably just getting old. Happens to everyone.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Lilly. It's common for hearing to change with age, and background noise can definitely make things more difficult. Okay, let’s talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that years ago? But I don’t really remember. I take a little pill every morning, though. A tiny white one. My daughter makes sure I have enough. She handles all that, bless her heart. As for anything else… no, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. Never been one for sweets, you see. And I used to walk everywhere. Before my knees started acting up, that is. Now I mostly sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So you're taking a medication for high blood pressure, managed by your daughter. We'll want to confirm exactly which medication that is. And you mentioned your knees bothering you – do you have any pain or difficulty with movement in other joints, like your hips or shoulders?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees are the worst, dear. But now that you mention it… my shoulders do feel a little stiff sometimes. Especially in the mornings. It’s just a little ache, really. Nothing I can’t ignore. I used to do water aerobics, but it got too hard getting in and out of the pool. And frankly, I just… lost interest. It’s easier to sit and watch television, you know? I’m not as active as I used to be. That’s probably the problem. A little bit of everything. Old age, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilly, thank you for sharing all of this with me. It's good to have a clearer picture of what's been going on. Now, let's talk about your past medical history a little more directly. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. That was… must have been in the eighties. And I had a little bout of pneumonia once, but that was nothing serious. Just a week in the hospital. Nothing major. I've always been lucky, you know? Never been one for serious illnesses. And I don't remember much else, to be honest. It was so long ago! My memory isn’t what it used to be. My daughter probably knows more about it than I do. She keeps all the records.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilly, gallbladder removal and a bout of pneumonia. That's helpful. And it’s good you have a daughter who keeps good records – we can certainly check those. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tough one. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was quite young, actually. And my father… he had some kind of stomach trouble. But honestly, I don't remember much about their illnesses. It was so long ago, and we weren't very close. And I don't have any siblings, so there's no one to ask. My daughter may know more about it, but I wouldn't count on it. She wasn't very interested in family history, if you know what I mean. She’s always been more focused on her own life. It's probably not important, anyway. Everyone gets something eventually, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilly, thank you for sharing that. We can certainly try to get more information from your daughter if you're comfortable with that. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. You mentioned taking a pill for high blood pressure. Can you describe the pill, or do you happen to know the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh dear... Let me see... It's a tiny white one, like I said. And it has... little letters on it. M...G...something? I can barely see, you know. It’s so small. Oh, here! It says… Lisinopril. Is that right? Lisinopril. My daughter told me about it once. She always makes sure I have enough. And she tells me how many to take every day. One, I think. Just one. I hope that’s right. I trust her completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilly, Lisinopril, one pill daily. That’s very helpful. Now, one last question before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I've always been pretty lucky, you know? Never had any trouble with food or anything like that. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle sometimes with the pollen in the spring, but nothing serious. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, that I remember. My daughter always asks me before I take anything new, just to be safe. She’s very careful. And I trust her completely. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. At least, none that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilly, that’s very good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Lilly. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. That’s perfectly normal, and shouldn’t take too long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. That sounds… sensible. Yes, go ahead. I suppose it’s good to check things, even if I feel perfectly fine. Just don't poke too much, alright? My skin is a little sensitive these days. Whatever you need, just let me know. I trust you completely.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, everything sounds good there. Now I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not surprisingly, given your history. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears and eyes. Everything looks good there as well. Now I’ll just quickly check your reflexes and strength. Okay, everything seems normal there too. Last, I’ll just listen to your abdomen. Alright, Lilly, that completes the quick physical exam. Everything seems generally normal, but we'll want to discuss your blood pressure and address some of the things you've mentioned. Do you have any questions about what I’ve done so far?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. That didn’t hurt a bit. You were very gentle. Hmm… questions? Well… is my blood pressure bad? Should I be worried? I don't want to have to take any more pills, you know. My daughter already makes sure I take so many. And… did you notice anything wrong with my knees? They ache terribly sometimes. Other than that… I suppose not. Just tell me if there’s anything I should be concerned about. I trust your judgement, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address those questions one by one. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, as I mentioned, but it's not drastically high. It's something we need to manage, and that’s why it’s important to continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed. We can discuss lifestyle modifications as well, like diet and exercise, to help lower it naturally. And regarding more pills, I understand your concern. Our goal isn’t necessarily to add more medication, but to make sure you’re on the right dosage and managing your health effectively. We'll explore all options before considering any changes. As for your knees, I did notice you mentioned pain. I didn’t specifically assess them during this quick exam, but we can certainly discuss that further. It sounds like you may have some osteoarthritis, which is common with age. We can talk about pain management strategies, like physical therapy, or referral to an orthopedist if needed. Overall, I’m not overly concerned, but it’s important to address these things proactively. You’ve mentioned several symptoms – the “fuzziness”, lightheadedness, hearing changes – and combined with your slightly elevated blood pressure, it's worth investigating further. I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests? Well… alright, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like needles, you know. But if it will help… yes, go ahead. My daughter says I need to listen to the doctors, and I always do. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… will they hurt? I hope not. I’m a little bit of a baby when it comes to needles. You’ll have to be very gentle, alright? And… what exactly are you looking for? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be nervous about needles, Lilly. I understand. The blood draw itself is very quick, and the phlebotomist will be as gentle as possible. We’ll just need a small sample of blood to check a few things. We’re looking for several things. Primarily, I want to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels , and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and blood sugar levels. These tests can help us rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, like the “fuzziness” and lightheadedness. We’ll also check your complete blood count to make sure there aren't any signs of infection or anemia. I don't suspect anything serious at this point, but it's important to be thorough. These tests are a standard part of a check-up, and they’ll give us a clearer picture of your overall health. It’s better to be safe and have all the information before making any decisions. The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. That sounds… sensible. But what if something is wrong? What if it’s something serious? My daughter would be terribly worried. And what if they need to give me… shots? I really don’t like shots. I suppose I should just get it over with. But… will you tell me the results right away? I don’t like waiting. It makes me anxious. And… will it hurt? Honestly, I’m a little bit scared. It’s silly, I know, but I just don’t like needles. And… and what if they can’t find any blood? I have thin veins, you know. It’s always difficult.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be scared, Lilly. It's not silly at all. And I understand your concerns. Let's address them one by one. If something is wrong, we’ll discuss it openly and honestly. I will explain the results in clear terms and work with you to develop a plan of action. We'll explore all your options and make sure you feel comfortable with every decision. And I promise I won't leave you in the dark. Regarding shots, we don't anticipate needing any at this time, unless the blood tests reveal a specific need for a vaccination. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. And as for finding your veins, don't worry. The phlebotomist is very skilled at drawing blood, and they have techniques to make it easier, even with thin veins. They’ll use a warm compress and gentle techniques to help locate a suitable vein. The lab results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you have any concerns or experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. I’ll write you a lab order and give you the instructions on how to prepare for the blood draw. It’s best to be well-hydrated before your appointment. Are you ready for me to get that order written for you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Yes, let’s just get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can stop worrying. Just… make sure they’re gentle. And tell them I get nervous easily. I don’t want to faint or anything. My daughter would be terribly upset. Just… write the order, alright? And tell me again what I need to do to prepare for the blood draw. I don’t want to forget anything. And… and can I bring my daughter with me next time? It makes me feel safer when she’s there.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilly. I’ll make a note in your chart that you get nervous easily, and I’ll let the phlebotomist know to take extra care. Here’s the order. The phlebotomist will ask you to drink plenty of water before your appointment – at least 8 ounces. It helps to make your veins more visible. And eat a light meal beforehand – nothing too heavy. And yes, absolutely, you can bring your daughter with you to your follow-up appointment. That’s perfectly fine, and I encourage it if it makes you feel more comfortable. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh… I don't think so. Just… thank you, dear. You've been very patient with me. I know I’m a bit of a worrywart. I suppose I'll go get these blood tests done. Hopefully, it won't be too bad. And… and I'll remember to drink plenty of water. Thank you again, doctor. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilly. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember to relax and take care of yourself. We'll see you soon. Have a good day. .
