DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work… about the masks. It’s a bit complicated, but I’d like to request an exemption, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A mask exemption request due to work. That is a bit unusual, but we can certainly discuss it. To help me understand the situation, can you tell me a little more about why you're requesting an exemption?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a Protective Service Worker. It involves a lot of direct contact with people, as you might imagine. The issue isn't that I dislike wearing a mask, Doctor. It's… well, it interferes with my ability to read people. A large part of my job is noticing subtle cues - body language, facial expressions… things that are hidden when everyone is masked. It's crucial for assessing safety, particularly when dealing with vulnerable individuals and potentially volatile situations. I’ve found it makes it… difficult to do my job effectively, and truthfully, safely, for both myself and those I assist.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Knabenshue. You're right, nonverbal communication is incredibly important, especially in your line of work. It sounds like the mask is actively hindering your ability to perform essential job functions. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me how long you’ve been noticing this impact?
PATIENT: It’s been… approximately six months now, Doctor. The mask mandates began more broadly around that time, and it became apparent almost immediately. At first, I thought it was just an adjustment period, that I would learn to compensate. But after several incidents where I missed key signals… well, I felt I needed to address it. One particular case involved a family dispute that escalated more quickly than I anticipated. It could have been handled differently, I believe, had I been able to fully read the situation. It wasn't dangerous, thankfully, but it highlighted the issue quite clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, and a specific incident that really brought this to your attention. That’s helpful. Now, before we discuss potential exemptions, I’d like to rule out any other contributing factors. Do you have any underlying medical conditions – anything affecting your vision, hearing, or neurological function – that might also make it difficult to read social cues?
PATIENT: That is a very thoughtful question, Doctor. To the best of my knowledge, no. I have a yearly physical with my primary care physician and everything is always within normal limits. My vision is… well, I require glasses, as you can see, but that’s been stable for years. I also have no issues with my hearing. I’ve never been diagnosed with any neurological conditions, nor do I experience any symptoms that would suggest one. My mind is as sharp as it ever was, thankfully. I attribute that to a lot of time outdoors, and careful observation, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you are very attuned to your own health. Let's talk a bit about the masks themselves. Have you tried different types of masks – different materials, looser fits, clear masks, face shields – to see if any of them mitigate the issue?
PATIENT: That's a good point, Doctor. I have, actually. Initially, I was provided with the standard surgical masks. Those were the worst, naturally, as they completely obscured everything. Then, I tried some of the cloth masks – various materials and thicknesses. They were slightly better, as they offered a little more visibility, but still hampered my ability to read expressions. I even requested a clear mask, thinking that would solve the problem, but the plastic created a lot of distortion and glare, making it difficult to see clearly. And the face shield… well, that was cumbersome and didn’t feel practical in my line of work. It created distance, which is the opposite of what I need. I've tried, honestly, to make it work with various options, but nothing has been satisfactory.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve systematically explored different mask options without success. That's very thorough of you. Now, just to be complete, have you discussed this with your employer?
PATIENT: Yes, I have, Doctor. I spoke with my supervisor, Ms. Davies, about it several weeks ago. I explained the challenges I was facing and requested an accommodation. She was… sympathetic, but ultimately said she needed to adhere to the current safety protocols set by the agency. She suggested I continue trying different mask options, which I’ve already done, as we discussed. She did mention there's a process for requesting a medical exemption, and advised me to seek documentation from a healthcare professional, which is why I am here today. She was professional, but firm, if that makes sense. She has a lot of responsibility, you see, and a great deal of pressure from above.
DOCTOR: It certainly does make sense, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you’ve been very proactive in addressing this issue, both with your employer and by seeking medical evaluation. Okay. To proceed, I'd like to do a brief neurological assessment – just some simple tests to ensure there aren’t any underlying factors contributing to your difficulties. It’s a standard precaution. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for a thorough evaluation. Please, proceed as you see fit. I want to be certain we’ve explored every possibility. I trust your professional judgement entirely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your pupillary response, then assess your facial muscle strength and symmetry. It’s a quick series of tests – nothing to worry about. Just follow my instructions as best you can. Could you please focus on this penlight as I move it back and forth?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am looking directly at the light. It’s… rather bright, actually, but I’m managing. Is there anything specific you are looking for? I apologize if I blink excessively – the light is a bit much.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, blinking is perfectly normal. I’m simply assessing how your pupils react to light. Everything looks good so far – equal and reactive. Now, could you please try to smile for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that sufficient? I can try to broaden it, if you wish. It feels a bit strange, being assessed like this, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, thank you. Everything looks symmetrical. Now, could you please try to raise your eyebrows as high as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I can hold it longer, if you require. My forehead feels a little… tight, but it's manageable.
DOCTOR: Good. And now, could you please tightly close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that alright? I can try to squeeze them tighter, if needed. I just want to be sure I'm doing this correctly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Everything appears normal there as well. Based on this brief neurological assessment, I don't see any obvious indicators of a neurological issue contributing to your difficulties. It seems your concern regarding mask interference is likely the primary factor. Now, while I can't definitively rule out the possibility of subtle perceptual difficulties, and further testing could be considered, it appears your concern is valid. I'm prepared to write a note supporting a medical exemption request, outlining your concerns about the impact of masks on your ability to perform essential job functions as a Protective Service Worker. However… it’s important to understand that the final decision rests with your employer.
PATIENT: That is… incredibly reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. I understand that a note of support doesn’t guarantee approval, but it’s a significant step, and I greatly appreciate your thoroughness and willingness to consider my concerns. I was prepared for the possibility of further testing, and I am relieved to hear you don’t believe that’s necessary at this time. Would you like me to provide any further information, or is there anything else you require before drafting the note? I am happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: No, I think I have enough information at this point. I’ll draft a note outlining your concerns about the impact of masks on your ability to read nonverbal cues, and the potential safety implications for both you and the individuals you assist. It will also mention my neurological assessment findings, which were normal. It may take a few minutes. While I’m working, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. I do not have any immediate questions. Perhaps… just one thought, if I may. Do you have any recommendations for how I might approach Ms. Davies again, armed with this note? I want to be respectful of her position and the agency’s protocols, but I also want to advocate for my ability to perform my job safely and effectively.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful question. I understand wanting to approach the conversation constructively. I would suggest framing it as a collaborative effort to find a solution that prioritizes both safety and your ability to effectively assess risk. Emphasize that you’ve taken the matter seriously, sought medical evaluation, and are presenting this note as evidence of your genuine concerns. You could also suggest exploring alternative safety measures – perhaps increased distance when feasible, or heightened awareness of other verbal cues – as a compromise. And finally, respectfully reiterate the potential safety implications of hindering your ability to read nonverbal cues, particularly in sensitive situations. Ultimately, Ms. Davies is in a challenging position, and finding a solution that satisfies everyone may require some negotiation. But presenting a well-reasoned argument, supported by medical documentation, will certainly strengthen your case. Here’s the note. I hope it’s helpful. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: This is… perfect, Doctor. Thank you immensely for your time, your thoroughness, and your thoughtful advice. I feel much more prepared to approach this conversation with Ms. Davies. I truly appreciate your understanding and your willingness to advocate for my well-being. No, I believe that is all. I am confident this will be a positive step forward. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley. You have been most helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you're a dedicated professional, and I'm confident you'll find a solution that works for everyone. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day, and stay safe. .
