DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Chest… hurts. And my heart, it… flips. Like fish. Doctor, I no have time for long talk. Very busy man. Blood pressure… wife say high. She always worry.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. Chest pain and a feeling of your heart "flipping," you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Like fish. Not good feeling. Happens… when I get angry. Or… when I walk too fast. Small hill, maybe. Then boom. Like someone hit my chest. Not big boom, but… annoying. And make me short of breath. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. So it seems to be related to exertion, or perhaps strong emotions… and it causes you some shortness of breath as well?
PATIENT: Exertion… yes. And… people. Sometimes people make my blood pressure go up. Then chest hurt. I run emergency management. You think I have time for feelings? Important work. Always on call. No time to rest.
DOCTOR: Right, very demanding work. It sounds like stress is a significant factor here. When you say “chest hurt,” can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmph. Like… tight. Squeeze. Not sharp. Like someone put… heavy band around my chest. And sometimes… goes into my arm. Left arm. Not always. Just… tight. And then… the flipping. Like fish. I tell you again. Is very annoying. You understand that much?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, I understand perfectly. Tightness, squeezing pain in the chest, sometimes radiating to the left arm, and that feeling of your heart “flipping.” Okay. Have you ever had this pain checked out before?
PATIENT: No. Never have time. Always something happening. Big storm, bad traffic… emergency! Wife say I should go. She always say something. But I busy. Important work. Last time she made me go… waste of time. Young doctor, look at me like I crazy. Said stress. I know stress. Don't need doctor to tell me that.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, we’ll try to make this as efficient as possible. Even if it is stress, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a few other things. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick. Very quick. And no poking. I no like poking. And tell me straight. If nothing wrong, I go. Don't want to waste whole day here. Important meeting later. Very important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. Quick and to the point. No unnecessary poking, I promise. Let’s start with your blood pressure, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just relax your arm for me, please.
PATIENT: Hmph. Make it fast. And don't squeeze so tight! Everything hurts these days. Old man problems. Don’t need to tell me that either.
DOCTOR: 168 over 92. A little elevated. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now… a regular rhythm, but I do hear a slight murmur. Not necessarily concerning, but we'll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Yes! Stop! That hurts. See? Everything hurts. Old man. Don’t need to poke around. Just tell me if I dying or not. Stop touching me. It make my blood pressure go up even more.
DOCTOR: My apologies, sir. I didn’t mean to cause any discomfort. I understand. No more touching. Let's just stick to what we've got so far: elevated blood pressure, a slight murmur, and chest pain with that feeling of your heart flipping. Given your symptoms and history, it's important to rule out a few possibilities. It could be related to stress, as you mentioned, but we also need to consider things like angina - chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart. I’d like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart's electrical activity. And perhaps a blood test to check for any markers of heart damage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. EKG… blood test… more poking? More waiting? I have important work to do, Doctor. Very important. This meeting… very crucial. Fine. Do the tests. But make it fast. And tell me results today. No waiting. I need to know if I can go to meeting or not. If I miss this meeting… bad things happen. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, sir. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. I’ll put in the orders right now. The EKG can be done here in the clinic, it only takes a few minutes. The blood test will require a small sample, but the lab is very efficient. I’ll personally review the results as soon as they're available and will let you know today, without fail. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I’m going to recommend you avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. Perhaps reschedule that meeting, if possible?
PATIENT: Reschedule meeting… No. Impossible. Very important people. Cannot reschedule. Just… tell me if I can go. If I can sit there, look important, and not… drop dead. That is all I need to know. No more lectures. No more poking. Just… yes or no. Can I go to meeting? .
DOCTOR: Sir, I understand your need for a quick answer. However, it would be irresponsible of me to give you a definitive "yes" or "no" without the test results. What I can tell you is that given your symptoms, there is a possibility of a cardiac issue. Attending a stressful meeting could potentially exacerbate that. If you choose to attend, I strongly recommend you let me know immediately if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. And please, avoid getting overly stressed. I will prioritize getting these results back to you as quickly as possible. Does that help at all?
