DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta, have a seat. Look, I’m Dr. Pehrson. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… my sight. It’s been going. Not suddenly, mind you. More… fading. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I handle a lot of paperwork, you see, and blurry forms aren’t conducive to efficiency.
DOCTOR: Fading, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, fading. Is that not a clear enough description for you, Doctor? It’s not as if I’m claiming to see in technicolor one moment and total darkness the next. It’s a gradual… lessening. A decline. I suppose you’re here to determine how gradual, aren’t you?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Let’s just pull up your chart… name and date of birth, please. And don't tell me your life story, just the basics. I have other patients.
PATIENT: Really. I see. Well, Delano Alcorta. August 14th, 1973. Though I fail to see how my birthdate is particularly relevant to my diminishing eyesight. But, if you insist on such… trivia. It’s hardly a life story, Doctor. Just a factual piece of information.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alcorta… nothing here. No prior ophthalmology visits listed. You've never seen anyone about this before?
PATIENT: No. I haven’t. I’ve always… managed. It hasn’t been a pressing issue until recently. One doesn’t typically rush to the doctor for a slight… blurring, does one? I pride myself on self-reliance, Doctor. It's a quality sorely lacking in today's world. Besides, my insurance situation is… complicated. I was putting it off as long as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Complicated is an understatement, I'm sure. So, you said "recently." How long exactly is recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. Perhaps… six months? It began subtly, just needing a bit more light to read. Now… well, now it’s difficult to distinguish faces across a room. It’s rather embarrassing, truthfully. Particularly when I’m trying to assess the competence of new hires. One needs to see these things, you understand. It’s a matter of… judgment.
DOCTOR: Six months. Okay. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, Doctor, are we compiling a medical catalogue or diagnosing a condition? No, I don’t have symptoms. My vision is… deteriorating. Is that not symptom enough? Though, if you must know, things do seem a little… dim. Not just visually, if you catch my meaning. A general lack of brightness, perhaps. But I attribute that to the state of the world, not a medical ailment.
DOCTOR: Right. Dim. Okay. Do you have any pain, any floaters, flashes of light, double vision, halos around lights?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Are you reciting a checklist? No, I do not have pain. I have the displeasure of diminished sight. And no, I haven’t been plagued by “floaters” or “flashes of light,” nor do I experience a supernatural “halo” effect around illumination sources. I assure you, my situation is quite mundane, if terribly inconvenient. It’s… a gradual fading, as I’ve already explained. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Let's just do a quick exam. Stand up. Follow my penlight. I need you to look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, I find the directness rather… abrupt. But proceed. Though do try not to wave that… device… directly in front of my eyes. I’d prefer not to be blinded further.
DOCTOR: Okay, follow the light...good. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. Diminished visual acuity, roughly 20/40 in each eye. Some mild cataracts forming, expected for your age. No obvious signs of macular degeneration or glaucoma. It's… consistent with age-related vision changes.
PATIENT: “Consistent with age-related changes?” Is that all? That's… remarkably unhelpful, Doctor. I expected a more… definitive diagnosis. A precise explanation. Not a vague assessment of my… maturity. And “mild cataracts”? Is that something to be alarmed by? Will I be rendered completely blind? I need specifics, Doctor. Not… platitudes. Is there anything that can be done? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Look, it’s early cataracts, perfectly normal. You’re not going blind overnight. Glasses will help. If it gets significantly worse, we can discuss surgery down the line. It's a pretty standard procedure. I can write you a prescription for a basic exam. I'll refer you to an optometrist for a full fitting. It's really the best I can do right now. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: “A basic exam”? So, you’ve determined the problem is my vision is deteriorating and the solution is… more vision testing? That’s… profoundly underwhelming, Doctor. And surgery! You casually mention surgery as if it were a routine dental cleaning! No, I have no known allergies. Though I suspect I may be developing an allergy to… vague diagnoses and dismissive attitudes. But as for medications, no. However, I remain deeply unsatisfied with this… assessment. Is there not anything else that can be done? Perhaps a more thorough examination? A specialist consultation? Anything to avoid the prospect of… surgical intervention?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm a family doctor. I'm not an eye specialist. I've given you a preliminary assessment. If you're that concerned, I can write you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, ophthalmologist. But honestly, it sounds like you just need glasses. It's probably nothing serious. Here’s the referral. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: “Probably nothing serious”? Doctor, I assure you, diminished vision is quite serious to someone who relies on it for… discerning competence. Very well. Dr. Reed, you say? I’ll… consider it. Though I maintain this entire consultation has been… remarkably unproductive. And frankly, a little insulting. No. There is nothing else. Though I suspect this will not be the last you hear from me. .
