DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get right to it. This… thing with my stomach. Food just comes back up, you know? Really unpleasant. It’s been happening a while now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. We can certainly get right to it. It sounds quite bothersome to have food consistently coming back up. When you say “a while now,” could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… probably six, maybe seven months now? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I don’t spend much time dwelling on these things, you understand. I’ve got important things to manage, running the emergency services for the whole county. This is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Altine, and I certainly understand being a busy person. Six or seven months is a significant amount of time to be dealing with this. To help me understand what’s going on, can you describe when this typically happens?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like it happens all the time, thankfully. Usually it’s… after I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Sometimes it's right after, sometimes a few hours later. More often when I lie down, I suppose. Just… comes up. Not violently or anything, thankfully. Just… unpleasant. And it ruins a good shirt, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. So it's not consistently immediately after eating, and it seems to be worse when you're lying down. And you mentioned it's not forceful vomiting, more of a…regurgitation?
PATIENT: Regurgitation, yes, that’s a good word for it. It’s not like I'm emptying my stomach, just… some of it comes back up. And it’s embarrassing, frankly. My wife keeps telling me to see someone, but I generally don't bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. They usually just tell you to stop doing whatever you're doing, and that’s not very helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for quite some time now, and it's understandably disruptive. We'll try to get to the bottom of it. Besides the regurgitation, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Well, sometimes my chest feels a bit…burny. Not painful, exactly. Just…warm. And I do belch a lot. My wife complains about it constantly. Says I sound like a foghorn. But I suppose that comes with the territory when you eat a good meal, doesn’t it? And… now that you mention it, my throat feels a little scratchy sometimes. But I live in Poland, it's always a bit scratchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heartburn, increased belching, and a scratchy throat. The scratchy throat could be related to the regurgitation, or something else entirely, given where you live. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, absolutely not. I’m a perfectly healthy weight. Always have been. I take care of myself, you know? I need to be in good shape for my job. I can't be running around responding to emergencies looking… unfit. I think I may have gained a little weight, actually, but that's probably just the stress of the job.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And I understand needing to stay fit for your demanding role. Now, in terms of diet, would you describe it as generally healthy?
PATIENT: Healthy? Look, I eat. I don't spend my days nibbling on lettuce. I enjoy a good steak, a hearty Polish sausage, things like that. I don't deny myself anything. Life's too short for that. I don’t drink much soda, but I do like a beer with dinner. Is that what you're asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know. A typical diet including steak, sausage, and beer. Now, have you tried anything to alleviate the symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Alleviate? Well, I tried those antacid tablets. The chalky ones. Didn’t really do much. And I try to stay upright after I eat, like my wife tells me. But it doesn't always prevent it, you understand. Honestly, I just try to ignore it most of the time. It’s easier that way.
DOCTOR: Okay. Antacids haven't been very effective, and you try to stay upright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. This will give me a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't expect miracles. I've got a county to run, you know. And be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Altine. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please lie back for me. Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, just below your breastbone. No masses are palpable. It doesn’t seem to be acutely painful, but it's certainly worth noting. I'd like to order some blood work, and possibly an upper endoscopy to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your esophagus and stomach. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What does that involve? I don’t like the sound of that at all. Is it painful? Because I have a very important emergency preparedness drill next week, and I can't be laid up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Altine. An upper endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining. It allows us to look for any inflammation, ulcers, or other abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. It's typically done with some sedation, so you'll be quite comfortable during the procedure. Most patients don't recall much of it at all. There can be some mild discomfort afterwards, like a sore throat, but it’s usually manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. It usually takes a few hours to recover, and you should be able to resume most of your normal activities the next day. The results will give us much more information, and guide our treatment plan. We can discuss postponing it if you are concerned about the drill, but it is the most definitive way to determine the cause of your symptoms. Would you like me to explain the risks and benefits in more detail, or would you prefer I consult with a gastroenterologist to discuss it with you directly?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t like the sound of that at all. A tube down my throat… No. I’m not doing it. I’ll just… try to manage it better. More antacids, I guess. And I'll try to eat smaller portions. Honestly, it’s probably just stress. This job… it ages you quickly, you know? I think I’ve wasted enough time here. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine, and I respect your decision. However, without a proper diagnosis, we can only treat the symptoms, and it’s possible there’s a more serious underlying issue that needs to be addressed. While I respect your wishes, I strongly advise you to reconsider. We can at least get a referral to a gastroenterologist for a second opinion, even if you don’t choose to proceed with the endoscopy. In the meantime, I’ll document your symptoms and recommend a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, which is a stronger medication than antacids, to reduce stomach acid. But if your symptoms worsen, or you develop any new symptoms like difficulty swallowing, weight loss, or bloody vomit, please come back immediately. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of our discussion and instructions for the medication. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me the prescription. And please, don’t bother me with any more tests or procedures. I’ve got a county to run. Thank you… I guess. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if your symptoms worsen. I do hope you’ll reconsider the referral if things don’t improve. Have a good day, and stay safe.
