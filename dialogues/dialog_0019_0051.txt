DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. My name is NINI. Darl is what my husband called me. He’s… gone now. Um… well, my daughter, she said I should come. Something about… blood? I need to know what type I am, she said. For… reasons. I can’t quite recall all the details. It’s a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It’s perfectly alright if things aren’t crystal clear. So, your daughter suggested we check your blood type, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She was very insistent. Something about… a form? And… emergencies? I don’t remember ever needing to know this before. I’ve always been… alright, I suppose. Just a little forgetful, you know? Is it a long process? I didn’t bring a book…
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a long process at all, Darl. It’s a simple blood draw, just a few vials. And don’t worry about a book – we won’t keep you long. It's good to be prepared though, and knowing your blood type is helpful in emergencies, even if you haven't needed it before. Before we do that, though, just to get a better picture, have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Different… Well, I am old, Doctor. Everything feels a bit different these days! My knees ache, my back… oh, don’t even get me started. But… no, nothing new, I don’t think. Just the usual. A bit tired, perhaps. And… sometimes I misplace things. Like my glasses. And my keys. And… what was I saying? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. It’s very common to experience aches and pains as we get older, and a little forgetfulness is normal too. We can certainly talk about managing the aches and pains if you’d like. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any unusual bruising, bleeding – maybe bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, or nosebleeds that are harder to stop than usual?
PATIENT: Oh… bruising. I do bump into things, you know. Furniture mostly. Old houses, everything’s in the wrong place! Bleeding… hmm. I don’t think so. My gums… sometimes they bleed a little, yes, but I always thought that was just because I brush too hard. My husband always said I had a heavy hand. I haven’t had a nosebleed in… oh, goodness, ages. Not since I was a little girl, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, Darl?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. That’s a good question. Let me think… I think I take something for my water retention. My ankles swell up something awful in the evenings. A small white pill, I believe. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. But I can’t remember the name of that one. My daughter manages most of it, you know. She’s very good with all these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that matches what I’m seeing here. So, you’re taking a diuretic for swelling in your ankles, and a pain reliever when needed for your knees. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always been quite robust, you know. I used to eat anything and everything! My husband used to say I had an iron stomach. I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. Although… I think I had a bit of a rash once, many years ago, after eating some shellfish. But I’m not even sure it was the shellfish. It could have been anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, thank you. Now, before we get to the blood draw, I just want to quickly check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I always feel a bit silly when they take my temperature. I’m sure I don’t run a fever. But… if you think it’s necessary, go right ahead. Just be gentle, please. My skin is a bit thin these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick squeeze here… and there. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82, which is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Your pulse is 78, which is nice and steady. And your temperature is 98.6, perfectly normal. Now, let's go ahead with the blood draw. I'll just need to clean the area on your inner arm with an antiseptic wipe… it’ll feel a little cold. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s good, isn’t it? Normal. I like normal. The arm… hmm. I think… this one is better. It’s a bit achy, but I think it’s stronger than the other one. And… I don’t think I’ve had a shot in that arm recently. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Darl. Avoiding the arm where you’ve recently had a shot is a good idea. We’ll use this one. It might feel like a little pinch… just for a moment. And then we'll be all done. Alright, here we go…
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Just be quick, please, Doctor. I don’t like needles. Not one bit. My husband always used to hold my hand… Is it over already?
DOCTOR: Alright, all done, Darl. You did wonderfully. Just a little pressure here for a few moments to stop the bleeding. There we go. All patched up. See?
PATIENT: Oh… That wasn’t so bad, was it? Thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle. Now… what happens next? Do I need to stay here? Or can I go home and… have a little lie down? I’m a bit tired all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: You were very brave, Darl. And yes, you can absolutely go home and have a lie down. We’ll send the blood sample to the lab, and it usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. We'll call you as soon as we have them to discuss them. In the meantime, just keep the bandage on for a few hours and avoid heavy lifting with that arm. Is there anyone who will be with you at home?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, Elena. She’s a very good girl. Always looking after me. She’ll be glad to hear it’s over. A couple of days… alright. I can manage that. It’s just… all this talk of blood makes me a little anxious, you know? I never was very good with… well, anything medical. Do you think… everything is alright? It’s not anything serious, is it? I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious, Darl. And it’s good you’re asking. We’re just checking your blood type as a precaution, as your daughter requested. It's helpful information to have on file for emergencies. Based on what we've discussed and my initial examination, I don't have any immediate concerns. The blood draw itself is simply a routine procedure. We’ll have more information once the lab results come back, and we can discuss any necessary next steps at that time. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. And patient. I do get a bit… muddled, you know. It’s the age, I suppose. Thank you for… everything. I think I’ll just go home now and have a nice cup of tea. That’s always a good idea.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Darl. It was my pleasure. And a cup of tea sounds like a wonderful idea. Take it easy, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before we call with the results. Here's a card with our number. Have a good day, and a restful afternoon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I will. You too. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Darl. Take care.
