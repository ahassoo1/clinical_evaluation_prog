DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is... painful. That is why I am here. My back. It hurts a lot. I would like to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I understand you’re experiencing back pain and would like to be as efficient as possible. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this quickly. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Alright. It is… a dull ache, mostly. But when I move… or if I try to lift something… it is a sharp pain. It started about a week ago. I was… putting up fence. It is my work. Fence erecting. I do it for a living.
DOCTOR: I see. So a dull ache that sharpens with movement, particularly when lifting, and it began about a week ago while erecting fences for your work. That gives me a good starting point. Can you tell me where exactly on your back the pain is located?
PATIENT: It is… low. Low on my back. On the left side, mostly. Sometimes it goes around, but it starts there. It is not my… upper back. Lower. Like… where the small of your back is. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Reihner. Lower back, primarily on the left side, sometimes radiating around. And to clarify, it doesn’t affect your upper back at all?
PATIENT: No. Not my upper back. Only the lower. And… it feels stiff. Everything feels very stiff in the morning. Hard to… bend over. That is why I came. It is interfering with my work.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stiffness in the mornings making it difficult to bend, and impacting your ability to work – that’s very important information. Now, have you experienced any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No. Not my legs. Just… my back. Sometimes it feels… tight. But not my legs. I can walk alright. No trouble walking. Just… bending. And lifting. That is the bad part. Everything is heavy when I do my job.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know it’s not radiating down your legs. So, primarily localized lower back pain, with stiffness, exacerbated by bending and lifting. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is… new. I have always been strong. I work hard. But never any trouble with my back before. Not like this. I have had… the usual things. Colds. Flu. But nothing… serious. I have Medicare. Is that alright? Do you need anything else?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. So, no prior history of back problems, just general illnesses like colds and flu. And yes, Medicare is perfectly alright. Now, thinking about other aspects of your health, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. No medications. Never needed any. Just… vitamins. Sometimes. But not now. And… I do not smoke. Never did. And I… do not drink much. A little wine, sometimes. But that is all. I try to eat healthy. When I can. My work is hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no current medications, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and you generally strive for a healthy diet. That’s all very helpful to know. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. None that I know of. I have… never had a problem. Even with bee stings. Nothing. Is that… unusual? I just… don’t have allergies. It is good luck, I suppose. Can we get this over with? I have a fence to finish.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Reihner, that is quite good! It’s certainly helpful to know you have no known allergies. Alright, let’s move on to the physical examination then. I will need you to lie down on your back on the examination table. We’ll start with some gentle range of motion tests, and I will also palpate your spine and surrounding muscles to assess for tenderness or any abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright. If you must. The table looks… hard. But yes. Let us get it done. I have work to do. Be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Reihner. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Ms. Reihner, can you bend forward and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ouch! That… that hurts. I cannot go very far. It is… tight. Like something is… stuck. I cannot… reach my toes. It is too painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. I understand. No need to push through the pain. Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength appears to be within normal limits. However, I do note some tenderness to palpation on the left side of your lower back, and as we observed, limited range of motion, particularly when bending forward. There doesn’t appear to be any neurological deficits at this time. Based on your history and the physical examination, it appears you have a musculoskeletal strain, likely due to the physical demands of your work, specifically erecting fences. While it's difficult to determine the exact cause without imaging, it doesn’t appear to be anything acutely serious, such as a fracture or nerve compression.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Can I still work? I have a fence to finish. Is it going to be a long time? I do not want to be laid up. I need to know. Quick, please. I have a schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about returning to work, Ms. Reihner. A musculoskeletal strain means you’ve likely overstretched or torn the muscles or ligaments in your lower back. It doesn’t mean you’re permanently injured, but it does require time for healing. Continuing to put stress on it, like heavy lifting and bending, will likely worsen the injury and prolong recovery. To help manage the pain and promote healing, I recommend the following: 1. Rest: Avoid strenuous activity for the next few days. 2. Ice: Apply ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. 3. Over-the-counter pain medication: You can take ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce pain and inflammation. Follow the dosage instructions on the label. 4. Gentle stretching: After a few days, when the initial pain subsides, you can start doing some gentle stretches to help improve flexibility. I would also like to order an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any underlying bone issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… alright. If it is quick. And the stretching… gentle. Very gentle. I need to get back to work. How long will the X-ray take? And… can I take something stronger than ibuprofen? That barely does anything. I need to be able to lift things. I have a deadline. Can I get a prescription for something… better? Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I understand your need to return to work quickly. The X-ray will likely take about 15-20 minutes, including the time to get positioned and for the radiologist to review the images. I will have the results sent to me as soon as they are available. Regarding pain medication, I can prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the muscle spasms and a stronger pain reliever for a short period to help manage the pain while the muscle heals. However, it is important to understand that these medications can have side effects and should be used as directed. They are not a long-term solution and may cause drowsiness, so it is important not to operate heavy machinery or drive while taking them. I'm also going to prescribe a short course of physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you proper lifting techniques and exercises to help prevent future injuries. However, please understand that it is important to give your body time to heal. Pushing yourself too hard too soon could lead to a more serious injury. Do you have any questions about the medications or the physical therapy?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… make it quick. And… will the muscle relaxants make me sleepy? I have a lot of work to do. Can I still drive? And… the physical therapy… how many times a week? I do not have a lot of time. Just the essentials. The quickest way to get back to work. That is all I need. Please. Write the prescriptions. And… tell me about the X-ray. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Here are your prescriptions for a muscle relaxant and a pain reliever. The muscle relaxant can cause drowsiness, so it’s important to be cautious when driving or operating machinery. I recommend starting with a lower dose to see how it affects you. If you feel drowsy, please avoid driving. The pain reliever should provide more effective pain relief, but please follow the dosage instructions carefully. The X-ray is located just down the hall, in the radiology department. You can go there anytime today, and they will take the images and send the results to me. As for physical therapy, I’m recommending two sessions a week for the next two weeks. The therapist will assess your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan to help you return to work safely and effectively. I will review the X-ray results as soon as they are available and will contact you to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please rest, ice your back, and take the medications as prescribed. Do you have any further questions at this time, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… get me back to work. Thank you, Doctor. I will go get the X-ray now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I hope you feel better soon. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
