DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Why don't we start with what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone. I don’t really… know much about what’s going on, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. That’s perfectly alright. It’s a lot to take in. So, you were informed about a possible cancer diagnosis… Do you remember who told you, or perhaps what type of cancer was mentioned, even vaguely?
PATIENT: Um… it was the hospital, I think. After some tests. I… they said something about it being in my… chest? But I was very upset and didn’t catch everything. It all happened so fast after my husband… passed. It’s hard to remember details. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t apologize at all, Chellsea. That's completely understandable. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s very common for details to become blurred during times of extreme stress. Chest… okay. That narrows things down a bit. Let me see if I can pull up your records from the hospital. Ah, yes. Chellsea Luft… August 2nd, 2025… It looks like you had a chest X-ray and a CT scan performed on July 18th. The report mentions a concerning mass in the mediastinum. It also notes some enlarged lymph nodes. Do you mind if I ask about any symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Medi… what now? And lymph… nodes? I’m sorry, Doctor, I don’t understand all these words. Symptoms… well, I’ve been very tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And I’ve had a cough. It doesn't really go away. It’s just… a little cough. Not a bad one. But it’s been there for a while. I also sometimes feel… a little breathless, like I can’t quite get enough air. Is that important?
DOCTOR: No, no, it is important, Chellsea. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me when something doesn’t make sense – that’s what I’m here for. The mediastinum is essentially the space in the middle of your chest, between your lungs. And lymph nodes are small glands that are part of your immune system; they can sometimes swell up when something is going on. Tiredness, a persistent cough, and shortness of breath… those are all things we need to investigate further. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. In the middle… I see. Well, the tiredness has been… a long time, really. Months, I think. It’s just gotten worse lately. The cough started maybe two months ago? And the breathlessness… maybe a month. It doesn’t happen all the time, just when I… walk up the stairs or something. Or if I try to do too much. I try not to push myself. It reminds me of… my husband. He… always did everything. I’m not used to doing things myself. Sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize at all. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed, and it’s helpful for me to understand what’s going on in your life. It sounds like your symptoms have been gradually worsening over the past few months. The CT scan shows a mass approximately 5 centimeters in diameter. It appears to be pressing on your trachea – that could explain the breathlessness. It also shows enlarged lymph nodes on both sides of your chest. Now, the report doesn't give a definitive diagnosis, but it mentions the possibility of lymphoma or a primary lung tumor. To get a clearer picture, we’ll need to do a biopsy – that’s where we take a small sample of the mass and examine it under a microscope. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… biopsy? What does that involve? Will it hurt? And what’s… lymphoma? Is that… bad? I’m sorry to ask so many questions. I just… I don’t want to be scared. I really don't understand any of this.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Chellsea. You're not bothering me at all. It's very important to ask questions, and it's completely understandable that you're scared. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the mass. There are a few different ways to do it. In your case, given the location of the mass, it would likely be done with a procedure called a mediastinoscopy. This involves making a small incision in your neck and using a special instrument to reach the mass and take a sample. It’s done under anesthesia, so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. You may experience some discomfort afterwards, but we can manage that with pain medication. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. There are different types of lymphoma, some of which are very treatable. Whether it's "bad" depends on the type and stage of the lymphoma. We won't know that until we have the biopsy results. We'll also want to do some blood tests and a PET scan to get a better understanding of the extent of the disease. Does that all make sense so far?
PATIENT: Okay… a small cut… and I won’t feel it? And blood tests… I can do blood tests. A PET scan… is that like the CT scan? With the big machine? It’s just… a lot. It’s all happening so fast. I feel… overwhelmed. And scared. I really don’t want to go through this alone. Do I… have to make a decision right now? About the biopsy?
DOCTOR: It is a lot, Chellsea, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and scared. And no, you absolutely do not have to make a decision right now. Take all the time you need. A PET scan is similar to a CT scan, yes – you lie on a table and go through a large machine. However, it uses a radioactive tracer to help us identify areas of abnormal activity in your body. It gives us a more detailed picture of the disease. And you definitely won't go through this alone. I'm here to guide you through every step of the process. We have a wonderful oncology team, and we can also connect you with a social worker who can provide emotional support. For now, let's focus on getting you scheduled for the biopsy. We can discuss all your options after we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better. Getting scheduled… and then we talk. And I can talk to someone… about… everything? That would be helpful. Yes, please. Scheduling sounds good. But… will it cost a lot of money? I’m on Medicare… but I don’t want to cause problems. I don’t have a lot of savings.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Chellsea. Let’s absolutely address that. We have a dedicated financial counselor who can help you navigate your Medicare coverage and explore any available assistance programs. They can also work with the hospital billing department to ensure you understand all the costs involved. Okay, let me see… we can get you scheduled for a mediastinoscopy with Dr. Ramirez next week, on Wednesday the 13th. Does that date work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday… the 13th. That… sounds alright. Yes, I think so. I’ll have to… arrange someone to drive me. I don’t drive after… everything. And I’ll need to talk to someone about… what to do beforehand. Like, should I eat? Or not eat? And what will happen… afterward? I get… anxious. Easily. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t apologize. It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, and we’ll make sure you're well-prepared. I'll have the nurse call you tomorrow with detailed instructions about the procedure, including dietary restrictions and what to expect beforehand and afterward. They can also answer any questions you have. And we’ll also connect you with our social worker, Ms. Evans. She’ll reach out to you to schedule a time to talk. She can help you with practical matters like transportation and support resources, and also provide emotional support. We’ll get through this together, Chellsea. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. And for not… rushing me. I really appreciate that. I’m still scared… but I feel… a little better. Knowing what to expect… helps. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. And you should know that your feelings are completely valid. It takes courage to face something like this, and I'm proud of you for taking the first step. Remember, we're here for you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you on Wednesday. .
