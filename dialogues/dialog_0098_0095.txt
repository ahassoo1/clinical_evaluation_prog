DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’d rather not be here. I have a very busy schedule, and this… inconvenience… appeared out of nowhere. I woke up yesterday and half my face feels like it’s melting. And I can’t hear on this side. It’s quite disruptive. Don’t tell me it’s stress. I manage perfectly well under pressure, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. It’s never convenient to be unwell, especially with a busy schedule. And it sounds quite concerning – facial weakness and hearing loss coming on suddenly. We'll certainly try to figure out what’s going on. Just to clarify, you said this started yesterday morning?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday morning. Woke up, went to get dressed, and that’s when I noticed it. The…droopiness. And then I realized I couldn't hear properly when someone spoke on my left side. It wasn't gradual, it was just… there. And it hasn’t improved, I might add. I expect a quick diagnosis and a swift resolution. I haven’t got all day to sit here.
DOCTOR: Okay, sudden onset is important. And you’re right to want answers quickly. To help me understand what might be happening, could you tell me a little more about the “droopiness”?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to explain. The left side of my face just doesn’t move the same way. When I smile, it pulls to the right. It looks… asymmetrical. Frankly, it’s quite unsettling. I looked in the mirror, and it’s not a pleasant sight. I don’t typically concern myself with appearances, but this is… noticeable. Is it obvious to others? Because I do have a certain reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: I understand. Asymmetry can be very concerning, and you’re right to want to know if it's noticeable. We’ll definitely assess that. Would you mind if I perform a quick neurological exam?
PATIENT: A… neurological exam? What exactly does that involve? I’m not fond of being poked and prodded. And will it be… painful? I have a low tolerance for discomfort, you see. I prefer to be informed before anything happens. Honestly, this is all rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's a very standard exam, and not painful at all. I’ll be checking your facial movements, reflexes, and sensation – just to see how your nerves are functioning. I’ll also look in your ears and possibly check your balance. It will help me narrow down the possible causes of what’s happening. It should only take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And please be gentle. I’m not accustomed to being handled. Honestly, I expect this is a simple fix. Perhaps a pinched nerve? I’ve read things online, you know. And don't bother with complicated explanations. Just tell me what I need to do to get this resolved.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s just have you close your eyes tightly, and I'll check your forehead wrinkles. Then I’ll ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and puff out your cheeks. Just try to relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to look in your ears.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is rather undignified. Are you sure you’re not just making this up? It feels perfectly normal to me. Well, aside from the inability to hear and the… facial imbalance. But I'm a radiologist, I understand anatomy. I doubt a simple look in my ear will reveal anything groundbreaking. Do proceed, but I fully expect a more thorough investigation if this doesn't yield results. A CT scan, perhaps? I have access to the best facilities, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything looks normal in the ear, which is good. The hearing test confirms some difficulty on the left side, as you’ve already noticed. Now, I want to test a few reflexes, and just check your sensation on your face. Again, just let me know if anything feels unusual. Based on what I'm seeing, this sounds like it could be Bell’s palsy. It's a condition that causes sudden weakness in the facial muscles. It’s thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. But to be absolutely sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a CT scan, as you suggested. We should also get some blood work.
PATIENT: Bell's…palsy? Is that serious? Will I be… disfigured permanently? I have important meetings, presentations… my image is rather crucial. And blood work? Honestly, I haven't had blood drawn in years. This is becoming increasingly inconvenient. And a CT scan, fine. But I want it done immediately. And I expect the results to be expedited. I don’t have time to sit around waiting. What’s the treatment for this… Bell’s palsy? Is it painful? Will I need surgery? Just tell me straight, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take this one step at a time. Bell's palsy is not usually serious, and the vast majority of people make a full recovery. It's rarely caused by something more serious. While it can cause temporary facial weakness, permanent disfigurement is uncommon. The blood work is just to rule out other possibilities, like Lyme disease or a stroke. It's standard procedure. I've already put in the order for the CT scan and blood work. The radiology department is aware, and I've requested expedited results. As for treatment, the most common approach is a course of corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation. We can also prescribe antiviral medications. The goal is to start treatment as soon as possible. Pain is not always present, but some people experience discomfort behind the ear or in the jaw. We can prescribe pain medication if needed. Surgery is rarely necessary. We'll monitor your progress closely, and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Corticosteroids… those have side effects, don’t they? I’m rather careful about what I put into my body. And antiviral medications… honestly, this sounds increasingly complicated. Fine. Do the tests. Give me the medications. But I expect a detailed explanation of the potential side effects. And I want to know exactly how long this is going to take. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. And if this doesn't improve within a week, I'm seeking a second opinion. I have connections, you know. Very influential connections. Honestly, this is all rather… disruptive. Is there anything else? I'd prefer to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your concerns, and I'll make sure you have a detailed information sheet outlining the potential side effects of both medications. We will closely monitor you for any adverse reactions. The CT scan results should be available within a few hours, and the blood work results within 24-48 hours. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. I want to assure you that we're taking this very seriously, and we'll do everything we can to help you recover as quickly and comfortably as possible. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And I will provide you with a written referral for a neurologist, as you requested. Thank you for coming in today.
