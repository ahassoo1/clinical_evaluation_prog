DOCTOR: Hello, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is… a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Um, well, it's rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been… unsteady, I suppose. A bit wobbly on my feet. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's… concerning. I don't quite recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “unsteady” – that’s a good place to start. And you said “a little while now”?
PATIENT: Yes… a little while. Perhaps… a few months? It feels longer, but… time does seem to slip away. I truly wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It’s not a sudden thing, more of a gradual… worsening, if that makes sense. I don't remember any specific event that caused it, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual worsening over a few months with no specific injury or event. That's helpful. Can you describe what you mean by “unsteady”?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like walking on a boat, perhaps? Not severely, but… a feeling that I might fall. Especially when I turn my head quickly, or… reach for something. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. Sometimes I feel perfectly normal, and other times… I have to hold onto things. It hasn't caused a fall yet, thankfully, but it's quite frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like you're off balance, and it's worse with head movements or reaching. And it hasn’t led to any falls, yet. That's good to know. Do you notice it more in certain situations – like walking in the dark, or when you’re tired, perhaps?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. I believe… yes. It is worse when I’m fatigued, definitely. And… walking on uneven ground is particularly difficult. I work… outside, you see, so that's… unavoidable. Also, I think it's a bit worse in dim light, but that might just be my anxiety speaking. It's hard to tell, honestly. I do spend a lot of time outdoors, as part of my occupation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and uneven ground make it worse. And potentially dim light. You mentioned you work outside – what kind of work do you do, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I am a rotary drill operator. In the oil and gas industry. It requires… a good deal of physical strength and… balance, naturally. It's rather demanding work. I have been doing it for several years now. It’s… ironic, isn’t it? To be unsteady while being responsible for operating such machinery.
DOCTOR: It is ironic, yes. And a physically demanding job. Okay, let’s talk a bit more about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My memory isn’t what it once was. I believe… no, not that I am aware of. I’ve always been relatively healthy, as far as I know. I lost my husband… some time ago, and he handled most of the medical appointments. I don't recall any specific diagnoses. I do have private insurance, if that’s helpful. I’m afraid I’m not very good at recalling these details.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you said your husband typically handled medical appointments. That’s alright, we’ll work through this. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing any surgeries. I recall… a broken arm when I was a child, but that healed quite well on its own, I believe. Nothing since then. It’s… strange. I feel as though there should be something, but I simply can’t recall it. Perhaps my husband kept better records.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family. Is there a family history of any medical conditions – things like dizziness, balance problems, heart issues, neurological problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: That… is a tricky one. My family… we aren’t very close, and I haven’t seen most of them in many years. I know my mother had… some sort of ailment when she was older, but I don’t recall what it was. Something with her… legs, perhaps? It was never discussed in detail. And my father… he passed away when I was young. I'm afraid I don't have much information about their medical histories, Doctor. It’s… unfortunate, but that’s the truth.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family medical history. That’s alright. Let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking any medications right now – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not taking any medications. I don’t typically take anything, unless I have a headache, in which case I might take… ibuprofen, perhaps? But that’s infrequent. I generally try to avoid medication if possible. I believe I’m quite healthy, otherwise. I have… not been prescribed anything recently, that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And you occasionally use ibuprofen for headaches. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, that I recall. I sometimes get a mild rash if I’m bitten by mosquitoes, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I haven’t experienced any serious allergic reactions, to medications or food. I believe I’m generally quite tolerant of most things. But… it's difficult to be certain, Doctor. My memory… is unreliable, as you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s move on to a physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’ll do a brief neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I am a little anxious, if I may be honest, but I understand it’s necessary to determine the cause of this… unsteadiness. I will do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's perfectly normal to be anxious. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please sit here and relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Everything looks normal there. Now, I'm going to have you stand up slowly. Okay, good. Now, can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes… I can. It’s… a little difficult, actually. I feel… less steady now. I am trying my best, Doctor. I can feel myself swaying slightly. Should I… open my eyes? I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it's expected. Just let me know if you feel like you’re going to fall. Okay, you are swaying slightly, but maintaining your balance. Now, can you walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Yes… I can try. This is… more difficult than I anticipated. Oh! That was… close. I am trying very hard to keep my balance, Doctor. It feels… unnatural, walking this way. I feel… quite unsteady. Perhaps I should stop? I don’t want to risk a fall.
DOCTOR: It's alright, let's stop there. You did well. I observed some mild unsteadiness, particularly with the heel-to-toe walking. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and some basic coordination. Please sit back down. Okay, your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems intact. However, I did note some slight nystagmus when you followed my finger with your eyes. It’s very subtle, but present. Based on what I’ve observed – the gradual onset of unsteadiness, worsening with fatigue and uneven ground, slight nystagmus – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to your inner ear, a mild neurological issue, or even something simple like dehydration. We need to do some further testing. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any serious issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… of my brain? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it something to be alarmed about? I… I'm not sure I understand. Dehydration… that seems unlikely. I drink plenty of water. And my inner ear… I haven’t experienced any ringing or pain. Perhaps it’s nothing? I am… quite anxious now. What are we looking for, exactly? Is it… something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned when we talk about tests like an MRI. The MRI isn't something to be alarmed about, it’s a very sensitive imaging test that allows us to get a detailed look at your brain. We're looking to rule out any structural problems, like a small stroke, a tumor, or multiple sclerosis. These are less common possibilities, but it's important to rule them out to get a clear diagnosis. Dehydration was just one possibility, and you're right, it's unlikely if you drink plenty of water. The complete blood count and metabolic panel will check for any underlying medical conditions, like anemia or electrolyte imbalances, that could be contributing to your symptoms. It’s important to be thorough, and the tests will help us determine the cause of your unsteadiness and develop an appropriate treatment plan. We’re not jumping to conclusions, we're simply gathering information. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Anemia… I suppose that’s possible. I haven't been eating very well lately, if I'm honest. But a tumor… or multiple sclerosis? That sounds… frightening. Is it… common, for someone my age? I… I don’t understand how these things happen. And the MRI… is it painful? Will I be… confined in a small space? I have… a slight aversion to enclosed spaces. Perhaps… could we discuss other options? Before we proceed with something so… invasive? I truly appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor, but I am… quite overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Lilyanna. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when faced with these possibilities. And you’re right to ask about the MRI. Multiple sclerosis is less common, particularly at your age, but it’s important to rule it out. It usually presents with other neurological symptoms as well, which you haven’t described. The MRI itself isn't painful. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It can be a bit loud, and some people feel claustrophobic. We can provide you with headphones to reduce the noise, and we can give you a mild sedative if you're feeling anxious. If you are severely claustrophobic, we can discuss an open MRI, which is less enclosed, but the image quality isn’t quite as good. We can also talk about whether a CT scan of the brain might be an alternative initial step, although it doesn’t provide as much detail as an MRI. Before we make any decisions, let’s focus on what we do know. I’m going to write you a prescription for a complete blood count and metabolic panel, and I’m also going to recommend you increase your iron intake through diet or supplements. We'll get those results back quickly, and then we can discuss the next steps, including the possibility of further imaging. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds much better, Doctor. Starting with the blood tests and increasing my iron intake. That feels… less daunting. A CT scan… perhaps that would be a good alternative, if the blood tests are normal. I truly appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, and offering me options. The idea of being confined in that machine… it’s quite unsettling. And I do worry about the quality of the image, if we choose the open MRI. Yes, let’s start with the blood tests. And I will try to improve my diet. Perhaps some spinach and… red meat? I’m not sure. I truly hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad we could come up with a plan you feel comfortable with. Increasing your iron intake is a good first step, and spinach and red meat are both excellent sources. I’ll write you a prescription for the blood tests, and I’ll also provide you with a list of iron-rich foods. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we're going to take this one step at a time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been… incredibly helpful. Thank you for your patience, your understanding, and your thoroughness. I truly appreciate it. I will contact the lab to schedule the blood tests, and I will try to improve my diet. And I will reach out if I have any further questions. Thank you again, Doctor Piet. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
