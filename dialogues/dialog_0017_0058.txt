DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, it's my weight. I'm hoping you might have something to help me lose a few pounds. It’s become… difficult, you see.
DOCTOR: Difficult, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s not like it used to be, Doctor. I used to be able to… well, keep it in check with my work, you know? Model making keeps you moving, but it's harder now. I get tired easier, and… things just seem to stick to me more, if you understand. I'm not as active as I once was, and it's showing. It's just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating is a subjective term, Mr. Osumi. Let’s try to be more precise. When did you notice this change in your ability to “keep it in check,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… Probably… oh, maybe about six months ago? It wasn't sudden, just… gradual. I started noticing my clothes feeling tighter. Then, I started getting winded walking up the stairs at home. Little things, you know? But they added up. Six months feels right, yes. It was around the time… well, around the time my wife passed. Everything changed then, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Six months. And this coincided with… a personal loss, you state. I see. While I appreciate emotional context, we must focus on the physiological. Have you made any changes to your diet in the past six months?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat… well, I eat pretty much the same as I always have. Rice, fish, vegetables… Chamorro food, mostly. My wife did most of the cooking, and honestly, I haven’t changed much since… since she’s been gone. I try to eat healthy, but… it's just hard to motivate myself sometimes. I don't have much of an appetite, either, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: A lack of appetite and weight gain. An interesting combination. Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Osumi?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribes for my age, Doctor. For my blood pressure, a small pill every morning. And sometimes, something for my arthritis when it flares up. Nothing else, I assure you. Medicare sends me what I need.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine 5mg daily, and occasional Naproxen. Very well. Now, let's conduct a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale. And I'll need you to remove your shoes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. I always try to be helpful. I understand you’re a busy man. Let's get this done, shall we?
DOCTOR: 80 kilograms. Height is listed as 170 centimeters… that puts your BMI at 27.9. Overweight, but not severely so. Blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Is that bad, Doctor? I don't really understand all that… BMI business. I just know I'm carrying a little extra weight. And yes, I can let you check my blood pressure. Just tell me what you need.
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. Elevated. Not alarming, but requires attention. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished breath sounds. Now, abdomen. Soft, non-tender. No masses. We'll need some blood work. A complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone. And I’d like an ECG, just to be safe.
PATIENT: That's… a lot of tests, Doctor. Is it that serious? I just thought maybe a pill or something… Are those tests expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you see, and… well, Medicare covers some, but…
DOCTOR: Mr. Osumi, a thorough evaluation is always the first step. We must rule out underlying causes for your weight gain and elevated blood pressure. While I understand your concerns about cost, delaying a proper diagnosis could lead to far more expensive complications later. Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, but you'll need to verify your coverage with them. Let's not dwell on hypotheticals. The lab requisition is being printed now. Schedule the ECG with the receptionist on your way out.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it’s best… I’ll get it done. I suppose you're right. Better to be safe. I just wish there was a quicker way. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: See the receptionist. And try to focus on making small, sustainable changes to your diet. That's all. .
