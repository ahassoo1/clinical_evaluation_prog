DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor, yes. Chest… feels funny. And heart… goes too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they said high. Just want to fix it, quickly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. “Funny” in your chest… can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Like… squeezing. Not bad bad, but… uncomfortable. Like someone is sitting on it. And then… thump-thump-thump. Too much. Not normal. I don't know what "details" you want. It just feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, a squeezing sensation and a racing heart. And you mentioned your blood pressure has been high – do you know when that was checked, and what the reading was, if you recall?
PATIENT: Yesterday. At the pharmacy. Old lady checked it. Said… lots of numbers. I don't remember. Too many numbers for an old man like me. Just said it was “high.” I don't need numbers. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. Numbers can be overwhelming. Let's focus on what you feel. This squeezing… does it happen with activity, or at rest?
PATIENT: Mostly… when I’m doing things. Walking, you know? Or even just… getting dressed. When I rush. If I sit, it’s… better. Not gone, but better. I don't have time to sit all day, Doctor. My wife… she needs help.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s related to activity, and improves with rest. And you mentioned your wife needs your help… is there a lot of physical activity involved in the help you provide?
PATIENT: She… can't do much. Old age, you know? I do the shopping. Cooking. Cleaning. Little things. But… she's heavy. Sometimes I have to… help her up. That’s when the chest… really bothers me. It's not a big deal. Just… gets tiring.
DOCTOR: I see. So, some lifting involved as well. And this has been happening for…?
PATIENT: Oh, a while now. Months, maybe? I don't keep track of these things. It comes and goes. Sometimes I feel fine for a day or two. Then it starts again. It’s annoying, that's all. Can we just get some pills for it? I don’t want a long exam.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to be quick, Mr. Sobkowicz. However, to ensure I prescribe the right medication, and to rule out anything serious, I do need to ask a few more questions, and perhaps do a brief examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Examination? How brief? I don't like doctors poking around. And what kind of questions? If it's about my childhood, forget it. I just want something to stop the chest pain. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Sobkowicz, that is not too much to ask at all. The examination will be quite brief – I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and perhaps take your blood pressure again. The questions will be about your medical history – any other illnesses you've had, medications you're taking, and allergies. Nothing about your childhood, I assure you. Just enough information to ensure your safety. Would you be willing to let me do that?
PATIENT: Fine. But quick. And no needles. I hate needles. Just listen and poke. That's it. And then the pills. I have a garden to tend to. My tomatoes are ripening.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Sobkowicz. No needles, I promise. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and then exhale slowly. I'm hearing a slightly rapid heart rate, as you mentioned. And there's a faint crackling sound in your lower lungs when you breathe deeply. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? No. Bron… what? Never had those. Always been strong. Worked hard all my life. Maybe a little cough sometimes, in the winter. But nothing serious. Just old age. Stop poking. It's making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Just checking. Now, could you tell me if you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Penicillin. Bad reaction when I was young. Swelled up like a balloon. Doctor gave me a shot... then I got sick. Very sick. Don't give me penicillin. That's all I know. Everything else is fine. Just no penicillin.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my… water. Old age. Makes me go to the bathroom a lot. That’s it. Nothing else. And don't ask about vitamins. I don't remember. My wife buys them. She likes those fancy things.
DOCTOR: Alright. A medication for your bladder. Do you know the name of it?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. Too many numbers and letters. She fills the little plastic thing every week. That's all I know. Look, Doctor, are we getting to the pills yet? I really need to get going. Tomatoes won't pick themselves.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your urgency. However, to prescribe the right medication safely, I need a little more information. Based on what you've told me – the chest discomfort, racing heart, crackling in your lungs, and your history of a penicillin allergy – it sounds like you might be experiencing some congestion, possibly related to fluid buildup. We need to rule out a more serious cardiac issue before starting any treatment. I'd like to order a simple chest X-ray and an EKG – that's a quick test that checks your heart’s rhythm. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray? EKG? More tests? This is ridiculous! I just want a pill! Look, I’m an old man. I’ve lived a long life. If my heart’s going to stop, it’s going to stop. No need to poke and prod and take pictures. Just give me something for the chest pain and let me go home. I'm wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration, and I respect your wishes. However, I am ethically obligated to ensure your safety. Given your symptoms, and without a proper assessment, prescribing a medication could be harmful. I strongly recommend we proceed with the X-ray and EKG. If you are absolutely opposed, I can offer a referral to a cardiologist for a second opinion. Would you prefer that?
