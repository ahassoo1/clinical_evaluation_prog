DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? I haven't the faintest idea why my…associate insisted I come. Something about…nerves, I believe. Utter nonsense, if you ask me. I’ve been a teacher for…well, a very long time. One develops a certain…resilience. I simply wish to be done with this, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, we can certainly take things as quickly as you’d like. Just to be thorough – and sometimes things do present in subtle ways – could you tell me a little more about what prompted your associate to suggest a visit?
PATIENT: Prompted? Well, young Miss…Petrova, I believe her name is, has a rather…overactive imagination. She claims I’ve been…irritable. And…less enthusiastic. Absolute rubbish. Students are…students. One can’t expect sunshine and roses all the time. It’s simply the nature of the…profession. Really, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Is there a questionnaire I can simply complete? This is rather tedious.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that. A questionnaire might be helpful, but it's often best to just talk things through first, if you don’t mind. It helps me get a better picture. So, this irritability... has that been new, or something you've experienced on and off for a while?
PATIENT: “On and off”? Doctor, I have maintained a certain…dignity for eight decades. One does not simply have “on and off” bouts of…irritation. Perhaps Miss Petrova noticed a particularly…challenging lecture I delivered. These young people lack the proper respect for… scholarship these days. Honestly, it’s a wonder they manage to tie their shoes. If you must press, I suppose I have been…less tolerant of…foolish questions. But that is hardly a cause for medical intervention, is it?
DOCTOR: I see. And has this been accompanied by any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Changes? Good heavens, Doctor, I maintain a very strict regimen. Eight hours of sleep, precisely. A light breakfast – toast, always toast – and a sensible dinner. I do not indulge in…excess. My energy? Perfectly adequate, thank you very much. I still manage to grade papers until the late hours, you know. Though, admittedly, the quality of the submissions has…deteriorated considerably. Is this truly necessary? I have a luncheon appointment, you see. A rather important one.
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture, sir. Sometimes even small changes can be important. Now, have you noticed any difficulties with your memory lately?
PATIENT: Memory? Doctor, I teach history! It is, rather ironically, my profession. My memory is… impeccable. Though, names… sometimes slip my mind. These students all look the same, you know. A blur of… youthful enthusiasm, or perhaps it is apathy. It’s difficult to tell. Really, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance. Are we done yet? This is quite… distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. I understand your frustration. Just one more quick question, then we can move on. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Perfectly sound. I walk every morning, you know. A brisk pace. Keeps me… regular. Numbness? Tingling? Whatever are you implying, Doctor? I assure you, my physical condition is…adequate. Honestly, I find these questions rather…personal. Is this standard procedure? I think I preferred Miss Petrova’s initial assessment. At least she understood the importance of… brevity. Are we quite finished?
DOCTOR: Okay, sir. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you're generally in good health. It's possible this is just a bit of stress or perhaps some normal changes associated with age. However, given your associate's concerns, and the fact that you've mentioned some changes in tolerance and remembering names, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam, just to be safe. It's very straightforward – just checking your reflexes, balance, and a few simple things. It shouldn't take more than five minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Doctor, are you implying that I am… deficient? I have spent my life immersed in intellectual pursuits! The very idea! Miss Petrova never suggested anything of the sort. And frankly, I find this rather insulting. No, thank you. I will not be subjected to…prodding. I believe I have wasted quite enough of my time already. Good day, Doctor. .
