DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m…concerned about my weight. It’s been increasing lately, and I haven’t changed my eating habits or exercise routine. It’s just…unexpected. And a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weight fluctuations can certainly be concerning when they occur without an obvious cause. It’s good you’re addressing it now. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about how long you’ve noticed this weight gain?
PATIENT: Approximately…six months, I would say. It wasn’t drastic at first, just a pound or two. But in the last three months, it’s been…more noticeable. I’ve gained, oh, perhaps fifteen pounds overall, give or take. It’s… unusual for me. I usually maintain a fairly stable weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, with a more noticeable gain in the last three. Fifteen pounds overall. That's helpful to know. And you said you haven’t made any changes to your diet or exercise routine?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No changes at all. I eat the same foods, the same portions… and I walk nearly every day. It’s a habit, really. About thirty minutes, brisk pace. My husband and I used to walk together, but… he passed away last year. So now I walk alone, but the routine remains the same.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Selbitschka. That must have been incredibly difficult. It's understandable that you've maintained routines for a sense of normalcy. Let's focus on the weight gain for now. Besides the weight gain itself, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was…a considerable loss. Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I sleep alright, perhaps a little more than usual, but nothing significant. I haven't been feeling particularly tired, and my appetite is… normal, I suppose. No changes in bowel habits, no swelling in my ankles… just the weight. It’s rather perplexing, isn’t it? It feels… disconnected from anything obvious.
DOCTOR: It is perplexing, and it's good you've been observant of other potential symptoms. Let’s move on to some medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. Nothing major, certainly. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. And I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was… decades ago. I do have… well, a family history of high blood pressure, on my mother’s side. But I haven’t been diagnosed with it myself. I’ve had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy from time to time, and it’s always been… acceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical diagnoses, childhood illnesses, tonsillectomy, and a family history of hypertension. Thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries, aside from the tonsils?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. The tonsils were the only surgery I’ve ever had. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard, I suppose. I try to avoid hospitals whenever possible. I don't find them…pleasant places.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid medication if I can. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, as much as possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s the extent of it. Oh… and sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, if absolutely necessary. But it’s rare. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, occasional ibuprofen, and a multivitamin. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve never had a reaction. I’ve been stung by a bee once, as a child, but it was just a local reaction, a bit of swelling. Nothing severe. I do hope we're getting closer to understanding what might be causing this weight gain. It's rather worrying, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Selbitschka, and we are working towards that. It’s good to rule things out. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My husband smoked, for a time, but I always insisted he smoke outdoors, and eventually he stopped altogether. I find the habit… unpleasant. And unhealthy, of course. I've always been rather careful about my health, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I… occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, Doctor. Perhaps once or twice a week. But it’s never more than one glass. And sometimes I skip it altogether. It's more of a social thing, really, when friends come over. I don’t drink to excess, and I certainly don’t rely on it. I assure you, it’s not a factor.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Selbitschka. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Now, to help me understand the situation better, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you are comfortable with that. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be fine. Although, as I mentioned, my blood pressure has always been acceptable when checked at the pharmacy. Still, I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please, proceed. I just…hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a few errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka. We'll be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. It's good you've had normal readings in the past, but this is something we'll want to keep an eye on. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Finally, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, but I do feel some mild fullness. Do you experience any bloating or discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… I have been feeling a little…bloated, particularly in the evenings. It's not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. A feeling of fullness, even after eating only a small amount. I assumed it was just… indigestion, or something similar. Perhaps it’s more significant than I thought. Is that… unusual, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Ms. Selbitschka. The bloating, combined with the fullness and your weight gain, is something we need to investigate further. Given your age, weight gain, elevated blood pressure, and reported bloating, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help us assess your thyroid function, kidney function, liver function, and glucose levels. It will also help rule out any other potential underlying causes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Anything that might help determine the cause of this…problem. Blood work is fine. Where do I go to have that done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I do hope it's not too long. I have a busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll write you a requisition form for the lab at the clinic across the street – 123 Main Street. They usually have quick turnaround times – results should be back within 3-5 business days. The lab technician will explain the process when you arrive. In the meantime, I would like you to start keeping a detailed food diary, noting everything you eat and drink, along with the time and portion size. Also, please track any symptoms you experience, such as bloating, fatigue, or changes in bowel habits. This will give us a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. A food diary… and symptom tracking. I can manage that. It all feels rather… overwhelming, to be honest. But I understand the need for thoroughness. Three to five business days… I’ll be sure to check back then. And, if I experience any… significant changes in my condition before then, I should contact you immediately, correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. If you experience any concerning symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, difficulty breathing, or sudden weight loss – please contact the clinic immediately. We'll review the results when they come back and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. We're taking the necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time and…attention. I appreciate your thoroughness, despite my… concerns. I will be sure to contact you if anything changes. Three to five business days. Yes. Goodbye, Doctor Rakosky.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Goodbye, and take care.
