DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and…hungry, too. It’s just been…a lot more than usual, if you understand. It’s rather disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I work in shipping and receiving, and you need to be…focused, you see? Constantly going to the break room for water or a snack isn’t exactly ideal. It’s impacting my productivity, and…well, my employer isn’t overly pleased.
DOCTOR: Right. So, increased thirst and hunger. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s been…probably a couple of months now, I’d say. It started gradually, but it’s definitely gotten worse in the last few weeks. I hadn’t thought much of it at first, just put it down to the weather, honestly. It’s been quite warm.
DOCTOR: A couple of months…and worsening recently. Any other symptoms you’ve noticed alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…I suppose I’ve been going to the lavatory a bit more often than usual. And…I’m rather tired, to be honest. Just generally feeling a bit run down, if you understand. But I thought that was just the job. It's…physical work, after all.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination and fatigue… Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Not that I've noticed, no. I wear glasses, as you can see, and haven't needed a new prescription recently. Everything seems…normal enough, I suppose. Though, I don't stare at things too closely, if you understand. Just general distance viewing.
DOCTOR: Right. Distance viewing only. Any family history of…well, anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a bit tricky. My mother…she had some heart trouble, but I don't recall anything about thirst or hunger. My father… well, he wasn't around much, so I don't really know much about his medical history, if that makes sense. My sister, she’s fine, as far as I know. No unusual complaints, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And no medications, no. I try to avoid them if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a bad back, if needed, but that's it. I prefer to…manage things myself, if you understand.
DOCTOR: No regular medications. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, if you understand. I’ve got work to get back to.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just step over here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take your blood pressure. I’ll also do a quick neurological exam. And, if you don’t mind, I’d like to check your reflexes. Just routine, of course. Deep breaths, please. Everything sounds…normal, within reasonable limits. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Not alarming, but something to keep an eye on. Reflexes are normal. Now, let’s check your weight. 93 kilograms. Height is 170 centimeters. That puts your BMI at…32.3. That’s in the obese range, Mr. Erxleben.
PATIENT: Obese, you say? I suppose I've put on a bit of weight recently, yes. Work is rather stressful, and…comfort eating, I suppose. Still, I wouldn't say obese. I'm a solid build, if you understand. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to consider all factors. I’d like to run some blood tests, just to rule out anything serious. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose level. And a urine sample, of course. We'll check for glucose in your urine as well. Do you have any issues providing a sample?
PATIENT: No, no issues with that, Doctor. I can provide a sample. Though, if I may ask… how long will these tests take? I’ve got a rather full schedule, if you understand. And…is there anything specific you’re looking for? I’m not keen on worrying unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: The tests themselves shouldn't take long, Mr. Erxleben. A few minutes to draw the blood, and a quick urine sample. The results will take a couple of days to come back from the lab. We're looking for signs of diabetes, primarily. The increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and weight gain are all potential symptoms. It’s best to rule it out, or confirm it, so we can proceed with the appropriate treatment. It's standard procedure, really. While we wait for the results, I recommend you try to reduce your sugar intake and get some regular exercise, if possible. It won’t hurt, regardless. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Right. Well, if that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Yes, I can…try to reduce my sugar intake. And…exercise, yes. Though it’s rather difficult with my schedule. Still, I’ll do my best. So, just the blood and urine sample then? And a couple of days for the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the samples. We’ll call you as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – blurred vision, excessive fatigue, unexplained weight loss – please contact the clinic immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Blurred vision, fatigue, weight loss… I’ll keep an eye out. Thank you for your time. I’ll go and wait for the nurse then. I appreciate you seeing me so quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll be in touch. .
PATIENT: .
