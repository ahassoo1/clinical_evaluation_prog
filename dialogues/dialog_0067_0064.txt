DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels… tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain is definitely something we want to take seriously. When did this start?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe… three weeks ago? Around July 10th, I think. Yes, July 10th. My grandson, Mateo, was visiting, and I was helping him build a Lego tower. It was a big tower. Maybe that had something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So, about three weeks ago, around July 10th, it started while you were active – helping Mateo build a Lego tower. Has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: No, not constant. It comes and goes. Mostly when I’m doing something. Like walking up the stairs, or… like I said, with the Legos. Yesterday, I was gardening, and it started then too. But when I’m just sitting, watching TV, I don't feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to exertion. Can you describe the pain more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not a sharp pain, you know? Not like a cut. It’s more… a pressure. Like a heavy weight on my chest. And sometimes, it feels like it's going up into my shoulder, my left shoulder. Not always, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure in the chest, sometimes radiating to the left shoulder… and brought on by activity. Have you noticed anything else that seems to bring it on, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, it feels a little worse when I’m stressed. My daughter, Isabella, she’s having some trouble with her car, and I worry about her a lot. And yesterday, when I was gardening, it was very hot, too. Maybe the heat had something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so stress and heat seem to potentially worsen it as well. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had a headache before, of course, and a little back pain, but this chest thing… this is new. It’s a little scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. The doctor always says my blood pressure is a little high, but he never gives me pills for it. Just tells me to watch my salt. And I don’t have diabetes or cholesterol. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of fruits and vegetables. I do have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Medicare is helpful. And it's great that you're focusing on a healthy diet. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was younger, maybe 20 years ago, I had my gallbladder taken out. That was a little scary, but everything went okay. Other than that, no surgeries. No hospital stays, except for when I had my babies, of course. That was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about 20 years ago, and deliveries, otherwise no significant surgical history. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had some heart trouble when she was older. She had to have a little… a little thing put in her chest, a pacemaker, I think they called it. And my father, he had high blood pressure, like me. But that's about it, really. My brothers and sisters were mostly healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. That’s helpful to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can take most anything. I took some penicillin as a child, and I was fine. And I haven’t tried any new foods lately, nothing that would cause a reaction. I'm pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… sometimes I drink chamomile tea before bed to help me sleep. But that’s it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just chamomile tea. Alright, Sherion, it sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that’s not uncommon when you’re anxious. I’m hearing clear breath sounds in both lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a very faint murmur. It’s subtle, but worth noting. I don't feel any particular tenderness to the touch. Let me check your pulse in all four extremities. Pulses are strong and equal on both sides. Finally, let's take a look at your legs for any swelling. No swelling detected. Okay, Sherion. Everything seems relatively normal on initial examination, but the murmur and your elevated blood pressure are something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A murmur? What does that mean, Doctor? Is that bad? And my blood pressure… I try to watch my salt, I really do.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Sherion. A heart murmur isn’t always a cause for concern. It's just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It can be perfectly normal, especially as we get older. However, it can sometimes indicate a valve problem or other heart condition, so we want to take a closer look. Elevated blood pressure, as you know, can increase your risk for heart disease and stroke, but we can definitely manage that with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, and a blood test to check your cholesterol and other important levels. And I'm also going to order a chest X-ray to rule out any other possible causes of your chest pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Tests are good. I like knowing what’s going on. An X-ray… will that show if my lungs are okay? I haven't been coughing or anything, but it’s good to be sure. And an EKG… is that painful? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. The X-ray will help us make sure there’s nothing going on in your lungs, even if you’re not experiencing any cough or shortness of breath. It's a very quick and painless procedure. As for the EKG, it’s not painful at all. We simply place small stickers, called electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. These stickers detect your heart’s electrical activity and transmit it to a machine. It doesn't involve any needles. It just takes a few minutes. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss them in detail and come up with a plan to manage your chest pain and overall health. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment to review everything. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better. No needles, that’s good. Stickers I can handle. And a follow-up appointment… that’s good too. I like knowing I won’t just be left wondering. When will I get the results, Doctor? And where will I go for these tests? Is it here, in the clinic?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that. The lab and radiology department are both right here in the clinic, so you won't have to go anywhere else. I’m going to write you an order for the EKG and chest X-ray, and I’ll also send a request for the blood test. The lab technician will call you to schedule the blood draw. Usually, the results are available within 2-3 business days. I'll have my nurse, Maria, call you as soon as they are ready to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if your chest pain gets significantly worse, or if you experience any shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, 2-3 days. And Maria will call me. That sounds good. No, I don't think so. Emergency room… okay, I understand. If it gets bad. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little less worried now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. I’m glad I could help. It’s always best to get things checked out, and I’m happy we’re taking these steps to understand what’s going on. Just remember, if anything changes or worsens, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Maria will be in touch soon to schedule your follow-up. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again for listening and explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your kindness. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care.
PATIENT:
