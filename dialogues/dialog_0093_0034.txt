DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I... well, I just moved here. With my husband. And I think I need to, like, get signed up for healthcare stuff? I have Medicare, I think? It’s all a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It can be quite confusing navigating the healthcare system, especially when you're new to an area. We’ll certainly get everything sorted out for you. It’s good you have Medicare, that’s a great start. Before we focus on the administrative side, I do like to get a general understanding of your overall health. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That sounds good. Medical history... um. I don't really remember much, to be honest. I had some stuff when I was little, I think, but… it’s all fuzzy. I’ve mostly been okay, though! I work with machines, so, you know, gotta be careful with that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to have gaps in memory regarding childhood illnesses. We'll focus on what you do remember, and don’t worry if it's not a comprehensive list. You mentioned working with machines. Could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Um, okay. I'm a… a technician. Mechanical stuff. Fixing things, building things. Mostly at the… the plant, just outside of town. It’s pretty good work, keeps me busy. Lots of lifting and… and making sure everything runs smooth. I’ve been doing it for… a few years, I think? It’s mostly safe, but sometimes things… well, things go wrong.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Emileigh. Knowing your occupation is very helpful. “Things going wrong” – could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Um… well, sometimes the machines… jam. Or… break down. And you gotta, like, get in there and fix them really fast. And sometimes… things fall. Or… sparks fly. Nothing major, usually. Just… little scrapes and bumps. Once, I… I think I hit my head, but it wasn’t too bad. I just… felt dizzy for a bit.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your work involves potential risks of injury, even if they haven’t been serious until now. When you hit your head, do you recall approximately when that occurred?
PATIENT: Um… goodness. That’s… hard to say. It was… a while ago. Maybe… last year? Or the year before? I really don’t remember exactly. It wasn’t a big hit, I promise. I just… bumped it on something. And I was dizzy for, like, five minutes, then I was fine. I went back to work.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Emileigh. Even a minor head injury can sometimes have lasting effects, so it’s good we’re discussing it. To get a better picture of your overall health, let's briefly discuss any current symptoms you might be experiencing. Are you having any pain, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, or any other concerns right now?
PATIENT: Um… pain… not really. Sometimes my back aches a little, from lifting stuff at work. But that’s pretty normal, I think. Fatigue… yeah, a little tired sometimes. But who isn’t? Sleep… okay, I guess. I don’t really have trouble sleeping, no. Oh! Sometimes my hands go a little numb, after working on the machines all day. But it goes away pretty fast.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Hand numbness is important to note, especially given your occupation. Does this numbness occur in all of your fingers, or is it specific to certain ones?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s mostly in my thumb and… and the first couple of fingers. Not my pinky. It’s… kind of tingly. And it happens after I’ve been working on something small, for a long time. Like, with little tools. Not when I’m lifting heavy stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history, if you recall anything. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?
PATIENT: Um… not that I remember. I think I had… chickenpox when I was little? And maybe… the flu, a few times? But nothing serious. I don’t think I’ve ever been told I have anything wrong with me. My mom… she took me to the doctor when I was sick, but I don’t remember what they said.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emileigh. It's alright if you don’t have detailed information. We'll proceed with a general check-up to get a better understanding of your current health status. Before we do that, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I eat pretty much anything. And I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to any medicine. I’ve taken… ibuprofen, for headaches. And… cold medicine when I was sick. But nothing else, really. Oh! I think I'm a little sensitive to… really strong smells? Like, perfume. Makes my head hurt sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not really. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen, when my back hurts. But that’s it. No vitamins or anything. I try to eat healthy, so I don’t really need them.
DOCTOR: Alright. To complete the picture, and if you feel comfortable sharing, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… well, my mom… she’s okay. She’s… older now. And she has… arthritis, I think. In her hands. And my dad… he… he passed away a few years ago. He had… something with his heart, I think. But I don't remember much about it. I don't really know much about what he had, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don’t have all the details. Knowing about the arthritis and heart condition in your family is helpful. Now, just a few more general questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Um… no. Definitely not. I don't smoke. And I don't drink. And… no, definitely no drugs. Never have. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emileigh. That's all the questions I have for now. With your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle?
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 128/76. That's within the normal range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength appears to be good. I also notice some mild tenderness in your lower back when I palpate the area. Do you experience pain with specific movements?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, it hurts a little when I bend over. And when I lift something heavy. It’s not… a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like, a really bad pull. And it's worse at the end of the day, after working.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emileigh. Based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like you may be experiencing muscle strain in your lower back, likely related to your work. However, to rule out any other potential causes, and given the hand numbness you described, I would like to order a few simple tests. These include a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel , and an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Um… tests? Are they… expensive? I don’t want to… get into trouble with money. I have Medicare, but… I don’t know how it all works. And X-rays… are those safe? I’ve heard things…
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Emileigh, and I'm happy to address those questions. The tests are relatively inexpensive, and with Medicare, you should be covered for the majority of the cost. We have a billing department that can help you understand any potential out-of-pocket expenses. As for the X-ray, yes, there is a small amount of radiation involved, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits of ruling out any structural issues in your back far outweigh the risks in this case. We use modern equipment that minimizes radiation exposure. We can also discuss alternative imaging options if you're particularly concerned. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Um… okay. If Medicare covers it… and it's not too much radiation… then, yeah, I guess I can do the tests. But please, just explain what they’re for, okay? And what you’re looking for? I just… I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Emileigh. Absolutely no surprises. The complete blood count is a general blood test that checks for things like anemia, infection, and other blood disorders. It gives us a broad overview of your overall health. The basic metabolic panel checks your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar – again, just a general assessment to rule out anything obvious. The X-ray of your lower back will allow us to visualize your bones and identify any signs of arthritis, fractures, or other structural problems that could be contributing to your back pain. It also helps rule out any nerve compression. Essentially, these tests are just a precaution to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and ensure we’re on the right track with treatment. Do you have any other questions about the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that makes sense. Just… how long will it take? And… where do I go? And… what if they find something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's break it down. The blood tests and X-ray can be completed here at the clinic. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the X-ray shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. We can get those ordered right away, and you can have them done before you leave today. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. As for what if they find something wrong, that’s a valid concern, but let’s not jump to conclusions. If the tests reveal any abnormalities, we'll discuss the findings with you in detail, explain your options for treatment, and, if necessary, make a referral to a specialist. We’ll work through everything together, step by step. The goal right now is to get a clearer understanding of what’s causing your back pain and ensure you receive the best possible care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Um… yeah. Okay. Step by step… that sounds… better. Let’s just get it done, then. I want to feel better. Can we start with the blood test?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a great attitude, Emileigh. We’ll get the process started right away. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw your blood. She's very skilled and gentle. After that, we can get the X-ray ordered. Just relax, and remember I’m here if you have any questions or concerns at any point. Sarah will be with you in just a moment.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. It’s my pleasure. While we're waiting for Sarah, just to recap, we've discussed your new healthcare coverage, your occupation as a mechanical technician, and your reported back pain and hand numbness. We’ve also ordered a CBC, BMP, and X-ray of your lower back to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Um… yes. That sounds right. And the hand thing… and the smells. You remembered everything. Thank you for listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I make a point of listening carefully to my patients – your concerns are important, and every detail can be helpful. Sarah, this is Emileigh Bonck. She’s going to need a CBC and BMP drawn. Sarah will take good care of you. Please let me or Sarah know if you feel uncomfortable at any point.
