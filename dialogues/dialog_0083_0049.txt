DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Alanes, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Alanes, you say? Lovely name. Well, it's my hearing, you see. It ain't what it used to be, not by a long shot. Things are gettin’… muffled, I suppose. My daughter, bless her heart, she said I really ought to get it checked. She's probably right, but I can't rightly recall when it started. A little at a time, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. Muffled hearing is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you notice the muffling?
PATIENT: Hmm… when do I notice it… that’s a tricky one. It seems to be worse when there's a lot of noise, maybe? Like, if the television is on and folks are talkin’, it all just… blends together. And sometimes, even when it's quiet, it feels like I'm listenin' through cotton. Not always, mind you. Some days are better than others, I suppose. I used to work in a shoe factory, lots of clatterin’ machines… maybe that had somethin’ to do with it? Though it was a long time ago, goodness knows.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Schneer. The history of working in a shoe factory is very relevant. Prolonged exposure to loud noises is a common cause of hearing loss. So it sounds like the difficulty is more pronounced in noisy environments, but also present to some degree in quieter settings. Would you say it affects one ear more than the other, or is it the same in both ears?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question… I honestly couldn't say. I don't think so, not really. It feels… both, I guess? It’s hard to tell. I never paid much attention to which ear was hearin' better than the other, you see. Just know it’s gettin’ harder to hear, period. Old age, I suppose. Though my mother lived to be ninety-five and she could hear a pin drop!
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schneer. It can be difficult to pinpoint without specific attention. And genetics certainly play a role – it’s wonderful your mother had such good hearing! Let’s move on to a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of, such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor told me a while back my blood pressure was a little high, I think. He put me on a pill for it, but I stopped takin’ it. Didn’t seem to be makin’ much difference, and I didn't like feelin’ so tired all the time. Aside from that… nothin’ really. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, I suppose. And I've got a touch of arthritis in my hands, but that’s about it. I've always been a pretty healthy fella, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know about the high blood pressure and arthritis. It's important that we address the blood pressure again, even if you didn't feel it was effective previously. There are different medications we can try, and managing blood pressure is important for overall health. And just to clarify, when did the doctor tell you about the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes… that must have been… oh, ten years ago, maybe more? It was Dr. Hemmings, a nice young man. He was at the practice before… well, before he moved away. I don’t rightly remember when, but it was a while back. He told me to watch my salt intake, and I tried, but I do love a bit of bacon with my eggs! It wasn't botherin’ me, so I just… stopped takin’ the pills and didn't really think about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. It's good to know the timeline. Ten years ago is quite some time. And I understand enjoying a bit of bacon – it's hard to resist! Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis pills, I suppose you’d call ‘em. Little white ones. I take two of ‘em every morning. And sometimes, when my knees are really botherin’ me, I take a little somethin’ my daughter gives me, but I don't know what it is. She says it's good for the joints. I think it has glucosamine in it? I'm not good with names, dear. I just take what she tells me to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. It's helpful to know about the arthritis medication and the supplement your daughter provides. Do you happen to know the name of the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I've got the bottle somewhere… Ah, here it is. Let me see… it says… Naproxen. Yes, Naproxen. That's the one. And the other one, the one my daughter gives me… hold on… It says… ChondroFlex. That's a mouthful! I told you, I'm not good with names.
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Schneer. Naproxen and ChondroFlex. That’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’ in my life. I eat just about anything. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. I’ve never had a problem with penicillin or any of those other things people are allergic to. Never even had a bad rash. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Schneer. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll check your ears, nose, and throat, and listen to your heart and lungs. It’ll just take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Been goin' to doctors my whole life, and they always poke and prod. Just let me know if it's gonna be cold, my ears are a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I’ll be gentle. Okay, I’m just going to take a look in your ears now. Hmm… there appears to be some cerumen – earwax – present, but nothing particularly concerning. Similar findings on this side. Some earwax, but the ear canal appears clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Also clear on this side. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 150/90.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Hmm… that doesn't surprise me much, I suppose. I do love my salt, like I said. Always have. My wife, God rest her soul, used to nag me about it somethin’ fierce. Still, nothin’ a little bacon can’t fix! So, what does all this mean, doctor? Is my hearin’ really bad? Is there anythin’ you can do about it?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Schneer, your hearing isn’t drastically reduced, but it is certainly affected, likely due to a combination of age and potential noise exposure from your previous work. The elevated blood pressure could also contribute. The earwax I observed could be contributing to the muffled hearing, so I recommend we remove it. We can do that with a simple ear irrigation procedure today. After that, we can perform a formal hearing test – an audiogram – to get a more accurate assessment of your hearing levels. Based on the results of the audiogram, we can discuss options such as hearing aids if needed. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, dear. Get the wax out, test my ears… sounds like a plan. Hearing aids… well, I always thought them things were for old folks. But if that's what I need, I suppose I’ll try ‘em. Anything’s better than not hearin’ a good story, eh? So, let’s get that wax out, then. When can we do the test? And are these hearing aids comfortable? My daughter would want to know that, she worries somethin’ awful.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad you're amenable to that plan. We can perform the ear irrigation right now – it usually takes just a few minutes and is generally very comfortable. Some people experience a slight sensation of fullness or pressure, but it's usually brief. As for the hearing test, we can schedule that for later this week, perhaps Thursday?
PATIENT: Thursday sounds good, dear. That gives me a bit of time to… prepare myself, I suppose. And what about these hearing aids? Are they… noticeable? I don’t want to look like I’ve got somethin’ stuck in my ears, you see. My daughter would have a field day! She always tells me I need to “modernize.”
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schneer. Modern hearing aids are quite discreet. They are significantly smaller and more streamlined than the older models. Many of them fit comfortably inside the ear canal and are virtually invisible. There are also some that sit behind the ear, which are also quite small and come in a variety of colors to blend in with your hair or skin tone. We have several different styles available, and we can find one that suits your needs and preferences. I'll be happy to show you some options and answer all of your questions during the hearing test appointment. Shall we proceed with the ear irrigation now?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s get it over with, then. The sooner the wax is out, the sooner I can hear properly! Just be gentle, dear, my ears are a little tender. And tell me a story while you’re at it. Always helps to have a distraction, eh?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And a story sounds like a good idea. Let me see… Ah, I remember one about a rather mischievous cat my neighbor had… Alright, Mr. Schneer, we've completed the ear irrigation. Do you feel any relief?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, now… that’s… better! Yes, I do feel a bit of relief, thank you, dear. It’s not a miracle, mind you, but things do sound… clearer. Like someone turned up the volume a notch. Not as muffled, that’s for sure. Good work, doctor, good work! Now, about that hearing test… Thursday, you said? What time? And do I need to do anything to prepare for it? Is there anythin’ I should avoid? I wouldn't want to mess it up, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent, I'm glad to hear you're already experiencing some relief! Yes, Thursday at 2:00 PM works well. As for preparation, there’s nothing specific you need to do. Just come as you are. Try to avoid wearing earrings that day, and if you wear a hearing aid, please don't wear it to the appointment. During the test, you’ll be in a soundproof booth, and you’ll be asked to respond when you hear certain tones at different volumes. It’s a very straightforward procedure. It'll take about 30-45 minutes. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that covers it, dear. Two o’clock on Thursday. No earrings, no hearin’ aid… got it. Just come and listen to some beeps, eh? Sounds easy enough. Thank you for your patience, doctor, and for explainin’ everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease. I best be gettin’ home now, my daughter will be wonderin’ where I’ve got to. And she’ll want to hear all about this “ear irrigation” business. Stop by and say hello if you ever need a good story!
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could help. I look forward to seeing you on Thursday. And please, feel free to stop by anytime for a chat. Have a wonderful day, and give your daughter my best. .
