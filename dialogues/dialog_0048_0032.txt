DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... Sink, is it? Yes. It's... a delicate matter, really. Something a man doesn’t often discuss. It’s been... discharging. Down there. I haven't the foggiest idea what brought it on, to be frank. It's rather bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. She’s a practical woman, my dear.
DOCTOR: "Discharging," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A... leakage. A sort of... flow. It's not a torrent, mind you, just... present. And frankly, rather unsightly. I haven't experienced anything like it before, not that I can recall, anyway. Old age, perhaps? Everything begins to... drip, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that is a question. A week? Perhaps two? Time seems to slip away these days, you understand. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a keen eye for such things. It wasn't…immediate. A gradual thing. Before I knew it, she was insisting on a visit. Really, it’s probably nothing, just…a minor inconvenience. But she worries so.
DOCTOR: Right. And any pain associated with this...flow?
PATIENT: Pain... well, not exactly pain. More... a discomfort. A slight burning sensation, perhaps, after… using the facilities. Nothing debilitating, you understand. I’ve endured worse in my time, working with those infernal tractors. But it’s…unpleasant. I wouldn’t call it pleasant. And it’s certainly not something one discusses over tea, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, chills, or changes in your urination—frequency, urgency, difficulty?
PATIENT: Fever? Goodness no, I’ve felt perfectly well otherwise. A bit achy, perhaps, but that’s just old age creeping up on me, I suspect. Chills… no, the summer heat has been rather oppressive, if anything. Urination… well, I suppose I go about as frequently as a man my age ought to. Perhaps a little more… insistent at times. It’s difficult to say, really. Everything feels a bit… out of sorts these days. I wouldn’t say it’s difficult, no. Just… not as smooth as it once was. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or around your…genital area?
PATIENT: Blood… now that is a rather indelicate question, Doctor. I… I haven't actively looked, if you understand. My wife, again, may have mentioned something. A spot, perhaps? I honestly can’t recall. She has a habit of fussing over minor things. It’s probably nothing. I'm an old man, and these things happen, don't they? It wouldn't surprise me if there was a little… discoloration. But I haven't made a dedicated study of it, to be frank. Is it something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Right. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill, I believe. And another one for my…joints. Arthritis, you see. A yellowish capsule. Oh, and sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take a half of a sleeping pill. A small, blue one. That’s about it, I think. Nothing extravagant. And I take a multivitamin every morning, if that counts. My wife insists. She’s very particular about my health, you see. I’m not sure I remember the specific names, to be perfectly honest. They all look rather similar.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. Never had any… adverse reactions, not that I recall. A bit of indigestion sometimes, but that’s probably just the food these days. My wife makes a lovely stew, but it can be a bit… rich. No, I wouldn't say I have any allergies. Certainly not to any of the pills I’m currently taking. I’m a fairly robust fellow, you see. A bit old, perhaps, but robust. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. It's just a standard check. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: An exam, you say? Well, I suppose that’s…necessary. I hadn't anticipated such a thorough investigation. I trust it won't be too… uncomfortable? I’m not as nimble as I once was, you see. And I’m rather particular about my… dignity. But if it’s for the best, I suppose I can manage. Yes, yes, lie down… I’ll just… carefully maneuver myself onto the table. It’s rather high, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: There’s a step stool, Mr. Krok. Take your time. I’ll be right back to assist if needed. Alright, let’s start with your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides. I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Nothing particularly concerning here. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, I’ll need to listen to your bowel sounds… Bowel sounds present in all quadrants, normal intensity. Alright, Mr. Krok, I'm going to need to perform a digital rectal exam. This will allow me to assess your prostate gland and check for any abnormalities. It may be a bit uncomfortable, but it will only take a moment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… digital exam? Oh, dear. Well, I suppose if it’s necessary… My wife will likely be relieved if you find something. She's been hinting at a… check-up for years. But it sounds rather… invasive. And I haven't the flexibility I once had. But yes, yes, proceed if you must. Just… be gentle, Doctor. And please, don’t take too long. This is all rather… unsettling. Do proceed. Quickly, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, which is common for men your age. It wasn't particularly tender to the touch, but it is definitely larger than ideal. I didn't feel any obvious nodules or hard spots, which is good. Now, I'm going to order a urinalysis and a PSA blood test to get a better picture of what's going on. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the PSA test will measure the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. It can help us determine if further investigation is needed. I’ll have the lab results back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Also, try to urinate frequently and completely. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Increased fluids... avoiding caffeine... my wife will be pleased; she's been harping on that for years. And... a blood test? Is it… a painful one? I haven't the strongest constitution, you see. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean, exactly? Is it serious? Am I… ill? I’m not ready for any drastic measures, you understand. And what about this…discharge? Will it simply… go away? It’s causing me a great deal of…discomfort, both physical and…social. I do hope it’s nothing too worrying. My wife will be quite cross if I’m incapacitated. Please, Doctor, be frank with me. What am I looking at?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, an enlarged prostate—benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH—is very common in men your age. It doesn't necessarily mean you are ill. It simply means your prostate gland has grown larger, which can sometimes cause urinary symptoms like frequency, urgency, and difficulty urinating. As for the discharge, it could be related to the BPH, or it could be a separate issue. That’s why the urinalysis is important. The blood test is a standard one, just a small vial. It shouldn’t be painful, just a brief pinch. I understand your concerns, but it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. We need the lab results to get a clearer picture. Worrying won't help, and jumping to conclusions will only cause unnecessary stress. We’ll take it one step at a time. In the meantime, focus on increasing your fluids and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as I mentioned before. And please, try to relax. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the lab results are back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well. One step at a time, you say? Yes, I suppose that’s…sensible. My wife always says I worry too much. She’s probably right. A pinch, you say? I can tolerate a pinch. And my assistant… she's a pleasant young woman, if I recall correctly. Will these tests tell me… definitively what’s wrong? Or will I need… more invasive procedures? I do have a rather low tolerance for discomfort, you see. I’m not as sprightly as I once was. And what if it’s… serious? What sort of treatments are available? I’ve heard… frightening stories. Be frank with me, Doctor. I’d rather know the worst, so to speak, than be kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your anxiety, but I can't give you a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan until we have the lab results. The tests will help us rule out infection and determine the severity of the BPH. As for treatment options, they range from medication to minimally invasive procedures, depending on the severity of your symptoms. Medication can help shrink the prostate and improve urinary flow. Procedures can help open up the urethra and relieve blockage. I understand your concerns about invasive procedures, and I assure you, we'll explore all non-invasive options first. But it's too early to discuss specifics at this point. We need the lab results to make an informed decision. My assistant will schedule your follow-up appointment, and we'll discuss the results and potential treatment options in detail then. In the meantime, please focus on increasing your fluids and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Very well. Increasing fluids... avoiding caffeine... I understand. You’ve said that repeatedly. No, I believe that’s all, Doctor. I’ll try to remain… calm. And I’ll leave the worrying to my wife. She’s quite good at it, you know. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment, then. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Yes, goodbye, Mr. Krok. Please let my assistant know if you have any questions before your appointment. .
