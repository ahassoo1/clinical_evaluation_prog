DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s about getting some shots, I reckon. My daughter… she’s trying to get her husband to come live here, permanently. From… well, from over in Romania. And I believe she said he needs certain vaccinations before he can get his visa? I’m a bit confused about it all, to be honest. She asked me to come talk to a doctor and get the proper information.
DOCTOR: Right, vaccinations for visa purposes. Yes, I see. It’s not uncommon. Romania… let me pull up the current requirements. Hmm… Okay. So, it depends on his age, specifically, and his past vaccination history. Do you happen to know if he’s had any vaccinations before, or do you have any records available?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t believe she has any records, Doctor. He didn’t grow up with a lot, you see. And things were… different over there, I expect. I don't rightly know if he’s had any shots at all, no. He's… let me think… he'll be 38 next month. Does that help? I’m sorry I don’t have more information for you. My daughter said I was the one who should come get the list of what’s needed, but she didn’t say anything about knowing what he’s had before.
DOCTOR: Thirty-eight… alright. Without a record, we have to assume he’s not up-to-date on certain things. It's best to be cautious. Based on his age and assuming no prior vaccinations, he'll likely need a Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and a MMR booster, measles, mumps, rubella. He may also need a varicella vaccine, chickenpox, if he hasn’t had it. And a flu shot is always a good idea, seasonal of course. We should also discuss his risk factors for hepatitis A and B, and potentially consider those vaccines as well. Does that sound… overwhelming?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious, that is a lot! Tdap… MMR… varicella… it all sounds like a jumble of letters to me, Doctor. And hepatitis… I’m just trying to keep it all straight. So, those are all things we should consider? Not necessarily need right away, but should talk about? I suppose I’m most worried about making sure he has the ones he absolutely has to have for the visa, if that makes sense. What about… is there anything specifically required by the government for someone coming from Romania? Before we get into all of this… consideration?
DOCTOR: You’re right to focus on what’s required. It's best to start there. Let me see… according to the CDC and current immigration guidelines, for a permanent resident visa from Romania, the primary requirements are documentation of a completed vaccination series for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and influenza. They do require proof of vaccination, or a waiver if vaccination isn’t medically feasible. It appears they’re fairly strict about the measles component specifically. Do you know if he ever had the measles?
PATIENT: Measles… Oh dear. No, I don’t believe she ever mentioned anything about him having the measles. He was a pretty sickly child, she said, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses. Back in his village, they didn’t have a lot of access to doctors, I reckon. So, it’s likely he didn’t. So… that means he will need that shot, then? Is it just one shot, or a series of them? And… is it a painful one? I’m just thinking about him, you see. He’s a strong young man, but I wouldn’t want him suffering needlessly.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned. Without documentation of past measles vaccination, he will need two doses of the MMR vaccine, spaced at least 28 days apart. It's the standard protocol. As for the pain... it’s generally well-tolerated, but there can be some mild discomfort at the injection site, and occasionally a low-grade fever or rash. We can offer a pain reliever afterwards if needed. We'll also need to document his vaccination status carefully for immigration purposes. To proceed, I recommend we start with the MMR vaccine today, and schedule a follow-up appointment in a month for the second dose. We should also discuss the other recommended vaccines—Tdap, polio, and influenza—and determine if those are necessary given his overall health and risk factors. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Starting with the measles seems like the most important thing right now. And yes, scheduling the second dose is a good idea. I wouldn’t want him forgetting about it. I suppose… what does he need to bring with him to the next appointment? Just his identification? And is there anything I need to do before then? I want to make sure we’re both prepared. And… how much will this cost, roughly? I need to let my daughter know.
DOCTOR: Yes, starting with the MMR is a good plan. For the next appointment, he should bring a valid photo ID. It’s also helpful if he has any previous medical records, even if they’re incomplete, but it’s not essential at this point. As for what you need to do… it would be helpful if he could recall any childhood illnesses he may have had, but that’s not critical either. The cost for the MMR vaccine today will be approximately $150. The second dose will be the same price. We will file the claim with his insurance, and he will be responsible for the copay and deductible. We can also provide a receipt for reimbursement purposes. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very helpful, Doctor. $150… I’ll have to tell my daughter. And the receipt is good to know. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. He's usually pretty good about remembering things, but I wanted to be sure we were prepared. So, if he brings his ID and tries to remember if he had any childhood illnesses… and we pay for the shot today… that’s all we need to do? I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with an old man and all these newfangled things. .
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Skarbek. It's my job to help. Yes, that’s correct. He should bring his ID, and you’ve already done the most important part—thinking ahead. I’m scheduling his appointment for four weeks from today. Here’s a summary sheet with all the information and instructions. Please let my office know if you have any further questions or need to reschedule. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day. .
