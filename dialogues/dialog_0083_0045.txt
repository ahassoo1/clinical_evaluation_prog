DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, I been getting… a flush. Like, my face gets very red. And sometimes my neck too. It happens… not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a flushing sensation in your face and neck. And you said it doesn't happen constantly, but frequently enough to be concerning. Can you tell me more about when this flushing occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly when. It doesn’t seem to be after eating anything special. And it’s not always after I do something… like exercise. Sometimes it just… happens. I was gardening yesterday, and it started then, but I also felt it last week when I was just… sitting and reading. It’s… random, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Withycombe. “Random” is helpful information. When the flushing occurs, do you experience any other symptoms with the redness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little warm, you know? Not a fever warm, just… warmer than usual. And… maybe a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. It doesn’t last long, though. Maybe five minutes, ten minutes at the most. And then it goes away. It's not painful, never painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so warmth and mild lightheadedness accompanying the flushing, lasting approximately five to ten minutes. Has this been happening for a long time, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: It’s… recent, I think. Maybe a couple of months? I haven’t really… kept track. It used to happen very rarely, like maybe once a year. But now it’s… maybe once a week, sometimes more. My wife… she passed away last year. Things have been… different since then. I don’t know if that has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. Losing your wife is a significant loss, and it's certainly possible that stress or emotional changes could be contributing to your symptoms. We'll explore all possibilities. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. I don’t really… have much of one, to be honest. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man. I had the flu a few times, a cold here and there. Nothing serious. I don't take any pills, no regular medicine. My wife… she was the one who went to the doctor all the time. I just… took care of her. I don’t know… is there something specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you’ve generally been healthy. No, just trying to get a general picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. Doctor always said my blood pressure was good. My wife always worried about hers, but mine was always fine. I don’t know anything about diabetes… never had that. And my heart… I’ve never had any problems with my heart. I walk a lot, garden a lot… I try to stay active. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Withycombe. Knowing you’ve been active and haven’t had those diagnoses is reassuring. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. I… I don't like hospitals. Always try to avoid them. My wife… she had her gallbladder out, a long time ago. But me? Never. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises from gardening.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family is… mostly in India. We don’t really… talk about those things. My mother… she had some problems with her stomach, I think. But I don’t know what it was. And my father… he was a very strong man, never sick a day in his life. I don't remember anyone having… heart trouble or anything like that. It’s hard to say, really. We lost touch with a lot of family a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. It's not always easy to have that information. No worries if you don’t know. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a problem with anything like that. I eat everything, pretty much. My wife… she was allergic to shellfish. But me? I can eat anything. I even like spicy food!
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink alcohol. Not even a little bit. My wife… she used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But me? Never. And definitely no… recreational drugs. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Just gardening and reading.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. That’s very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if anything… hurts. I'm not very good with… hospitals and things. But I trust you.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm also noting your weight is 121 pounds and your height is 167 cm. I'm going to palpate your neck to check for any swollen lymph nodes or thyroid abnormalities. No noticeable swelling or abnormalities in your neck. Do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Not at all. Feels… normal, I guess. Like you said, everything feels… normal. I just worry about the flushing. It’s… unsettling. Makes me feel… weak, sometimes. But it doesn't last long.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms—the flushing accompanied by warmth and mild lightheadedness, occurring sporadically, along with a slightly elevated blood pressure—there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is something called rosacea, although it typically presents with facial skin changes in addition to flushing. Another possibility, given the episodic nature of your symptoms, could be related to a vascular issue. And we also need to rule out any cardiac causes, although your heart sounds normal to me. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid hormones, and a basic metabolic panel. I also want to order an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm and rule out any underlying cardiac abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an EKG… That sounds… a lot. I don’t like needles, Doctor. And I’m not very good with… machines. But… if you think it’s important, then I guess so. I just want to know what’s wrong. I don't want this flushing to… get worse. Will these tests tell you what’s causing it?
DOCTOR: Yes, these tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on, Mr. Withycombe. They'll help rule out several potential causes and guide us towards the right diagnosis. I understand your apprehension about the tests, and we'll take things slowly. The blood draw will be quick, and the EKG is non-invasive – it simply involves placing some stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. The nurse will explain the procedures in more detail. I’ll also give you a requisition form to take to the lab. Would you like me to write down the name of a nearby lab?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I… I don’t know this area very well. And… maybe write down what the tests are for, too? Just so I know… what they’re looking for. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Withycombe. I’ve written down the name and address of the lab, as well as a brief explanation of each test. The Complete Blood Count checks for any abnormalities in your blood cells. The Electrolytes, Kidney Function, and Liver Function tests assess how well your organs are working. The Thyroid Hormone test checks for any thyroid issues. And the EKG evaluates your heart rhythm. The nurse will also explain everything in detail before the tests. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and staying well-hydrated. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I guess I’ll go see the nurse now? And… hope for the best.
DOCTOR: Yes, please go see the nurse, and she’ll get you started. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns in the meantime. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Withycombe. I hope you feel better soon.
