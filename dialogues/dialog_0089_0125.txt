DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s August 2nd, and good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Look, I just... wanted to get tested. For, you know... the HIV. I figured it was a good idea, preventative and all. My wife thinks it's a bit silly, honestly. She says I worry too much. But better safe than sorry, I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very sensible, Jacquille. Preventative health is always a good idea, and it’s great you’re thinking about this. And it's good you're talking with your wife about it, even if you have different perspectives. Just to be thorough, and for my records, can you tell me a little bit about why you're thinking about HIV testing now specifically?
PATIENT: Honestly? Just... seeing things on the news, you know? All that stuff. And I read a thing online... about how you can't always tell if someone has it. It’s not like the old days. It made me a bit uneasy, to be frank. Plus, I travel a bit for work, different cities, different hotels… I'm not saying anything happened, but it’s just… a precaution. I like to be prepared, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jacquille. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned with what you're hearing in the news and wanting to take control of your health, especially with travel involved. It's good you're proactive. Before we proceed with the test, I’m going to ask a few questions, just to get a complete picture. Have you ever had an HIV test before?
PATIENT: No, never. I... haven't really needed one before, you know? I mean, I've been married for eight years now, very happily, and… well, it just hasn’t come up. We weren't… particularly wild in our youth, if you catch my drift. So, no. First time. Hopefully, it's a simple one. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, first time, no worries at all. We’ll make it as comfortable as possible. And yes, it's generally quite straightforward. Now, I want to ask about any potential exposures. Have you ever shared needles with anyone, even in the past?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! What do you take me for? I've never touched a needle in my life, aside from, well, at the doctor's office, obviously. I find the very idea… distasteful. Are you required to ask everyone this? It feels a bit… intrusive, frankly. I assure you, I'm a perfectly respectable member of society.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question felt intrusive, Jacquille. It’s standard procedure, I assure you – part of a thorough risk assessment, and not a judgment of your character at all. We ask everyone the same questions to ensure we're covering all bases and providing the most accurate care. Alright. Let's move on. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections – STIs – diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Like I said, eight years of marriage, very happy, very… faithful. I find the implication… upsetting, actually. Is this what I came here for? To be grilled about my personal life? My wife is perfectly healthy, and I'm perfectly healthy. It’s a waste of time, honestly. I just want the test, can we please get to the test?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question me, Jacquille, and I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable. You're coming to me to feel safe and informed, and I clearly haven't been doing a good job of that. I am asking these questions not to imply anything, but to ensure I have a complete picture of your medical history. I understand your frustration, and we can absolutely proceed with the test if that's what you prefer. However, knowing a bit more about your history allows me to interpret the results accurately and provide the best possible care. Before we proceed with the test, would you mind if I quickly ask about any blood transfusions you may have received in the past?
PATIENT: Look, I’ve already answered enough questions about things that haven’t happened! Blood transfusions? No! I've never needed one. I'm a perfectly healthy man! I eat well, I exercise… honestly, Doctor, I think you're overthinking this. Just give me the test. I have a meeting this afternoon, and this is taking up a lot of time. I really don't appreciate being treated like… like I'm some sort of reckless individual. Just… the test, please. I’m starting to get quite annoyed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jacquille, I understand. You're understandably frustrated, and I apologize for the line of questioning. I respect your decision. We will proceed with the HIV test. The test is a simple blood draw. We'll take a small sample, and the results should be available in about 20 minutes. I'll explain the process, and we'll go over the results as soon as they’re ready. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol wipes?
PATIENT: No allergies. Finally, something simple. Just... get it over with, alright? I don't like hospitals. Or clinics. Or being poked and prodded. The quicker we finish this, the better. I’d really rather not dwell on it. Honestly, I think I'm wasting my time here, but my wife insisted. Just... please, hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jacquille. We'll be as quick and efficient as possible. Please have a seat here, and I’ll clean the area. There you go. All done. Just a little pressure for a minute or two, and you’ll be fine. The lab is just down the hall, so it won't take long to get the results. I’ll be right back.
