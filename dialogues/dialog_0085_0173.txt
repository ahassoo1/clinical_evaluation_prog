DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Lahn, nice to meet you too! Well, I've been having these chills... they just started a couple of days ago and they're kind of bothering me. It's August, so it's not like it's cold or anything!
DOCTOR: Okay, chills that started a couple of days ago. That is unusual for August! Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. Um... they come and go, not constant. Like, I'll be fine, then suddenly I feel really cold, even though I’m not. It's not a fever chill, you know? Not with sweats or anything. Just… cold. And then it passes. It happened yesterday a couple of times, and again this morning. It’s a bit worrying, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're paying attention to it. So, just to clarify, these chills are happening intermittently, without fever or sweats. Have you noticed anything else happening with the chills?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I’ve been a little tired, maybe more than usual. But I am divorced and working, so tiredness is pretty normal, haha. Oh! And my muscles feel a bit achy, like I did a workout, but I haven't. Does that count? I don't know. It's probably nothing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased fatigue and muscle aches along with the chills. That's helpful. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not like, fall-down exhausted. More just… dragging. I feel like I need a nap in the afternoon, which I don't usually do. And I'm having trouble focusing at work. Little things are taking longer than they should, if that makes sense? I’m a Health Education Specialist, so I need to be on my game.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, and it's good you're noticing the impact it's having on your work. Okay, so fatigue that's new, interfering with your concentration, and these intermittent chills and muscle aches. Have you had any other symptoms like a cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Definitely no cough or sore throat. My nose is fine, and I haven't had a headache. No stomach stuff either. Just the chills, tiredness, and achy muscles. It’s just… weird. It feels like something's trying to come on, but it’s not fully happening, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating when something feels off but isn't clearly defined. Let’s go over some of your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Um... nothing major. I had bronchitis a couple of years ago, but that was just a one-time thing. And I had the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox. Oh! And I was diagnosed with mild anxiety a few years back, but I manage it pretty well with… well, with keeping busy, mostly. Does that count? It’s not bothering me right now, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of bronchitis, childhood illnesses, and mild anxiety that's currently well-managed. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Lucky me! I try to stay healthy, haha. I mean, apart from these chills, I do. I eat pretty well and try to exercise when I can. It's just hard balancing work and everything else.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! Avoiding surgery is always a plus. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications I've taken before. Penicillin is fine, everything's fine. I'm pretty boring in that department, honestly!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regular, really. And the multivitamin is just a basic one, nothing fancy. I try to get most of my nutrients from food, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad has diabetes, but that’s about it. My grandparents were pretty healthy, actually. No heart disease or cancer that I know of. It's not a very dramatic medical family, haha. Mostly just the usual aging stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension and diabetes. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. Um... I'm divorced, as I mentioned. I live alone in the city. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I work full-time, like I said, as a Health Education Specialist. And I try to stay active, but it's hard. I don't have a lot of close friends nearby, but I have a good support system with my family. That's pretty much it. Normal, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Thank you for sharing all of that. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start by taking your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Okay, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 128/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. I’m going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears look clear, and your throat is normal. No redness or swelling. Finally, I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes don't feel enlarged or tender. Everything seems normal so far, but based on your symptoms, I think it would be helpful to order some lab work to rule out any potential infections or other underlying causes. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. Definitely. If it helps figure out what's going on, absolutely. Lab work is fine. What kind of tests are you thinking? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m thinking a complete blood count to check for infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function. A vitamin D level might also be useful, given your fatigue. These tests will give us a good starting point to see if anything is obviously off. They require a simple blood draw, and the results should be available within a few days. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds reasonable. CBC, BMP, TSH, and Vitamin D. I can handle a blood draw. A few days is good, I’m not in a huge rush, but I’d like to know what’s happening, obviously. How do we go about getting that done? Do I need to go somewhere else, or can I do it here?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can actually do the blood draw right here in the clinic. I'll give the order to the lab technician, and they'll come in shortly to draw your blood. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. Avoid strenuous activity, and try to manage your stress levels. If your symptoms worsen, such as developing a fever, severe muscle aches, or difficulty breathing, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything really well. Rest, hydration, no stress, watch for worse symptoms... got it. Thank you, Dr. Lahn. I feel a bit better just knowing we're looking into it. Hopefully it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I understand it can be unsettling when you're not feeling well, and it's good you’re proactive about getting it checked out. We'll get those lab results back as quickly as possible, and we'll discuss them and come up with a plan. I’ll have the lab technician come in to draw your blood now. In the meantime, feel free to relax. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. "Lab technician, could you please come to exam room three for a blood draw?
PATIENT: Sounds good, thank you again. .
