DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schlatterer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Schlatterer. Though, frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about requiring my full name. A simple "Sir" would suffice, wouldn’t it? I have very little time for this, you understand.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Schlatterer. Necessary for accurate record-keeping and… well, it's just done this way. Now, if you could just tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Record-keeping… Honestly. Very well. It’s… the library. The students, mostly. Utterly lacking in respect, the lot of them. And the administration…don’t even get me started. They expect miracles with… with the resources they provide. It’s…stressful. Though, I suppose you need to know why I’m here, and not a complete indictment of modern education. It's… exhausting, really. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Exhaustion… and is this exhaustion new, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Decades, I assure you. Though…it’s worsened recently. A new batch of…enthusiastic, shall we say, pupils. And the constant changes! Everything must be “digital” now. As if a screen can replace the feel of a proper book. It’s…demoralizing. Though, I can’t quite recall when it became so…intense. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this increased stress led to any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, my appetite…isn’t as robust as it once was. I find myself… skipping meals more often. And I haven’t been sleeping particularly well. Though, to be frank, I've never been a sound sleeper. Always a bit of a worrier, you see. I do find myself… irritable, perhaps. Snapping at colleagues, which is… uncharacteristic. Though, they deserve it, most of them. Is that what you mean by “changes”?
DOCTOR: Irritability, decreased appetite, trouble sleeping… Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? I… honestly, no. I haven’t been keeping track. Though, I suspect I’ve lost a little. My trousers feel… looser. Though, that could just be the heat. This summer is quite oppressive, you know. I’ve never been one for weighing myself regularly. A waste of time, if you ask me. Focus on the work, that’s what I always say. Though, if you must know, I’d estimate… a few kilograms, perhaps? It’s hardly a crisis.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I believe in a strong constitution and a healthy lifestyle. Though, I did take something for…indigestion, years ago. A small thing, really. And allergies? No. Never had any. Though, I find myself… slightly averse to lavender. The smell is rather… overpowering. But that's hardly an allergy, is it? I believe in natural remedies, if anything. Though, frankly, I don't see what this has to do with the…the students.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mr. Schlatterer, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: A…physical examination? Really? Is that necessary? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. Though, I suppose if it will expedite this process… very well. But please, be quick. I have papers to grade, you see. And I haven't the patience for prolonged… poking and prodding. Though, I do expect a full explanation of whatever you find – or, more likely, don't find. It's a waste of my time otherwise.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could just step up onto the table, please. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 110/70. Within normal limits, though a bit on the lower side. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular, but slightly slow. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are diminished. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but present.
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes… Honestly. I told you I was perfectly healthy. Though, I suppose prolonged stress can do strange things to one’s body. Though, I fail to see what this accomplishes. Is there a diagnosis? Or are you simply… documenting my decline? It’s all rather unsettling, you know. Though, I do trust you are competent. Though, I haven’t seen much evidence of it thus far. Though, perhaps you will surprise me. Though, I doubt it. Now, if you’re finished, I would like to leave.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, based on what you've told me, and the examination findings, it appears you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with mild dehydration and possible early signs of frailty, exacerbated by chronic stress. We need to rule out other possibilities, however. I'd like to order a basic blood panel, including electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. And a urine analysis. Also, I recommend we check your vitamin D levels. It’s common in older adults. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Honestly! It’s all rather…invasive. Though, I suppose if it will finally put my mind at ease… very well. Though, I trust you'll explain the results in plain English. No medical jargon, please. I have no desire to decipher cryptic reports. Though, I can’t imagine what they will reveal. I told you, it’s simply stress. Though, I suppose one must indulge these…modern procedures. Though, I do expect a swift turnaround. My time is valuable, you understand. Though, perhaps you can schedule them for tomorrow? Though, I have a faculty meeting in the afternoon… It's all rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've scheduled the blood work and urine analysis for tomorrow morning, 8:00 AM. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. In the meantime, I strongly recommend increasing your fluid intake—water is best—and try to prioritize rest when possible. And, if you feel particularly unwell, or experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Though, frankly, I find your recommendations rather…patronizing. Water, rest… as if I hadn't considered such obvious remedies. Though, I suppose I should thank you for your time. Though, it was hardly a productive use of either of our schedules. Though, I do expect a clear explanation of the results. And I trust you will refrain from further unnecessary tests. Though, I believe that is all. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have papers to grade. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Have a good day. Some people… .
