DOCTOR: Good morning, Jerrel. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I really don't have a lot of time for this. My hand… it shakes. Been shaking for a while now, I guess. It’s annoying, mostly. Makes things difficult. Can we just… get this over with?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jerrel. I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll do our best to be efficient. “Shaking for a while now”… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about what? Look, it just does. It’s been… months, maybe? Years? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things anymore. My wife used to handle all that. It's worse when I try to write, or hold a cup of coffee. Simple things, you know? It's not like it's stopping me from directing, but it's… a nuisance. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start, thank you. It’s helpful to know it’s been going on for months, possibly years, and that it affects things like writing and holding a cup. And that it's not interfering with your directing work – that gives me some context. Just to clarify, is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, not constant. It’s… worse at times. When I’m nervous, I suppose. Or tired. It’s…look, it just depends. It’s not like a clock, ticking away steadily. Don't need a scientific breakdown of it, alright? It shakes when it shakes. Is there a point to all this questioning? I've got a lunch with some… important people.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jerrel, and I apologize if I'm taking up too much of your time. I’m just trying to get a clearer picture of what's going on so I can best help you. Knowing when it’s worse is useful information. So, it’s worse when you're nervous or tired. Anything else that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Ugh. Well, sometimes when I try to be… precise, you know? Like, if I’m sketching something out, or… trying to thread a needle. Silly things. I don't need to thread needles anymore, honestly. My housekeeper handles all that. It's just...when I focus on small, detailed work, it seems to get worse. But really, it's just a general annoyance, alright? Is that helpful enough? I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. So it's exacerbated by fine motor tasks requiring focus. And you're feeling lightheaded now?
PATIENT: Lightheaded? A little. It’s this chair, I think. Awfully uncomfortable. And honestly, all these questions… It’s making me anxious. See? Now my hand is shaking even more. Can we just… get to the bottom of this and be done with it? I don’t like doctors. Never have. Too much poking and prodding. Is there a pill you can give me? Something to stop the shaking? That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Jerrel, and I apologize for that. We can certainly try to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. And yes, there are medications that can help with tremors, but before I can recommend anything, I need to do a quick exam and get a little more information about your medical history. Just a few questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I’m an old man. I've got symptoms. Back pain, mostly. And I forget things. A lot of things. That's what happens when you live as long as I have. You’re asking me about…the hand, right? Not about my general state of decay? I'm not a medical textbook. Frankly, I don't see what other symptoms have to do with a shaky hand. Is this chair going to give me a backache? I’m telling you, it’s terribly uncomfortable. Can we hurry this along?
DOCTOR: I apologize again for the discomfort, Jerrel. You’re right to point out I’m focusing on the hand. I'm trying to rule out any underlying causes. You mentioned forgetting things. Is that new, or has that been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Always been a bit forgetful. My wife used to say I had a sieve for a brain. She handled everything. Appointments, medications… everything. It's worse now, naturally. Been a year since she… well, you know. Everything’s a blur, honestly. I just want to get back to my life. This chair is killing me. Can we please just skip the exam and give me something for the shaking? I have people waiting. Important people. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and your desire to get back to your schedule. And I truly apologize for the discomfort you're experiencing with the chair. Before I can recommend a medication, even a simple one, I really need to do a quick neurological exam. It will involve checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It's a very quick assessment, and it will help me determine if there's anything more serious going on. It will only take a few minutes. Would you be willing to let me do that, just to be safe?
PATIENT: Look, I really haven't got the patience for this. Exam, no exam… it's all the same. Just give me something to stop the shaking, alright? Anything. I'm a busy man, and I don't have time for poking and prodding. My wife… she always handled these things. I don’t like doctors. Never have. This is a waste of my time. Just… give me a pill. A strong one. And get me out of this awful chair. .
DOCTOR: Jerrel, I understand your frustration and desire to get back to your schedule, and I respect your wishes. However, prescribing medication without a proper assessment would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. I am ethically obligated to ensure I'm providing safe and appropriate care. Given your reluctance to undergo a quick exam, and the potential for underlying causes, I recommend a referral to a neurologist. They are specialists in conditions affecting the nervous system and can provide a thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment plan. I can provide you with a referral to a highly-regarded neurologist in the area, and schedule an appointment for you. Would that be acceptable?
