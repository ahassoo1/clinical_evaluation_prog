DOCTOR: Alright then, Wynell. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, I don’t even know why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, practically dragged me. Said I needed to get this…situation…looked at. Something about my feet? I really don’t pay them much mind. They get me where I need to go, don't they? Though, admittedly, it's not nearly as much these days.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Well, your daughter sounds…concerned. That's good. It is important to address things, even if they don't seem like a big deal to you. “This situation” with your feet…can you tell me a little more about what she’s noticed?
PATIENT: Oh, she's always concerned. Thinks I’m falling apart at the seams. Probably right, if I’m being honest. As for my feet…well, they’re just…old, I suppose. A little swollen, maybe? And they ache sometimes. But aches and pains come with the territory, don’t they? I haven’t really told her anything specific, I just wave her off. She makes such a fuss.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. "A little swollen"...and aching. And when would you say this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That's a tricky one. Seems like…forever ago, really. A little at a time, I suppose. I don't remember a specific incident. Just…gradually. It's not like I tripped and broke something, or anything dramatic. I do recall it being worse after that trip to Florida last winter…but then again, everything is worse after Florida. Too much walking, too much sun, too much…everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Worse after Florida…that gives us something to work with. And when you say worse, what specifically felt different?
PATIENT: Well, the puffiness was…puffier. And the aching wasn’t just a little twinge when I first stood up, it was…constant. It felt like my shoes were squeezing me, even though I was wearing my usual comfortable ones. I had to sit down a lot more, even just walking around the hotel. My daughter kept fussing over it, of course. "Mommy, your ankles!" "Mommy, are you sure you should be walking?" Honestly, it was exhausting.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. And has that swelling and aching returned to that level since you’ve been back from Florida, or is it better now?
PATIENT: Oh, it's…better, I think. Not as bad as Florida, definitely. But it's still there. It’s a low hum, if you know what I mean? Just always a little uncomfortable. I mostly just ignore it. And I don’t go anywhere that requires a lot of walking, naturally. I’m not about to put myself through that again. Though, it's lonely sometimes, being stuck at home.
DOCTOR: Alright. A “low hum” of discomfort…that's helpful. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where do I even begin? I'm old, dear, everything aches. I had my gallbladder out years ago, and I have a little bit of trouble with my blood pressure, but nothing the doctor hasn't seen before. I take a little pill for it, every morning. And my knees... don't even get me started on my knees. They creak like an old ship, but I refuse to get a replacement. Too risky, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal, hypertension managed with medication…and some knee discomfort. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, land, no. I have a little box, a little pill organizer, that my daughter fills up for me every week. I just pop them, dear. I don't bother with names. They're little white pills, I think. Maybe some pink ones too? Honestly, I leave all that to her. She’s very good with details. I’m just not one for remembering numbers and letters.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get that information from your daughter. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything put in front of me, dear. My mother always said a little of everything is good for you. Though…I did have a rash once, years ago, after I tried a new brand of lotion. But that was ages ago. Could have been anything, really. It went away on its own. I don’t think it was anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick examination of your feet and ankles. Could you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Though, don't expect anything pretty. They're just old feet, that's all. My daughter keeps telling me I need a pedicure, but honestly, what's the point? It's not like they’re going to look any younger.
DOCTOR: If you could just sit here for me. Alright. Let’s take a look. Okay. I do see some swelling, as you mentioned, particularly around the ankles. And there's some discoloration, a little bit of brownish pigment. Also, the skin feels a little thickened. Your pulses feel a bit weak, but present. I’m going to want to get some tests done, just to rule out a few things. A blood test to check your kidney function and to rule out infection. And I think an ultrasound of your legs would be helpful to check for any blood clots.
PATIENT: Oh, tests… More poking and prodding? Honestly, I’m getting too old for all this fuss. Blood clots…that sounds serious. Is something wrong? My daughter is going to be beside herself. She worries so much. What exactly are we looking for? Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Now, now. Let's not jump to conclusions. Testing is just to be thorough, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright... thorough. That's good, I suppose. But honestly, sometimes I think doctors just like to run a lot of tests just to…justify their salaries. My cousin’s husband, Harold, he had every test in the book when he had a little cough. Turned out to be allergies!
DOCTOR: Harold's case might have been different, Wynell. I assure you I am only ordering these tests to get a clear picture of what's going on with your feet and ankles, to help determine the cause of the swelling and discomfort. It could be a number of things. Circulation issues, venous insufficiency—that’s when the valves in your veins don’t work properly—or something else. It’s best to rule things out systematically. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. And we can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Valves…what valves? Honestly, it’s all Greek to me. Greek! And tomorrow morning? I have my bridge club tomorrow morning. Ethel will have my head! Look, dear, is it something serious? Can’t you just give me something for the swelling? A cream, maybe? Or a pill? I don’t want to be running around to all sorts of tests and appointments. I just want to be able to walk to the mailbox without my ankles feeling like balloons.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. But I cannot simply prescribe something without knowing why your ankles are swelling. It could be something minor, but it could also be a sign of a more serious underlying condition—something that needs proper treatment. If I gave you something to mask the symptoms without knowing the cause, it could actually delay a proper diagnosis and make things worse. As for the tests, I’ll see if we can schedule the ultrasound for later in the week, perhaps after your bridge club. But I do need those blood tests, and it’s best to get them done as soon as possible. We need to rule out things like kidney problems and infection. Now, I want to be clear. I’m not trying to cause you unnecessary worry. I simply want to ensure you receive the best possible care. And that requires a thorough evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Thorough… always thorough. Honestly, you doctors and your "evaluations." It sounds so…official. And what if the tests show something awful? Ethel will be insufferable, and my daughter will move me into a home. Alright, alright. Fine. Blood tests. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And see if you can’t push that ultrasound back a day or two. Ethel is making her famous lemon squares tomorrow, and I wouldn’t miss it for the world. And just…promise me it's not something dreadful. Promise me?
DOCTOR: I cannot promise you anything definitive, Wynell, until we have the results of the tests. But I can promise you I will explain everything to you clearly and honestly, and we will discuss the best course of action together. We will take things one step at a time. Now, let's get the nurse to draw those blood tests. Nurse, could you please come in here and draw some blood for Wynell?
PATIENT: Fine. But tell her to be gentle. My veins aren't what they used to be. Honestly, the indignity of it all...
DOCTOR: .
