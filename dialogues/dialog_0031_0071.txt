DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Yes, well… it’s about some shots I need. My niece, she’s trying to get her husband here from… over in Europe, I think. And they said he needs certain vaccinations before he can get a visa. I’m trying to figure out what all that involves. I’m helping her with it, you see. I'm Karry Skarbek, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Skarbek. It's good to know you're helping your niece. That's very kind of you. We can certainly assist with determining what vaccinations are necessary for visa requirements. To start, do you happen to know which country in Europe her husband is coming from?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. She didn't say specifically, but I think it was… Poland? Yes, Poland. That sounds right. She mentioned something about his family being there, near Krakow, I believe. It's been a while since we spoke about it, so I could be wrong, but Poland feels right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Poland. That’s helpful. The required vaccinations can vary depending on the country of origin, and even the individual’s prior vaccination history. Before we get into specifics, let me ask a few general questions. Have you had a tetanus shot in the last ten years?
PATIENT: Let me think… ten years… That would be… around 2015, wouldn’t it? I… honestly, I don’t rightly remember. I get shots when the doctor tells me to, but keeping track of dates… that’s not my strong suit. I’m afraid I don’t have a record handy. Would my regular doctor have that information?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Skarbek. It's common to not remember exact dates. Yes, your primary care physician would likely have that record. We can also check here at the clinic, if you’ve had any previous vaccinations done with us. Let's proceed as if you are unsure about your tetanus status for now. We can certainly give you a booster if needed. It's a fairly routine shot. Beyond tetanus, are you aware of having received any other vaccinations – perhaps for measles, mumps, rubella, polio, or influenza?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those names… I had some as a boy, I’m sure. Polio, I think. A little prick in the arm… But measles, mumps… rubella… I couldn’t say. It was a long time ago, and things weren't kept the way they are now. I've gotten a flu shot every year, though, almost without fail. My wife always insisted on that, and I’ve kept it up. She was very careful about things like that. Is the flu shot important for this visa situation?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the polio and the annual flu shot, Mr. Skarbek. And I understand it can be difficult to recall details from years ago. The flu shot, while generally beneficial for health, isn’t typically a requirement for visa purposes. We're focusing on the vaccinations needed for entry into the United States, and those are generally the core childhood vaccines and sometimes others depending on the region your niece's husband is coming from. Now, to get a better picture of what he might need, do you know if he's had any vaccinations at all?
PATIENT: That’s a very good question. She didn’t mention anything about him having shots. He… well, he lived in a small village for most of his life, and they didn't really go to doctors much, she said. I imagine he probably hasn't had many, if any, of the ones you’re talking about. That’s why I’m here, trying to get this straightened out before he tries to come over. It all seems so complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Skarbek. It's wise to be proactive, and you're right, it can be a bit complicated. Since he likely hasn’t received many vaccinations, we will need to consider a series of shots to ensure he meets the requirements for entry. Before we discuss specific vaccines, let's briefly review his medical history, if you know it. Does he have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, as far as I know, he doesn't. My niece said he's a very healthy man, always working outdoors. She didn’t mention any allergies at all. She said he's never had any trouble with food, or anything like that. He eats just about anything, she said, and has a strong stomach! But I suppose that doesn't mean he doesn't have allergies. Is it possible to be allergic to something without knowing it?
DOCTOR: That's a very astute question, Mr. Skarbek. It is absolutely possible to have an allergy without being aware of it. However, for visa requirements, we primarily focus on known allergies, especially to vaccines themselves, as that could contraindicate giving certain shots. Alright. And has he had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She said he broke his arm when he was a boy, climbing a tree, but that healed up fine. Other than that… no, not that I know of. She said he's always been a strong, healthy man. No major illnesses, no surgeries. He might have had the usual childhood things – colds, maybe the flu – but nothing serious enough to require a doctor, as far as she knows. He’s a simple man, doesn’t bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. Is there a list of things I should ask her specifically? It’s hard knowing what’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Skarbek. And yes, it can be difficult to know what’s important. A list is a good idea. We'll keep a running tally, and I will summarize at the end. Since he's been generally healthy, we can proceed under the assumption of no major medical issues. Now, let’s talk about his age. Do you know his exact date of birth, or at least his age?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe my niece told me. He was born on July 12th, 1968. That would make him… let me count… 55 years old. Just turned 55, actually. She sent me a picture from his birthday celebration. He looks very good for his age, if I do say so myself. He's a strong man. Is that age important for which shots he needs?
DOCTOR: Yes, his age is important. At 55, certain vaccines are recommended as a matter of course, and it helps us determine if he’s eligible for others. Alright, Mr. Skarbek, we’ve covered a lot. To summarize so far: he's 55 years old, born July 12th, 1968; likely unvaccinated or minimally vaccinated; no known allergies; a history of a broken arm as a child; and generally healthy. Now, let’s talk about the vaccinations he might need. Based on his age and potential exposure, we'll likely consider Tdap , MMR , varicella , influenza, and potentially hepatitis A and B, and COVID-19. Before we proceed with a plan, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam is a good idea. I suppose it’s better to be thorough. I'm happy to have that done. I just… I haven't been to a doctor myself in quite a while, so I don’t really know what to expect. But if you think it’s best, let’s go ahead with it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It’s always good to be thorough. Don't worry, it will be a quick and straightforward exam. If you could please have a seat here, we'll start with your height and weight, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and just take a general look at your overall condition. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. I'm not much for doctors, but if it helps my niece's husband… then I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. Your height is 158 centimeters, and your weight is 102 kilograms. That puts your BMI at approximately 32.5, which is considered obese. We'll note that for future consideration, but it's not our primary focus today. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, with no wheezes or crackles. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical in all extremities. Throat is clear, ears appear normal, and eyes show no obvious abnormalities. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. There are no immediate concerns that would contraindicate vaccination. We'll proceed with a plan to get him up-to-date on his immunizations. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… good. Unremarkable is good, right? It’s a relief to hear that. So, what happens next? What shots does he need, and how many? And are they… painful? I remember getting shots as a boy, and they weren’t very pleasant. Is there anything I can do to prepare him? And how much will all of this cost, roughly? I need to know for my niece.
DOCTOR: Yes, unremarkable is definitely good, Mr. Skarbek. It means there are no immediate red flags. Now, regarding the vaccinations, based on his age and potential exposure, I recommend the following: Tdap , MMR , varicella , and influenza. We should also discuss the Hepatitis A and B series, especially considering potential travel and exposure. And, given current recommendations, the updated COVID-19 vaccine as well. He will likely need multiple doses for some of these. MMR and varicella require two doses spaced 28 days apart. Hepatitis A and B is a three-dose series over six months. Tdap and Influenza are typically one-time annual doses. And the COVID-19 vaccine, depending on the formulation, may require a series as well. As for pain, modern vaccines are much less painful than they used to be. There might be some mild soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site for a day or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help alleviate any discomfort. I recommend advising him to move his arm gently after the injection. Regarding cost, the price varies depending on the insurance coverage. With private insurance, the majority of the cost should be covered, but there might be a co-pay or deductible. Without insurance, the cost per vaccine can range from $80 to $200. I can have our billing department provide a more accurate estimate once we have his insurance information. Do you have his insurance card available, or can you provide me with his insurance details?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… Here you are. It’s with Blue Cross Blue Shield. The policy number is… hmm, let me find it… it’s 123456789. He’s a new client, so I don’t have much experience with it myself. I hope it covers most of it. He’s a hard-working man and doesn’t have a lot of extra money. Is there anything else I should ask him before he comes in? Anything about allergies or things he’s been exposed to? I want to be prepared. And… will he need to come back multiple times, like you said? How far apart will the shots be? It’s a long drive for him, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. Let me just verify this information… Okay, it appears he does have coverage with Blue Cross Blue Shield, and vaccinations are generally covered. There is a $50 co-pay per injection, however. Regarding preparation, it would be helpful to ask him about any previous allergic reactions to vaccines specifically. If he remembers a severe reaction – like difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat – we’ll need to proceed with caution. Otherwise, just advise him to eat a good meal before coming in and to be prepared for some mild discomfort afterward. Yes, he will need to come back multiple times, as we discussed. The MMR and varicella vaccines require two doses, spaced 28 days apart. The Hepatitis A and B series is over six months – the second dose one month after the first, and the third dose six months after the first. We can schedule these appointments in advance to minimize travel. I recommend spacing them out as much as possible to make it easier for him. For the Hepatitis A vaccine, we can do the first two doses one month apart, and then the final dose six months later. That would require three visits. For MMR and Varicella, two visits. Would you like me to schedule these appointments now, or would you prefer to coordinate with him directly?
PATIENT: Yes, let's schedule them now, if you don’t mind. It will be easier for me to keep track of it that way. He doesn't have a computer, you see. I'm the one who handles all that. Let's… let's do the Hepatitis A shots first, since they’re the most urgent, I suppose. And spread them out as much as possible. What days do you have available? He can come on Tuesdays or Thursdays, usually. But not mornings, he works early.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. Let me see… Tuesdays and Thursdays after noon work best. Okay, I can schedule the first Hepatitis A dose for Tuesday, August 27th at 2:00 PM. The second dose can be scheduled for Thursday, September 25th at 2:00 PM. And the final dose for Tuesday, February 25th, 2026 at 2:00 PM. That gives ample time between doses and accommodates his schedule. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. August 27th, September 25th, and February 25th. I’ve got that written down. So, that’s everything? He just needs to come in on those three days, and I’ll make sure he has his insurance card. Is there anything else I need to know or do before then? I want to be prepared for everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It was my pleasure. Yes, that’s everything for now. Just remind him to eat a good meal before each appointment and to inform the nurse of any allergies or concerns he may have. And, if he experiences any unusual symptoms after the injection – like high fever, severe allergic reaction – to contact our office immediately. I've documented all of this in his chart. If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to call our office. Thank you for choosing our clinic, and please give your niece our best regards. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Skarbek.
