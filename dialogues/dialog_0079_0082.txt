DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning. Yeah, the travel thing. My wife... she wanted to go. Now I need... shots? Something for travel. She planned everything, I just… need to do what she said. I don’t really know what she told me, to be honest. It was a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: I see. And where are you and your wife traveling to, Mr. Tayar?
PATIENT: Somewhere… hot. Desert, I think. She liked the desert. Lots of sand. I think it was… Africa? Or maybe the Middle East? She had the papers. Everything. I just… followed along. It was a surprise trip, you see. A big surprise. And now… I need to go. By myself.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that does complicate things somewhat. "Somewhere hot" isn't particularly helpful for determining necessary vaccinations or preventative medications. Do you recall anything specific about the country, or perhaps the city you’re traveling to?
PATIENT: Ugh. She said… Cairo. Yeah, Cairo! That was it. Lots of old stuff, she said. Pyramids. And… camels. But that was a while ago, before… everything. It’s hard to remember details, you know? It was a trip. A big one.
DOCTOR: Cairo, Egypt. Excellent. That narrows things down considerably. Now, Mr. Tayar, have you ever been to Egypt, or any other parts of Africa, before?
PATIENT: No. Never. She wanted to go somewhere… new. For both of us. This is my first time. That's why she wanted all the… shots. She was very careful. I hope they don't hurt too much.
DOCTOR: Well, preventative medicine is always advisable when traveling to a region with different endemic diseases. Now, to determine what vaccinations you might require, let’s go through some standard questions. Have you had your routine vaccinations – tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio?
PATIENT: Ugh, all that? I don’t… I don’t keep track of that stuff. When I was a kid, yes, I think so. My mother… she took care of it. But it was a long time ago. I haven’t been sick, not really. Just… normal stuff. Do I need all of those? It sounds like a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s important to have a record of your vaccination history, Mr. Tayar, as it dictates what boosters or additional vaccinations are necessary for safe travel. Do you have any documentation from your primary care physician, perhaps a childhood immunization record?
PATIENT: No! No papers. She had everything. All the important stuff. I just… go. That’s what I do. She took care of all this. Why do I have to remember? It's just… a lot. Everything is just a lot.
DOCTOR: Very well. In the absence of any record, we will proceed as if you are not up-to-date on routine vaccinations. This will require a series of vaccinations to protect you from potential health risks in Egypt. Before we begin, are you allergic to any medications, or have you had any adverse reactions to vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. Maybe a little fever once? When I was a kid, I got one of those… flu shots? But nothing bad. I don't really pay attention to that stuff. She always asked all the questions. Are they going to be very painful?
DOCTOR: A mild fever is a common reaction to vaccinations, Mr. Tayar. I am more concerned about any severe allergic reactions. Now, let’s move on. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, heart disease, or a weakened immune system?
PATIENT: No! I'm fine! Always been strong. Worked construction, you know. Heavy lifting. Very healthy. She always worried too much. I don’t need to be poked and prodded. I just need to go. This trip... it's important. I promised her.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Very well. Given the lack of information and your… insistence on your good health, we will proceed with a standard travel vaccination protocol for Egypt. This will include Hepatitis A and Typhoid, at minimum. We may also discuss a course of malaria prophylaxis, depending on the specific regions you intend to visit. Now, before we administer anything, I need to perform a brief physical exam to ensure you are otherwise fit for travel. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Exam? Ugh. Fine, whatever. Just… get it over with. I don't like doctors. But make it quick. I have… things to do. I need to get going. She would have handled this so much better.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I will begin with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Respiration is within normal limits. Now, if you could please open your mouth and say “ah”… Throat appears clear, no visible signs of infection. Lungs sound… somewhat congested. Do you experience any shortness of breath, or have a chronic cough?
