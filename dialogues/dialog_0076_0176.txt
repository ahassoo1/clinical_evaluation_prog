DOCTOR: Right. So, Ivette, you're here today… tell me what brings you in. Don't bother with a long story, just the important bits. I have quite a few patients after you, you understand.
PATIENT: Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going. More than 48 hours now, definitely. It’s really annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, alright. More than 48 hours… yes, that is a bit long. Have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, you name it! Holding my breath, drinking water really fast… my ex-husband always told me to breathe into a paper bag, but I don’t even have a paper bag anymore. It hasn’t helped any of it, really. It just… keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Breathing into a paper bag… yes, some people suggest that. Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Just the hiccups. Maybe a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t these days? And, well, a bit frustrated, if that counts. It's just… constant. It's making it hard to concentrate at work, you know? I manage events, and you need to be on for that.
DOCTOR: Constant hiccups, fatigue… Alright. And what sort of events do you manage?
PATIENT: Oh, all sorts! Mostly corporate things – conferences, team-building days, that sort of thing. Sometimes weddings, though those are… a lot. Lots of details to keep track of, and you need to be able to think clearly. Which is hard when you’re hiccuping every few seconds!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, stress can cause all sorts of things. Alright, let's just do a quick exam to rule out anything obvious. Lie back on the table, please. I'll listen to your chest and abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. It’s just… I don’t think it’s stress. I mean, work is work, but I'm used to it. I just feel… off.
DOCTOR: Chest sounds clear. Abdomen… soft, no tenderness. Heart rate is regular. Everything seems normal, honestly. Have you had any problems with… acid reflux, heartburn?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. Not terribly often, but every now and then. Usually if I eat something spicy, or have too much coffee. I had a bit of coffee yesterday, actually. But I usually just take something over the counter for it, and it goes away. It doesn’t feel like heartburn, though, if that makes sense? It’s more… a feeling in my chest, but with the hiccups.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was… oh, must be twenty years now? Aside from that, I’m pretty healthy. I try to eat well, I walk when I can. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially. I don’t take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some heart trouble later in life. Nothing major, really. Oh, and my aunt on my father’s side had diabetes, but she wasn’t very good about taking care of herself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Look, these things sometimes just… happen. It's probably nothing serious. I’ll prescribe you something for the hiccups, a muscle relaxant. If it doesn’t improve in a week, then come back. But honestly, it’s likely just a temporary thing.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. A muscle relaxant… Will that make me drowsy? Because, like I said, I really need to be on my game for work. And a week feels like a long time to be hiccuping! Is there anything else I could try in the meantime? Just… something, you know? I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: It may cause some drowsiness. But you can try it at night. And honestly, there's not much else you can do. You’ve tried the standard things. If it’s truly bothering you this much, I suppose you could see a gastroenterologist. But for hiccups… that seems a bit extreme, don’t you think?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… yes, that does seem a bit much. Okay. I guess I’ll try the muscle relaxant. And if it doesn’t work, you think it could be something more serious? Just, so I know what to look for?
DOCTOR: Look, unlikely. But if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or severe chest pain, then go to the emergency room. Otherwise, it’s probably just… persistent hiccups. I’m printing the prescription now. And try to relax. .
PATIENT: Okay. Fever, shortness of breath, chest pain. Got it. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… see how it goes.
