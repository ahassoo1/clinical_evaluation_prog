DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this sensitivity to light, really. It's been bothering me for a little while now. It feels like…everything's just too bright, even on cloudy days.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to light… that’s photophobia. And you said it’s been bothering you for “a little while” – could you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, properly, maybe… six months ago? At first it wasn’t too bad, just a bit of squinting. But it’s gotten worse steadily since then, definitely. I remember noticing it around February, I think. We had a pretty bright winter, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: February… alright. And has anything changed with it since then?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. It used to just be outside, in the sun. Now, even bright indoor lights bother me. Fluorescent lights are the worst, honestly. And… sometimes it feels like my eyes are actually hurting, not just uncomfortable. Like a throbbing pain, if I’ve been looking at something bright for too long. It doesn't last long, but it's definitely new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s progressed from mainly being an issue outdoors to now affecting you indoors as well, and you’re experiencing some throbbing pain with prolonged exposure to light. Is it just one eye, or both?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. It's not worse in one than the other, just… both of them. It's hard to explain. It's like the light is just too much, all over. And it doesn't matter what I'm looking at, it's the light itself. Even with sunglasses on sometimes, it's still bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, both eyes, and even with sunglasses it’s not fully relieved. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… I have been a bit more tired than usual, maybe? But I figured that was just… life, you know? Being on my feet all day at work. And my vision… I don't think it's changed. I can see things as clearly as I always have, as far as I can tell. Oh! And sometimes my eyes feel a bit gritty, like there's something in them, even when there isn't. But that’s only now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue, no changes to your vision, and occasional grittiness in your eyes. Do you have any pain besides when exposed to light?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's mostly just the throbbing with the light, or a bit of ache afterwards. Not a constant headache or anything like that. And nothing in my head, it’s definitely in my eyes. I can feel it. I'm just glad I came in, because it's been getting a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It’s always best to get things checked out when you’re worried. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Nothing major, anyway. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. But no serious illnesses. I had my usual check-ups, blood tests and everything, when I was younger, but nothing ever came up. And… I lost my wife a few years back, and things have been… quiet, health-wise, since then. If that makes sense. I try to eat well, get enough sleep… just trying to keep things ticking over.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It takes a lot of strength to keep going after a loss like that. And yes, that absolutely makes sense. Okay, so no known medical conditions, standard childhood illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Just the usual bumps and bruises, nothing serious enough for a trip to the hospital. I've always been careful, and I think that's helped. I try to avoid anything too risky, if I can. I’m not a fan of being sick, or in pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That’s a bit… complicated, Doctor. I didn’t grow up with my parents, not really. I was raised by my grandmother, mostly. She was healthy as an ox, lived to be 95, but I don’t really know much about her family’s medical history, if that makes sense? She didn’t talk about it much. And I don’t have any siblings, so there’s no one to ask about my mother or father’s side of things. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Arbin. You’ve told me what you know, and that’s what’s important. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. Never have. I don't smoke, I don't drink, and I definitely don't use any drugs. I just… never been interested. I work long hours on my feet, so I prefer to stay clear-headed and healthy, if I can. A cup of tea in the evening is about as exciting as it gets for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications in the past. I've had the usual antibiotics for colds and things, and I had a tetanus shot a few years ago, but no problems with either. My grandmother always said I had a strong constitution, maybe that’s why!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Arbin. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination of your eyes, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable, and I’ll try not to flinch too much!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… Um… is it… E-H-P-T-F…? Is that right? It’s a little blurry, honestly. I’m straining to see it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. And now the other eye.
PATIENT: Um… let me see… E-H-P-T… oh, and an F… F-P-T-H-E? Is that better? It still feels a little…fuzzy around the edges.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful. Now, I'm going to check your pupils and eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes, and try not to blink. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Tracking is smooth, but… I notice a slight nystagmus when looking to the extremes of gaze. It's subtle, but present. I’m also going to check the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope now. The optic discs appear healthy, but there is some mild pallor. The retinas are unremarkable. Okay, Arbin, everything seems relatively normal so far, but I did notice a slight nystagmus – involuntary eye movement – when looking to the side, and some mild pallor of the optic discs. It's not a major concern on its own, but combined with your sensitivity to light, it suggests we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh, wow. That sounds… complicated. Nystagmus? Pallor? I’m not a doctor, so I don’t really know what any of that means! What does that suggest we do now? Is it something serious? I'm starting to get a little worried again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Arbin. It sounds complicated, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it is serious. Nystagmus can have many causes, from fatigue to more underlying neurological conditions, and pallor of the optic disc can be seen in a variety of situations. Given your symptoms and these findings, I'd like to order a couple of tests to get a clearer picture. I want to rule out anything serious and figure out what's causing your light sensitivity. I'm going to order a complete blood count – that’s a routine blood test to check your overall health – and a magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, of your brain and orbits. The MRI will give us detailed images of your brain and eyes, so we can see if there are any abnormalities. It’s a painless scan, you just lie still for a bit. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that… sounds reasonable. Blood test, I can handle that. An MRI… it sounds a bit scary, but if you think it’s necessary, then yes, alright. It’s good to be thorough, I suppose. So, what happens next? Do I need to book an appointment for the MRI? And how long will it take to get the results? I have work, you see, and I need to know how much time I might need off. I’m a dental assistant, so it’s hard to just…disappear for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m glad you’re willing to proceed with the tests. I’ll write you a referral for the MRI. The receptionist will help you book an appointment at a local imaging center – they usually have good availability. The MRI itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes, but you should allow a couple of hours for check-in and preparation. The lab results usually come back within a few days, and the MRI report can take a little longer, maybe a week or so, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'd recommend avoiding bright lights as much as possible, and if you're experiencing a lot of discomfort, you can try using sunglasses indoors. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think that makes sense. So, book an appointment for the MRI, avoid bright lights, and wait for you to call. Okay. I’ll try not to worry too much in the meantime. But it’s hard, you know? This whole thing is a bit unsettling. What about the dental assistant job? Is there anything I should tell my employer? I mean, I don't want to alarm them unnecessarily, but I might need some time off if something serious comes up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Arbin. It's natural to feel unsettled when you're waiting for test results. As for your job, I wouldn't alarm your employer at this stage. You don't need to disclose anything until we have the results of the tests and know what’s going on. However, you might want to let them know you have a medical appointment scheduled and may need some time off in the future, depending on the outcome. You can just say you're getting some tests done and need to be flexible for a bit. If the MRI reveals something significant, we can discuss a medical leave of absence. I can provide a note to your employer explaining the situation. But for now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and seeing what the results say. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and… reassuring. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll book the MRI as soon as I can. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Okay, I’ll… see you when the results are back. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help. And remember, we're just gathering information at this point. Try not to worry too much. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day to you too, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
