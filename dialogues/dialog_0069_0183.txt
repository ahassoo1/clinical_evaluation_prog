DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Grumman is fine. Well, I’m tired. Just…very tired. Not like after work tired, but…all the time tired. It’s been going on for a while now, and my wife, she says I need to get it checked. She worries too much, but…here I am. And I have…problems with my liver, they told me. Years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Grumman, I understand. Constant fatigue is certainly something we want to investigate. And you mentioned some previous liver issues – that’s helpful to know. When you say "problems with your liver," do you recall what those were?
PATIENT: Problems…yes. A doctor, a long time back, said it was…swelling. Something about too much, too much of something. I don’t remember the name. I take some pills for it, but I don’t know what they do. Just take them. My wife handles all that. She keeps the little boxes organized. I just…feel tired. Is that enough for you?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Grumman. It's very common for patients to not remember all the details, especially when it comes to past medical history. And feeling tired is absolutely enough to bring you in. We'll figure this out together. Let me pull up your records here... Okay, I see you’ve been a patient with us for a few years. It looks like there's a note from Dr. Ellis, from 2022, mentioning elevated liver enzymes and a diagnosis of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, or NAFLD. Does that ring any bells?
PATIENT: Non-Alco…what now? Sounds like a lot of big words. I don't drink. Never have. So, how can it be non-alcoholic? My wife always tells me I need to eat better. Too much…rice, maybe? Is that what this is about? She always says I eat too much rice. And she makes me walk with her. It’s…fine. But tiring. Is this liver thing from the walking?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Grumman. NAFLD doesn’t necessarily mean you drink alcohol. It simply means there's a buildup of fat in your liver, and it can happen for many reasons – diet, genetics, weight, even certain medical conditions. It's quite common, actually. And no, walking wouldn't cause liver issues; it's generally very good for your health! Your wife sounds like she's looking out for you. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about your typical diet?
PATIENT: My diet? What do you want to know? I eat food. My wife cooks. She makes…stews, mostly. With meat and vegetables. And rice. Lots of rice. Sometimes, we have injera, with wat. It’s good. I like it. She tries to get me to eat more greens, but…I don’t really like them. They taste like…nothing. And sometimes, I have bread with coffee. Just…regular things. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point, Mr. Grumman. It sounds like a fairly traditional diet, which is perfectly fine. And no, we won't be here too long. To get a clearer picture of your liver function and rule out other potential causes for your fatigue, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your liver enzymes, kidney function, and some other basic levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests. More poking and prodding. My wife will be happy, at least. She likes it when doctors do things. But…what will the tests show? Will it be bad? I don’t want to be sick. Just…tired. Is there a pill for being tired? A simple pill? Because these tests…they sound complicated. And expensive. Medicare will cover it, right?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Grumman. The tests will help us see how well your liver is functioning and identify any abnormalities. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to know for sure. As for a simple pill for tiredness, unfortunately, there often isn't one. Fatigue can have many causes, and finding the right solution often involves addressing the underlying problem. That's what we're trying to do with these tests. Regarding the cost, Medicare should cover the necessary tests, but we have staff who are very experienced with insurance pre-authorization and billing, and they can confirm that for you. Now, before we proceed with the blood tests, I'd like to ask a few quick questions about your general health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. My wife gives me the pills, and I take them. She asks if I feel funny, and I say no. Sometimes my stomach feels a little…off, but that happens anyway. Old age, probably. I don’t remember any…reactions. Never had a rash. Or trouble breathing. She’d know. She notices everything. Can we just get the tests done? I have to pick up my grandson later.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know, Mr. Grumman. And yes, we can absolutely get the tests done. Alright, I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. These will give us a good baseline to start with. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Do you know how to get there?
PATIENT: Down the hall. I can find it. Everything is…straightforward. Just point me in a direction and I'll go. Though…is it far? My legs aren’t what they used to be. And…will it hurt a lot? I don’t like needles. My wife always holds my hand. Is there…someone who can hold my hand? Just in case.
DOCTOR: It's just a short walk down the hall, Mr. Grumman, and I can have a nurse escort you. They’re very good at drawing blood, and they can make you as comfortable as possible. And yes, absolutely, a nurse can hold your hand if you’d like. It’s no trouble at all. Let me call Nurse Amani to come and assist you. She's excellent with patients who are a little anxious about needles. One moment, please. Nurse Amani, could you please come to room three?
PATIENT: Fine. A nurse. My wife will be relieved. She always worries. But…please tell her not to come with me. She has errands to run. And I don't want her fussing. Just…get this over with quickly. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Picking up my grandson is very important. I promised him ice cream.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Grumman. I'll make sure Nurse Amani knows not to bother your wife. We'll get you taken care of quickly, and then you can get to picking up your grandson and getting him that ice cream. Nurse Amani: Dr. Andraca?
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Just…get it over with. Carefully. And don’t poke too much. And…a band-aid. I need a band-aid. My wife says I bleed easily. Though…I don’t feel it. Mostly. Just…hurry.
