DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 70 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s really bothering me, you know? Just… constantly. It's hard to explain, it's all over, not just one spot. It's been going on for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? Time slips my mind these days.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. Yes, that is… troublesome. Itchy skin all over. Is it a constant itch, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, really. Some days are worse than others, of course. But it’s always there, sort of nagging at me. It doesn’t really let up completely, even at night. It makes it hard to sleep sometimes, I have to admit. I've been trying different lotions, but nothing seems to help for very long.
DOCTOR: Lotions, hm. And what sort of lotions have you been trying, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, the usual. Aveeno, I think? And some Eucerin, the one for dry skin. My daughter, Maria, bought me a fancy one once, with shea butter, but that didn't seem to do much either. I just keep trying different ones, hoping something will take the itch away. It's just... frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it sounds as though you’ve attempted some standard remedies. Have you noticed any rash accompanying the itch?
PATIENT: No, no rash. That's what's so strange about it! It’s just… dry, maybe a little flaky sometimes, but no bumps or redness. That’s why I didn’t really worry about it at first. I thought it was just my skin getting old, you know? But then it just kept getting itchier and itchier.
DOCTOR: I see. No rash, simply a persistent itch and some dryness. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I've been a little tired lately, but honestly, at my age, who isn’t? And maybe a little… achy, but that could be the weather. It's been so humid. No fever, no changes in my appetite… nothing that I can really pinpoint. Just the itch, mostly. It's really just the itch that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just review your medical record briefly. I see you’ve had… hypertension, and some mild arthritis. Any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The hypertension. I take a little pill for that, every morning. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And something for the arthritis, but I don't really pay attention to the names anymore, Maria handles all that. No changes though, no, not recently. She keeps everything organized for me. I haven’t changed anything myself, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you have any allergies to medications, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get a little hives as a child, but those went away a long time ago. I don’t take many medications, so there hasn’t been much chance, really. I just take the two pills I mentioned, and sometimes a little something for my nerves when I get anxious, but not very often.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’ll permit me. I'll just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a closer look at your skin. This will help me to determine the cause of your itch. Please, lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not very good at remembering these things!
DOCTOR: Simply lie flat, Ms. Cassimatis. I will begin with your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, please. In and out… very good. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s examine your skin. Skin appears dry with no evidence of acute rash, excoriation, or other significant findings. No edema. Capillary refill is within normal limits.
PATIENT: Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem… very focused. It doesn’t hurt or anything, but I can feel you looking very closely.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cassimatis, nothing immediately alarming. I am simply attempting to rule out any obvious causes for your discomfort. Your skin is indeed dry, as we’ve established, but the lack of a rash is… atypical. It suggests a systemic cause, perhaps, or simply age-related dryness. Given your age and history, and the persistent nature of the itch, I would like to order some basic blood work. This will help us to evaluate your liver and kidney function, as well as rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions.
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh dear. I don't like needles, Doctor. Is it really necessary? Can't we try something else first? Maybe a stronger lotion, or some kind of cream? I've never really had much blood work done, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cassimatis, while a stronger lotion may provide temporary relief, it will not address the underlying cause of your itch. Blood work is a necessary step in determining the source of your discomfort and ensuring appropriate treatment. It’s a standard procedure, and relatively quick. We will need to check your complete blood count, liver function, kidney function, and thyroid levels. These are all potential contributors to pruritus – that is, itching – and ruling them out is paramount. It's a precaution, but a necessary one, given the chronicity of your symptoms. Delaying diagnosis could potentially worsen your condition.
PATIENT: Oh. Well… if you really think it’s necessary. I just… don’t like the thought of all those needles. And I don't have insurance, Doctor. Will it be very expensive? Maria helps with those things, but she's already stretched thin with her own family. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: The cost will depend on the specific tests ordered, Ms. Cassimatis. I will request the most essential tests initially to minimize expenses. We can discuss potential payment options with the clinic’s financial department. It is important to address this itch, as it is impacting your quality of life. Procrastinating further will not alleviate the problem. I will provide you with a lab order. You can present that to the lab technician, and they will assist you with the process. A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood. It is a minor inconvenience for a potentially significant diagnostic benefit. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. A lab order… and a phlebotomist. It just… sounds so complicated. But alright. If you think it’s best. I’ll… I’ll go to the lab. Just tell me where it is, and how long it will take. I need to arrange for Maria to pick me up afterwards, I don't drive anymore.
DOCTOR: The lab is located on the first floor, just past the radiology department. It should take approximately 30 minutes, including the wait time and the blood draw itself. Ensure you inform the technician of any medications you are currently taking. I will review the results as soon as they are available. We will then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, continue to moisturize your skin regularly with a hypoallergenic lotion. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. First floor… hypoallergenic lotion… Thank you. I… I guess I’ll go.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will expect to hear from you regarding scheduling a follow-up appointment once you’ve had the blood work completed. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms in the meantime.
PATIENT: .
