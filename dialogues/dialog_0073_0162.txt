DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bloating. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, alright? It’s… my stomach. It feels full, even when I haven’t eaten much. It’s been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, just… recently. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: “Recently” isn’t terribly helpful, but we can work with that. Alright. Bloating, feeling full quickly… and has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Uh… no, not really. Maybe… a little tired? But I work hard, pile driving, you know. That’ll make anyone tired. I don’t… I don’t sit around counting my symptoms, Doc. It’s just the stomach, being… puffy. And uncomfortable. Is that all you need to know? I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: Fatigue can be relevant, Mr. Kristofik. But alright. “Puffy” and uncomfortable. Does anything relieve the discomfort?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Not really. Laying down, maybe. But I can't just lay down all day, can I? It comes and goes, mostly after I eat. And it doesn't matter what I eat. Seriously, I've tried different stuff. It’s just… random. Look, I just want something to make it stop. Is that too much to ask? I’ve got a job to do.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask. But “random” makes it harder to pinpoint. When you say after you eat, is it immediately after, or a few hours later?
PATIENT: A few hours, usually. Not right away. Like… a couple hours after lunch, or dinner. Sometimes even overnight. It's not consistent, which is the problem! I don’t have time for things that aren’t consistent. Look, is there a pill you can just give me to… you know… deal with it? I don’t need a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, but I can’t simply prescribe something without a little more information. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What's that even mean? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to. It's normal. I don't… track it or anything. This is getting ridiculous. You’re asking me all sorts of personal questions, and I just want my stomach to not feel like a balloon. Is this what doctors do? Waste people's time?
DOCTOR: It's important to rule out potential causes, Mr. Kristofik. Changes in bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, anything different from your usual – can be a clue. Are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Just… the bloating. And feeling kinda sluggish, like I said. Look, my wife… she used to handle all this stuff. Asking about… everything. I just told her what was wrong, and she figured it out. Now… it’s just me, and I don't have time for a twenty-minute interrogation about my… bowel habits. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little insulted. Is this going somewhere, or should I just leave? I’ve got work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try this differently. Given your fatigue and bloating, and since you haven’t noticed any weight loss, nausea, or changes in bowel habits... it could be something as simple as a dietary issue, or perhaps some mild irritable bowel syndrome. But we should still do a basic physical exam to rule out anything more serious. Can I at least listen to your abdomen?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but if that's what it takes… Just don’t take too long, alright? I really need to get back to work. And please don’t ask me any more questions about… things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your stomach sounds, and then I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. Try to relax as much as possible. Your bowel sounds are… normal, present, but slightly sluggish. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No. Not really. It just feels… full. Like a balloon, I already told you. Stop pressing so hard. You’re making it worse. Look, is this going to take much longer? I swear, my wife was a much better doctor, and she didn't poke and prod like this. It's just… uncomfortable. Can't you just give me something for the bloating and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. There's no significant tenderness to palpation, which is reassuring. Given your history, normal bowel sounds, and the absence of significant pain… and your… insistence… I'm going to suggest a trial of an over-the-counter simethicone for the bloating. It's a gas reliever. However, if the symptoms persist or worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms – fever, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, weight loss – you need to come back immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Simethicone. Gas reliever. Got it. Look, I'm not one for fancy medications, so over-the-counter is fine. Just… as long as it works. And no more questions, alright? I need to get back to work. This whole thing has been a waste of time, honestly. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kristofik, you can go. I’ve documented our consultation and the plan. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or worsen at any time, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And try to get some rest. Have a good day. .
