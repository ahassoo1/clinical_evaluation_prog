DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Tayar is name. Doctor… Abady, yes? Look, I need… shots. For travel. My wife… she would always handle this. Now… now I need to go. Somewhere far. Nepal is… not good now. Business. Important business. Not my business, really. But I have to go. So, need the… things. For sickness. Before I go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar, I understand. You need travel vaccinations. It sounds like you’re planning a trip relatively soon, and your wife usually handles these preparations. No problem at all, we can certainly get that sorted out for you. To make sure I recommend the correct vaccinations, could you tell me where exactly you’ll be traveling to?
PATIENT: Somewhere… hot. Dusty. Lots of… buildings. Not mountains. My wife… she had the papers. Everything. I just… followed her. It was… India, I think. Yes. India. Big place. Lots of people. Before… you know. I don't know the city. She did all the booking. I just… went.
DOCTOR: Okay, India. That's helpful. It is a big place, and recommendations vary depending on the specific region. Since you don't recall the city, let's err on the side of caution and cover the most common recommendations for general travel throughout India. Before we proceed, have you traveled to India before?
PATIENT: Maybe. A long time ago. Before my wife… before everything. I think so. We went to… lots of places. Temples. Old places. I don't… really remember. It was all very… crowded. And hot. Always hot. Did I get the… things then? I don't know. She always… took care of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like it’s possible you’ve had some vaccinations in the past, but we can’t be certain. To be safe, we’ll review what's generally recommended for travel to India, and I'll assess your immunity if needed. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications or vaccines?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. My wife… she asked me this. Every time. I always said no. I get… a little itchy sometimes. But that's just… skin. Everyone gets itchy skin. Never had… a bad reaction. To anything. Except… well. Never mind. That was… different. Not a medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. My wife… she would give me things. For my… stomach. When we traveled. But I don't take anything now. Just… tea. And water. Sometimes. Not much water. Makes me… uncomfortable. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses… I had the fever, once. Long time ago. When I was young. Very sick. But I got better. Surgeries… no. Never had surgery. My wife… she kept me healthy. Always made me eat good food. Lots of vegetables. Before… before everything. She was a good woman.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like you've been generally healthy. Just to complete the picture, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… my father, he had the… cough. Bad cough. For a long time. Then… he just stopped breathing. My mother… she was always weak. Very thin. But nothing… serious. Just old age. No one else… that I know of. We don’t talk about these things. Not in my family. Bad luck to talk about sickness.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, before we discuss specific vaccinations, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Yes. Okay. As long as it is… quick. I have things to do. Important things. Not much time. Just… check. And tell me what… things I need. For the sickness. Before I go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. It will be quick. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90, but not drastically so. It’s something we can monitor. Ears look clear, and your throat is… slightly red, but no obvious signs of infection. Do you feel any pain when I gently press here?
PATIENT: Red throat? Maybe. It's dry. Always dry. The air… it's bad. Makes everything dry. And the pressure… yes. A little. But I always feel… pressure. In my head. Not a bad pain. Just… there. Like a weight. My wife… she would give me tea. For the pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you may have some mild dehydration contributing to the dryness and perhaps the sensation of pressure. The pressure could also be related to stress, given the travel you have planned. I’ll make a note of that. Now, regarding vaccinations, based on your travel to India, I recommend Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccines. Depending on the specific region you’ll be visiting, we may also consider Japanese Encephalitis and Rabies. Have you had any of these vaccinations previously?
PATIENT: Hepatitis… Typhoid… sounds… complicated. I don't remember. My wife… she handled all this. Papers. Lists. She knew everything. No. I don’t think so. I don’t remember getting… those. Too many things. Before. Rabies… is that for… dogs? I don’t like dogs. They bite.
DOCTOR: You are right, Rabies is often associated with dog bites, but it can also be transmitted by other animals. Given the potential risks in certain areas of India, it's something to consider. Since you don’t recall having these vaccinations, we’ll proceed with Hepatitis A and Typhoid initially. Hepatitis A requires two doses, spaced six months apart, but we can give you the first dose today. Typhoid is a single injection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Injection… yes. Just… get it done. Quickly. I have things to do. Six months… that is a long time. Can’t I just… take a pill? A strong pill? My wife… she always had pills. For everything. Much easier than… needles.
DOCTOR: There is an oral Typhoid vaccine, yes. However, it requires multiple doses over a longer period than the injection, and it is not as effective. For optimal protection, especially with a short timeline, the injection is the recommended option. The oral vaccine also carries a slightly higher risk of side effects. Regarding Hepatitis A, there is no pill option. It must be administered via injection. We can discuss other preventative measures, like safe food and water practices, to supplement the vaccinations. Would you like to proceed with the injections today, and I can provide you with detailed information on how to minimize your risk while traveling?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… do it. Both. Quickly. And tell me… what to eat. What to drink. My wife… she always said “boil it”. But I don't want to boil everything. Too much trouble. Just… what to avoid. Simple things. So I don't get… sick. Before I go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. I understand. Let’s get these done, and then I’ll give you some practical advice. There you go. Both done. You may experience some mild soreness at the injection site for a day or two, but it should subside on its own. Regarding food and water, the safest options are bottled water, carbonated beverages, and hot food served fresh. Avoid ice, tap water, raw fruits and vegetables, and unpasteurized dairy products. Be cautious of street food, even if it appears freshly cooked. If you can’t peel it or boil it, don’t eat it. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Boil it… peel it… no ice… sounds… difficult. I like fruit. Fresh fruit. And sometimes… a little ice in my tea. Is it really that important? My wife… she was always so careful. But I traveled with her… and I never got… too sick. Just… a little upset sometimes. Is there… a pill? For the upset stomach? Something I can take… just in case?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. It’s a matter of balancing risk and convenience. The risk of getting sick from contaminated food and water in India is relatively high, and it can ruin your trip. While you might not get seriously ill, even a mild stomach upset can be very disruptive. There are medications you can take to prevent traveler's diarrhea. Loperamide, for example, can help slow down the digestive system. And bismuth subsalicylate, like Pepto-Bismol, can also provide some protection. However, these medications only treat the symptoms and don’t prevent infection entirely. It’s best to focus on preventative measures first. I can prescribe you Loperamide to have on hand, just in case. But I strongly recommend being very careful with your food and water choices while you're traveling. Do you want me to write you a prescription for Loperamide?
PATIENT: Loperamide… yes. Okay. Just… in case. My wife… she always said “better safe than sorry”. Write the prescription. And… tell me again. The water… can I drink the tea? If it’s hot? She always drank the tea. And I never… never got too sick. Just… a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This is for Loperamide. Take two tablets as soon as you experience diarrhea, then one tablet after each loose stool, up to a maximum of eight tablets per day. Regarding tea, hot tea is generally safe, as the boiling process kills most harmful bacteria. However, it's important to make sure the water used to make the tea is boiled thoroughly. If you’re unsure of the water source, it’s best to avoid it altogether. To recap, stick to bottled water, carbonated beverages, and hot food served fresh. Avoid ice, raw fruits and vegetables, and unpasteurized dairy products. Be cautious of street food, and make sure any tea you drink is made with boiled water. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s everything. Water… hot tea… pills… It sounds… complicated. But I will try. My wife… she would be proud. Just… I hope I don’t get too sick. Before I go. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tayar. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, but you’ve got this. Being mindful of these precautions will significantly reduce your risk. Please, if you experience any concerning symptoms while you're traveling – high fever, severe diarrhea, or persistent vomiting – seek medical attention immediately. I wish you a safe and productive trip. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. .
