DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you don't mind. I'm pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that'd be great.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Of course. Though I do find a brief history is helpful, even with results in hand. It helps me contextualize things... but alright. You had some blood work done on… July 19th, if I’m reading this correctly. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, July 19th. That's right. I remember because it was right before my flight to Bora Bora. Look, I just need to know if everything's okay so I can, you know, be okay for the trip. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Okay” is a rather broad term, Ms. Kovtun. And flights to… Bora Bora. Right. Well, let's see... your complete blood count was within normal limits. Your metabolic panel… slightly elevated cholesterol, but not alarming. Your thyroid function was normal. Vitamin D is a bit low, which is… common. Any family history of high cholesterol, or thyroid issues, perhaps?
PATIENT: Hmm. Cholesterol… My grandfather, on my mother’s side, had something with his heart, I think. But I don't really know the details. He lived to be 90, though, so it couldn’t have been that bad. And Vitamin D… I spend a lot of time surfing, but maybe not enough time not covered in sunscreen? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Kovtun. Sunscreen is… sensible. However, it does block Vitamin D absorption. As for your grandfather... a history of cardiac issues is relevant, even if the details are unclear. We’ll need to monitor your cholesterol. And the Vitamin D is easily addressed. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn't? I've been training pretty hard for a competition. Honestly, I feel fine. Is the cholesterol something I need to be worried about right now? Like, will it stop me from surfing?
DOCTOR: "Worried" is… a strong word. It's managed, Ms. Kovtun. Not ignored. Your levels are not currently high enough to warrant immediate intervention, but they are trending in a direction we should address proactively. Surfing itself shouldn’t be impacted, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial. Have you considered your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? I eat… fish. A lot of fish. And fruit. And rice. I try to avoid processed stuff. Look, I'm pretty active. I don't really eat a lot of junk food. Is this going to involve a whole lecture about kale and quinoa? Because I really don't have time for that right now.
DOCTOR: It’s not about “kale and quinoa”, Ms. Kovtun. It’s about balance. And frankly, a diet primarily of fish and rice, while not inherently bad, lacks certain nutrients. We should discuss your lipid profile in more detail. I’m seeing a high LDL – the “bad” cholesterol – and low HDL, the “good” cholesterol. Do you have any family history of early-onset heart disease?
PATIENT: Early-onset… my uncle, on my dad’s side, had a heart attack when he was, like, 50. But he smoked a lot. And drank. I don’t do any of that. Is that the LDL thing? Look, can we just get a prescription for the Vitamin D? I’ll try to eat more… colorful stuff. Can we do that?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Kovtun. I will write you a prescription for 2000 IU of Vitamin D daily. However, I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment in three months to re-check your lipid profile. And I do suggest you consult with a nutritionist. Ignoring this could lead to… complications. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. Just… please hurry? I have a flight to catch, eventually. And honestly, I'm pretty sure a little extra fish oil will fix everything. It always does.
DOCTOR: Here. And while fish oil can be beneficial, it is not a substitute for a comprehensive approach to health. I'm documenting my recommendation for nutritional counseling, and a follow-up appointment. Are there any other concerns before I conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. Seriously. I appreciate you not making me listen to a lecture about… kale. I really need to get going. Can I just schedule the follow-up with the receptionist? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Kovtun. The receptionist can schedule that for you. Have a… safe trip. .
