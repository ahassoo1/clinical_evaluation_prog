DOCTOR: Hello Janeth, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I suppose. Well, it’s not really a problem, you understand. More… a little boost I need. My daughter, she says I should come get a card from you. A “get well” card, or one of those… encouraging ones. You know, to cheer me up a bit. It’s silly, really. But she insisted.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Janeth. Sometimes a little support is all we need. And I’m happy to help in any way I can. So, your daughter is concerned about your mood?
PATIENT: Concerned is a strong word. She just… fusses. Always has. Says I don’t take care of myself. Thinks I need… something to lift my spirits. Honestly, I’m perfectly fine. It’s just… life, you know? Things happen. It’s not like I’m sick or anything. I just thought, if the doctor writes a nice message, maybe she’ll stop worrying so much. It's more for her peace of mind than mine, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your daughter is very caring, and wants the best for you. Even if you feel perfectly fine, it's good that she's encouraging you to seek support. Just to be thorough, and to make sure we're not missing anything, could you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally, over the last few weeks?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. “Feelings.” That’s a big word, isn't it? I’ve been… normal. I go to work, I come home, I cook. My husband, he mostly keeps to himself in the garden. We eat dinner. We watch the news. It’s… routine. I don't go around feeling things, if that makes sense. I’m not one for dramatics. I get tired, of course. Work is work. But everyone gets tired. Is there a specific feeling you’re asking about? Because honestly, I haven’t been… sad or anything. Just…existing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Janeth. “Existing” is a very valid way to feel, and it’s good you’re able to describe it. Sometimes a change in routine, or feeling just… “off,” can be more than just tiredness. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Well… the sleep is… okay. I used to sleep like a log, but now I wake up a few times during the night. Not because I’m unwell, just… needing to adjust the blankets or something. And my appetite… it’s probably a little smaller than it used to be. But I’m not starving, don’t worry. I still eat. Just… not as much rice as I used to. My husband says I’m getting too thin, but he always says that. And energy… I get tired at work, like I said. But who doesn’t? It’s a factory, Doctor. It's not a spa! Honestly, I think your daughter is making a mountain out of a molehill. She always does.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to tell me all of this, Janeth. Even small changes can be important. It sounds like you’ve noticed some shifts in sleep, appetite, and energy – and it’s helpful to know your husband has noticed you’ve been a little thinner. Just to get a broader picture, have you experienced any changes in your mood, like feeling more irritable, less interested in things you used to enjoy, or difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Irritable? No, not really. People at work can be annoying, of course, but that's always been the case. I just ignore them. Less interested in things… well, I never was one for hobbies, so there’s not much to be less interested in. I used to enjoy watching the news, but lately… it’s just depressing. Everyone fighting all the time. But that’s the world, isn’t it? Not something I’m feeling, more like something I’m observing. And concentrating… I can still assemble the parts just fine. I’ve been doing it for twenty years. I don’t think my brain is failing. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to wonder why I’m even here. It’s a waste of both our time. My daughter…she’s just overly sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janeth, and I appreciate you being so honest with me. It does sound like your daughter is very concerned, and it’s good you’re willing to explore what’s going on, even if you feel perfectly fine. It sounds like you've noticed some changes – a little less sleep, reduced appetite, some fatigue, and perhaps less enjoyment from the news. While these changes might seem small, they can sometimes add up. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any other symptoms like headaches, muscle aches, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about… bodies. I’m not one for complaining about bodies. Headaches… sometimes. Everyone gets headaches. I take a paracetamol and it goes away. Muscle aches… occasionally. From lifting things at work, probably. I’m not a young woman anymore. And bowel habits… well, I don’t discuss those things with doctors. It’s… private. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite healthy for my age. I eat my dal and rice, I keep busy, and I don’t cause trouble. I really think this is all a fuss about nothing. My daughter should focus on her own life, not mine. She has plenty of problems of her own, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janeth. It sounds like you're generally quite healthy, and that you’ve managed these minor symptoms on your own for some time. And I respect your privacy. To get a more complete picture, would you mind if I quickly checked your blood pressure and listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. But I’m telling you now, it’s perfectly normal. I don’t have any fancy problems. Just a normal, hardworking woman. Don’t go making a big deal out of it. And please, don’t ask me about my… bowel habits again. It's really quite rude. Go on, then. Get it over with. But I’m warning you, it’s going to be perfectly normal. I’m wasting my whole afternoon here for nothing, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. I assure you, I’m not trying to make a big deal out of anything. Just a routine check, as we discussed. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs sound clear. That being said, a slightly elevated blood pressure can sometimes contribute to feeling tired or a little “off”. And I do want to address the changes you’ve noticed – less sleep, reduced appetite, fatigue, and less enjoyment from things you used to enjoy. These could be related to stress, or a number of other things. I'm going to order a basic blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and other common issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Elevated? See? I knew it. My blood pressure. My husband always said I worry too much. But I don’t see how worrying causes high blood pressure. It’s just…life! And now you want to take blood? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure I like this. I don’t like needles. And what if something is wrong? I don’t want to hear about anything being wrong. I just wanted a card to make my daughter stop fussing! But… alright. If you must. But don’t go poking around too much. And no scary news, please. Just tell me if it’s all normal. And then can I please get that card? For my daughter. Before I faint. Is that too much to ask? A simple card.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. We’ll take it one step at a time. A simple blood test is just to get a baseline, to make sure everything is working as it should. It's a very common procedure, and we’ll be quick and gentle. And I promise, I will only share the results that are important, and explain them clearly. And absolutely, we can get a card for your daughter after this. I even have a few encouraging ones right here. Let’s get the blood test done first, and then we can talk about the results and pick out a card. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Get it over with. But I’m warning you, if I faint, I’m blaming you. And I want a really cheerful card. Not one of those sad, gloomy ones. Something with flowers, maybe. And a nice message. Something about… being a good mother. My daughter is always saying I don’t tell her enough. And please, don’t poke around too much. I hate needles. Where do you poke? Is it going to hurt? I really don't like this. Just get it over with, quickly, quickly. And then the card. Before I change my mind about the whole thing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. It will just be a small prick in your arm, and it will be over before you know it. We have plenty of cheerful cards to choose from, and I'll make sure we find one with a lovely message about being a wonderful mother. There you go. All done. Just a little pressure for a moment. See?
PATIENT: Oh! That did hurt a bit. See? I told you. I hate needles. And it's still throbbing. Honestly, Doctor, you have no idea how much I dislike this. Is it all done now? Really? And how long until I get the results? Days? Weeks? Honestly, I don't want to worry about it. I just want a card. And a cup of tea. This has been a very stressful experience. Now, about those cards… let’s get this over with before I faint. Show me the cheerful ones. The ones with flowers. And no gloomy messages. A motherly message, you said? Good.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. It's perfectly alright to feel a little stressed after that. The results will be back within a few business days – usually three to five. We can call you as soon as they're available. Here are a few cheerful options. We have some with lovely messages about motherhood, strength, and kindness. Take your time, and choose whichever one resonates with you the most. How about this one?
PATIENT: Hmm. Sunflowers are alright, I suppose. But they're a bit…bright. Too cheerful, maybe. Honestly, I’m not a very cheerful person. But the message… “A mother’s love is a guiding light.” That’s…nice. My daughter always said I was her guiding light. Even when I was yelling at her to clean her room. This one is a bit more…subtle. Lavender is my favorite scent. But the message… a bit bland, isn’t it? “Thinking of you…” My daughter wants more than just thinking! She wants… praise. Acknowledgement. Appreciation for everything I’ve done for her. Oh, honestly, this is too much stress. Just pick one for me, Doctor. Anything with a nice message about motherhood. I’m exhausted. And I need a cup of tea. Before I faint. Anything. Just pick one.
DOCTOR: Alright, how about this one?
PATIENT: Yes. That one will do. Sunflowers are alright, I suppose. And the message… yes, that’s nice. My daughter… she’ll like that. “A mother’s love is a guiding light.” She always said I was her guiding light. Even when I was yelling at her to clean her room. Now, about that cup of tea… is there any chance of getting one? And perhaps a biscuit? This has been a very stressful experience. Honestly, I need something to calm my nerves. A biscuit, and a cup of tea. Before I faint. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Janeth. Absolutely. Let me get you a cup of tea and a biscuit right away. And then we can discuss the next steps, once you’ve had a chance to relax a bit. Here you go. Earl Grey or chamomile?
PATIENT: Chamomile, please. Something calming. And a biscuit… the one with the chocolate chips, if you have it. Honestly, a biscuit and a cup of chamomile tea… that’s all I need right now. Yes. That’s much better. A biscuit, and a cup of chamomile tea… before I faint. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Now, about those results… will they be very bad? Honestly, I’m not a very strong person. I might faint.
DOCTOR: Here you go. Take your time, and relax. As for the results, it’s too early to say. The blood test is just to get a baseline, to make sure everything is working as it should. It’s likely everything will be perfectly normal. But if there is anything unusual, we’ll discuss it thoroughly and come up with a plan together. For now, let’s just focus on relaxing and enjoying your tea. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you feel a little better now?
PATIENT: Yes. Much better. The tea is lovely. And the biscuit… chocolate chips are my favorite. Honestly, a biscuit and a cup of chamomile tea… that’s all I need right now. But… what if something is wrong? My husband… he’s always saying I worry too much. And my daughter… she’ll be very upset. Honestly, I’m not a very strong person. I might faint. What if I need… treatments? Or… surgery? Will it be very painful? Honestly, I’m not a very strong person. I might faint.
DOCTOR: Janeth, let's take things one step at a time. We haven’t even received the results yet, and worrying about treatments or surgery right now isn’t helpful. If the results do show anything unusual, we’ll discuss it thoroughly, explain all your options, and make a plan together. And rest assured, if any treatment is necessary, we’ll do everything we can to ensure your comfort. There are many ways to manage pain, and we’ll work together to find the best solution for you. For now, let’s just focus on enjoying your tea and biscuit. And remember, I’m here to support you, every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do to make you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: No… I think… I think I’m alright. The tea is lovely. And the biscuit… chocolate chips are my favorite. Honestly, a biscuit and a cup of chamomile tea… that’s all I need right now. My daughter… she’ll like this card. “A mother’s love is a guiding light.” She always said I was her guiding light. Even when I was yelling at her to clean her room. Yes. I think… I think I’m alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Now… I suppose I should go home. Before I faint. Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. I'm glad you're feeling a little better. Yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the blood test results. How about next week, on Tuesday afternoon?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… Yes, that will do. Honestly, I suppose I should go home now. Before I faint. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And thank you for the card. My daughter will be very pleased. Now… I suppose I should go home. Before I faint. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again. Before I faint.
DOCTOR:
