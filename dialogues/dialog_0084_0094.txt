DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… morning. I think… my husband told me to come. Something about… learning stuff? I don't really remember. He worries too much, you know? It's not like I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like this might be a check-up, then. Sometimes it's good to get things looked at even if you’re not feeling unwell. Your husband's concern is good. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why he thinks you should be seen?
PATIENT: He says… I get short of breath sometimes. When I work, mostly. I do sheet metal, it’s… heavy. But I always finish my work! He just… fusses. I don’t know. It’s just work. Everyone gets tired. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with work. That’s good information. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. It's important to rule out anything serious, even if it is just from the work. When you say shortness of breath, can you describe it?
PATIENT: Describe it…? Like… I breathe harder. Faster. Like when you run, but I’m not running. Just… bending metal. It happens after a while. Not right away. And… I guess it goes away when I stop. It's not a big deal. Really. He makes it sound like I'm going to fall over. He watches too many dramas, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes on gradually with exertion, and improves with rest. Does it happen every time you do sheet metal work, or is it more random?
PATIENT: Umm… most times. If I’m really busy, yeah. Lots of bending, lots of lifting… then I get… winded. Sometimes, if it’s a really hot day, too. Makes it harder to breathe. But I always finish. I have to. My boss… he doesn’t like complainers. He says… strong people just push through. I don’t want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re very dedicated to your work. And it’s good you're pushing through, but we want to make sure there’s nothing underlying causing the shortness of breath. Aside from the shortness of breath, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. My ankles… they get a little puffy sometimes. At the end of the day. But I’m on my feet all day. That's normal, right? And… maybe I cough a little. Not a big cough. Just a little tickle in my throat. It’s the dust, probably. Lots of metal dust where I work. He worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling and a mild cough… that’s helpful to know. And you're right, dust could certainly be contributing to the cough. Have you had any chest pain or wheezing with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Never. Wheezing… I don’t know what that even is. Is that like… a whistling sound? I don't think so. I just feel tired, and have to breathe harder. Like I said, it's just work. I'm not a weakling. My husband… he doesn't understand. He gets upset when I tell him it's nothing. He says I should listen to the doctor. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Airam. We just want to be thorough. And I assure you, we’ll try to be as quick as possible. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history…? I… I don’t really… go to the doctor. Not unless I have to. I broke my arm once, when I was little. Fell out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. And… I think I had the flu once. That’s it. I’m pretty healthy. I eat rice, mostly. My husband makes me take vitamins. He thinks I don’t eat enough vegetables. He’s always telling me what to do. I don't remember anything else. Really. Is this over soon?
DOCTOR: Okay, limited medical history. That’s good to know. And it sounds like your husband is very attentive to your well-being. To continue, are you currently taking any medications, besides the vitamins he gives you?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. Nothing. Just the vitamins. He gives them to me every morning with breakfast. He says they’re good for my bones. They taste like… dirt. But I take them. He gets upset if I don’t. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel weird. I don’t need medication. I'm fine. I’ve been working this job for ten years. Ten years! And I've never had any problems. Until he started worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. And you have no known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but everyone does, right? And dust… I guess I get sneezy at work. But that's just the metal dust. I don’t get… rashes or anything. Not like a serious allergy. Just a little sniffle. My husband… he doesn't know much about allergies. He just says I need to wash my hands more. He’s always telling me what to do. Is this it? Can I go now? I have to pick up my daughter.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Airam. I think it would be best to do a quick physical exam. It will just involve listening to your lungs and checking your heart rate and blood pressure. We can also check your ankles, given the swelling you mentioned. This will help me get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick. And don’t poke me too much. I have things to do. My daughter… she has a recital tomorrow. I promised I'd help her practice. And my husband… he’ll be furious if I’m late. He makes a big deal about everything. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the table. I will try to be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your pulse is normal. I'm listening to your lungs now... I do hear some slight wheezing on both sides, especially when you exhale. Not alarming, but worth noting. And I do notice some mild swelling in both ankles. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Wheezing? What does that mean? And my blood pressure? Is something wrong? My husband is going to kill me. He told me I needed to watch my salt intake. I like pickled vegetables. Is it really that bad? And my ankles… they just feel tired. Like I said, I'm on my feet all day. It's just work! He worries too much. He always does. Are we done now? I really have to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. The slight wheezing means there's a narrowing of your airways, which could be caused by a number of things – allergies, asthma, or even irritation from the metal dust. The elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor, and reducing salt intake could be helpful, as your husband suggested. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I think we should do a chest x-ray to rule out anything serious in your lungs. And a basic blood test to check your overall health and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood test? Oh, for heaven’s sake. Now he’s going to be even more upset! He hates needles. And x-rays… are those dangerous? I don’t want to be exposed to radiation. And my kidneys? What's wrong with my kidneys? I just want to go home. He’s going to be furious if I’m late picking up my daughter. She’s been practicing for months! This is all a waste of time. I feel perfectly fine. I really think this is unnecessary. Can’t I just… take some vitamins and go home? I'm sure it's just stress. My job is very demanding.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Airam. The x-ray does involve a very small amount of radiation, far less than you receive from a cross-country flight, and it will give us valuable information. The blood test is also relatively quick and painless. We need to rule out anything serious, and these tests are the best way to do that. I want to assure you, we're not trying to cause you unnecessary worry. But given your shortness of breath, wheezing, and swelling, it's important to be thorough. I also understand you have commitments, and we will try to make this as efficient as possible. If you're hesitant about the tests, we can discuss a referral to a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – who can further evaluate your condition. However, I strongly recommend we proceed with the x-ray and blood tests for a clearer picture. What do you think?
PATIENT: A… a pulmonologist? Oh, for crying out loud. He's going to be furious if I have to see another doctor. He hates going to specialists. He says they just want to make more money. And what’s a specialist even going to do? I just want to go home and help my daughter. This is ridiculous. Fine. Do the stupid tests. But hurry up. And don’t poke me too much. And tell me the results right away. I don’t want to wait days and days. And… can I at least get a glass of water? I feel a little faint. This is all so stressful. I'm sure it's just my nerves. He's going to be so mad. .
