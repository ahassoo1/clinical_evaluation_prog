DOCTOR: Hi Ronnald, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello there. Yes, um… well, it’s about some papers I need. My wife, she handles most of this sort of thing, but she told me to come get… something for work? It has to do with… taking some time off, I think. FMLA, maybe? Or something like that. Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur. She just said paperwork. Lots of it, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, paperwork for FMLA – Family and Medical Leave. That’s perfectly alright, it can be confusing. Your wife is right to get the ball rolling with documentation. So, just to clarify, are you needing this paperwork because you're planning to take time off for a medical reason, or is this more of a preventative measure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a good question. Let me think. I think it’s because… well, my back’s been bothering me something awful lately. It comes and goes, you see. Mostly goes, thankfully. But when it does come… well, it makes it hard to… sit for long periods. And I do a lot of sitting with my… duties. Yes, duties. So, I suppose it is for a medical reason. Preventative… no, not really. More like… necessary, when it flares up. Does that make sense? I hope I’m not being too confusing.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ronnald. You're explaining it perfectly. It sounds like your back pain is intermittent, but impacts your ability to do your work when it flares up. That’s very helpful to know. Could you tell me a bit more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the pain. Hmm. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Lower back, right around… well, right there. And sometimes it shoots down my leg, a bit. Not always, though. And it gets worse when I’ve been sitting for too long, like I said. Or if I bend over too much. It’s just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. And it makes me… tired, if it lasts a while. I usually just rest and it goes away. But lately, it’s been… longer. That's probably why my wife wants all these papers, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely sounds like something we should document properly. A dull ache in the lower back radiating down the leg, worsened by sitting and bending… and lasting longer recently. Okay. Have you noticed anything that helps the pain, besides rest?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Well, a warm bath helps a bit. And sometimes, if I walk around for a while, it loosens up. Not a cure, mind you, just… temporary relief. My wife, she rubs my back sometimes. That's nice. And I try to stretch, but I'm not very good at it. It's hard, you know, getting older. Things just… don't move the way they used to. Honestly, I mostly just try to avoid doing things that make it worse. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ronnald. Knowing what makes it better and worse is important. Warm baths, walking, your wife’s help… all good things. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Let me think. Not that I recall, no. Nothing serious, anyway. I used to be quite active, you see. Played a bit of rugby in my youth. Maybe a few bumps and bruises here and there, but nothing that needed a doctor. And later on, with my… work, there's some lifting involved sometimes, but nothing too strenuous. I always try to be careful. Now that I think about it… a few years back, I did twist my back when I was gardening. But it didn’t last long. Just a bit sore for a couple of days. Nothing like this current thing. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I was asking. So, no major back injuries, just a minor twist a few years ago. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about other parts of your body, just to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling… You know, now that you mention it… sometimes, yes. Just a little, in my toes. Mostly at night, I think. It doesn’t last long, and it’s not very bad. I just wiggle them around and it goes away. I figured it was just… old age again. Is that something I should be worried about? It’s just a little thing, really. My wife worries about everything, so I try not to bother her with the small stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned it, Ronnald. Even “small things” can be important. Numbness and tingling in your toes, intermittent, worse at night… We’ll want to keep that in mind. Now, have you had any problems with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a rather personal question, isn't it? Well… no. Not that I've noticed. Everything seems to be… functioning normally, if you know what I mean. I haven’t had any trouble… going to the bathroom, or anything like that. Just… normal. Really. I hope that's an acceptable answer. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ronnald. It is a personal question, and you’ve answered perfectly. It's important to ask, but perfectly normal to feel a bit embarrassed. "Normal" is a very good answer. Now, just a few more general questions. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor put me on some pills for that a few years back. I take them every day. Otherwise… no, not that I know of. I had a bit of trouble with my cholesterol once, but that cleared up with diet and exercise. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of fruit and fish. My wife keeps a close eye on all that, to be honest. She’s very good about my health. She makes sure I go to all my appointments. Do you need a list of my medications? I think she has one in the car. She’s always prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. High blood pressure, managed with medication. And you’ll have a list of your medications – that would be very helpful. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything the doctor has given me. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that’s gone now. Mostly just a bit of a sniffle sometimes. But no serious allergies, thankfully. I always tell the doctor if I think something doesn't agree with me, so I’m pretty sure I haven't accidentally taken anything I’m allergic to. Is that helpful? My wife always double-checks too, just in case. She's very thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ronnald. No known medication allergies. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to check your back, legs, and reflexes, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll start with your back. Could you please stand up and bend forward gently, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. My back isn’t what it used to be, you know. Is this alright? Not too far, I hope? It feels a bit stiff this morning. How far do you want me to go? I don’t want to pull anything.
DOCTOR: Just as far as is comfortable, Ronnald. Don’t push yourself. I'm just assessing your range of motion and looking for any areas of tenderness. Okay, I see you have some limited flexibility, and there's a bit of discomfort with forward bending. Now, could you please stand up straight?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s better. Although, it’s still a bit stiff. It feels a bit… tight. Like a knot. Do you feel that? I haven't had this kind of pain before. Usually it's just a dull ache, but this is different. It’s more… sharp. And it’s worse when I move. I hope it's not serious.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do feel some muscle spasm and tenderness in your lower back, Ronnald. It’s not surprising given your description of the pain and limited range of motion. Now, let’s check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Could you please sit back down?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. My legs feel a bit… tingly, sometimes. Like pins and needles. Mostly at night, though. Is that something to worry about? My wife always says I should mention everything, no matter how small. She’s very… attentive, you see. She worries about me constantly. I hope this isn’t too much trouble for you.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Ronnald. It’s good your wife encourages you to mention everything. Let’s check those reflexes. I’m going to use this little hammer to tap on your knees and ankles. It might feel a little strange, but shouldn’t be painful. Okay, your reflexes are a bit diminished on both sides, but fairly symmetrical. Now, I’m going to check the strength in your legs. Could you please press your feet down against my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Is that enough? It’s a bit difficult, you know. My legs aren’t what they used to be. I used to be quite strong, you see. Played rugby for years. But now… it’s not so easy. Is that strong enough? I don’t want to disappoint you.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Ronnald. You’re doing very well. Your strength is a bit reduced, but still within a reasonable range, considering your age and activity level. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on everything you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a muscle strain in your lower back, possibly with some mild nerve irritation causing the tingling in your toes. It doesn't sound like anything too serious, but we want to get it properly addressed.
PATIENT: Oh, a muscle strain. That's… good, isn’t it? Not serious? That’s a weight off my mind. My wife worries so much. She’ll be so glad to hear it’s not something terrible. So, what do I need to do? What kind of treatment will I need? Is there anything I should be avoiding? And what about the paperwork? Can we get that sorted out now? I really need to get that to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, a muscle strain is generally manageable. We’ll start with conservative treatment: that means rest, ice, compression, and elevation – RICE. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity that aggravates the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain and inflammation. I’m also going to recommend physical therapy to help you strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. As for the paperwork, yes, we can absolutely get that started. I’ll have my assistant print out the necessary forms for FMLA. We’ll fill those out together. It'll require some information about your medical history and my assessment. I'll also note the limitations of your current condition that may necessitate time off from work. Does that sound alright to you, Ronnald?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfect! Rest, ice, pain relievers… I can do that. And physical therapy… that sounds good too. I need to get back in shape anyway. And the paperwork… wonderful! That’s a huge relief. My wife will be so happy. So, should we start with the paperwork now? I’m ready whenever you are. And thank you, doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ronnald. I’m glad I could help. Let's get started on the paperwork then. My assistant, Sarah, will be right in with the forms. She'll guide you through everything. In the meantime, do you have any other questions for me before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Just the paperwork, please. And thank you again, doctor. You’ve been very kind. My wife will be thrilled to hear all this. She always worries about me, you see. I'm ready when Sarah gets here.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Sarah should be right with you. Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind while you’re filling out the forms. And remember, rest and take it easy. We’ll get you feeling better in no time. .
PATIENT: .
