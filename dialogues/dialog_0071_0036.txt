DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. I am here… for the check-up. Before the insurance starts, you understand? They require this physical, yes? It is… necessary paperwork.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A pre-insurance physical. Smart to get that done. Paperwork… right. Well, let’s just get some information down, make sure everything’s in order. It's good to be thorough. Now, are you having any particular health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. Nothing… specific. I work in the food factory, it is… repetitive. My back sometimes feels… tired. But that is to be expected, no? It is the work. I am strong man, though. 188 centimeters, you see. Not a small thing.
DOCTOR: Right, 188 centimeters… that is quite tall. And working in a food factory, repetitive work… yes, back fatigue is common. We'll definitely address that. Just to be clear, is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly at the end of the day, yes? After many hours… standing and moving boxes. It is not… a pain, exactly. More… a heaviness. Like I have carried too much. Not a problem needing… attention, I think. I take some rest, and it is better.
DOCTOR: A heaviness, mostly at the end of the day… that's helpful. And rest helps, good. Just to get a full picture, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your back, or going down your legs?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Tingling… maybe sometimes my fingers feel… cold. But that is the factory, you see? It is very cold in the cooling room. I wear gloves, but… still. It is not… from my back, I do not think. Just the cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Cold in the cooling room… that makes sense. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, just to check everything out. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Is there something… specific you are looking for? I assure you, I am very healthy. Good bones, strong muscles. A worker needs to be.
DOCTOR: I just want to check your range of motion, feel your spine, and make sure there aren't any obvious issues. Nothing to worry about, just routine. Now, could you bend forward and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Touch my toes? Is this… necessary? I am a grown man, not a child doing exercises. But… alright. There. Is that satisfactory? It is difficult, you see. My back is… strong, not flexible.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Noted. I see some limited range of motion, and a slight wince as you bend. That's useful information. Now, let’s try bending backwards, gently. Just as far as is comfortable. No need to push yourself. And I’ll just palpate your spine while you’re standing. Any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: A little… pressure. It is not pain, exactly. More like… you are poking a muscle that is tired. I told you, it is the work. You are feeling the strain. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Yes, I understand. Just trying to pinpoint the source of the discomfort. No major tenderness, just some muscle tightness. Okay. Now, could you walk on your heels for a few steps, and then on your toes?
PATIENT: Walk on my heels? This is… unusual. Is this standard procedure? But, fine. There. Is that what you needed? I do not enjoy being put through… tests like this. It feels… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Just assessing your reflexes and nerve function. A little unsteady, but nothing alarming. Now, just one more quick thing. Could you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Lie down? Now? Must I? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly fine. This is… a waste of time, is it not? But… alright. Get it over with quickly, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, just checking your reflexes. And just a quick assessment of your strength. Can you push down on my hand with your leg?
PATIENT: There. Is that… sufficient? I am strong, you see. Do not expect me to struggle. I work with heavy boxes all day. This is… unnecessary, but I am cooperating. Is it almost finished?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Yes, very strong. Good. Okay, Mr. Barban, that’s all I need for the physical exam. Everything seems… within normal limits. Some muscle tightness in your back, which is likely related to your work, as you mentioned. No major concerns at this time. We should probably get an X-ray just to rule anything out, though. It's a precaution, just to be safe.
PATIENT: An X-ray? Now you tell me! Why was I not told this before? I have been… poked and prodded, made to lie down and… walk like a child! And now you want to expose me to… radiation? No. Absolutely not. I am perfectly healthy. This is a waste of my time and… frankly, insulting. I came for a pre-insurance physical, not a… medical investigation. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, please. It’s a standard precaution, a quick scan to… rule out anything serious. It's a very low dose of radiation, perfectly safe. But… alright. If you’re not comfortable, we can skip it. We’ll just document your symptoms, recommend rest and proper lifting techniques, and… submit the paperwork. I’ll write you a note for work, explaining the back fatigue. Will that suffice?
