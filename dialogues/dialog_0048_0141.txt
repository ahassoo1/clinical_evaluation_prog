DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Ferneding, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Brendan Ferneding. Though most folks just call me Brendan. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Sink, is it? I apologize, my memory’s usually quite good, but names… sometimes they slip.
DOCTOR: Yes, Sink. Dr. Sink. And it’s quite alright. Now, let's not waste time. You're here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, right. The itching. It’s… well, it’s everywhere, really. Started a couple of weeks ago, just a little annoyance, but it’s gotten worse. It’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not painful, just… constantly itchy. It's hard to describe, like little ants crawling all over.
DOCTOR: “Itching,” you say. And how long exactly has this “itching” been going on?
PATIENT: About two and a half weeks, I think. Maybe a little longer. It started subtly, mostly on my arms and back. I didn't think much of it at first, figured it was just dry skin, maybe from the summer heat. I tried some lotion, but it didn't really help. Then it spread to my legs and… well, pretty much everywhere now. I can pinpoint the start date because my grandson, Leo, was visiting. We were building a fort in the garden, August 15th, I believe.
DOCTOR: A fort. Right. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. I’ve been keeping to my routine, mostly. Gardening, a bit of reading, visiting with Leo when I can. I did try a new brand of laundry detergent a few weeks back, just a generic one from the supermarket. Could that be it? It smelled… a bit stronger than usual, maybe. I switched back to my old brand a few days ago, hoping it would help, but the itching’s still there. Oh, and I started taking a new vitamin supplement, a multivitamin. That was… around the same time as the detergent, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Detergent, vitamins… people and their self-treatment. Any fever, chills, or fatigue accompanying this “itching”?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No fever, no chills, and I haven’t felt particularly tired. I mean, I’m 53, so I get a little tired sometimes, but nothing unusual. No body aches or anything like that either. Just… the itch. It keeps me up at night sometimes, that's the worst part. I have to resist scratching, don't want to make it worse. It’s more of a nuisance than anything, but it's a persistent one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your skin. Please, remove your shirt and shoes. I need to examine the affected areas. And try to remain still.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Of course. Shoes off… shirt off… Just let me know if you need me to turn or anything. I haven’t been shirtless in… well, a while. Hope I’m not too pale. I mostly stay out of the sun these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No visible rash, no excoriations… skin appears generally healthy, despite your… sun avoidance. Some mild dryness, but nothing significant. I'm going to order a complete blood count and liver function tests. Just to rule things out. Don’t get excited, it’s likely nothing. I'll also put in a request for a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Complete blood count, liver function tests, basic metabolic panel… Is that going to involve a lot of needles? I'm not afraid of them, exactly, but I don't particularly enjoy them either. And what are we ruling out, if you don't mind me asking? Just trying to understand what's going on. Could it be… allergies, perhaps? I’ve never had any serious allergies before, but it's been a strange summer.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard workup, Mr. Ferneding. A few vials of blood. It's to rule out a multitude of things—anemia, infection, liver problems, kidney issues… allergies are possible, but unlikely given the lack of other symptoms. We'll see what the results say. The nurse will draw the blood. Don’t worry about it. Try to relax. I'm also referring you to a dermatologist. They are the real skin experts. I’m just doing the initial screening.
PATIENT: A dermatologist, huh? Okay. That sounds… sensible. I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. It’s good to know you’re covering all the bases. I suppose I’ll head over to the lab and get the blood drawn then. Is there anything I should do to prepare? Should I fast beforehand, or is it okay to eat something? Just want to make sure I do it right. And where exactly is the lab located? I'm not terribly familiar with this part of town.
DOCTOR: No fasting necessary. And the lab is downstairs, third door on the left. The nurse will explain everything. Frankly, I doubt it's anything serious. People come in here with all sorts of imagined ailments. Just try not to scratch. And try to be patient with the dermatologist. They get a lot of… cases. Here. Get this done as soon as possible. And I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. No scratching… I'll try. Thank you, Doctor Sink. I appreciate your time. I'll head downstairs now. .
