DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah, hi. It's about my nails, I think. They… they just look funny. Not good funny. I don't really know what's wrong with 'em, just that they don't look right. They're always… somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, “something” with your nails. Can you describe what you mean by “not right”?
PATIENT: Well… they're kinda bumpy. And the color is… off. Not like a pretty pink, more… yellow-ish? Brown-ish? I dunno. It's hard to explain. I don't paint 'em or nothin', never have. I just… notice 'em. They just look unhealthy, you know? Like somethin' bad is happenin'. It's been goin' on a while, I think. Maybe months? Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: Months, okay. Bumpy, and a yellow-brown discoloration. And this is all ten nails, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Oh, all of 'em, I think. Yeah, all ten. They all look kinda… the same bad. Not one is normal. I wouldn't say all the same, but pretty close. It's not like one is really bad and the rest are fine. They’re just… consistently not good. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explainin' things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Thut. You’re doing a very good job explaining. It sounds like this has been a gradual change over several months, affecting all of your nails. To get a better idea of what might be going on, can you tell me if you've noticed any changes to your skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm… let me see. Not really. I don't think so. Maybe a little dry sometimes? But I always have dry skin, everywhere. I put lotion on, but it doesn't really help much, honestly. I don't get… red or bumpy around 'em. Just kinda… normal dry skin. Like the rest of me. I don't pay much attention to my hands, to be honest. Other than the nails lookin' awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness or changes to the skin around the nails, just generally dry skin. Have you ever had any injuries to your hands or nails – any breaks, cuts, or infections?
PATIENT: Injuries… not that I remember. I do a little gardening, but nothin' serious. I might scratch 'em on somethin' sometimes, but nothin' deep. And I don't think I've ever had an infection. Not in my hands, anyway. I get sinus infections sometimes, but not my nails. No, I’m pretty sure I haven't had any injuries. I’d remember that, wouldn't I? They're my nails! I notice stuff about 'em.
DOCTOR: You would, yes. Alright. And are there any other symptoms you’ve noticed anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I'm always tired. But I’m always tired, so I don’t know if that counts. And my joints ache sometimes. My knees, mostly. But I'm old. Old people ache. I don’t think that's got nothin' to do with my nails. Honestly, I just want to know why my nails look so bad. They’re kinda embarrassing. I just want 'em normal again. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Thut. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The fatigue and joint pain are good information, though, so thank you for mentioning them. Before we move on to a physical examination, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
