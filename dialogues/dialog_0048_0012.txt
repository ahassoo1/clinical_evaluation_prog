DOCTOR: Right. Velda Squiers, 45 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor…Sink, is it? I'm here because I'm planning a cruise, a lovely one to the Mediterranean, and the cruise line requires a bit of medical information before I can confirm my booking. Nothing serious, mind you, just a formality, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Cruise lines and their… requirements. Alright. So, a pre-travel assessment. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
PATIENT: Perfectly understandable. It’s better to be safe than sorry, isn't it? I don’t have any particular worries, I just need a doctor to say I’m fit enough to go, really. I’m a fairly healthy woman, all things considered. Do you need me to fill out any forms, or would you rather just ask me some questions?
DOCTOR: Questions will be faster. We don’t have all day, do we?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly not, Doctor. I appreciate your efficiency. Very good. Fire away, then. I’m ready when you are. Though, if you do need me to write anything down later, just let me know. I have a rather good memory, so I can recall details easily enough.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s start with the obvious. Any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I had my appendix removed when I was a girl, a long time ago, and a touch of the flu every now and then, as one does, but nothing that's ever required any ongoing treatment. My late husband, bless his soul, had a bit of trouble with his heart, but I haven’t inherited any of that, thankfully. I’ve always been quite robust, I believe.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy… fine. Family history of heart trouble... noted. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to food, not to medications, not to animals, not to anything, as far as I know. I can eat shellfish, take penicillin, and I've always loved cats and dogs. Never a bother, never a rash, never a sniffle. It’s rather convenient, actually.
DOCTOR: Good. And currently, are you taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t take a single thing. I believe in a good diet and plenty of fresh air, that’s what I always say. My late husband was fond of multivitamins, but I never got into the habit. Just good, honest food and a bit of walking, that’s my prescription, if you will. I'm quite particular about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what prompted you to come in today, specifically?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, it’s this cruise, Doctor. The cruise line, Mare Nostra Cruises, they sent a rather sternly worded letter. It simply stated that they require a doctor’s note confirming I'm fit to travel, particularly as I’m going on a longer voyage. It’s more a matter of ticking a box, really, than anything else. I wouldn't want to lose my deposit, now would I? It was a rather good price.
DOCTOR: So, no specific symptoms or concerns you’re bringing to my attention?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. Absolutely nothing. I feel perfectly well. Perhaps a little tired after all the preparations for the trip - packing, arranging things at home, that sort of thing - but nothing a good night's sleep wouldn't fix. I assure you, I'm in excellent health for a woman of my age. A little bit of forward planning, that's all it is. I'm just being thorough, as one should be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be… complete. Lie back on the examination table, please. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Don't anticipate anything lengthy.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I understand. A quick check is perfectly sensible. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I do tend to get a little cold easily, so if you could perhaps keep the room warm, that would be lovely.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 118 over 76. Heart rate is regular. Lungs are clear, though a little… diminished. No tenderness. Everything seems… unremarkable. Height and weight are noted as 171cm and 109kg. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: One hundred and nine kilograms? Oh, dear. That can’t be right. I’m quite slender, really. Perhaps the scale is inaccurate? I usually weigh around sixty-five or seventy kilograms, perhaps a little more after a good meal, but certainly not one hundred and nine. As for shortness of breath… no, not at all. I walk up the stairs perfectly well, and I can manage a brisk pace without any trouble. Perhaps a little puffed after a particularly long hill, but nothing alarming. I’ve always been rather active. Are you certain about the weight, Doctor? It seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: The scale is calibrated. And… while I appreciate your self-assessment, the number is what it is. Now, given your weight and… lack of reported symptoms, we should discuss potential risks associated with travel. Are you aware of the increased risk of deep vein thrombosis in individuals with a higher BMI?
PATIENT: Oh. Deep… vein… thrombosis? Goodness. No, Doctor, I wasn’t aware of any such thing. That sounds… rather unpleasant. Is that common? And what does my weight have to do with it? I’ve always been reasonably fit, despite what the scale seems to be saying. I do enjoy a good walk, and I eat a very healthy diet. I’m terribly confused. Perhaps we should double-check the measurement? I'm worried now.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will double-check. The scale is accurate. Look, the point is, your weight places you at a higher risk of complications during long flights. We need to discuss preventative measures. Compression stockings, frequent hydration, and… perhaps, a consultation with a specialist to assess your overall cardiovascular health. Do you have any history of swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Goodness me. One hundred and nine kilograms… it simply cannot be. I… I don’t understand. My clothes fit perfectly well, and I’ve always been able to maintain a reasonable level of activity. Swelling? Not usually, no. Perhaps a little bit after a very long day on my feet, but nothing significant. I always put my feet up when I can. Compression stockings… that sounds awfully uncomfortable. And a specialist? Is it… is it serious, Doctor? I just wanted a note for my cruise, not… not all this. I feel quite faint, actually. Perhaps I should sit down.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s something we need to address. I’m going to recommend a referral to a cardiologist for a full evaluation. They can assess your risk factors and recommend appropriate preventative measures. In the meantime, I’ll write a preliminary note for your cruise stating you’ve been assessed, but it will be contingent on the cardiologist’s clearance. Do you have any preference for a specialist?
PATIENT: A… a cardiologist? Oh, dear. That sounds terribly… alarming. I’m not sure I understand. Contingent? What if they say I can’t go? I’ve been planning this cruise for months, Doctor, it’s my first proper holiday since my husband passed away. I… I don’t know any cardiologists. I’ve never had to see one before. Perhaps… perhaps someone recommended by you? Someone… gentle? And are you certain this is necessary? Could it not simply be the scale? I’m terribly worried now, Doctor. This is all very upsetting. Perhaps a glass of water?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your concern. But your weight is a significant factor, and it’s my professional obligation to advise you appropriately. I’ll write down the name of a cardiologist I recommend – Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s… thorough. In the meantime, try to remain calm. I’ll also write a preliminary note for your cruise, stating you’re under evaluation. It will require confirmation from Dr. Vance before your departure. Here. Make an appointment as soon as possible. And yes, a glass of water wouldn’t hurt. I have other patients waiting, so I'm afraid I need to proceed.
PATIENT: Dr. Eleanor Vance… very well. I suppose I have no choice. Thank you, Doctor. It’s just… it’s all so much. I only wanted a simple note. I… I don’t know what I’m going to do. .
