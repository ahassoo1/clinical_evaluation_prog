DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my eyesight. It’s been getting worse, steadily, I suppose. Not suddenly, thankfully. I don't appreciate surprises, if you catch my drift. It’s just… things aren’t as sharp as they used to be. I noticed it mostly when I’m reading reports at work, and frankly, the quality of those reports isn’t helping matters either.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A gradual worsening of vision, particularly with reading. Not sudden, which is good. And it’s impacting your work, specifically reading reports. Can you tell me a little more about how it’s worse?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like everything is blurry, Doctor. It’s more… faded. Like someone turned down the contrast, you understand? And sometimes letters… they sort of swim around a bit, especially after a long day. It’s difficult to explain. I suppose if I had to put it in layman’s terms – and I do prefer layman’s terms – it’s like looking through a slightly dirty window. Not filthy, mind you, just… not pristine.
DOCTOR: Okay, “faded” and like looking through a dirty window, with some letters swimming after a long day. That’s helpful. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. Never have. Always had perfectly good vision, or so I thought. My father had excellent eyesight his entire life, and his father before him. I always figured I’d be alright in that regard. Frankly, the idea of relying on something external to see… it doesn’t sit right with me.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance. It’s good to know about your family history, though. Besides the vision changes, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. No… not really. No pain, no flashes of light, no floaters, nothing like that. I suppose I have been a bit more tired lately, but I attribute that to the general state of the world, if you understand my meaning. And the aforementioned… substandard reports I’m forced to review. It’s taxing, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, flashes, or floaters. Increased fatigue, but you relate that to stress. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not particularly. I’ve always been a rather… robust individual, if I may say so myself. I watch my diet – mostly. I avoid excessive sugar, red meat isn't a regular feature on my plate. I don’t smoke, never have. And I certainly don’t partake in any… recreational activities of that nature. I'm a fairly simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Healthy lifestyle is important. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none whatsoever. Not a single one. I had a rather unfortunate bout of the flu as a child, but that’s hardly a hospitalization. Just a few days in bed with a hot cup of tea and my mother’s… overbearing concern. Otherwise, perfectly healthy. I pride myself on that, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family history – any history of eye problems like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Well, now that’s a difficult question. My mother… she was rather secretive about family matters. And she passed away some years ago, so retrieving such information is… problematic. My father’s side… I know very little about them. He wasn’t one for reminiscing, let’s put it that way. I believe his mother had some… ailment, but I couldn’t tell you what it was. Something to do with her hands, I think. Not her eyes, certainly. It’s all very vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. Vague family history is better than none. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. I take a multivitamin occasionally, if I recall correctly, but that's purely… preventative. I don’t believe in relying on artificial substances to maintain good health. It seems… counterintuitive, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does have its merits. Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’d like to do a brief eye exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your vision and the health of your eyes. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I'm not particularly fond of examinations. I find them… intrusive. But if it’s necessary, I suppose I’ll submit. Just… try to be gentle, if you would. And do explain what you’re doing, I appreciate clarity.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go. Please, have a seat and look straight ahead. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity. That just means we’ll see how well you can see letters of different sizes. I’ll have you read the letters on this chart. Can you see this chart clearly?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see the chart, Doctor. Though I must say, the letters are rather small. Reminds me of the fine print in those… regrettable contracts they force one to sign these days. Still, I can make them out. Proceed, if you wish.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, start with your right eye. I want you to read the smallest line of letters you can see clearly. Don't strain, just read what you can make out. Okay... go ahead.
PATIENT: …E… F… P… T… V… Okay, that’s about all I can discern, Doctor. It's becoming rather… blurry beyond that point. Not terribly blurry, mind you, but certainly not crisp.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That gives us a starting point. Now let's try the left eye. Same thing, read the smallest line you can comfortably see. Don't worry if you can't see them all.
PATIENT: …E… F… P… That’s… that’s it, Doctor. I can’t make out the rest. They’re just… shapes at this point. Honestly, it’s rather frustrating. I used to have such excellent vision.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let's check your peripheral vision now. I’m going to ask you to focus on this point here, and I’ll hold up some fingers in your side vision. Just tell me when you see them, and how many fingers you see. Sound good?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? Hmm. Very well. Though I must confess, I find this rather… disconcerting. It feels as if I'm being tested. Proceed, Doctor. But do be prompt. I haven’t got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking straight ahead. Tell me when you see my finger. … Good. Now this side… and this side… Alright. Everything seems within normal limits with your peripheral vision. Now, I’m just going to shine a light into your eyes to check the health of your retinas and optic nerves. It won’t hurt, but it may be bright. Relax your gaze and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Bright light, you say? I do hope it isn’t too bright. I have rather sensitive eyes. Very well, proceed with caution, Doctor. But do let me know if it becomes… unbearable. I prefer not to be blinded, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, looking straight ahead… good. Now the other eye… Okay. Everything looks normal back there, no signs of any major issues, no bleeding or swelling. Your optic nerves look healthy. Based on this brief exam, Mr. Alcorta, your vision loss appears to be gradual and likely due to age-related changes – what we call presbyopia. It’s a very common condition, especially as we get older, where the lens of the eye loses some of its flexibility, making it harder to focus on close objects. That explains the difficulty with reading.
PATIENT: Age-related changes, you say? Presbyopia. It sounds… rather ominous. So, it’s simply a matter of… deterioration? It seems rather… disheartening. I pride myself on maintaining a certain… vitality. Is there nothing to be done? Surely there’s some remedy for this… affliction?
DOCTOR: It’s not an affliction, Mr. Alcorta, it’s a normal part of aging. And thankfully, it’s very manageable. The most common solution is glasses – either reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses. We can get you a prescription tailored to your needs. Alternatively, there are contact lenses available. There are also some surgical options, but those are typically reserved for more severe cases and are not always necessary. Reading glasses are often the simplest and most effective solution. They allow you to see clearly up close without straining your eyes. Would you be interested in discussing getting a prescription for reading glasses?
PATIENT: Glasses… I must confess, the thought of relying on an external device to see… it’s rather unsettling. I’ve always managed perfectly well on my own. Still… if it’s the only option… and if it truly will alleviate this… discomfort… Very well, Doctor. Let us discuss this prescription, then. Though I must warn you, I expect a thorough explanation of all the options. I don’t appreciate being rushed into anything. And they must be… discreet. I have a certain… reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns completely. We’ll go through all the options slowly and carefully. There are different types of reading glasses. Standard reading glasses are the simplest – they correct your vision for close-up tasks like reading, but you’ll need to take them off for distance vision. Bifocals have two distinct lenses – one for distance and one for close-up. Progressive lenses are similar to bifocals but have a gradual transition between distance and close-up vision, making them more versatile and aesthetically pleasing. We can also discuss different frame styles and materials to find something that suits your face and your personal preference. And as for discretion, there are many frame options that are subtle and stylish. We can choose something that blends seamlessly with your look. Do any of those lens types sound more appealing to you?
PATIENT: Progressive lenses, you say? The gradual transition… that does sound… less jarring than the distinct line of bifocals. Still, I confess, I'm not entirely convinced. It all seems rather… complicated. And I worry about the aesthetic. I don’t want to appear… frail. Perhaps… perhaps we should start with the simplest option – the standard reading glasses. Just to see how I tolerate them. And please, Doctor, choose a frame that is… understated. Something in a classic style. No bright colors, no outlandish designs. Something that won’t draw attention.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Standard reading glasses are a good place to start. And I understand your preference for a classic, understated frame. We have several options that fit that description. Do any of these frames catch your eye?
PATIENT: Hmm… the rectangular ones… the ones in the dark brown… they’re… acceptable. Not particularly exciting, but acceptable. They don’t scream “elderly gentleman.” And the shape… it’s… solid. Yes, let us proceed with those. But do ensure they are of a high quality. I won’t tolerate flimsy materials. I expect durability.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. Those are a very classic and sophisticated choice. And we only carry high-quality frames. Alright, I’ll write you a prescription for standard reading glasses with those dark brown frames. It’ll take about a week for them to arrive. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to ensure they fit properly and that the prescription is correct. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: A week… acceptable. And a follow-up appointment… yes, necessary. I wouldn’t want to be saddled with ill-fitting spectacles. Very well, Doctor. Let us proceed with those arrangements. I trust you’ll contact me when they are ready? And please, be prompt. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I’ll have my assistant contact you as soon as the glasses arrive – typically within 7-10 business days. Here’s your prescription and the appointment slip. The appointment is scheduled for August 9th at 10:00 AM. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: August 9th… acceptable. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You’ve addressed my concerns… adequately. Thank you for your… assistance. Though I still maintain a certain skepticism regarding the necessity of these spectacles. Let us hope they prove… useful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your hesitation. Hopefully, they'll improve your reading comfort and quality of life. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day. .
