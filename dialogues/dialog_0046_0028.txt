DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it’s been feeling weak, you know? It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say. Maybe a month? It’s harder to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been lingering for a few weeks, and you’ve noticed some heart palpitations or a feeling of weakness. I understand. It is sometimes difficult to keep track of time. Let's start with the cough. Can you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a bad cough, not like one that rattles your whole chest. It’s more… dry. And it happens mostly when I lie down, I think. Or when I’ve been sitting for a while. Not so much when I'm up and moving around. Sometimes it feels like something’s tickling my throat, and that makes me cough. It doesn’t bring up much, if anything at all. Just… air, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough that’s worse when lying down or after sitting for a while, and not much phlegm production. That’s helpful. And you mentioned it feels like something tickling your throat sometimes. Now, regarding your heart feeling weak – could you elaborate on that sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s hard to explain. It’s not exactly pain, Doctor. It’s more like… a heavy feeling. Like there’s something sitting on my chest, weighing it down. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it’s skipping a beat, or beating too fast. Not all the time, thankfully. Mostly when I try to do too much. Like carrying groceries, or even just walking up the stairs. It gets better when I rest, but it worries me. My husband… he used to have trouble with his heart, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given your husband’s history. A heavy feeling in the chest and palpitations that occur with exertion are important things to investigate. Let's go through some more details. Have you noticed any shortness of breath along with the chest discomfort or palpitations?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When I try to do things, like you said, I get winded easier now. It’s not terrible, but… I used to be able to walk to the market without any trouble. Now I have to stop and catch my breath halfway there. And sometimes, even getting dressed in the morning feels like too much. It’s been getting worse slowly, I suppose. I just thought I was getting old! But now… with the cough too, it seems like something more.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're noticing these changes, and you're right to want to investigate. It's always better to be cautious. Now, Ms. Sadhu, could you tell me a little about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My ankles have been a little swollen lately. Not terribly, but if I press on them, they leave a dent for a little while. And I’ve been feeling tired, very tired. More than usual, even for my age. I sleep okay, I think, but I wake up feeling like I haven’t rested at all. Oh, and I haven’t been eating much. Everything just… tastes bland. Not a lot of appetite these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling, fatigue, and a decreased appetite… all important things to note. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me years ago I have something wrong with my heart. Heart failure, he called it. It’s been… manageable, mostly. I take a pill for it, a water pill, I think. Helps with the swelling. And I have arthritis, of course. It makes my hands ache something awful. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I had the flu a few years back, but that’s it. Oh! And high blood pressure, the doctor said. I take a pill for that too, a little white one. I can’t remember the names of them, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can look those names up. So, heart failure, arthritis, and high blood pressure. And you mentioned a water pill and a little white pill. We'll confirm those medications shortly. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, yes! I had my gallbladder taken out years ago. A long time ago. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my hip, slipping on the ice. That was awful. Other than those two things… no, I haven’t been in the hospital. And I haven’t had any other surgeries. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can! They aren’t very pleasant places.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, Ms. Sadhu, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything and taken all sorts of pills over the years, and nothing has ever bothered me. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I’ve never been one to be bothered by allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My family… well, my mother lived to be a good age, but she had a bad heart in the end. My father had high blood pressure, I think. And my husband… he had heart problems for many years. He had a stroke a few years before he passed. We had a lot of heart trouble on both sides of the family, I’m afraid. My sister, she had diabetes, but that’s about it. Mostly heart things, though, in my family. It seems to run in the blood, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. That’s a lot of helpful information. Okay, I see here you've been prescribed Furosemide 40mg daily for heart failure, and Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure. That confirms what you mentioned. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. The pills… yes, that’s right, Furosemide and… Lisinopril. I always forget the names, but I take them every day like I’m supposed to. Please, go ahead with the examination.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 160/90, and your pulse is 88 and regular. I’m listening to your heart now. I do hear a slight murmur, and there’s a bit of extra sound when I listen closely, which could indicate some fluid around the heart, or a valve issue. Your lungs sound a little congested, with some crackles at the base, which suggests some fluid buildup. As you mentioned, there's some pitting edema – swelling – in your ankles. I’m noting that. Finally, I'll check your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild fullness. Based on this examination, and your history, it sounds like your heart failure may be worsening, and the fluid buildup is contributing to your symptoms. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it will help find out what’s wrong, please do. My husband always said it’s best to know what you’re fighting. Blood tests and an X-ray, yes. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Or after?
DOCTOR: That’s a good attitude, Ms. Sadhu. Knowing what we’re dealing with is definitely the best approach. For the blood tests, you don’t need to do anything special beforehand – just come in on an empty stomach, meaning no food for at least 8 hours prior to the appointment. The X-ray is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. I’ll write you a referral for the lab work and the X-ray. The results should be available in a few days. I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and develop a plan. Does Tuesday at 2:00 PM work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM sounds perfect, Doctor. Yes, that will work just fine. I’ll mark it down on my calendar right away. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better knowing we’re doing something about it. Are there any warning signs I should look out for before my appointment? Anything that means I should call you sooner?
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear that, Ms. Sadhu. It's important to be proactive. Yes, there are a few things to watch out for. If you experience any of the following, please call the office immediately: Significant shortness of breath, even when resting. Chest pain or pressure. Sudden, severe swelling in your legs, ankles, or abdomen. A rapid or irregular heartbeat. Dizziness or fainting. These could indicate a more serious problem that needs immediate attention. Here are the referrals for the lab work and the X-ray. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very well. I have your number here, in case I need to call. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. It's a comfort to know someone is taking care of me. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll see you next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Please, don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Have a good day, Ms. Sadhu.
