DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s August 2nd, and I see you’re 86 years young. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Young? 86 is… old enough. Chest hurts. And my heart, it flutters. Like a little bird. And the nurse, she said my pressure was… high. Just fix it. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. And I apologize for the nurse’s comment – everyone feels differently about age. “Chest hurts” and a fluttering heart… and high blood pressure, as you mentioned. Okay. Let’s start with the chest pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe? What do you mean, describe? It hurts! Like… a squeezing. Right here. <points vaguely at chest> It comes and goes. Sometimes when I walk, sometimes just… sitting. It’s not… a nice hurt, you understand. Is that enough describing?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. A squeezing sensation, coming and going, sometimes with walking, sometimes at rest. And you say it’s not a “nice hurt.” Okay. When it happens, does anything make it better or worse besides walking?
PATIENT: Worse? Getting angry, maybe. My wife, she… she says things. Makes my blood boil. Then it hurts more. Better… lying down, I guess. Quiet. Not listening to… everything. <shakes head slightly> It’s complicated. You young doctors wouldn't understand.
DOCTOR: I see. So, stress or being upset seems to worsen it, and resting quietly helps. Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Years, I think. Maybe five? Six? I don't keep track of these things. It comes and goes, like I said. Not every day. Just… when things are bad. My wife… she worries too much. It makes it worse for both of us. Just fix the hurt, okay? I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Five or six years, coming and going. I understand you want me to fix the hurt, and we will certainly work towards that, Mr. Sobkowicz. To help me understand everything fully, can you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I get tired, of course. I’m 86! <rolls eyes> Sometimes I feel dizzy when I stand up too fast. And I… I don't sleep so good anymore. But that's just old age, isn’t it? Don’t need to write all that down. It’s… normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, dizziness upon standing, and some difficulty sleeping. Those are all important things to know, even if they seem “normal” with age. Now, have you had any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… <looks down at his feet, then back up> Sometimes. A little. My wife says it's the salt. She always tells me I eat too much salt. She controls everything, you know? But… yes. A little swelling, especially at the end of the day. Is that important? Everything seems important to you doctors.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Sobkowicz, thank you for telling me. Swelling in the ankles, especially at the end of the day. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions – like diabetes, high cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: High… what was that? Cholesterol? No. Never had any of those fancy diseases. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And my back hurts sometimes, but that's from… well, from life. My wife, she takes all kinds of pills, for everything. I try to stay healthy. Eat my rice. That’s all you need. No pills. I don’t trust them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diagnosed conditions, just the flu in the past and some back pain. You prefer to stay healthy with a good diet and avoid medication. I respect that. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? <pauses, thinking> Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And… I think I had a growth removed from my face, maybe? It was small. My wife says I'm always forgetting things. So maybe I didn't. Just the appendix, I think. Now, are we almost done? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed when you were young, possibly a growth removed from your face. Let’s talk about your family. Is there a history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or stroke in your family?
PATIENT: Family? <sighs> My parents… they lived long lives. My father, he smoked too much. Didn’t die from the heart, though. Just… old age. My mother, she ate a lot of vegetables. Very healthy. No one in my family had… fancy diseases, like you're asking about. Just… normal people. Now, can we get to the fixing part? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or stroke. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, or any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don’t take anything. My wife tries to give me pills, but I refuse. I told you! No allergies, no pills. Just… get on with it, doctor. I’m wasting my time here. What’s going to happen now? Will you fix my chest? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Thank you for all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure and pulse. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
