DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, a trip I’m hoping to take. Is that something you can help with?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can certainly look into that for you. A “fit-to-fly” letter, you mean?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Fit-to-fly. That’s what they called it. I didn’t want to use the wrong terms. It’s for travel insurance, mostly. They need it to cover any… well, anything that might happen, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Insurance companies often require that. To write that letter, I'll need to get a bit of your medical history, just to make sure everything is alright. It’s standard procedure, I assure you. Do you have a copy of your records with you, or should we start from scratch?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have a copy with me, unfortunately. Starting from scratch is fine. I have Medicare, if that helps? I don’t… I don’t really have a long history, if that makes things easier. Just… some routine checkups and things. And then… well, my husband passed away a few years ago. That was the last significant thing, medically, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. Medicare is helpful – it gives me access to some records, but starting fresh is perfectly alright. Let’s start with your current health. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms at the moment?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. Sometimes my knees ache a little, especially when it’s cold, but that’s just… getting older, I guess. And I get tired easily, but I work pretty long hours, so that could just be the job. Otherwise, I feel… okay. Honestly, better than okay, considering everything. I’ve been trying to eat healthier and walk more. Small things.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Kiante. It's excellent that you’re prioritizing your health. Knee aches and fatigue… let’s explore those a little further. When you say your knees ache, is it a sharp pain, or more of a dull ache?
PATIENT: It’s a dull ache, mostly. It doesn’t come on suddenly, it’s just… there, when I’ve been on my feet too long. Or if it’s really cold. I don’t take anything for it, usually. Just try to rest them when I can. It's not… debilitating, if that makes sense. I can still walk, I can still work. It just… bothers me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Dull ache, worse with activity and cold weather… Alright. And the fatigue – would you describe that as feeling generally tired, or do you find it difficult to concentrate, or have a lack of energy even after getting enough sleep?
PATIENT: It’s… a lack of energy, I think. Even after a full night’s sleep, I just feel… drained. It’s not that I can’t stay awake, it’s just… everything feels harder. Concentrating is harder. And getting motivated to do things after work is… a struggle. It’s been going on for a while, but I always just assumed it was the job. Sales is… draining, you know? I’m always on, always talking, always trying to convince people.
DOCTOR: Yes, sales can be incredibly demanding. It’s good you’re aware of the potential impact of your work. Let’s just cover a bit more ground. Have you noticed any weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: No, my weight has been pretty stable. Maybe a pound or two, but nothing significant. I’m usually around 130, 131 pounds. I’m… not a big eater, to be honest. I’ve never had much of an appetite. And I’m pretty tall – 176 centimeters, I think. It’s… why I need the letter. The airline wants to know if my height and weight are a factor, and if I’m healthy enough to handle the flight.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that information now. That’s helpful. And just to be thorough, do you have any history of heart problems, lung disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My family is pretty healthy, actually. My mother had arthritis, but that’s about it. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything, except for when I had my wisdom teeth out, but that was… decades ago. I get a regular checkup every year, and everything is always fine. Or, it was fine. Before… well, before my husband. I haven't really focused on my health much since then, to be honest. I just... keep going.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly natural to prioritize other things during difficult times. Alright, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to get everything I need from my diet. And, like I said, I don't have much of an appetite, so I’m not really eating enough to need a lot of vitamins anyway. Does that make sense? I’m just… not a big fan of relying on medication.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No current medications… And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, I can take any medication… I’ve never had a problem. I don’t have any trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that either. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I just… want to make sure I can get this letter so I can go on this trip. It’s… important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kiante. That’s very helpful. Just to complete the picture, would you mind if I quickly perform a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a pretty full schedule today. But, yes, go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won’t take long. If you could just have a seat here, please. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within the normal range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Ears appear normal as well. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses detected. Everything appears normal on the initial examination, Kiante. No immediate concerns detected.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear. Really good. So… does that mean you can write the letter? I just… I’m anxious to get it sorted, if possible. I booked the flights already, and I don’t want to risk losing my deposit. I didn't think it would be this complicated.
DOCTOR: Yes, based on what you’ve told me and the initial examination, I can certainly write a letter stating that you are medically cleared for air travel. However, just to be thorough, and given the fatigue you’ve described, I would recommend a basic blood test to rule out any underlying issues like anemia or thyroid problems. It’s a simple precaution, and it will give us both peace of mind. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh. A blood test. I… hadn't thought of that. I really don't like needles. But… you think it's necessary? Just because I'm tired? I mean, I get tired. Everyone gets tired. It just feels… like a lot. But… if you really think it’s important, then okay. I guess I can do it. As long as it doesn't take too long. And I can still get the letter after?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Kiante. It’s not about requiring it, it’s about being thorough and addressing the fatigue you’re experiencing. It's a small precaution, and it's always better to rule things out. It will help me write the letter with even greater confidence, and give you peace of mind during your trip. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. And yes, absolutely, you can still get the letter after the results are back. If everything is normal, I can finalize the letter today. It’s a simple CBC – complete blood count – and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Do you have a preferred lab nearby?
PATIENT: CBC and a… what was the other one? Okay. There's a lab just down the street, actually. On Elm Street. I've never been there before, but I've seen it. They said they take Medicare. Would that be okay? I… I guess I should just get it done. The sooner the better, right? So I can get this letter and… go on my trip. It just… feels like a lot of bother, but… you're the doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Kiante. The lab on Elm Street is perfectly fine. And yes, Medicare should cover it. I'll write you a requisition form now. It will list the tests the lab needs to perform. It's a small bother, yes, but a prudent one. It’s always best to be thorough. Here you are. Just take this to the lab, and they'll take care of everything. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. Once I have them, I’ll review them and finalize the fit-to-fly letter for you. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. Even the blood test. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for being so thorough. Hopefully, everything will be fine. And I can finally go on this trip. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I understand your anxiety, and I’m happy to help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you have a wonderful trip! .
