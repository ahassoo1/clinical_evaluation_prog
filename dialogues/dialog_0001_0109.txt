DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Mitchell, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Mitchell. Is good to meet you, Doctor… Pehrson, you say? My head… it hurts in the back. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Pehrson, yes. Audel Pehrson. Three days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Three days. Feels like… a pressure. Like someone is squeezing the back of my head. Not a bad pain, not like when I fall, you know? Just… uncomfortable. I worked on the rail yard for many years. Maybe from that?
DOCTOR: Rail yard…right. And you're… how old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Ninety years old. Almost ninety-one in November. Long life, I think! But the body… it gets tired. Worked hard all my life, on the rails. Dinkey operator, mostly. And hostler too. Lots of shaking and bumping. Maybe that has something to do with the head?
DOCTOR: Ninety… alright. And this pressure… does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. It’s there when I wake up sometimes. And if I bend over to pick something up, maybe a little bit more. But mostly just… always there, a little. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, you know? I still walk to the store. But it’s… annoying. And my wife… she passed away last year. I miss her very much. Maybe worrying makes it worse too?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, worrying doesn’t help anything, that’s for sure. Alright, let's just take a look at your neck. Don't want to rule anything obvious out. Can you lean forward for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can lean. Like this? Is okay? I try to be careful, you know. Old bones. My wife always told me, "Mitchell, don’t strain yourself!" She was a good woman. Is there something wrong, Doctor? Does it look bad?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A little stiffness, nothing alarming. Range of motion is… limited, but expected for your age. I don’t feel any major lumps or anything. Blood pressure is… elevated, but not drastically. We'll keep an eye on that. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? I don't know what that means. Other symptoms… no, not really. I eat okay. Sleep okay, mostly. Sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But that happens sometimes. And I forget things… but I am ninety years old! Is normal, no? My daughter says I repeat myself too much. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Dizzy when you stand up… alright. And the forgetfulness… yes, that can be normal at your age, but we’ll make a note of it. Look, it sounds like… typical age-related issues. Probably just some muscle tension in your neck. I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen, naproxen. Try those for a week. And try to stay hydrated.
PATIENT: Ibuprofen? Is that like… a pill? I take pills for my water already, the doctor gave them to me for my kidneys. Is okay to take another pill? And hydration… you mean drink more water? My daughter always tells me that too. So… is not something serious? Is just old age?
DOCTOR: Yes, ibuprofen is a pill. We'll need to be careful with that, given your kidney medication. Don't take it without checking with your primary care doctor first, alright?
PATIENT: My primary care doctor… Is Doctor Ramirez. The one in the city. She is a good doctor. But I haven’t seen her in a while. So… no pill until I talk to her? Is okay. I will call her. And… is there anything else I should do? Anything to help my head? Maybe a special pillow? My daughter says I snore very loud.
DOCTOR: Look, you're right to check with Dr. Ramirez. I'm just saying it's likely not anything serious, but we need to be cautious. As for your head… try a supportive pillow when you sleep. And… honestly?
PATIENT: Honestly? What? Is something I should worry about? Tell me, Doctor. I am an old man. I want to know. My wife… she always said I worry too much, but… I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Honestly?
PATIENT: Yes? Please, Doctor. Tell me. I am ready to hear it.
DOCTOR: Look, at your age, there are a lot of things that could be causing this. The dizziness, the forgetfulness… It could be a number of things. I don’t want to alarm you, but I think you should follow up with Dr. Ramirez and she may want to get some imaging done just to rule things out. That’s all. Don't worry too much about it. Now, do you have any other questions, or can we be done here?
PATIENT: Imaging? Like… a picture of my head? Is something bad? My daughter… she works at the hospital. Maybe she can explain it. Is not good to take pictures of my head? I don’t understand. I just want my head to stop hurting. Is okay to call Dr. Ramirez now? Can you maybe… write down her number just in case? I forget things, you know.
DOCTOR: Here. Dr. Ramirez’s number. It’s just a precaution. Sometimes, older patients get these aches and pains, and imaging is just to rule out anything serious. It doesn't mean anything is wrong, alright?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Is good of you to write it down. I will call her right away. I will tell her about the dizziness and the headache and… the forgetting. Is okay to go home now? I am a little scared, but I will call Dr. Ramirez. Is good to know you tried to help me, Doctor. Thank you again. .
