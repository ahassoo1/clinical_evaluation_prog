DOCTOR: Alright, Derick, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, right. The… swelling. Yeah, my face and legs. It’s been… a bit off, lately. Not sure how long, to be honest. Things kinda blur these days. It’s mostly just puffy, you know? Makes my boots feel tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy face and legs… and you’re having some trouble pinpointing exactly when it started, that’s alright. It's common for things to feel a little blurry with time. Just try to give me your best estimate. Has it been days, weeks, or longer than that?
PATIENT: Weeks, I reckon. Maybe longer. Honestly, I don't spend a lot of time looking at my legs. Too busy, always have been. Welding's not exactly a sit-down job, see? I used to be able to just do things, didn't need to worry about… puffiness. It’s just… annoying, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have something new like this start up, especially when it's interfering with your work. Welding definitely keeps you on your feet! So, it's been weeks, possibly longer. Has the puffiness been getting worse gradually, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. Not like it came on suddenly one morning. It’s just… more noticeable now. My wife used to nag me about it, said I looked like a balloon. She'd have known, I suppose. She noticed everything. But that was… a while back now. Sorry, rambling. It's just… bigger now, that's what I mean. Bigger and… tighter.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Derick. It’s helpful to hear everything, and it sounds like you've noticed a definite increase in the swelling, especially recently. And I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It's perfectly normal to still be thinking about her. Now, regarding the swelling itself... Is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Worse in the evenings, I think. After I’ve been on my feet all day, definitely. By the time I get home, my boots are… well, I practically have to pry them off. Used to be able to slip 'em right off. And my ankles… feel kinda heavy, you know? Like I’m dragging weights around. Not a good feeling when you're trying to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the evenings after being on your feet all day, and a heavy feeling in your ankles. That gives us a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any pain with the swelling, or just the tightness and heaviness?
PATIENT: Nah, not really pain. Just… uncomfortable. Aching, maybe. Like when you’ve been doing something for too long. It’s not sharp or anything. Just… a dull ache. More annoying than anything, really. Like a constant reminder. I used to ignore aches. Part of the job, you know? Now… it’s just another thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a persistent discomfort rather than a sharp pain. That's good information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin where the swelling is?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… color? I dunno. I haven’t really looked closely. Not much call for admiring my legs, see? Redness, maybe? Sometimes. It's hard to say, I mostly just see… puffy. And the veins, I suppose, are more noticeable. But that’s probably just 'cause it’s stretched out, yeah? Never been one for looking at the small details.
DOCTOR: Okay, redness sometimes, and more noticeable veins. That’s helpful. We'll take a closer look in a moment. Now, thinking about other parts of your body... Have you noticed any swelling anywhere else, like your hands, or around your eyes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Eyes… maybe a little puffy in the mornings? But I just put that down to… well, getting old, I suppose. And my hands… no, not really. They get sore from the welding, but not swollen. Just rough and calloused. Never been much of a delicate flower, see? Always been a working man.
DOCTOR: Alright, some morning puffiness around the eyes, but no swelling in your hands. And you mentioned being a working man, which is good to know. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. Eat when I’m hungry, don't when I'm not. Used to have a bigger appetite, but… things change, don't they? Not eating any different, if that makes sense. Mostly just… meat and potatoes. Simple stuff. Don't need fancy food, never did.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Derick. Simple, solid food. Have you noticed any changes in how often you're urinating – going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Urination? No, not that I've noticed. Go when I need to, same as always. Maybe a little more at night? But that could just be the tea, I suppose. Old habits die hard, you know? Can’t start the day without a good cuppa. Gets the blood flowing, keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Okay, maybe a little more urination at night, potentially from the tea. And finally, have you experienced any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. I get a bit winded after a long day at work, but that’s just the welding, see? Heavy lifting, awkward positions. No chest pain or anything. Always been a healthy smoker, mind you, if that makes any difference. Not that anyone recommends it these days, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for answering those questions, Derick. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a closer look at your legs and ankles. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. Not like I've got anything to hide. Just get it over with, eh? The sooner I know, the sooner I can get back to… well, to whatever it is I do these days. Don't like wasting time.
DOCTOR: “Alright, I’m seeing some swelling in both legs, extending up to your mid-calves. It pits when I press on it, which means it’s fluid buildup. Your pulses are present, but a little weaker than they should be, and I see some varicose veins. The skin is warm and slightly red. The swelling is worse on the insides of your legs.”
PATIENT: Hmm. Fluid buildup, eh? Never heard of such a thing. Varicose veins I figured, been there for years. Used to be a source of pride, if I’m honest. Now they just look… puffy. So, what does it mean, doctor? Is it serious? Don't go giving me a lot of fancy medical terms, just tell me straight. Is it something I gotta worry about?
DOCTOR: Alright, Derick, I'll be as straightforward as I can. The swelling, or edema, is likely caused by a few things working together. The varicose veins can contribute, but the fact that it’s getting worse, especially in the evenings, and you're also having some slightly elevated blood pressure, suggests it could be related to problems with how your heart is pumping, or with your kidneys. It could also be a combination of factors. We need to do some more tests to figure out the exact cause. I'd like to order a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out other causes, and an EKG to look at your heart. I'm also going to order a urine test to look for protein. It could be something serious, which is why we need to investigate. It doesn’t necessarily mean it is serious, but it's important to rule things out. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests, eh? Always tests. Heart and kidneys… sounds… complicated. Never had any trouble with those before. Always been a strong man. Is it… is it gonna involve needles? I hate needles. And how long are these tests gonna take? Don't have time to be messing around with doctors all day. And what if it is serious? What happens then? Just give it to me straight, doctor. No sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Derick. Yes, the blood test will involve a needle, I won’t lie. It’s a standard blood draw, and the phlebotomist is very good at making it as quick and painless as possible. The urine test is just a sample - you’ll be given a cup, and that’s it. The EKG is completely painless - it involves sticking some small pads on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. The tests should only take about an hour or so to complete. We’ll get the results back in a few days. If it is serious, the treatment will depend on the cause. If it’s a heart problem, we might need to refer you to a cardiologist – a heart specialist. If it’s a kidney problem, we might need to refer you to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist. We’ll discuss all the options together. We'll take it one step at a time. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Would you like me to schedule them for you today?
PATIENT: Schedule 'em, I suppose. Get it over with. But no funny business, eh? Don't want any complicated procedures or anything like that. Just the tests, and then tell me what's what. And if it's serious, I want to know right away. No waiting around. Straight talk, doctor. That's all I ask. And make sure that phlebotomist is gentle with that needle. I’ve got things to do, you know? Don't need to be wasting time recovering from a bad blood draw.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Derick. Straight talk, I promise. No funny business, and I will personally make a note for the phlebotomist to be as gentle as possible. We’ll just do the tests for now, and we’ll take it from there. I'll have the receptionist schedule you for a blood test, urine test, and EKG. They should be able to get you in within the next couple of days. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend you reduce your salt intake and elevate your legs whenever you can, to help reduce the swelling. And, as much as possible, try to manage your stress. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Salt and legs… alright. Sounds… manageable. Less salt, more relaxing. Not much relaxing to be done these days, but I can try. Stress, you say? Don’t even get me started. No, I don't suppose I have any questions right now. Just get the tests done, and then tell me what's what. And make sure that phlebotomist is gentle with that needle. One last time. Let's get this over with. I've got things to do. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Derick. I’ve made a note for the phlebotomist. We’ll get this done. The receptionist will be right with you to schedule your tests. And remember, if the swelling gets significantly worse, or you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath before your appointment, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in today. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
