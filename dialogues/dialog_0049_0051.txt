DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. My… well, it’s about my blood. I need to know what kind it is, I think. My son… he said something about needing to know, for… something. Old age, you know. Things slip my mind. It’s not terribly important, is it?
DOCTOR: Blood type… Right. Well, it can be important, yes. Knowing your blood type is useful information, particularly as you get older and may require medical interventions. It’s good your son prompted you to look into this. Though, frankly, it’s a rather unusual request without a specific reason. To clarify, is there a particular medical situation he’s concerned about, or is he simply being cautious?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I really don't recall. He just… insisted. He’s a worrier, that boy, always has been. Something about… if I needed a transfusion, maybe? Or something to do with… family history? Honestly, it’s all a bit foggy. He handled all the arrangements for this visit, you see. I just… showed up. Is it… bad that I don’t know?
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, Mrs. Nini, but it does make things a bit more difficult. Family history is relevant, so it’s good he’s thinking along those lines, even if you don’t recall the specifics. We can certainly determine your blood type today. First, let’s go through a bit of your medical background. Have you ever had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… serious illnesses… let me think. I had the flu, of course, many times. And a bad bout of… what was it… something with my gallbladder, a long time ago. Had surgery for that. That was… oh, goodness, must be forty years ago now? And a broken wrist when I was younger, working as a rigger. That’s about all I can remember, really. Nothing else comes to mind. I was always quite healthy, actually. Not a lot of complaints. Do you need dates? I’m dreadful with dates.
DOCTOR: Forty years ago for the gallbladder surgery… alright. And the broken wrist, when would that have been, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, the wrist… goodness. That was… when I was still working full-time, definitely. Before my husband… passed. So, before… 1995, I think? Yes, 1995. He got sick in… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. It was a silly thing, really. Tripped over some ropes at the dock. I was always so careful, but accidents happen, don't they? Was that a helpful date, do you think? I'm trying my best, but it's like looking through fog.
DOCTOR: 1995 for the wrist injury… that’s helpful, yes. Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My son, of course. He’s… well, he's a good boy. Always looking after me. And my husband… he's gone now, as I mentioned. He had… problems with his heart. That’s why he… well, never mind. We had a lovely life together. Did he have any… illnesses, you mean? My father was… strong, I think. A fisherman. Mother… she died young. Pneumonia, I believe. A very long time ago. Is that what you're asking about? Family illnesses? It's all so hazy. I apologize.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mrs. Nini. You're doing perfectly well. The information is… fragmented, but we'll work with what we have. Your husband’s heart problems are relevant, and your mother’s early death… yes. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. Maybe a bit of a sniffle when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s all. No, I’m pretty sure I don’t have any allergies. I used to eat everything, you know? Everything my husband cooked! He was a wonderful cook, even if he did put a bit too much garlic in everything. Is that helpful? I really hope I’m not forgetting something important. It's just... a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: No, that’s good to know. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… I take a little pill for my… blood pressure, I think. A small white one. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take something for that. Ibuprofen, I believe. The blue ones. And… oh! My son gives me a vitamin D pill every morning. He says I don’t get enough sunshine. That’s about it, I think. Just those few things. Is that okay? I'm trying very hard to remember everything. It’s just… so many years, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. We'll make sure we have a complete list. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a baseline. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your general condition. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. My son always says I should listen to the doctors. He worries so much! Go ahead, please. I’ll just sit here and… try to relax. Is there anything I need to do? Take off my shoes? I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to take off your shoes. Just sit comfortably. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds… slightly irregular. Not alarming, but worth noting. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Pulse is also a little fast, 82. Overall, you appear to be in relatively good condition for your age, but we’ll want to investigate the irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure further. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a lot of numbers. I never was good with numbers. Irregular heartbeat… is that bad? My father always had a strong heart. Strong as an ox, he was. Oh! That’s a bit… startling. Everything feels a bit… wobbly. Is that normal? I just… don’t like surprises, you know. Old age, I suppose. Things aren’t as steady as they used to be. Is everything alright? I hope I’m not being difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mrs. Nini. The reflexes were… a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. And the irregular heartbeat isn’t necessarily bad, but it does warrant further investigation. We’ll need to do some tests to determine the cause. An EKG, perhaps, and some blood work. We also need to address the elevated blood pressure. Are you experiencing any symptoms, like headaches, dizziness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… more tests. My son will be pleased. He always says I need to be thoroughly checked. Headaches… sometimes. A little ache in my head, but nothing terrible. Dizziness… not really. Maybe a little unsteady on my feet sometimes, but that’s just old age, isn’t it? And shortness of breath… not unless I’m climbing the stairs. And I try to avoid the stairs these days! Is all this… serious, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious now. Perhaps a cup of tea would help? Do you have tea here?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mrs. Nini, but it does require us to be thorough. The symptoms you're describing could be related to the irregular heartbeat or the elevated blood pressure, or something else entirely. That’s why we need to run some tests. Unfortunately, we don't have tea here. But I can assure you, we’ll get to the bottom of this. Let’s start with the blood work and EKG. I’ll write you a requisition. Then, depending on the results, we may need to consult with a cardiologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh, my. That sounds… frightening. Blood work… I don't mind blood work, as long as the nurse is gentle. But a cardiologist… My son will be very relieved, I suppose. He worries so much about my heart. Requisition? Is that… a prescription? I’m not very good at understanding these things. And what exactly will the blood work show? Will it tell me why my heart is… irregular? And what if it’s… bad? I’m sorry, I’m probably being a bother. I just get… flustered easily. Can you explain it to me simply? Like you would to a… a child?
DOCTOR: A requisition is just an order for the tests, Mrs. Nini. It's not a prescription. And don't worry, you're not a bother at all. It's my job to explain things clearly. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in the heart. We're just taking precautions. The blood work will give us information about your overall health and help us identify any underlying issues that could be contributing to the irregular heartbeat. It can also tell us about your cholesterol levels and other important factors. Here. I've written down the tests we need to do: complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and an EKG. The EKG is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't hurt at all. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Complete… what? Metabolic… oh dear. It’s all a lot of fancy words. And lipid panel… is that something to do with fat? My son always tells me I should watch my fat intake. He’s very health-conscious. So, I have to go somewhere else to get these… tests done? And then come back? It seems like a lot of trouble. Is there a laboratory nearby? And will it cost a lot of money? I have insurance, but… you never know. And will the nurse be gentle? I really don't like needles. I always faint, you know. Or almost faint. It's terribly embarrassing. Perhaps I should just forget about all this… and go home?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, it's important to get these tests done. We need to rule out any serious underlying conditions. I understand you're anxious, but avoiding the tests won't make things better. Here's a list of local laboratories that are covered by your insurance. I can also have my assistant call and schedule the appointments for you if you'd like. As for the needle, I can write a note for the lab technician to be especially gentle. And if you're prone to fainting, let them know beforehand. They're experienced in dealing with patients who are anxious about needles. I assure you, we'll do everything we can to make this as comfortable as possible. But we need to get this information so we can determine the best course of action for your health. Now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. Shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please, tell the nurse to be very gentle. And perhaps… have a chair nearby, just in case? I don’t want to cause a fuss. My son will be relieved, I suppose. He always worries so much. He's a good boy. Could your assistant perhaps call this laboratory? It’s the closest one, according to the brochure. “Coastal Medical Labs.” And… perhaps schedule it for first thing in the morning? I always feel better in the morning. And… is there anything I should do to prepare? Should I eat something? Or fast? Oh dear, I’m getting all confused again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nini. I’ll have my assistant call Coastal Medical Labs and schedule your appointment for first thing tomorrow morning. She'll also confirm whether you need to fast beforehand. I’ll make a note to inform the lab technician about your anxiety and request that they be especially gentle. Hello, this is Dr. Nestingen's office… yes, I’d like to schedule an appointment for a Mrs. Darl Nini… complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel… yes, first thing in the morning if possible… excellent. Done. Your appointment is scheduled for 8:00 AM tomorrow morning. My assistant will call you to confirm the fasting instructions. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
