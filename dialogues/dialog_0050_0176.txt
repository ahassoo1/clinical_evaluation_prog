DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 50 years of age. Please, tell me what brings you in to see me today. Be as specific as possible; I find a detailed account is always most helpful.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Ivette Redeye, fifty years old this past March. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, maybe Tuesday? And they’re constant. It's been over 48 hours now, easily. It's really quite annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Constant hiccups for 48 hours, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not like little ones either. Big, shuddering ones. I’ve tried…well, everything people tell you. Holding my breath, drinking water really fast, getting someone to scare me…nothing works. It’s just…hiccup, hiccup, hiccup. All day and all night. It’s making it hard to sleep, and I manage a small entertainment venue, so needing to be calm and collected is…important.
DOCTOR: I see. And you've attempted the common remedies without success. Holding your breath, rapid water consumption…anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! My friend suggested sugar. A teaspoon of sugar, dry. Didn’t do a thing. And I tried breathing into a paper bag, but that just made me feel dizzy. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to get worried. It's not painful, exactly, but it's exhausting. And it’s… embarrassing. I had a show last night and I kept interrupting the performers. Not my finest moment.
DOCTOR: Very well. We need to rule out any underlying causes for persistent hiccups. It’s unusual for them to last this long without a clear trigger. I’d like to start with a brief medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little cold back in April, but that cleared up quickly. Nothing since then. I’m generally quite healthy, Doctor. I eat reasonably well, try to get some exercise when I can – running a venue keeps you on your feet, that’s for sure! – and I don’t smoke. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Does that matter? The wine, I mean.
DOCTOR: It’s noted. Now, have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Years ago, when I was younger, I had my gallbladder removed. And I had a bad bout of bronchitis when I was travelling in Greece, but that was…oh, goodness, almost twenty years ago now. Other than that, no. No major illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I really don’t spend much time at the doctor’s office, thankfully. I prefer being at the venue, not in one.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a bit complicated, Doctor. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… well, he had some heart trouble later in life. But beyond that, nothing really springs to mind. My grandparents… they lived long lives, mostly just…old age. No specific illnesses that I recall. I wasn't particularly close to them, to be honest. Does that help? I’m afraid my family weren’t big talkers about health problems.
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I really try to avoid them if I can. I prefer natural remedies, you know? A bit of ginger for a stomach ache, chamomile tea for sleep… things like that. That's why this is so strange – nothing usually helps! I haven't even needed a painkiller in years. Well, until these hiccups started, that is. They don't hurt, but they're certainly… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I eat everything – I love Egyptian food, of course, and I’ve travelled quite a bit, so I’ve tried all sorts of things. No hives, no breathing problems, nothing like that. Honestly, I think I’d know if I had an allergy by now. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. Clearly, something’s finally found it!
DOCTOR: Hmm. Very good. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps palpate your abdomen. Just to ensure there isn't anything obvious contributing to this…persistent irritation. If you’d be so kind.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, having to explain all this, and then get poked and prodded! But if it helps, I'm all for it. Hopefully we can find out what’s causing these hiccups. They’re driving me mad!
DOCTOR: Please lie down on your back, arms at your sides. I’ll begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though there is a slight…increased resonance. It’s likely nothing, but I’ll note it. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses palpated. Slight discomfort in the epigastric region with deep palpation… but that could be due to the hiccups themselves. I’m not detecting anything overtly abnormal at this point.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… and… okay. It feels a bit strange being poked and prodded, but if it helps… Oh, yes, that's a little tender, right there. But honestly, Doctor, everything feels tender when I'm hiccuping! It's like a constant vibration. So, what does that mean? Is it something serious? I do have a show on Friday, and I really need to be on top form.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be serious, Ms. Redeye, but persistent hiccups can be indicative of underlying issues. The slight tenderness in the epigastric region is concerning, though as you say, it could be related to the hiccups themselves. I’d like to order a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipase level – just to rule out any inflammation or gastrointestinal disturbances. Additionally, an EKG wouldn’t be amiss to ensure there is no cardiac involvement. It’s a precautionary measure, of course, but I prefer to be thorough.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Thorough is good. I just… I’m not a fan of hospitals, or tests, or anything medical, to be honest. But if it rules things out, then it’s worth it. How long will it take to get the results? And will the tests tell me what’s causing the hiccups, or just what’s not wrong? I’m worried it’s going to be one of those things where they say “everything’s normal,” and I’m still hiccuping!
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24 to 48 hours, Ms. Redeye. The tests will help rule out common causes – such as electrolyte imbalances, inflammation of the stomach or pancreas, or cardiac arrhythmias. However, hiccups can sometimes be idiopathic – meaning the cause is unknown. Should the tests return normal, and the hiccups persist, we may consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. In the meantime, I can prescribe a low dose of baclofen, a muscle relaxant, which may help to suppress the diaphragmatic spasms. It’s not a cure, of course, but it may provide some symptomatic relief. Do you have any objections to that course of action?
PATIENT: Baclofen… is that a strong medication? I really prefer to avoid pills if possible, Doctor. I’ve read things about side effects… But… if it might stop the hiccups, even temporarily, I suppose I’m willing to try it. I have that show on Friday, and I really can’t afford to be hiccuping through it. What are the side effects I should be aware of? And… how long would I need to take it for? I don't want to become dependent on something just to get through a performance.
DOCTOR: Baclofen is generally well-tolerated, Ms. Redeye. Common side effects include drowsiness and dizziness, but these are usually mild and transient. We would start with a low dose – 5 milligrams three times a day – and monitor your response. Should you experience any adverse effects, you would discontinue the medication immediately. We would reassess in one week. I will write you a prescription. And I strongly advise against self-treating with any herbal remedies or alternative therapies while on baclofen, as these may interact with the medication. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Five milligrams, three times a day. Watch for drowsiness or dizziness. No herbal remedies. And stop if I feel anything strange. It sounds… a bit scary, to be honest. But I suppose it’s better than hiccuping forever. Okay, well… if that’s what you recommend, then I’ll try it. Can I get the prescription filled at the pharmacy in town? And… is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can fill the prescription at your local pharmacy. And avoid alcohol, as it may potentiate the sedative effects of baclofen. Beyond that, simply monitor your symptoms and discontinue the medication should you experience any adverse reactions. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to assess your response to the medication and review the blood test results. If your symptoms worsen before then, or you experience any concerning side effects, do not hesitate to contact the office immediately. Are there any further questions I can answer for you, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for… explaining everything so thoroughly, even if it is a bit worrying. I suppose I’ll just… try not to think about it too much, and see how it goes. And I’ll definitely contact the office if anything feels wrong. Thank you again, Doctor Paraskevopoulos.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do try to rest, Ms. Redeye. And do not hesitate to contact the office should you have any concerns. .
