DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Doc, it's this cough. Been…bad lately. And there's…stuff. Red stuff. When I cough. It ain't good. I smoke, you know. Always have. But this is…different.
DOCTOR: Right. A cough with some…red expectoration. You say it’s different than usual for you, even considering your smoking history. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Uh…a while. Maybe a couple weeks? Hard to say, Doc. Things kinda blur together. It started small, just a tickle. Now…well, you see. It worries me. I ain't been feeling right, either. Tired. More tired than usual. But I work, you know? Gotta keep things running. Power don't fix itself.
DOCTOR: “A couple of weeks” is…vague, Mr. Reyno. It’s important to be precise when we’re talking about something like this. Has anything made it worse?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Just…coughing. More when I'm working, I guess. Lots of dust out there. And the weather's been weird, hot then cold. But I been working in the heat and cold for years. It's…just a cough, right? People cough. It's the red stuff that's got me worried. I don't know what it means. I ain't good with…fancy words.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to figure out what kind of cough this is. And the red…expectoration, as you call it, is certainly something we need to investigate. Let’s go through some basics. Have you had a fever, chills, or any night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever…maybe? I felt warm a couple nights ago. Couldn’t sleep. But I always feel kinda warm. Chills…no, not really. Night sweats…I dunno. I sleep hot. Always have. I use a fan. Does that count? I ain't been sick, sick. Just…tired. And this cough. It's the cough that's bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any shortness of breath or chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…sometimes. When I’m climbing hills to check the lines. But that’s normal, Doc. It’s a hill! Chest pain…not really pain. More like…a tightness. When I cough real hard. It goes away. But yeah, tightness. That happens. It’s…uncomfortable. But I keep working. Gotta.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Past…medical? Uh…not much. I broke my arm when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree. And I had the flu once, a long time ago. That's about it. I don’t go to the doctor much. Don't see the point, usually. But this…this is different. This cough worries me. I just want to know what's wrong, Doc. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Right. No major medical history. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. I told you, Doc, I don’t go to doctors. Avoid 'em if I can. Just a broken arm as a kid. And the flu. That's it. Look, is this cough something to worry about? I got work to do. People need power. I can’t be…sick.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, avoiding the doctor when you're experiencing symptoms like this isn't helpful. It's important to understand what's going on. Now, let's talk about your family history. Any history of lung problems, like COPD, emphysema, or lung cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Lung problems… uh… my grandpa smoked. A lot. He got…sick, a long time ago. But I don't know what kind of sick. He just… stopped breathing. That's all I know. Nobody talked about it much. My mom… she was healthy. As far as I know. Look, I ain't good at remembering stuff like that. I just know I got a cough and it's worrying me. Can we just… figure out what's wrong with me? I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. Let's move on. Do you drink alcohol, use tobacco, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: I smoke. You know that. Always have. A pack a day. Maybe more when things are busy. And I have a beer sometimes. After work. One or two. To relax. Never did any of that other stuff. Drugs? No. Never touched 'em. Just smoke and a beer. Like my grandpa. Is that bad? Everything feels bad lately. Just wanna know what's wrong with my cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out when I tell you.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath… right? Just tell me when. I’m ready. Gotta get this over with. Power ain’t gonna fix itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath… in… and out… again… deep breath… in… and out… Okay. And now I'd like to check your oxygen saturation.
PATIENT: Okay… breathing…deep breaths… Is something wrong, Doc? You look worried. This machine…what's it doing? Just tell me what's happening. Gotta know if I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: Your oxygen saturation is a little low, Mr. Reyno. 92%. And I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs. Given your smoking history, the red expectoration, the fatigue, and now this, I think we need to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything serious, like pneumonia or…something worse. I’m also going to order a sputum culture to see what, if anything, is growing in your lungs.
PATIENT: X-ray? Something worse? What…what do you mean? Pneumonia…is that bad? Sputum…what’s that even mean? Look, Doc, I gotta go back to work. People are counting on me. Can’t I just…take some medicine? I don’t have time for tests. This is bad. Real bad. What if… what if it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand you have responsibilities, but your health is the priority. We need to find out what’s causing these symptoms. Ignoring them won’t make them go away, and it could lead to a much more serious situation. Pneumonia can be serious, and there are other possibilities we need to rule out. The sputum culture will help us identify any infection present. I’m going to write you a referral to the radiology department for the chest X-ray. And I’ll have the nurse explain the sputum collection process. It’s a simple test. We’ll get the results back as soon as possible. For now, I'm going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler to help with the wheezing and shortness of breath. But this is just to manage the symptoms. We need to know the underlying cause. .
PATIENT: Tests… inhaler… It’s all too much. I just… I just want to go back to work. Fine. Tests. Whatever. Just… tell me when I can go back to work. Tell me it's not… bad. .
