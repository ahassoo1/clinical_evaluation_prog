DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it simply, I’ve gained weight. Quite a bit, actually, and I haven't… changed anything in my routine. It’s rather concerning.
DOCTOR: Concerning, you say. Well, weight fluctuations can happen. How much weight are we talking about, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s difficult to say exactly, but I’d estimate… around 20 pounds, perhaps more, over the last six months. I usually stay around 130, and now… well, the scale showed 155 last week. It’s very unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Twenty pounds in six months… and you state no changes to diet or exercise?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I still walk to the market most days, and my husband, Tomas, cooks the same meals he always has. We eat simple things – potatoes, cabbage, some meat when we can afford it. It’s… bewildering, really. I feel as though my body is working against me.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me see… Hmm. I have been rather tired lately, more so than usual. And… my hands feel a bit cold, even when it’s warm. I thought it was just the summer cooling down, but… now that you mention it, perhaps it’s something more. I also feel a bit breathless when I climb the stairs to our apartment.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, cold hands, and shortness of breath… We’ll need to rule out a few things. Do you have any family history of thyroid problems, diabetes, or heart conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother… she had a rather large thyroid, she always said. She didn’t have a proper diagnosis, not in Lithuania, you understand, but she always complained of being cold and tired. And my grandfather, on my husband’s side, he had a heart condition, I believe. He passed away quite young. I don’t know the specifics, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer natural remedies when possible. Tomas sometimes makes me teas with herbs from his garden, but that’s the extent of it. Just chamomile and mint, mostly, for calming my nerves. Nothing medicinal, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and take your blood pressure. Can you step up on the scale for me again, please, just to confirm the weight?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I do hope it hasn’t changed much since last week. It's rather unsettling, this weight gain.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are normal, but a bit distant. Lungs are clear, though your breathing is a bit shallow. Thyroid feels slightly enlarged, not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, let's run some blood work. I want to check your thyroid function, blood sugar, and a complete metabolic panel. It’s just routine, to rule things out.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. If you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I just want to understand what’s happening. I've never felt like this before, and it's quite frightening. Will the blood work require a long wait for the results? I have some errands to run and Tomas is expecting me home for dinner.
DOCTOR: The lab should be able to process it relatively quickly. It usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the results to come back. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us once they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, dizziness, or significant shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… and I will certainly seek immediate attention if I experience those symptoms. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your attention to this matter. It eases my mind somewhat, knowing we are taking steps to find an answer.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She'll explain the procedure. We’ll get this sorted out. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all for now. I will await the nurse, then. Thank you again for your time and attention. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Alright. That will be all for today, Ms. Selbitschka. Please have a seat, and the nurse will be with you shortly.
