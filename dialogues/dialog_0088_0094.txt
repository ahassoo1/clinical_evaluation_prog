DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. I think... the paper said something about learning? My husband, he told me to come. I don't really remember why. Just... learning things. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay. It looks like you scheduled an appointment for a general health check-up and preventative care screening. Sometimes these things get scheduled and…details get a little fuzzy. That’s perfectly alright. So, even though you don’t specifically remember why, we can still use this time to make sure you're doing well. Perhaps we can talk about how you’ve been feeling overall?
PATIENT: Feeling? Hmm. I work a lot. Sheet metal… it’s hard work. My hands, they hurt sometimes. And my back. But that’s just… work. Everyone hurts, right? I don't know what you want me to say about feeling. Is this going to take long? My husband, he needs me home to make dinner.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have a physically demanding job. We definitely want to address those aches and pains, even if they seem “normal” for your line of work. It's good you brought that up. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More? Ugh. It's in my hands… from cutting metal all day. And my back… from bending over. It's just… tired. Like, really, really tired. And sometimes… stiff. I take some pills. Red ones. I don’t remember what they’re for. My neighbor gave them to me. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you mentioned the pills, even if you don't remember what they are. Taking medication you haven't been specifically prescribed by a doctor can be risky, so we'll definitely need to talk about that. First, let's focus on your hands and back. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Start? A long time ago. Maybe… when I first started the metal work? I don’t know. Years. It just… got worse slowly. I didn’t tell anyone. Just… work. You have to keep working. My husband… he works too. We need the money. Is this about the money? Because I don’t have a lot.
DOCTOR: No, this isn't about the money at all, Ms. Fontanazza. We're just trying to understand what's going on with your body so we can help you feel better. It’s very brave of you to keep going even when you're in pain. You mentioned it's been going on for years and slowly getting worse. Does anything specifically make the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Better? Hmm. Not really. Maybe… when I stop working? But then we can't eat. Worse… when I’m cutting the thick metal. And when it's cold. The cold makes everything ache. I wear gloves, but it still gets cold. It’s always cold in the shop. I don’t know what else to tell you. This is… a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s a lot of questions, and I appreciate you answering them. It sounds like the pain is definitely related to your work and is aggravated by cold temperatures. Okay, let’s switch gears a bit. Have you had any other health problems in the past?
PATIENT: Health problems? Not… really. I had a cold once. A long time ago. And I broke my toe when I was little. Running around. But that’s it. I don't go to the doctor much. Too busy. And… they don’t understand. They just want you to stop working. My husband says so. He says doctors don’t understand real work.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I’ve never needed one. Why would I need one? I just… work. You cut metal, you get tired, you take some pills. That's it. I don't understand why you're asking all these things. Are you trying to find something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Fontanazza, I'm not trying to find something wrong with you. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health history. It's important to know these things to make sure we're providing you with the best possible care. Let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has any health problems, like arthritis, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family? My mother… she was always tired. She died when I was young. I don't remember much. My father… he worked in a factory. He was strong. He died too. Old age, I think. No one talked about… problems. Just work. And… dying. I don't know about… arthritis or… whatever you said. They didn’t talk about those things. Is this important? I need to go. My husband will be worried.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you've had a lot of loss in your life. It's understandable that you don't have much information about your family's health history. We can skip that part if you're uncomfortable. Before we finish, let's talk about those red pills you mentioned. Do you still have them?
PATIENT: Yes. I have them at home. In a little plastic bag. My neighbor… she gave them to me when my back was really bad. She said they were good for pain. I take two when it hurts a lot. But they don’t always work. And… sometimes I feel funny after. Like… dizzy. Is that bad? I told you, I don’t remember what they are. And I don’t really like taking them. But… I need to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very important information. Taking medication without knowing what it is, especially if it makes you feel dizzy, is potentially dangerous. We need to figure out what those pills are. I'm going to do a quick physical exam to check your back and hands. Then, I'm going to write you a prescription to get some blood work done. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying problems, and it can also help us identify what those pills are if you bring them in. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Blood work? More tests? Ugh. My husband… he doesn't like tests. And I don't have money for… everything. Can't I just… take some more of the red pills? And go back to work? I really need to go. He’s probably wondering where I am. Is the exam going to take long? I have to make dinner. And… I don't like doctors touching me. It feels… strange. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fontanazza. I truly do. I won't force you to do anything you're not comfortable with. However, I am concerned about your health and the potential risks of taking unknown medication. The physical exam will be quick—just checking your range of motion and feeling for any tenderness. The blood work is important to rule out any serious problems and get you on the right track to feeling better. We can discuss payment options if you are worried about the cost. I'm here to help you, not to make things more difficult. Let's start with the quick exam, and then we can talk about the blood work and your concerns. Would that be alright?
