DOCTOR: Hi Moshe, good to see you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s good to be here, though I wish it was for a nicer reason. I’ve been feeling awfully sleepy during the day, even though I’m using that machine they gave me for my sleep apnea. It’s just… exhausting, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Still feeling sleepy despite using the CPAP machine for your sleep apnea… that’s good information to have. Exhausting is a good way to put it. Let’s try to get a little more detail about this. When did you start noticing this increased sleepiness, even with the machine?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started, oh, maybe a month or so ago? It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual thing. At first, I just thought I was having a lazy spell, you know? But it’s been sticking around, and it's making it hard to enjoy things. I used to love puttering in the garden in the afternoons, but now I find myself dozing off in the chair. It's a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: No, not at all embarrassing, Moshe. It's good you're telling me. A gradual onset over a month… okay. And it's impacting your daily activities, like your gardening. That's helpful to know. Just to clarify, are you using the CPAP machine every night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Every single night. I made sure to get a good mask, one that fits comfortably, and I try to clean it regularly like the nurse showed me. It’s a bit of a nuisance, to be honest, but I understand it’s important. I wouldn’t skip it unless absolutely necessary. I even take it with me when I travel. It’s a bit bulky, but better safe than sleepy, right?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Moshe. Consistent use is key, and it sounds like you’re being very diligent about it. And keeping it clean is important too. So, the machine is on every night, a good fit, and you’re maintaining it… okay. Now, do you happen to know what pressure setting it’s on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the pressure setting? I’m afraid I don’t. They adjusted it when I first got the machine, and I haven’t touched it since. I just plug it in and go, you know? I figured they knew what they were doing. I never really asked, to be honest. Is that… bad? I’m not very good with all the technical stuff.
DOCTOR: No, not bad at all, Moshe. Plenty of people don't bother with the settings. It's perfectly alright. We can easily check that here. Before we do that, though, let’s quickly run through some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I think I might have gained a few pounds. Not a lot, but enough to feel a bit snug in my clothes. It’s probably just old age catching up with me, but it could be something else, I suppose. I’ve been enjoying my retirement a little too much, maybe. More time for cookies, you know?
DOCTOR: Retirement should involve more cookies! No shame in that, Moshe. A few extra pounds… okay. We'll keep that in mind. Now, have you noticed any snoring, even with the machine on?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she used to complain about my snoring. But that was before the machine, of course. Now… hmm. I haven't really noticed it myself. I sleep pretty soundly, so I wouldn’t hear it. And I sleep alone now, so there’s no one to complain! But I suppose it's possible. It wouldn't surprise me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially some snoring despite the machine, but you haven't confirmed it yourself. That’s helpful. Let's move on to some other things. Any headaches, especially in the mornings?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, actually. I've been getting them a little more frequently lately. Not terrible, just a dull ache, usually in the forehead. I thought it was just the weather, or maybe too much sun in the garden. They usually go away after I have some coffee, but they’re a bit of a nuisance. I hadn’t really connected it to the sleepiness, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so headaches, more frequent recently, dull ache in the forehead, relieved somewhat by coffee. That’s another piece of the puzzle. Now, just to cover all bases, have you noticed any changes in your vision, or any difficulty with your balance?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision… it’s not what it used to be, naturally. I need reading glasses now, which I’ve had for a few years. But no sudden changes, no blurry spots or anything like that. And my balance… well, I’m not as nimble as I once was, but I haven’t fallen or anything. I try to be careful. I wouldn’t want to break a hip!
DOCTOR: Good to hear. No sudden changes in vision or balance, just the usual age-related changes. That’s good. Okay, Moshe, this is helpful. Before we do a quick physical exam, let me just ask about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter things, vitamins, or supplements.
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things ticking over. Oh, and sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis in my hands, Ibuprofen, when it’s really acting up. That’s about it, I think. Nothing fancy. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, a multivitamin, and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Good to know. Now, let's do a quick exam, just to get a better sense of things. Could you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. A little creaky, but I’m still in one piece! Don't mind the noises, Doctor. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Moshe. Perfectly normal. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78, regular. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Okay, sounds good. A little crackling in your lungs, but that could be a number of things. Now, let’s just take a look at your throat. Say “Ahhh” for me…
PATIENT: Ahhh… Is that alright? I always feel a bit silly doing this. I haven't had a sore throat in years, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Everything looks okay there, no redness or swelling. Good. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes… Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright? I’m trying my best not to blink too much. I used to have excellent eyesight, you know, when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Perfect, that’s great. Your eye movements are good, no signs of any problems there. Okay, Moshe, that was helpful. Now, based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like your sleepiness could be related to a few things. Your blood pressure is a little high, which can sometimes cause fatigue. The crackling in your lungs could also be contributing, and the headaches are worth investigating further. I’d like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying causes, like anemia or thyroid problems. And I think we should also consider a sleep study, just to make sure your CPAP machine is still working effectively. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and another sleep study. A bit of a nuisance, to be honest, but if it helps figure out what’s going on, then I’m all for it. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? Gardening isn’t quite the same when you’re fighting to stay awake. So, yes, let's do the tests. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Moshe. We want you back in the garden enjoying yourself. Okay, I’ll write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. You can go to the lab at the clinic, and they’ll take care of everything. They'll need a sample of your blood. As for the sleep study, we can schedule that with the sleep center, also at the clinic. It will involve spending a night here while we monitor your breathing and sleep patterns. I’ll also prescribe a low dose blood pressure medication in the meantime. We'll see if that makes a difference. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Blood tests, sleep study, and medication for the blood pressure. You're very thorough, I appreciate that. And don't hesitate to tell me if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for the tests. I’m not very good with medical procedures, so any instructions would be greatly appreciated. And thank you, for taking the time to listen to me. It makes a big difference.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Moshe. That's what I'm here for. For the blood tests, you don't need to do anything special, just try to avoid a big meal beforehand. And for the sleep study, the sleep center will give you detailed instructions, but basically, you’ll need to come to the clinic in the evening, and they’ll set you up with the monitoring equipment. Just bring a comfortable set of pajamas and something to read. I’ll also give you a printout with all the instructions, just in case. I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks, so we can discuss the results of the tests and see how you’re doing on the medication. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds perfect, Doctor. I can definitely make that work. A printout would be wonderful, thank you. I always forget things, you know? It's good to have everything in writing. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thank you again, for listening. I feel a little better already, just knowing we're getting to the bottom of this. I suppose this is all for now, then? Should I head to the lab to schedule those tests?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for now. And you're very welcome, Moshe. I'm glad you're feeling a little better. Yes, please head to the lab to schedule the blood tests and the sleep study. The receptionist at the front desk can help you with that. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's the printout with all the instructions. Get some rest, and I’ll see you in two weeks. And try to enjoy the garden as much as you can!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. I will. You've been very kind and helpful. I appreciate it more than you know. Goodbye for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Moshe. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. Goodbye!
