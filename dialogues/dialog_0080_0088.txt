DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears, that’s also known as tinnitus. And you said it’s been happening for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe… three or four weeks now? It comes and goes, but it’s definitely more often now than it used to be. It’s hard to explain… sometimes it’s a high-pitched whine, sometimes just a buzzing.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four weeks. And it varies – sometimes a whine, sometimes a buzz. Is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right ear, I think. It’s hard to tell sometimes, but definitely more noticeable over there. It doesn’t feel painful, just… annoying, you know? Like a constant little distraction.
DOCTOR: I understand – very distracting is a good way to put it. And no pain, that's good. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… loud noises definitely make it worse. I work as a waiter, so there's always a bit of a racket. And when it's quiet… it's more noticeable then, if that makes sense? Like I focus on it more when there's nothing else going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, loud noises exacerbate it, and it's more noticeable in quiet environments. That’s helpful. Have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, flu, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of a sniffle maybe a month ago, but nothing major. Just a normal little cold and it went away pretty quickly. Didn’t feel sick for long, definitely nothing like the flu.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent significant illness. And have you been exposed to any really loud noises recently – concerts, construction, anything like that, besides work?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Work’s probably the loudest I get. Maybe the occasional motorbike going past, but nothing I’d say is really loud. I avoid loud music if I can, honestly. It just makes this worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so work is the main source of noise exposure. Have you noticed any hearing loss alongside the ringing, or any dizziness, nausea or fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No dizziness or nausea, thankfully. I think my hearing might be a little bit worse in that right ear, but it’s hard to say for sure. It’s subtle, if anything. I just sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves, but I figured that was just because it’s noisy at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle possible hearing loss in the right ear. Let's take a quick look in your ears and do a quick hearing test to get a better idea. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just want to figure out what’s going on, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, your ears look clear, no wax buildup or obvious signs of infection. The hearing test shows some mild high-frequency hearing loss in your right ear, which correlates with your feeling of subtle hearing loss. It's not severe, but it's present. Do you have any allergies or take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. And no medications either. I try to stay pretty healthy, so nothing like that. Just… a lot of waiting tables!
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies or medications, good to know. Given your history, the examination findings, and the mild hearing loss, this is most likely noise-induced tinnitus. Working in a noisy environment has likely contributed to this. We'll want to rule out other causes, but that’s the most probable explanation. Are you covered by private insurance?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I’ve got private insurance, thankfully. It’s… expensive, but I figured it was worth it in case something like this happened. So, noise-induced, you think? That makes sense, I guess. Is there anything I can do about it?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can use that. Yes, noise-induced seems the most likely cause. There's no cure for tinnitus itself, unfortunately, but we can manage it and try to prevent it from getting worse. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, protecting your ears at work is key. I recommend wearing earplugs – even foam ones can make a big difference. We can talk about custom-fitted earplugs if you're interested. Second, minimizing exposure to loud noises outside of work. Third, stress management techniques can sometimes help, as stress can worsen tinnitus. We can discuss resources for that, if you'd like. Finally, I'm going to order a baseline audiogram – a more detailed hearing test – just to get a more accurate picture of your hearing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. Earplugs at work, definitely. I don’t mind trying those. Custom-fitted ones sound good if they’re better. And less stress… that’s easier said than done, but I’ll try! A detailed hearing test sounds sensible too, just to be sure. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll write you a prescription for custom-fitted earplugs and a referral for the audiogram. The lab will contact you to schedule the test. They’ll send the results back to me. In the meantime, try the foam earplugs at work and focus on stress reduction techniques. I’ll also print out some resources on tinnitus management for you to take home. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for explaining it all so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate it. I’ll get those earplugs sorted and try my best with the stress stuff. I just want to be able to hear properly, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll do our best to help you with that. If your tinnitus worsens, or you experience any other symptoms like dizziness or pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, we'll see you back here once the audiogram results are in. Have a good day, Jaylyne.
