DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. Um... well, I have been coughing up... blood. Just a little, but it scared me. It happened a few times now.
DOCTOR: Blood, you say. Okay. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe about one week? It wasn't every day, but… three or four times now, I think. It’s not a lot, like… just spots, really. Not a big amount. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, it does. And is it bright red blood, or darker, maybe mixed with something else?
PATIENT: Bright red, I think. Yes, definitely bright red. And… no, not mixed with anything. Just… blood. It makes me a little worried, to be honest. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, any blood when you cough is something we need to take seriously. Now, let’s try to get a better picture of what's going on. Do you have any other symptoms along with the coughing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, I have been a little tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… maybe a little short of breath when I walk quickly. But I thought that was just because of my age. I am getting older, you know. Is being tired related to the blood?
DOCTOR: It could be, Ms. Weichers. It could also be something else entirely. Have you had a fever, any chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No chills either. And I haven't been sweating at night, no. I sleep pretty normally, actually. I have been eating okay, I think. Not a big appetite, but… nothing really changed there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any pain in your chest?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not a bad pain, but… a little ache. It’s hard to explain. More like… discomfort, really. It comes and goes. It doesn't hurt when I cough, though. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is. Okay. Let's get some more background. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… well, my husband… he passed away last year. I’m a widow now. He had… heart problems. And I was his caretaker for a long time. As for me… I don't think so. I had the flu once, a long time ago, and maybe a bad cold now and then. But nothing serious. I try to stay healthy. I do walk every day, when the weather is nice. I take vitamins, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries, or hospital stays, ever?
PATIENT: No, never. I have been very lucky, I think. Nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, until… well, until this started. It worries me a lot. I don’t want to get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My parents both passed away a long time ago. I have a sister, but we don’t talk very much anymore. She lives in… California, I think. I don’t know much about her health. I don't think she’s been sick, but… I haven't asked. It’s a long story. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Weichers. Sometimes, family history can give us clues. Alright, do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Never. I do not smoke. My husband used to, but he quit many years ago. I always told him it was bad for his health. I don’t like smoking at all.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine sometimes. Maybe a glass with dinner, once or twice a week. Nothing much. I don’t drink very often. I prefer tea, actually. Green tea. It’s good for you, I hear.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just vitamins. And… sometimes, if I have a headache, I take ibuprofen. But not very often. Maybe once a month, if that. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking medicine if I can. It doesn’t feel very natural, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers. Thank you for all that information. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you'll just sit up here for me. I'm going to start by listening to your breathing. Please take deep breaths in and out as I listen. Okay… and now your heart. Hmm. Your breathing sounds a little… wheezy. And your heart rate is normal, but there's a slight irregularity. I also want to check your oxygen saturation. 96 percent. That’s good. Now, I'm going to quickly palpate your lymph nodes. No swelling there. And I'll just take your temperature. Normal temperature as well. Okay, Ms. Weichers, everything seems… within normal limits, physically. However, the blood you are coughing, coupled with the wheezing and slight heart irregularity, warrants further investigation. It could be a number of things. We need to rule out serious causes.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What do you mean? What could it be? Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? I am getting scared now. What kind of tests do I need?
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, I understand your concern. It’s good to be concerned. It could be something minor, like a persistent bronchitis, but we need to rule out more serious possibilities first. Things like pneumonia, or, less likely, something more serious affecting your lungs or heart. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We'll also need to do some blood work - a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. And, because of the slight irregularity in your heart rhythm, I want to do an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to check your heart’s electrical activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Chest X-ray, blood work… and an EKG… Yes, yes, that sounds… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just want to know what’s wrong. I want to feel better. How long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? The tests, I mean. I don’t like needles very much.
DOCTOR: The X-ray won't hurt at all, Ms. Weichers. You'll just stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes a picture. The blood work… well, there will be a small prick with a needle, yes, but it’s quick. And the EKG involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs – no needles for that one. The lab usually gets the results back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased coughing, fever, difficulty breathing, or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No needles for the EKG, that's good. And I'll call if anything gets worse. 24 to 48 hours… okay. Thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little better. So, I should just go home and wait for your call? Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Weichers, just go home and rest. Try to stay hydrated. And avoid any strenuous activity. We'll go over everything in detail once we have the results. I will also send the orders for the tests to the lab electronically, so you should have no problem getting them done. The front desk will give you the lab address and any necessary paperwork. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You have answered everything I was worried about. Thank you again, Doctor Billman. I hope the tests are nothing serious. I will go now. I will wait for your call.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers. You take care now. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
