DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I am Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…Chilla, yes. Marija Chilla. Well, my husband suggested I come. He's been reading about…planning ahead. About what happens if…well, if something should happen. He thinks I need one of those forms. An…Advance Directive, I believe he called it. Honestly, I don't entirely understand what it’s about, but he’s quite insistent.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive. Yes. Your husband is…sensible, I suppose. It’s a good thing to consider, regardless of age. It outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to communicate them yourself. It's a rather…grim topic, certainly, but a responsible one. Before we get into the specifics of the form itself, let’s just get a general sense of your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – anything you’re being treated for presently?
PATIENT: Well, “treated” is a strong word. I had some…trouble with my back a few years ago, but it mostly sorts itself out. Old age, you know. And I get headaches occasionally. Nothing a good lie-down and some strong tea can’t fix. I don’t go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. I find they mostly make a fuss over nothing, honestly. My husband, however, is quite the hypochondriac. He’s always going on about his blood pressure.
DOCTOR: “Sorts itself out,” you say. Back pain can be…persistent if not addressed properly. And headaches, even occasional ones, can be indicative of…various things. I understand your reluctance to seek medical attention, but dismissing symptoms entirely isn't always the wisest course of action. Regardless. We can certainly discuss the Advance Directive. But before we do, just to have a complete picture, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I’ve always been remarkably healthy, despite what my husband tells anyone who will listen. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I suppose. But that was…ages ago. And a rather unpleasant experience, if I recall correctly. I’ve always preferred natural remedies, honestly. A bit of mint tea, a warm compress…that sort of thing. Much more sensible than letting someone cut you open.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy. Right. And no other surgical procedures?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. Honestly, Doctor, are you quite certain this form is necessary? It sounds dreadfully…morbid. And frankly, I haven't the faintest idea what I'm supposed to put on it. My husband just said I needed to "get it sorted." He's very good at giving orders, my husband is. But actually explaining things…not so much. He just waved a pamphlet at me and said, “You need this!” It’s very frustrating, honestly. Is this something that will take a very long time? I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you find the topic…unsettling, Ms. Chilla. And your husband’s…enthusiasm is…noted. It is a significant form, and it's important to understand what you are signing. It doesn't need to be a lengthy process, but it does require thoughtful consideration. Before we begin outlining your wishes, perhaps we should discuss your family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Well… my mother had…trouble with her digestion, I suppose. And my father…he had a bad cough, for years. Nothing particularly serious, as far as I know. They both lived to a good age, actually. My mother was nearly eighty. Though she was always complaining about something. It's all rather vague, honestly. We weren’t a family that discussed ailments. It was considered…improper, somehow. To dwell on such things. Is this really necessary, Doctor? I mean, honestly. I feel perfectly fine. Perhaps a little tired, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly fine,” you say. Yet, you came in at your husband’s insistence to discuss an Advance Directive. It's a bit…contradictory. Regardless. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like someone who indulges in such…vices? I find the very idea appalling. A glass of sherry with Christmas dinner, perhaps. But that’s the extent of it. My husband enjoys a good whisky, from time to time. But I’ve always discouraged it. It's terribly unhealthy, you know. And quite undignified. No, I lead a very…respectable life. Quiet, perhaps, but certainly respectable. I spend my time reading, gardening, and occasionally visiting my daughter. That is quite enough excitement for me, thank you very much. Now, if you don’t mind, Doctor, perhaps we can get this…form…sorted quickly. I really mustn't be late for luncheon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s address your current medications, then. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I take a calcium tablet, sometimes. For my bones, you know. My daughter recommended it. And occasionally an aspirin, if I have a headache. But that’s it. Really. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Chamomile tea for sleep, peppermint for digestion…that sort of thing. I don’t trust those pharmaceutical companies, honestly. Always trying to sell you something you don’t need. My husband, of course, takes a whole host of pills. Blood pressure, cholesterol…the list is endless. It's quite alarming, really. But he insists the doctor said they are necessary. Now, is this form terribly complicated? It looks rather intimidating.
DOCTOR: Right. Calcium, aspirin, occasionally. It’s…good you are generally mindful of your health, Ms. Chilla, despite your reservations about conventional medicine. Now, before we proceed to the form itself, let’s briefly discuss allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I don't think so. I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Everyone gets hay fever. And I’m not particularly fond of shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. My husband, however, is allergic to…cats, I believe. He sneezes terribly around them. And he’s rather sensitive to dust. But I, thankfully, have no allergies to speak of. I’ve always been quite robust, you see. Now, if you could just explain this form to me, Doctor… I’m beginning to worry about being late for my luncheon. It's with the ladies from the garden club, and Mildred gets terribly cross if one is tardy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam then, just to establish a baseline. It won't be extensive, but it's standard procedure. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Stand? Goodness. At my age? I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, I do hope this won’t take long. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. And I’m wearing rather nice shoes. I wouldn't want to scuff them. What exactly are you looking for, anyway? It all seems rather unnecessary, if you ask me. My husband is going to be furious if I'm late. Mildred is making her famous cucumber sandwiches, and one simply must have a cucumber sandwich at a garden club luncheon.
DOCTOR: Just a quick assessment of your posture and gait, Ms. Chilla. I notice some slight kyphosis and a mild base-wide stance. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished at the bases. Heart rate is regular, approximately 78 beats per minute. Blood pressure is 130/80. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, if you would be so kind as to turn your head and open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is terribly undignified. I haven’t had anyone poke around in my mouth like this in years. And I just had my lipstick applied! My daughter always says I have a lovely complexion, and now you’re going to ruin it with your…instruments. Is it absolutely necessary? It's all very…clinical. I much prefer a good facial. Now, can we please get back to this form? I really must be going soon. Mildred gets terribly cross, you know. And her cucumber sandwiches are simply divine. It would be a tragedy to miss them.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the examination is nearly complete. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are normal. No masses palpated. Alright, Ms. Chilla. We have a baseline. Now, about this Advance Directive… It’s essentially a document outlining your wishes for medical treatment should you become incapacitated and unable to make decisions for yourself. It designates a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make those decisions on your behalf – and specifies the types of treatments you would, or would not, want. Do you have anyone in mind to act as your proxy?
PATIENT: My husband, of course. Who else would it be? He’s…very decisive. Though sometimes a bit overbearing, admittedly. He always knows best, you see. But he's... capable. He'll want everything done, I suspect. Every test, every procedure. He believes in modern medicine, you know. Unlike me. He'll insist on the latest treatments, even if they're…uncomfortable. He's very well-informed, he reads all sorts of medical journals. Though I don't always understand them, myself. He'll want to prolong things, I expect. He has a…scientific curiosity, you see. Yes, my husband, definitely. He’s the obvious choice. Now, can we please get this form sorted? I'm beginning to feel quite faint, and I simply must not miss Mildred's cucumber sandwiches. They're legendary, you know. Absolutely legendary.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will document your husband as your healthcare proxy. Now, the form also allows you to specify your wishes regarding specific treatments, such as resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. Do you have any preferences in these areas?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I haven't the faintest idea. Those all sound rather…dreadful. Resuscitation? Mechanical ventilation? Artificial nutrition? I don't even like the sound of those words. I suppose my husband can decide. He's the expert, you know. He’ll want everything done, naturally. Everything possible to prolong things. He’s a scientist, you see. He has a…morbid fascination with the human body. Yes, just let him decide. I trust his judgment. I simply want it over with, quickly, if it comes to that. And I must get to Mildred’s luncheon. I haven't tasted cucumber sandwiches quite like hers in years. They are…divine. Absolutely divine. Now, can we please finish this form? I'm feeling terribly impatient, and my shoes are beginning to pinch.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. The form is complete. Here you are. Please read it carefully, and make sure you understand everything before signing it. It’s a legally binding document, so it’s important to be fully informed. I also have a copy for your records, and I will send a copy to your husband's primary care physician and to the local hospital. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the time to read all of that. It looks dreadfully complicated. My husband can read it. He's much more capable, you see. He'll know what it all means. Yes, just send it to him. He’ll sort it out. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. Mildred’s cucumber sandwiches await. I do appreciate your time, Doctor, but I’m terribly late already. It’s simply appalling to be late for a garden club luncheon, you know. The social implications are…dire. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been…most helpful. Though frankly, I still don't understand why I had to come here in the first place. My husband just insisted. Yes, insisted. Now, if you'll excuse me...
DOCTOR: .
