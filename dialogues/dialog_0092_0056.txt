DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor…Giganti, was it? Honestly, I haven’t much time for these things. Workplace…difficulties. That’s what my…daughter suggested I come about. A great deal of unnecessary…fuss, if you ask me. It’s just…young people these days don't understand dedication.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like your daughter is concerned about something at work. While I appreciate you coming in, could you elaborate on what these "workplace difficulties" are?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly, it’s…students. They simply don’t apply themselves anymore. Expect everything to be handed to them. No respect for the classics, you see. They prefer these…digital distractions. And the administration…always accommodating the…less-motivated ones. It's a constant battle, a constant…uphill struggle. I've been teaching for…a long time. A very long time. It wasn’t always like this. Though, to be frank, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re quite passionate about your work and frustrated with the changes you’re seeing. It’s admirable that you’ve dedicated so much time to teaching. You mentioned your memory isn’t what it used to be. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s nothing serious, Doctor. Just…things slip my mind. Dates, names…the occasional student's face. It’s to be expected at my age. Eighty-seven years, you know. Though, I recall perfectly well the proper Dewey Decimal System categorization…most of it, at least. It's just…recent events, shall we say. Not worth bothering you with, honestly. I simply wish they would listen to someone with experience. It’s the principle of the thing, you understand. A lot of…unnecessary bureaucracy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. While you feel it’s not worth bothering me with, changes in memory, even if they seem minor, are worth exploring, especially at your age. It's good that you’re still able to recall things like the Dewey Decimal System—that shows good cognitive function. But we should investigate the recent memory slips to rule out any underlying causes. Would you mind if I ask a few questions to get a better understanding of what you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly, Doctor, I came here because my daughter insisted. I haven't time for a…quiz. I’m a highly respected educator. I don't need to be examined. And frankly, I'm quite busy. Are you suggesting…something is wrong with me? Because I assure you, there is not. Just…students. It’s always the students. If you must ask something, make it quick. I have papers to grade, you see. Very important papers.
DOCTOR: Please, Mr. Schlatterer, I'm not suggesting anything is wrong with you. I simply want to gather some information to get a complete picture of your health. It's standard procedure, and it will help me understand what’s going on. Think of it as a comprehensive assessment, not an examination. It will only take a few minutes, and it could help identify if there's anything we can do to support your cognitive function, so you can continue doing what you love—teaching. To start, could you tell me approximately when you first noticed these memory slips?
PATIENT: Approximately? Goodness, Doctor, how am I supposed to know approximately? It's been…some time. Perhaps…a year? Maybe longer? Honestly, it’s all rather blurry. I’ve been teaching for so long, everything blends together. It's like asking me to pinpoint a single grain of sand on a beach. Pointless, really. Are we going to get anywhere with this, or are we simply wasting time? I have a very full schedule, you see. And these…questions…they’re rather irritating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It's perfectly alright if you don't have a precise answer. "About a year" is helpful. Now, can you describe the types of things you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: What types of things? Oh, goodness. Names, mostly. Student names, colleague names…the name of that new librarian. It's embarrassing, really. And…appointments. I missed a luncheon last month. A very important luncheon. And occasionally…where I put my glasses. Though, they usually turn up eventually. It's not as if I’m forgetting important things…like the principles of library science! Just…small details. Insignificant details. Really, Doctor, I suspect it’s simply the stress of dealing with…the younger generation. It’s quite draining, you know. All this…modern technology. It’s a scourge, a scourge, I tell you!
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’re primarily experiencing difficulty recalling names and occasionally misplacing items, along with forgetting appointments. It's understandable that the changes at work, and dealing with a new generation, could be contributing to stress. Now, Mr. Schlatterer, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, Doctor, at my age, it’s a rather long list. A touch of high blood pressure, years ago. Managed with…a small pill. And a bout of pneumonia in the nineties, but I recovered fully. Oh, and arthritis in my hands, but what old teacher doesn’t have arthritis? It’s the constant grading, you see. Years of holding a pen. I doubt any of it is relevant. It’s simply…old age, Doctor. Accept it. And frankly, I’d rather not dwell on it. It’s depressing. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have papers to grade, you see. Very important papers.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to dwell on it, Mr. Schlatterer. However, knowing your medical history helps me to get a complete picture of your health and to rule out any potential underlying causes for your current concerns. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the pill you mentioned for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see…the blood pressure pill, yes. And…sometimes I take something for the arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I believe. The generic kind. My daughter handles most of that, actually. She’s very…organized. Perhaps she knows better than I do. I mostly just take what she gives me. And…a vitamin D supplement, in the winter. The doctor recommended it, years ago. I can’t recall his name, unfortunately. A very forgetful business, this aging process. Honestly, Doctor, are you a specialist in…forgetfulness? Perhaps you should be the one seeing a doctor.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you letting me know, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like your daughter is very helpful in managing your health. And while I'm not a specialist in forgetfulness specifically, I'm a family medicine physician, and we do address cognitive concerns as part of overall health care. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you suggesting…something? I am a retired educator! A pillar of the community! I have never touched a recreational drug in my life. And while I occasionally enjoy a glass of red wine with dinner…a very small glass, mind you…it’s for the health benefits, you understand. Resveratrol and all that. And smoking? Absolutely not. My mother died of emphysema. A dreadful disease. Honestly, Doctor, are you always this…thorough? It’s rather insulting, frankly. I came here because my daughter insisted I was “overstressed,” not because I’m some sort of…degenerate.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Mr. Schlatterer. I simply need to gather all the relevant information to ensure I have a complete picture of your health. It’s standard practice, and it helps me rule out potential contributing factors. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, or dementia?
PATIENT: Family history…oh, goodness. That’s a long story. My mother, as I mentioned, died of emphysema. My father had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young. And…my aunt, on my mother's side, I think she had…something with her memory. Towards the end of her life, she was…confused. But honestly, Doctor, it was generations ago. I barely remember. These things…blur together. And frankly, dwelling on death and disease is rather depressing. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have papers to grade, you see. Very important papers.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I think it would be helpful if I conducted a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a simple neurological assessment—just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Now? After all these…questions? Honestly, Doctor, I came here to discuss my “stress levels,” not to be prodded and poked like some sort of…laboratory specimen. I assure you, my body is perfectly functional. I walk, I talk, I grade papers. What more do you need? And frankly, I haven't the time for such…antics. I have a very busy schedule, you see. Very important papers. This is quite unnecessary, Doctor. Quite unnecessary. I think I've answered enough questions. Perhaps a referral to a therapist would be more appropriate? Someone to discuss my…work-life balance, perhaps.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Schlatterer. I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. It seems you’re quite clear about what you’d like. Given your preference, and the fact that you believe your stress levels are the primary concern, a referral to a therapist specializing in stress management and work-life balance would likely be the most appropriate next step. I will write a referral for you. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your memory, or if you become concerned about anything else, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before I finalize the referral?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. A referral would be…acceptable. Though I suspect it will be a waste of time. The younger generation simply doesn't understand dedication. Still, my daughter would be pleased. Thank you for your…time. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I’ll have the referral ready for you shortly. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
