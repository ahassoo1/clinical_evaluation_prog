DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been bothering me something awful. A sore, it is. A nasty one, and it just won’t heal. I’ve had… well, I’ve had a lot of sores, you see. But this one… this one’s different. It’s painful, and it smells. Not a good smell, I assure you. I’ve been putting some cream on it, but it doesn’t seem to do a bit of good.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s painful and not healing well, and has a smell to it. I understand that you've tried cream already, but it hasn't helped. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this sore first started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… let me think. It's been… well, it feels like months, really. Maybe three? No, four, I reckon. It started small, just a little red spot, hardly noticeable. I didn’t pay it much mind at first. I thought it was just a scrape, you know? From walking barefoot, perhaps. I do like to feel the earth under my feet when the weather’s nice. But then it got bigger, and redder, and sore. And now… well, now it’s this mess. I can't rightly recall the exact date, mind you. Old age, you see. Details get fuzzy. But it’s been a good while. A good while indeed.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. “A good while” is helpful enough. So it started as a small red spot, slowly growing and becoming more painful over the last three or four months. And you mentioned you've had other sores before. Are those similar to this one, or are they different in any way?
PATIENT: Oh, they're different. Very different. Those others...well, those were just little things. Scratches mostly, or maybe a blister from new shoes. They healed up quick, with a bit of ointment. This one… this one’s deep. And it’s… it’s weepy. That’s the word, isn’t it? Weepy. Always damp. And the smell...those others never smelled like this. It’s a sickly sweet smell, honestly. Very unpleasant. I’ve always taken good care of myself, you know. Cleanliness is next to godliness, my mother always said. But this…this is beyond just a simple scrape. It's worrying me, it truly is.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned. A sore that's deep, weepy, and has a distinct smell, especially after trying ointment, definitely needs a closer look. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions, if that's alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or swelling in your leg or foot along with the sore?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Fever…well, I haven’t taken my temperature. Don’t bother with all that modern nonsense. I can tell if I have a fever, thank you very much. I haven’t been burning up, no. A little warm, perhaps, but that’s just the weather. It’s been awfully humid lately. Chills… not really. I get a little cold in the evenings, but that’s just old age again. Swelling… now, that you may be onto something. My foot is a bit puffy around the sore, yes. Not terribly, but I have noticed it. Especially at the end of the day. I usually put my feet up, helps a little. But it does swell, you’re right about that. It’s always the left foot, mind you. Always the left.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever that you've noticed, some swelling in the left foot, especially at the end of the day, and the sore is on your left foot. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, that. Well, Dr. Alika told me, oh, years ago now, that my sugar was… not quite right. He put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t feel right, all those chemicals. He said something about “diabetes,” yes. Something about sugar in my blood. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and taro. But I do like a little coconut pudding now and then. Circulation… I don’t know about that. My feet get cold sometimes, but that’s just… old age, isn’t it? They don't feel very warm to the touch, if that’s what you mean. And they tingle sometimes, a little pins and needles feeling. But nothing too bad. It's just…old age. I keep telling you.
DOCTOR: I understand. So you were told you had some issues with your blood sugar in the past, and you stopped taking medication for it. You also experience some tingling and coldness in your feet. It's good you're aware of these things. Now, before we take a look at your foot, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Medications…well, I don’t take much of anything these days. Dr. Alika, before he… before he retired, he took me off most of my pills. Said I didn't need them. I take a little fish oil, for my joints. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. But not every day. Just when I really need it. And I take a vitamin D supplement, Dr. Lahn said I was low on that, back when I had that check-up. But that’s about it. Just a few things. Nothing fancy. I prefer to rely on natural remedies, when I can. Coconut oil is good for everything, you know. Everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, so fish oil for your joints, ibuprofen occasionally for arthritis, and vitamin D. That’s good to know. Okay, Louine, I'm going to take a look at your foot now. Could you please take off your shoe and sock so I can examine the sore?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. It's not a pretty sight, you know. Don't expect miracles. It’s gotten worse since this morning, I can tell you that. It's…tender. Very tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the sore now. It is quite inflamed and there’s some drainage. It does appear tender to the touch, as you said. And I notice some redness extending up your foot. I'm also going to check your pulses to assess the circulation in your leg and foot. Your pulses are present, but they are a bit weak. That, combined with the soreness, swelling, and the appearance of the sore, is concerning. I'm going to need to take a closer look and possibly get some tests done to figure out what's going on. I want to rule out an infection, and because you mentioned having some issues with your blood sugar in the past, we need to check that as well. Would you be okay with me drawing some blood for a lab test?
PATIENT: Hmph. Blood tests, you say? More poking and prodding… I suppose it can’t be helped. Dr. Alika always said I had too much sugar in my blood, so I suppose you’re right to check. It’s just… I don’t like needles. Never have. But if it will help, I suppose I can endure it. Just… be quick about it, alright? And try not to bruise me. I bruise easily, you know. Old age. It all comes down to old age, doesn't it? What kind of tests are you planning, exactly? And will it hurt? I hope it won't hurt too much. I don’t have a high pain tolerance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll just need a small sample of blood. The tests we’ll run include a complete blood count to look for signs of infection, a blood sugar test to see where your glucose levels are at, and a test to check your kidney function. These tests will give us a better understanding of what's going on and help us determine the best course of treatment. I'll also need to clean the sore and take a swab to send to the lab for a culture. This will tell us if there’s a specific type of bacteria causing an infection. That may sting a little bit when I clean it, but it shouldn’t be too painful. Do you have any allergies to any medications or latex?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Allergies? Let me think… No, not to medications, as far as I know. Dr. Alika gave me all sorts of things over the years, and I never had a reaction. I am… sensitive to latex, yes. I had a rash once, a terrible rash, when I used a rubber band. So, no latex, alright? Absolutely no latex. It's a dreadful thing, latex. Makes my skin itch something awful. And don't use anything with a strong smell either. I’m sensitive to smells, you know. Everything bothers me these days. It's…old age. Always old age. Just be careful with the cleaning. I don't want any harsh chemicals on my foot. And please, be quick about it. This is all very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no latex, no strong smells, and gentle cleaning. I will make sure to use latex-free gloves and a mild antiseptic solution. I'll be as quick and careful as possible. First, I’m going to gently clean the sore with the antiseptic solution. It may sting a little bit, but I’ll let you know if I’m applying anything that might be uncomfortable. Then, I'll take a swab of the sore for the culture. After that, I’ll draw a small amount of blood for the lab tests. Alright, Louine, that’s all done. I’ve sent the swab and blood samples to the lab. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to wrap your foot with a sterile bandage to keep it clean and protected. I'll also give you some instructions on how to care for it at home. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Finally. Yes, wrapping it is good. Keeps the germs out, I suppose. And instructions… well, alright. But speak clearly. I don’t hear as well as I used to, you know. Old age. It’s always old age. And don't give me any complicated instructions. I’m not good with all that modern medicine. Just tell me what I need to do, simply. And if it gets any worse, you'll let me know, won't you? I don't want to end up in the hospital. I've had enough of hospitals in my life, thank you very much. Just… keep it simple. That's all I ask. Simple.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. I’ll keep it simple. First, keep the bandage clean and dry. Change it once a day, or if it gets wet or dirty. When you change it, gently wash the area with mild soap and water. Pat it dry with a clean towel. Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to the sore before applying the new bandage. This will help prevent infection. Avoid putting any pressure on your foot as much as possible. If you need to walk, try to rest it as much as possible. If you notice any of the following, please call my office immediately: increased pain, redness or swelling around the sore, drainage that is foul-smelling or changes color, fever, or chills. I will call you as soon as we have the lab results back. If the results show an infection, we may need to start you on antibiotics. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Antibiotics, you say? I don’t like those. They upset my stomach, you know. But if it comes to it, I suppose I’ll have to take them. No, I don't think I have any questions. Just…keep it simple, alright? And call me as soon as you have the results. Don’t make me wait. I don’t have much patience these days, you see. Old age. It's always old age. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you, Dr. Lahn. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I'll go home and rest my foot. It's been a long morning. And a rather unpleasant one, if I may say so myself.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. I understand. I’ll keep you updated as soon as we have the results, and we'll take things one step at a time. I’ll make sure to note your preference for simple instructions and potential stomach upset with antibiotics. Here’s a written copy of the instructions we discussed, just in case. Please rest your foot and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. It was nice meeting you, Louine. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
