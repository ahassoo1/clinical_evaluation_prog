DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure's been actin' up, that’s why I’m here. My regular doctor… passed on a while back, and folks said you were good with this sort of thing. It’s just been higher than I like, and I figured I best get it checked.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. It’s nice to meet you as well. I’m sorry to hear about your previous doctor. I’m happy to help, and we’ll certainly get your blood pressure checked and discuss what's been going on. To start, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by “actin’ up”?
PATIENT: Well, mostly just feelin’ tired, and kinda dizzy sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. And a few headaches, nothin’ terrible, just… there. My daughter, bless her heart, she bought me one of them machines to check it myself. It’s been readin’ high a lot lately, even when I’m just sittin’ quiet. Higher than it used to, that’s for sure. I don't really understand all the numbers, though.
DOCTOR: I see. Tiredness, dizziness, and occasional headaches, along with higher readings on your home blood pressure monitor. That gives us a good starting point. Could you tell me roughly what those readings have been when you’ve checked it at home?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. Numbers… I try to write 'em down, but I forget half the time. Seems like... mostly over 140, sometimes even closer to 160. My daughter says that's bad, but she's always worryin’. I mostly just try not to think about it too much, to be honest. It just makes me anxious, and then it goes higher!
DOCTOR: I understand, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when dealing with health concerns. It’s good that you’re monitoring it at home, even if the numbers are a little difficult to keep track of. Readings consistently over 140 are certainly something we need to investigate further. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to check your blood pressure myself here in the office, and then we’ll go over your medical history. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds fine. Whatever you think best. I just want to get this sorted out. It’s been worryin’ my family, and I don’t want to be a burden. Go ahead and check it, please. I’m sittin’ right here.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just relax your arm for me, please. I’m going to put this cuff on and take a few readings. Try to breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is currently 158 over 92. That confirms what you’ve been seeing at home. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs, if that’s okay. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, nothin’ like that. Just… old age, I reckon. My joints ache a bit, but that’s just comin’ with the years. I had a bad flu a few winters back, but I recovered just fine. And my eyesight’s goin', but I got glasses for that. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to eat right, mostly… and I used to walk more, but it's hard on these old knees now. I don't drink or smoke, never have. My husband, bless his soul, he did a bit of both, but I always told him it wouldn’t do him any good.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It sounds like you've generally been very healthy, and that’s wonderful. And it's excellent that you’ve never smoked and don’t drink. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Years ago, I had my gallbladder out. Must’ve been… forty years ago, maybe more. And when I was a little girl, I broke my arm fallin' out of a tree. Silly thing to do, I know. But that’s about it. No other surgeries, no long stays in the hospital. Just the usual aches and pains that come with livin’ a long life. I don't even remember the surgery that much anymore, to be honest. My mama took care of me then, and she handled everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago and a broken arm as a child. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. That’s a long story. My mama, she had high blood pressure too, towards the end of her life. And her mama, my grandmother, she had… somethin’ with her heart, I think. My daddy was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life, 'til the very end. My brother, he had some trouble with his diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself like he should have. It runs in the family, I reckon, this sort of thing. But nobody really talked about it much back then. Just figured it was part of livin'.
DOCTOR: I see. A family history of high blood pressure and heart issues, and diabetes. That’s important information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my arthritis, helps with the achin’ in my joints. Can’t remember the name of it, my daughter fills my pill box every week. And… no allergies, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin'. I eat pretty much anything, though I try to stay away from too much sugar. It makes my knees swell up something awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a medication for arthritis, and no known allergies. Alright, I’m going to pull up your records to see what information we have on file about your arthritis medication. One moment. Okay, it looks like you’re taking naproxen for your arthritis. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to ask you a few questions about how you’ve been feeling overall. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, or have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, naproxen, that’s right. My vision's been gettin' worse, like I said, that’s why I got new glasses. And sometimes my ankles swell up a bit, especially if I sit too long. No chest pain, thankfully, and I haven’t had any trouble breathin'. Mostly just tired, and a little dizzy now and then. I try to stay active, but it’s hard on these old bones, you know? It’s just… gettin’ old, I reckon. I’m probably just makin’ a fuss over nothin’.
DOCTOR: You're not making a fuss over nothing at all, Venna. It's good that you're describing these symptoms to me. Swelling in your ankles and fatigue, along with the dizziness, are all things we need to investigate. Your ankles do have some mild swelling. Now, just to rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs again and check your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, go right ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My daughter, she's always tellin' me to get everything checked out, and she's probably right. It's just… I've lived a long life, and I've been pretty healthy 'til now. I don't want to bother you with old-age aches and pains. But if you think it's best, check away. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Venna. And it's never too late to address health concerns, regardless of age. It's my job to help you feel your best. Okay, your heart and lung sounds are still normal, and your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, I believe your elevated blood pressure is the primary concern, and we need to investigate the cause. The swelling in your ankles could be related to the blood pressure, or it could be something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work and a urine test. These tests will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other potential underlying issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds sensible. Whatever tests you think best. I just want to know what's goin' on. Blood work and a urine test… fine. Just tell me what I need to do. I trust you to take care of me. Hopefully, it's not somethin' too serious. I've got a garden to tend, you know. I can't be laid up in bed!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. We’ll get to the bottom of this so you can get back to your garden. Okay, I’m ordering the blood work and urine test now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. You don’t need to fast for these tests, but please try to drink plenty of water before you go. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you monitor your blood pressure at home as you’ve been doing, and keep a record of your readings. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just gettin' this done is a relief, to be honest. Thank you for listenin' to me, and for not dismissin' me as just an old woman. That means a lot. When will I hear about the tests? And where do I go for 'em? Is it far? I don’t drive anymore, you see. My daughter usually takes me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Venna. It's my pleasure, and you should never feel dismissed. Your health concerns are valid, and I'm happy to help. The lab is right down the hall, just past the reception desk. It’s a very short walk. You won't have to go far at all. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. My office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. You've been very kind. I appreciate your time and patience. I'll go find the lab now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
