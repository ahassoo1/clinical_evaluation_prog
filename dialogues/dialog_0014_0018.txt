DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, I think. It’s been happening for… oh, goodness, I can’t quite recall when it started. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. Hmm. And would you describe it as painful, or just… frequent?
PATIENT: No, not painful, Doctor. Not at all. Just… a lot. It doesn’t hurt to go, it just… well, I find myself going quite often. And sometimes, it feels like I’ve just gone, and then… not long after, I need to go again. It’s… disruptive, I suppose. I don't recall anything changing that might cause it, though. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes, I understand. And is there any change in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color, you say? Oh dear. I haven’t… paid much attention, to be honest. I suppose it looks normal. You know, the usual yellow. I really haven’t been looking, if I’m being truthful. Is that… bad? I'm afraid I'm not very observant when it comes to things like that.
DOCTOR: Well, it's good to be aware of changes. Alright. And have you noticed any… difficulty starting the stream, or a weak flow?
PATIENT: Difficulty? No, not that I recall. It starts normally, as far as I can tell. And the… flow seems fine. It’s not like it’s… sputtering or anything. I suppose I haven't been measuring it, Doctor. I just know it feels… regular. Though, now that you mention it, perhaps it’s not as strong as it used to be? It’s hard to say, really. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or lower back pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t taken my temperature, but I haven’t felt feverish. Chills, no. And lower back pain… sometimes my back aches, but that’s just my age, I expect. It’s not… sharp or sudden, just a general ache. It’s probably nothing to do with this bathroom business. I'm getting rather confused, I must admit. It all feels a bit… much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any increased thirst?
PATIENT: Increased thirst… hmm. Now that you mention it, perhaps a little. I have been drinking more water than usual, yes. Though, it's been rather warm lately, so I attributed that to the weather. I suppose I could be wrong. I drink quite a bit throughout the day, but I don't know if it's more than usual. It's difficult to say for certain. Is thirst a common symptom? I'm trying to recall if anything else has changed…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Let's do a quick physical exam. We’ll check your abdomen and…yes, a prostate exam. It's standard procedure with these symptoms. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a prostate exam? Well… I suppose so. If it’s standard, then it must be necessary. I confess, I’m not terribly fond of… examinations, but if you think it’s important, Doctor, then please proceed. Just… be gentle, if you would. And perhaps tell me what you're doing as you go? It will help calm my nerves a bit, if you don’t mind. I’m not one for surprises, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will explain everything as I go. Please lie down on your left side, knees bent. We'll start with your abdomen. I'm just going to listen and feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. No masses felt. Now, we will proceed with the prostate exam. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should be brief. Prostate is… slightly enlarged. Not significantly tender, but feels…irregular. No acute pain reported. Alright. Prostate feels enlarged and irregular. This could be a sign of benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is common at your age. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The PSA will help us assess your risk of prostate cancer.
PATIENT: Oh… prostate cancer? That sounds… rather serious. Enlarged and irregular… is that very bad? I confess, I'm getting quite worried now. A blood test and urine analysis, you say? How long will it take to get the results? And what happens if… if it is something serious? I suppose I should have brought someone with me. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Trying not to drink so much water, perhaps? I'm terribly confused, Doctor. And a bit frightened, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, let’s not jump to conclusions. Enlarged prostate is very common, and it doesn’t automatically mean cancer. The PSA test is just a screening tool. We need the results before we can say anything definitively. As for what you can do in the meantime… try to limit caffeine and alcohol intake, as these can irritate the bladder. And yes, moderate your fluid intake slightly. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests as soon as they are available, likely within a week. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Tests… right. Limit caffeine and alcohol… I can manage that, I suppose. A week… that seems a long time to wait, but… alright. And the tests themselves… what exactly are you looking for? Is the PSA test a blood test? Will it be painful? I'm sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor, but… this is all rather unsettling. I just want to know… what’s happening. And whether it’s something… awful. Is there anything I should be feeling for? Any new symptoms I should be aware of? Perhaps… bleeding? I’m terribly sorry. I'm just… anxious.
DOCTOR: The PSA test is a simple blood draw, Mr. Verbos. Minimal discomfort, like any other blood test. It measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood, which can be elevated in cases of prostate cancer, but also in benign conditions. We’re looking for an elevated level, but again, it’s not conclusive on its own. As for new symptoms, yes. If you notice any blood in your urine or semen, or any difficulty urinating – a weak stream, or straining to go – contact us immediately. We'll also want to know if you experience any pain in your lower back, hips, or thighs. But try not to worry unduly at this point. We're gathering information, and we’ll have a clearer picture soon. I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood now, and she'll give you instructions on collecting a urine sample. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… blood test, urine sample, look for blood, difficulty urinating, pain… I think I understand. It’s just… a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it is… worrying. The nurse, you say? Very well. I suppose I should go and… have my blood taken, then. I hope it doesn’t take long. And… thank you again, Doctor. I feel slightly better, knowing what to expect, even if it’s not entirely good news. .
