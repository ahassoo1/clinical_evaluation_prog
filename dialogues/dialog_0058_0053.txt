DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble…going. It just takes a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t come out very strong, you know? It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Trouble going," right. And you said a couple of weeks, maybe longer. Can you be a little more specific about how long?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific…let me think. It started…around the 15th of July, I believe. Yes, the 15th. I remember because that was the day Mrs. Olenska’s cat finally had her kittens. Six of them! But that’s not important. It’s been…gradually getting worse since then, I suppose. Not suddenly, just…slower and weaker. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly three weeks. And it’s been a gradual decline in stream strength and increased difficulty. Do you feel like you're completely emptying your bladder when you go, or do you feel like there's always some left?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No, I don't think so. It doesn’t feel completely empty, no. There’s always a little bit left, like a tiny bit. I usually have to…sort of strain a bit to get everything out, but even then, I don’t feel like it’s all gone. And sometimes…sometimes it starts and stops, you know? Like it’s not a steady flow. Does that sound strange?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound strange, exactly. Intermittent stream and a sensation of incomplete emptying… okay. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. And no burning either. It's not uncomfortable, exactly, just…frustrating. It takes so long, and I have to go back to the bathroom again not long after. It’s really bothering me when I go to visit my daughter. She lives an hour away, and I don’t want to have to stop on the highway all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no pain, no burning, just difficulty and intermittency. Have you had any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. It looks the same as always, I suppose. Normal color, no blood, no foam… I haven’t noticed anything different about it, no. It just…takes longer to come out. I do drink a lot of tea, though. Lithuanian black tea. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Tea… possibly. We'll get to that. Have you ever had any urinary tract infections before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. A long time ago. Maybe…twenty years ago? Or more. I had to take antibiotics, of course. Dr. Petraitis gave them to me. He retired years ago now. I don’t think I’ve had one since then. It was a terrible pain, though, that time. This isn’t painful, thankfully. Just…annoying. Is that important, Doctor? Knowing I had one before?
DOCTOR: It’s…relevant. Okay. And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but it doesn’t bother me too much. And my blood pressure is a little high, but I take pills for that. Lisinopril, I think it is. And…oh, I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. That was a bit of a shock, but I’m fine now. I’m on Medicare, if that’s helpful. Do you need a list of my medications? I have one in my purse.
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. We can review the medication list later, if needed. Just the Lisinopril for now. Alright. I'm going to do a quick exam, just to check a few things. Can you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Oh dear, I hope it’s not too much. I’ve been enjoying Mrs. Olenska’s cookies lately. They're very good!
DOCTOR: 88 kilograms. And your height is 183 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I’m a tall woman, always have been. My father was very tall, too. A farmer, he was. Strong hands. Is that…a problem, Doctor? My weight, I mean?
DOCTOR: It’s… something we’ll note. Now, if you could lie down on the exam table, please. I just need to listen to your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s a little cold, isn’t it? But I suppose it’s better than being cold outside. Do you need me to take anything off? I have a slip on, you know.
DOCTOR: No, that won't be necessary. Just relax. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Reflexes appear normal. Now, I'm going to perform a quick pelvic exam. I’ll need you to bend your knees and relax. I’ll let you know what I’m doing as I go.
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam? Is that…necessary, Doctor? I haven't had one in years. It’s just the waterworks, you know? I'm not sure… I don't like those very much. Is there another way?
DOCTOR: Ms. Yadao, to properly evaluate your symptoms and rule out potential causes, a pelvic exam is necessary. It will allow me to assess the muscles, ligaments, and organs in the pelvic area. It’s a standard part of the evaluation for urinary issues. We will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you are truly uncomfortable, we can postpone it, but it will make it much harder to determine the cause of your problem. Are you experiencing any pain right now?
PATIENT: No, not right now. It's just…awkward, you know? I haven't had one in so long. And I don’t like being…touched down there. But…if you say it’s necessary… Alright, Doctor. But please be gentle. And tell me what you’re doing, alright? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to take a look at your external anatomy first… and then I'll use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal… This may feel a little cold… We’re just looking for any signs of infection or abnormalities…
PATIENT: Oh… that is cold. And… a little uncomfortable. Is it almost over? I don't like this at all. Please be quick, Doctor. It feels… strange. Like everything is…exposed.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s all for the internal exam. I'm just going to palpate your abdomen again… and then we’ll be finished. No masses noted.
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness that's over. That was… unpleasant. Is everything alright, Doctor? Did you find anything? Please tell me, I don't want to be left wondering. I just want to know what's wrong with my waterworks, and if you can fix it.
DOCTOR: Well, the exam didn't reveal any obvious abnormalities. No signs of infection, no masses. Your reflexes are normal. However, your pelvic floor muscles feel somewhat weak. Based on your history and the exam findings, it’s likely you have some degree of urinary incontinence due to pelvic floor weakness. It’s common, especially with age and after childbirth – though you didn’t mention childbirth. It means the muscles that support your bladder aren’t as strong as they should be, causing difficulty emptying your bladder and intermittent stream.
PATIENT: Oh. Weak muscles? But…I haven’t done anything to weaken them! I walk every day, you know. And I try to do my exercises. It's just…old age, you say? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? And…can it be fixed? I don't want to be wearing pads for the rest of my life! I still like to go to church, and I don't want to worry about accidents.
DOCTOR: It’s not serious in the life-threatening sense. It’s a quality-of-life issue. And no, you won’t necessarily need pads for the rest of your life. We can try some things. First, we’ll start with pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegels. I’ll give you a handout with instructions. You need to do these regularly, several times a day. It takes commitment. And we can discuss bladder training techniques. If those don’t work, there are other options, like biofeedback or, in more severe cases, medication or even surgery. But let's start with the basics first. And honestly, cutting back on the tea might help. It's a diuretic. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Kegels… I’ve heard of those. Squeeze and release, you say? Several times a day… that sounds like a lot. And bladder training… what does that even mean? And cutting back on my tea? Oh, Doctor, that's asking a lot! It's my one pleasure, you know? Lithuanian black tea, strong and hot. It helps me wake up in the morning. So, I have to do exercises, train my bladder, and give up my tea? Is there anything else? Any pills I can take right away? I just want a quick fix, if that's possible. And…how long will it take to see if this even works? I have my daughter's birthday next month, and I don't want to be worrying about this then.
DOCTOR: Ms. Yadao, there is no quick fix. These things take time and effort. There are medications that can help with bladder control, but they have side effects, and we generally reserve them for more severe cases. We'll start with the conservative measures – the exercises and bladder training. Give it at least six to eight weeks, and we’ll reassess. If there’s no improvement, then we can discuss other options. I'm going to write you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor rehabilitation. They can provide more personalized guidance and support. Here’s the referral. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… more appointments… more exercises… It just seems like a lot, Doctor. I'm an old woman, you know? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom without worrying. Is it going to get worse if I don’t do all this? And… what if the exercises don't work? What then? I suppose… I’ll try. But I’m not very optimistic.
DOCTOR: It likely won't get significantly worse if you stick to the conservative measures. But without intervention, it will likely remain the same or potentially worsen over time. And we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let’s focus on the exercises and the physical therapy first. If those don't work, we’ll explore other options. Here are the discharge instructions. Read them carefully. Schedule the appointment with the physical therapist, and come back in six to eight weeks for a follow-up. Do you have any questions before you go?
