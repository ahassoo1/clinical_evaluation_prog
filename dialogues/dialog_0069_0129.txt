DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. I see you’re 73 years young. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Andraca, you say? Well, don't bother with the "young" part, dear. Seventy-three is seventy-three. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get to it. It's my stool. It's… dark. Black, actually. And I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking them for years. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta, I understand. Seventy-three is seventy-three, you're absolutely right. And we'll definitely get to the bottom of things. Black stool is something we need to investigate. You mentioned the red pills for arthritis – those are important to know about. Just to clarify, are those the only medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Only medications? Like I'm some sort of… complicated case? Honestly. Well, there's the water pill, the little white one, for my ankles swelling up. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take one of those… what are they called? The blue ones my neighbor gives me. But that's it. Mostly just the red ones, though. And the water pill. Really, it's probably just the red ones. They probably mess everything up, those things. I told my Harold they were trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, so red pills for arthritis, a little white pill for swelling in your ankles, and sometimes a blue pill for sleep. Thank you for clarifying. It's good you mention everything, even the things you get from your neighbor – that helps me understand the whole picture. Just to be sure, do you know the names of any of those pills?
PATIENT: Names? Honestly, doctor, I don't go around memorizing the names of everything I swallow. Harold fills those little bottles. I just take what he gives me. He's the one with the good memory. Something about the red ones ends in "-profen," I think? And the water pill… well, it’s small and white. That's about all I know. Don't expect me to be a pharmacist, dear. I've got better things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Dawnetta. You shouldn't feel pressured to remember medication names. "-profen" is a good start – that helps us narrow things down. We can look up what those might be. Now, about this black stool... Has this happened before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: New. Definitely new. It started… oh, maybe a week ago? A little more than a week. I thought it was something I ate at first, you know? But it keeps happening. And it's not… normal. It's not like the usual color. It’s… well, black. Like tar, almost. Harold said I should come in, said it could be serious. He worries too much, honestly, but he means well.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this black, tar-like stool has been happening for about a week now. And it's not related to anything specific you've eaten. I appreciate Harold encouraging you to come in – it’s always good to have someone looking out for you. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this?
PATIENT: Changes? What sort of changes? I feel… fine. A little tired, maybe. But I'm seventy-three! I'm supposed to be tired. No… no stomach pain, not really. And everything else is working as it should, if you know what I mean. Honestly, doctor, I’m not falling apart, despite what Harold thinks. It’s just the stool. Black stool. That’s what’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no stomach pain, and everything else is functioning normally. Just the black stool and a little tiredness, which you attribute to your age. That’s good to know. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your abdomen and check your vitals. It will only take a few moments. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly. Fine, go ahead. But don't expect miracles. I'm a bit… sensitive, you know? And hurry it up, please. I’ve got things to do. Harold’s making stew, and I don’t want it to get cold. Just… be gentle. And quick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dawnetta. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. I'll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then check your pulse and blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning for your age. Your pulse is 78, regular. When I listen to your abdomen, I don’t hear any unusual sounds, but I do notice some mild tenderness when I press on your lower abdomen. Is that something you've noticed before?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Well, sometimes. Not always. It's just… a little ache. Like a dull pain, you know? It comes and goes. I usually just ignore it. Old age, dear. Things ache. It's part of the package. Don't go making a big deal out of it. And frankly, I told you Harold worries too much. Now, are we done poking and prodding? I need to get home for that stew.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild, dull ache in your lower abdomen that comes and goes. I understand that you attribute it to age, and that you're not overly concerned. Given the black stool and the tenderness in your abdomen, I’d like to order a couple of tests, just to be on the safe side. A complete blood count and a stool test to check for blood. We'll also check your iron levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for heaven’s sake. More poking and prodding? And waiting around? Honestly, doctor, I haven’t got time for this. Harold will be wondering where I am. Look, I've told you, it’s probably just those pills. Can't you just… stop the pills and see if it goes away? That's what I want. No tests. Just stop the pills. I'm sure that's all it is. Really. Those red ones are trouble. I told Harold.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I respect your wishes. However, black stool is a serious symptom that can indicate bleeding in the digestive tract. Stopping the pills without knowing the cause could potentially mask a more serious issue. While the pills could be the cause, we need to rule out other possibilities. The tests I'm ordering are relatively simple and will give us valuable information. I'm not trying to cause you unnecessary worry, but I have a responsibility to ensure we're making the best decision for your health. Would you be willing to consider the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! You’re just like Harold. Always worrying, always making a fuss. Digestive tract? Bleeding? Good heavens. Alright, fine. Do your tests. But I'm telling you, it's those pills. And if it turns out to be nothing, I expect an apology. And you better be quick about it. I really need to get home for that stew. Harold makes a lovely stew. And honestly, if I miss it because of all this, you’re going to hear about it. Now, what do I have to do for these tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta, I appreciate you agreeing to the tests. I’ll write you a requisition for a CBC, stool test for occult blood, and iron levels. You can get those done at the lab just down the street. They don’t require any special preparation. Just a standard blood draw and a small stool sample. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to collect the sample. It should only take about 30 minutes, and then we’ll get the results back in a couple of days. In the meantime, I recommend temporarily stopping the red pills for arthritis, just to see if that makes a difference. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild stool softener to help with any discomfort. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Stool softener… well, that’s something, at least. Alright, fine. Stop the pills, do the tests, get the results. And I’ll take the stool softener. Honestly, the whole thing is just a nuisance. And you better call me with the results, not make me come back here. Harold can't drive. Now, where do I get this requisition? And how long will this stool sample business take? I really need to get home. That stew is not going to make itself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dawnetta. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they come in – no need to come back unless absolutely necessary. Here’s the requisition for the lab. The lab is just a five-minute walk down Elm Street, and the stool sample collection shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. They’ll give you a container and instructions. It’s best to collect the sample first thing in the morning for the most accurate results. Here’s the prescription for the stool softener as well. You can pick it up at your usual pharmacy. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s everything. Just… please call me with those results. And don't make me wait. I've got better things to do than sit around worrying about my stool. Honestly, the whole thing is just ridiculous. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to get going. Harold’s stew… and it’s probably getting cold by now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. You have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And enjoy the stew! .
