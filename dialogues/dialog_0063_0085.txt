DOCTOR: Good afternoon. Dr. Jules. So, Ms. Bartock, you’re here today… for what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s just… patchy. Not a nice color, really. It’s hard to explain, and frankly, I don't understand why it's happening. It's not like I spend all day out in the sun, you know.
DOCTOR: Patchy, you say. And not related to sun exposure, hmm?
PATIENT: No, definitely not the sun. I’m very careful. It’s… it’s more like… faded spots, almost. And some areas are a bit darker than others. It’s just… unsightly. Honestly, it’s probably nothing, but my husband insisted I get it checked. He worries too much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: “Unsightly” is… not a medical term, Ms. Bartock. But I understand your concern. When did you first notice these… faded spots, as you call them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… it was… probably around November, last year. Yes, November. After the first really hard frost, actually. I was putting up the holiday decorations and I just… noticed them in the bathroom mirror. It wasn't dramatic, just… different. I figured it was the winter, you know? Everything looks a bit pale in the winter. But it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: And has it been… progressing?
PATIENT: Progressing? Well, I suppose so. It hasn’t gotten worse quickly, but… there are more spots now, if that makes sense. And a couple of the darker patches seem a bit… bigger. I really don’t pay that much attention to these things, though. It's not like I’m constantly examining my skin. My husband is the one who keeps pointing it out. He has a very good eye for detail, which is… sometimes irritating.
DOCTOR: Right. And where on your body are these patches located?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly on my arms and chest, really. A few on my hands, but not many. And… well, a little bit on my face, but it's not terrible. It’s hard to cover with makeup, that’s the main thing. I wouldn’t say it’s noticeable noticeable, but… I notice it. And that’s what matters, isn’t it? I mean, what’s the point of worrying about something if it doesn’t bother you?
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with these areas?
PATIENT: No, none of that. It doesn't feel different at all, which is why I thought it was just… something temporary. It's purely a cosmetic issue, I assure you. Honestly, Dr. Jules, I'm starting to think my husband is making a mountain out of a molehill. He does get fixated on things sometimes. It’s… a character flaw.
DOCTOR: And do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… well, dust, I suppose. And certain flowers give me a bit of a sniffle. Nothing serious, though. I wouldn’t say I have any real allergies. Nothing that requires… an EpiPen or anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a farmer, you know. Very hardy woman. But I don't think that's relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Very low dose, the doctor said it was just preventative. And a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because… well, it’s winter, you know? Not much sun. Honestly, Dr. Jules, are we going to get to the point of this visit, or are we just going to discuss my entire medical history? I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ms. Bartock. It is necessary to gather information. Now, regarding your medical history… have you ever been diagnosed with any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Autoimmune conditions? Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve always been very healthy, as I said. My mother… well, she lived to be ninety, and she barely saw a doctor her entire life. We were a practical family. We didn't believe in fussing over every little ache and pain. Though… now that you mention it, my grandmother… on my father’s side… she had something with her joints, I think. Rheumatism, maybe? But that was a very long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention. Honestly, I doubt it's relevant. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look at the affected areas, then. Please, remove your sweater, Ms. Bartock. And perhaps a robe is available?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. I suppose I can do that. It’s a bit chilly in here, you know. I have a cardigan in the closet. Give me just a moment. And honestly, I hope this doesn't take too long. I really don’t like being examined. It’s… undignified.
DOCTOR: Please, lie back on the examination table. I need to examine your arms and chest, as you’ve described. I will need to visually inspect the areas. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright. But do be quick, please. And try not to… poke too much. It's very sensitive skin, you know. And really, if it's nothing, I'd prefer you just tell me that and be done with it. I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see the patchy discoloration on your arms… and chest, as you described. The areas are irregularly shaped, and the pigmentation varies. Not raised, no tenderness to the touch. There is some mild dryness noted. I'm also observing some subtle scaling on the elbows. It doesn't appear to be anything acutely concerning, but further investigation is warranted.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What does that mean? What kind of investigation? Are you thinking it’s… something serious? Because frankly, Dr. Jules, if it’s something I need to worry about, you should just say so. Don't beat around the bush. I detest ambiguity. Is it contagious? Will I need… tests?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, please remain calm. It is unlikely to be contagious. “Serious” is a subjective term. To determine the cause of the discoloration, I would like to order a skin biopsy. It’s a simple procedure – a small sample of skin is removed for analysis. It will allow us to rule out several possibilities, including, but not limited to, certain dermatological conditions and, in rare cases, cutaneous manifestations of systemic illness. We'll also take a complete blood count to assess your overall health. It's a standard procedure, Ms. Bartock, and I assure you, we are being thorough. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: A biopsy? You want to cut me? Absolutely not. That sounds barbaric. And a blood test… honestly. It’s just a bit of discoloration, Dr. Jules. My husband is clearly overreacting. I refuse. I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve told you. I do not consent to having perfectly good skin removed or my blood poked and prodded. Perhaps a second opinion is in order. I’m sure another doctor would agree this is unnecessary. I’m leaving now. I’ve wasted enough time on this already.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bartock. However, I must advise you that declining diagnostic testing is not recommended. Without a definitive diagnosis, we cannot rule out potential underlying conditions. I will document your refusal in your chart. If the discoloration worsens or you develop any new symptoms, such as itching, pain, or bleeding, please return immediately. I wish you good health. .
