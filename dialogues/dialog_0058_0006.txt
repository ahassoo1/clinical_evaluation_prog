DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… very nice to meet you. I have been… coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see someone. It’s not a lot of blood, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Coughing up blood, or hemoptysis as we call it, is definitely something we need to investigate. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hemop… what did you say? Sorry, my English is not so good. When did it start… hmm. Maybe about three days ago? It was just a little at first, and I thought it was maybe from a sore throat. But it’s happened again today, and… it seems more.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about the medical terms. It just means coughing up blood. Three days ago… and it’s increased since then. Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I am glad you said that. Hmm… describe it… It is… bright red. Not dark. And… it’s mixed with my mucus, I think that is the right word? It’s not… a lot, like I said. More like streaks. Not… a full cup or anything. Is that helpful? I am sorry if this is a silly question.
DOCTOR: It’s not a silly question at all. Bright red, mixed with mucus… that gives us some information. Have you been having any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little… tired, maybe? But I thought that was just because I have been busy at work. And… a small fever, I think. Nothing very high, I did not even take my temperature. Just… feeling warm. Oh! And maybe a little… ache in my chest when I cough. Not a bad ache, but… noticeable. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, slight fever, chest pain with the cough… yes, that’s all relevant. And where exactly in your chest are you feeling the pain?
PATIENT: It is… hard to say exactly. More on this side. <points to left side of chest> Not right in the middle, but… over here. It doesn’t hurt all the time, only when I cough hard. And it’s not… sharp pain. More like… a dull ache, like a bruise. Does that make sense? I am trying my best to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Dull ache on the left side with coughing. Now, have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had a small cold, maybe a month ago? But it was very mild. Just a little sniffle and a sore throat. Nothing serious. I did not even go to the doctor for it. I usually just rest and drink tea. I have been feeling healthy until… this cough started. Is it possible it is just a bad cold that is… lingering?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, but given the blood, we need to rule out other causes. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My husband… he used to smoke, but he passed away five years ago. He stopped before he got sick, thankfully. I do not like smoking at all. It is very bad for you.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, but that was many years ago. And… I have high blood pressure, but it is well controlled with medicine. I take it every day, and my doctor checks it regularly. Otherwise, I am usually very healthy. I try to eat well and exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it is called… Amlodipine. Yes, Amlodipine. Five milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for headaches, but not very often. Is that all you need to know about my medicine? I have a list at home, if you would like.
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine for now. Alright, Ms. Weichers, I’m going to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then I’d like to take a look at your throat. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. <sits up straighter on the examination table> That sounds good. I hope everything is alright. It is just… worrying, you know? I have never coughed up blood before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. <listens for a moment, then moves the stethoscope around to different areas of your back and chest> Your breathing sounds a little… wheezy. Not severely, but present. Oxygen saturation is 96%, which is acceptable. Now, open your mouth for me, please. <uses a tongue depressor to examine your throat> Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection.
PATIENT: Okay. Wheezy… that does not sound good, does it? I do not feel sick, though. Just… tired. And the cough, of course. Is it possible it is just… bronchitis? I have heard of that before. My neighbor had it last winter.
DOCTOR: Bronchitis is a possibility, but given the hemoptysis – the coughing up of blood – we need to rule out more serious causes. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The X-ray will help us see if there's anything going on in your lungs, and the blood work will give us a better idea of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye or iodine?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… iodine… hmm. I do not think so. I have had X-rays before, and nothing happened. But I have not had one in many years. I do not remember ever being asked about allergies. Is it something I should have been told about? I am not good with remembering medical things. <frowns slightly> I always forget what the doctors tell me.
DOCTOR: It's good to be cautious. We ask about allergies to ensure your safety. It's okay if you don't remember, that's why we ask. It's a standard precaution. For the X-ray, we will start with a plain film. If we need more detail, then we would consider contrast. But for now, just a regular X-ray. I'm going to have the nurse draw some blood. It will be a standard panel to check your white blood cell count and look for any signs of infection. Do you have any history of bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders… no. Not that I know of. My family… we do not have any problems with bleeding. I used to bruise easily when I was a child, but I think all girls do. I never had any trouble with cuts or injuries. Nothing like that. Is that helpful? <looks at doctor with a worried expression> I just want to know what is wrong. I do not like being sick.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Alright, Ms. Weichers. I've ordered the X-ray and blood work. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we'll get you over to radiology for the X-ray. We should have the results back within a few hours. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help ease your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I am a little worried, but I feel better knowing you are trying to find out what is wrong. A cough suppressant sounds good. Will it… hide the blood, or should I still try to collect it in a container? <frowns slightly, concerned>
DOCTOR: The cough suppressant will reduce the coughing, but it won’t hide any potential blood. If you cough up any more blood, please do try to collect it in a clean container, if possible. A small jar or plastic bag will do. That can be helpful for the lab. And please, if you experience any significant chest pain or shortness of breath, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll have the nurse give you a list of instructions. We'll discuss the results as soon as they're available. Do you need a work note for any missed time from work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a work note would be very helpful, thank you. I am a physical therapist, so I need to be able to stand and move around. If I am sick, I cannot do that. <sighs softly> I hope it is not too serious. I have patients waiting for me. I do not want to disappoint them. Thank you again, Doctor, for everything. <offers a small, polite smile>
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll have the nurse print that out for you with the instructions. We'll do our best to get you back on your feet as soon as possible. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be in shortly. <begins typing rapidly>
