DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… rather upsetting. I seem to be losing my sight and hearing. It just… happened. I don’t have time for this, you understand. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: "Happened," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, happened! As in, I woke up, and things weren’t… clear. Sounds were muffled. It wasn’t gradual, Doctor. It’s not as though I’ve been slowly going deaf and blind for years. It’s quite… sudden. I expect a prompt diagnosis and a solution. Do you understand? I haven’t got all day to sit here describing the nuances of my… deterioration.
DOCTOR: Right. Sudden onset, you said. And this happened… when exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… I’m not entirely certain. A few days ago, perhaps? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank. I have a great many responsibilities, and I don’t spend my time cataloging the precise moments of my… infirmities. Is that sufficient? I simply require it fixed.
DOCTOR: A few days ago… okay. And when you say “not clear” and “muffled,” can you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics. Must we? It’s like looking through… a dirty window, I suppose. Everything is hazy. And the sounds… distant. As if someone put cotton in my ears. It's terribly inconvenient, really. I was meant to be at a charity gala last night, and it was… difficult. I simply couldn't follow the conversation. It was dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the vision and hearing changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No, I don’t believe so. Perhaps a slight headache, but I often have headaches. Stress, you understand. A woman in my position… it’s relentless. No, I can’t say anything else has been particularly… alarming. Though I do feel rather… fatigued, now that you mention it. But that could simply be the lack of sleep, trying to manage everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Just a small dose of lorazepam, occasionally, for… nerves. And I think I’m allergic to penicillin, yes. Though it was years ago. A rash, I believe. Nothing serious. I trust you have that on file? I’ve been a patient of this practice for quite some time, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we do have penicillin allergy noted. And the lorazepam – how often do you take that, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, very infrequently. Only when absolutely necessary. A stressful board meeting, perhaps. Or a particularly… trying social engagement. Perhaps twice a month, at most. I assure you, Doctor, I’m not reliant on it. I simply prefer to be… composed. Is this truly relevant to my current… predicament?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a complete picture, Ms. Julie. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick examination. I'll check your vision and hearing, and perhaps take a look in your ears and eyes, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Honestly? I suppose it's unavoidable. Though I must warn you, I am rather sensitive. And I have a very important appointment this afternoon. Please be as quick as possible, Doctor. I haven’t got time for… prolonged procedures.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient as I can. Let’s start with your vision. Could you please follow my pen with your eyes?
PATIENT: Just get on with it, please. I really must be going soon. I have a board meeting, you know. Important people waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay. And with your left eye covered... can you read the letters on this chart, starting with the top row?
PATIENT: E… F… P… I believe that’s… T? Oh, this is terribly small. I haven’t had my glasses adjusted recently. Honestly, it’s a wonder I can see anything at all. Are you quite certain this is necessary? It's all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. And with your right eye covered… same thing. Read the letters starting with the top row. And don’t worry, it’s a standard part of the exam. We just need to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Honestly! This is… even worse. I can barely make out anything at all. This is ridiculous. It’s all a blur. I really must insist you expedite this process. I feel a headache coming on. And I haven't even had my coffee yet! I simply don’t have time for this charade. Are you absolutely certain you're qualified to be doing this?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand you are busy. However, your vision is significantly impaired in both eyes. Now, let’s move on to your hearing. I'm going to place these headphones over your ears, and you’ll tell me when you hear a tone. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But if this involves any unpleasant noises, I will be forced to leave. I have a very sensitive constitution, you understand. And I haven’t the patience for… theatrics. Get on with it, Doctor. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, tell me if you hear this tone… Any sound at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It’s just… silence. As I said, Doctor, my hearing is clearly deteriorating. Is this all there is to it? A few rudimentary tests? I expected a more… thorough examination. I’m quite concerned, you know. This is very unsettling. Are you certain this isn't something serious? I have a gala to attend next week, and I simply must be able to hear.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, based on the initial examination, you are experiencing significant vision and hearing loss in both eyes and ears. While it’s difficult to determine the exact cause without further testing, the sudden onset and severity of your symptoms are concerning. I recommend we schedule an MRI and a comprehensive audiological evaluation as soon as possible. We need to rule out any underlying neurological issues or other serious conditions. I'm also going to order a blood test to check for any inflammatory markers.
PATIENT: An MRI?! Blood tests?! Good heavens, this is dreadful. This is… completely unacceptable. I haven't got time for all of these… invasive procedures! I have a board meeting, a gala… my life! Are you certain this is necessary? Couldn't we just… try some stronger glasses? Perhaps some ear drops? I simply cannot be indisposed for… whatever amount of time this will require. This is… outrageous! .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your concerns, but dismissing these symptoms and hoping for a quick fix would be irresponsible. The sudden loss of both vision and hearing requires a thorough investigation. I am obligated to ensure you receive the appropriate care, and that includes ruling out serious conditions. I strongly advise you to schedule these tests as soon as possible. We can discuss options for managing your schedule, but your health is my primary concern. I can provide you with a referral to a neurologist and an audiologist. Would you like me to do that now?
