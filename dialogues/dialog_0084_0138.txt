DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I’m Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Let me see... well, it’s a bit hard to explain, to be honest. Things aren’t always so clear in my head these days. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about... weakness? And headaches. My family… we’ve had some trouble with bad headaches, over the years. It’s… it’s been a while, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani, that’s perfectly alright. We'll take it slow. Weakness and headaches… can you tell me a little more about the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… They’re not always there, you know? They come and go. When they do come, it’s usually a throbbing, right… right here, in my temple. Not like a sharp pain, more of a… a pressure. And sometimes I get a little nauseous with them. But honestly, it's been years since I had a really bad one. My mother… she used to get them something fierce, though. She’d have to lie down in a dark room for hours. Is that… is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And you mentioned weakness. Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the weakness… it’s funny, it’s not like I can’t do things. It’s just… sometimes my right side feels… heavy. Like it’s a little harder to lift my arm, or… sometimes my leg feels a bit clumsy. It doesn't happen all the time, though. Just… comes and goes. It was my daughter, she noticed it more than I did, I think. She said I was dragging my foot a little when I was walking. I didn't even realize it! I don't know… maybe it’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did you first start noticing this weakness and these headaches coming and going?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It’s… hard to say exactly. It’s been so long. The headaches, I suppose, on and off for… well, probably since I was a young woman. But the weakness… maybe a few months ago? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. My daughter said she started noticing it around springtime, maybe April or May? I really can't be sure. I've just been trying to take things easy, you know? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you having any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I can recall, no. I sleep alright, eat okay… maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? Oh! Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not like I'm going to fall, just a little… off balance. It doesn’t last long. And… oh, sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I have gotten new glasses recently. So I assumed it was just those. Is that… is that helpful? I’m sorry if I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, Ms. Tofani. You're doing fine. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions… Let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years? And I’ve always had a little bit of trouble with my blood pressure, but I take medicine for that. Just a little pill every day. And… oh, I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fine. My daughter handles most of my appointments and keeps track of everything, to be honest. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Oh dear, this is a mess! Just a minute… I think it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. One every morning, with my breakfast. And I take a little vitamin D, too, because the doctor said my levels were low. My daughter reminds me, of course. I would forget otherwise!
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily and Vitamin D. Good. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose with some pollen in the spring, but that’s just seasonal. I don’t have any trouble with food allergies. My daughter is very careful, she always checks everything before I eat it. She worries about me, bless her heart. I’m not allergic to any medications, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anyone in your family had any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Yes, there’s been a bit. My mother, like I said, she had terrible headaches. Migraines, they called them. And she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. My brother, he had… diabetes, I think? And my father… oh, he had some trouble with his legs, towards the end. He couldn't walk very well. And… My aunt, on my mother's side, she had a stroke, years ago. That’s why my daughter wanted me to come in, I think. She’s worried about me having a stroke, too. Is that… is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, Ms. Tofani, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. My daughter always tells me to listen to the doctors, she says they know best. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm not very good with… well, with anything complicated. But I’ll try my best. Is it going to be uncomfortable? I don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Ms. Tofani. Just some simple checks. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not overly concerning given your history. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Can you please relax your arms for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Relax my arms… I'm trying. I always get nervous when the doctors use those little hammers, you know? My mother used to say the same thing. Is everything alright? It feels… a little strange.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a bit diminished on the right side, and strength is slightly weaker compared to the left. Now, can you squeeze my fingers?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… squeezing fingers. Is that alright? Is it supposed to feel like this? My hand feels a bit… clumsy. It’s probably just old age, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani. Thank you. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I'd like to order a brain scan – an MRI – to get a better look at what’s going on. It will help us rule out any serious causes for your weakness and headaches. I'm also going to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any other potential issues. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, a brain scan? A scan… Is that serious, Doctor? What are you looking for? I don’t like the sound of that, honestly. And blood work… I always bruise so easily. Will it hurt? My daughter will be worried sick if I have to have a lot of tests. And what if… what if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. It’s natural to be anxious when we’re talking about tests like these. The scan is not necessarily an indication that something serious is wrong. It’s simply a way to get more information and rule out potential causes for your symptoms. We need to understand why you're experiencing weakness and headaches. The MRI is a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take pictures of your brain. It’s a bit noisy, but it doesn’t hurt. As for the blood work, we’ll only take a small amount of blood, and the discomfort is minimal. We’ll be as gentle as possible. Based on your history and the exam, we need to consider things like stroke, or potentially a transient ischemic attack – a TIA – which is like a mini-stroke. But it could also be something less serious. That's why we need the scan and blood work. I'll order both tests today. The radiology center will call you to schedule an appointment. I will also give you a referral. I want to emphasize that we are taking these steps to be thorough and to ensure you receive the best possible care. Do you have any other questions, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh… a TIA, you say? My aunt… she had a stroke, you know. It was very frightening. And I’ve been feeling a little off balance, like you said. I suppose it's better to know, even if it’s bad news. Will the scan tell us right away? And how long will it take? I have a luncheon with my friends next week, and I don’t want to miss it. I’m just… worried about upsetting my daughter. She worries so much about me.
DOCTOR: Yes, a TIA can present with symptoms similar to a stroke, and it’s important to rule that out. The radiology center will likely be able to schedule the scan within the next few days. They will let you know how long it will take—usually around 30-60 minutes. The results usually take a day or two to come back, and my office will contact you as soon as they are available. I understand your concern about upsetting your daughter. It might be helpful to let her know we are doing these tests to get a clear picture of what’s going on and to ensure you are healthy. We can discuss the results together when they come back, and I can help explain everything to her. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like sudden weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’m going to write you a referral for the scan and give you some information about TIAs. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… I'll let my daughter know. She’ll want to be there, I’m sure. And I'll remember to go to the emergency room if anything feels… different. I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. It’s nice to know someone is listening. I appreciate your help. Is there anything you need from me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Tofani. It was my pleasure. No, I don’t need anything further from you at this time. Just focus on taking things easy and remembering those warning signs. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call my office. We’re here to help. I’ll have my nurse give you a follow-up appointment to discuss the scan results once they’re available. Take care, Ms. Tofani. And please, don’t worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, a little. I appreciate that. I think I'll go home now and have a nice cup of tea. Goodbye to you.
