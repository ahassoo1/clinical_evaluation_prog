DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? They’re on my shins, and they’re really bothering me. They’re kinda red and… painful, especially when I’m working.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Bumps on your shins that are red and painful, particularly when you’re working. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed them?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe a couple of months ago, I guess? I didn't pay much attention at first, thought it was just a bruise or something from work. But they didn’t go away, and they just got more… noticeable, and more sore. My wife, Elena, she noticed it too, and told me I should get it checked. She worries a lot, that one.
DOCTOR: It's good Elena is looking out for you. It's always helpful to have someone else notice changes. A couple of months ago, starting as something you thought might be a bruise... and now they're more noticeable and sore. Can you describe what the bumps look like exactly?
PATIENT: Well, they’re kinda… roundish, you know? Not flat, they stick up a bit. And they’re red, like I said, and kinda hard. Not huge, maybe the size of a small coin, or a little bigger. There's more than one, maybe… six or seven of them on both shins. And they feel warm to the touch, sometimes. They don’t… leak or anything, just red and bumpy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Roundish, raised, about the size of a small coin, six or seven on both shins, red, warm to the touch, and no drainage. Do they itch at all?
PATIENT: No, they don't really itch. That's good, right? It’s mostly just the pain when I’m on my feet a lot. I do a lot of moving things around at work, you know, boxes and stuff. It hurts when my pants rub against them too. I try to wear long pants, but it gets really hot, especially this time of year.
DOCTOR: Okay, no itching, mostly pain with activity and friction. And you work with boxes, so a good amount of physical activity. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… when I sit down and rest them, it feels a little better. And when I put my feet up, that helps too. Elena sometimes rubs them with lotion, and that feels good for a little while. But it doesn’t really make them go away, you know? Just feels nice to have her rub them.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – rest and elevation help, and the lotion provides some temporary relief. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions, like diabetes, or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, well, let me see… I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. . I had the flu a couple times, like everyone, but nothing serious. I don't have diabetes, as far as I know. Elena keeps track of things like that, and she would have told me if I did. My blood pressure is sometimes a little high, the doctor told me a while back, but I don’t take any medicine for it. Just try to eat healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no diabetes, blood pressure sometimes a little elevated but not currently managed with medication. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. And I haven’t been in the hospital since I was a little boy, when I broke my arm falling out of a tree. That was a long time ago! I’ve always been careful, mostly. Elena always tells me to be careful too!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No surgeries or hospitalizations since childhood. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. Elena always tries new foods, and I haven’t had any reactions to anything. I don’t take any medicines regularly, so I haven’t really had to worry about allergies. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any regular medications. Let me ask about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings – have similar skin problems, or conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or circulation problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother, she had some problems with her legs when she got older, kinda like varicose veins, I think. Not exactly bumps, but swelling and stuff. My father, he had heart problems, and he had to watch his diet. My sister, she's healthy as a horse, always been active. I don’t remember anyone having bumps like this, though. Elena might know more, she remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had varicose veins, your father had heart problems, and your sister is healthy. No similar skin issues that you're aware of. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. Elena doesn’t like it, and I don't want to make her worry. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, especially on the weekends, but I stopped a few years ago. Doctor said it wasn't good for my blood pressure, so I cut back. Now I just drink water, mostly. Elena makes sure I stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and you've cut back on alcohol. That’s good. Finally, are you currently employed, and if so, what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m still working. I move things around at the warehouse, boxes, supplies, whatever needs to be moved. It’s pretty physical work, lots of walking and lifting. That's probably what's bothering my legs, I think. I've been doing it for a long time, though, and I haven’t had problems like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, physical work at a warehouse. Now, Mr. Aluia, I’d like to take a look at your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. They're probably just tired legs, but I want to make sure it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the bumps you're talking about. They are raised, red papules, approximately 0.5 to 1 centimeter in diameter, located on the anterior shins. They are tender to palpation, and the surrounding skin is warm. I don’t see any signs of drainage or ulceration. Pulses are strong and equal bilaterally. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, these bumps look consistent with shin splints, although they are somewhat atypical in their presentation. Shin splints usually occur after increased activity, and the pain is often more diffuse, not localized to these distinct papules. However, given your work, it's certainly possible. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a couple of tests. A complete blood count to check for signs of infection, and a D-dimer to rule out deep vein thrombosis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… shin splints, you say? I haven’t been doing anything different at work, but I guess it could be that. Tests sound good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure it’s nothing serious. A deep vein what-now? That sounds scary!
DOCTOR: It’s good we’re being thorough. A D-dimer is a blood test that helps rule out a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. It’s a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. It can be serious, which is why we want to check, but it’s also relatively uncommon. These bumps don’t have all the classic signs of a DVT, but it’s always best to be cautious. We’ll also do the complete blood count just to make sure there’s no underlying infection. I’ll write you a lab requisition now. You can go to the lab at [Name of local lab] – it’s just down the street. Once you’ve had the tests done, the results should be back in a couple of days. In the meantime, I recommend rest, ice, and elevation. Try to avoid activities that aggravate the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… rest, ice, elevation… ibuprofen. I can do that. So, not too much walking around at work? That’s gonna be hard, but I’ll try. [Name of local lab], you say? I think I know where that is. A couple of days, huh? That sounds good. No, I think I understand. Just take it easy, get the tests, and see what happens. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. I’ll have the nurse print out a sheet with instructions for rest, ice, and elevation, as well as information about ibuprofen dosage. Once the lab results are back, we’ll give you a call to discuss them and make a plan. If you experience any worsening pain, swelling, redness, or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. I appreciate your time and patience. I’ll go get the tests done tomorrow. And I’ll let you know if anything changes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
