DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Trestrail. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, doctor. Just… this pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. I don’t remember when it started, honestly. A while ago, I think. I just hoped it would go away.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A dull ache with deep breaths… Okay. And where exactly are you feeling this pain, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Somewhere… in here. Not right in the middle, more over to the side, I think. My left side. But it's hard to pinpoint. Old man problems, you know? Everything feels a little…fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to describe pain, especially when it's been going on for a while. So, left side of your chest, a dull ache that worsens with deep breaths. Does anything else make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I recall. Maybe… maybe when I lift heavy things at work? But I lift heavy things all the time. It’s hard to say if that makes it worse, or if it’s just…normal old man soreness. I don’t remember it hurting more than usual, you know? Everything’s a little blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it's not consistently worse with exertion. And does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Nothing really, doctor. I just… try not to think about it. If I sit still, it’s not so bad. But I gotta work, you know? Can't just sit still all day. Maybe resting helps a little, but not much. Honestly, I just figured it was something I'd have to live with.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… I get tired easily, but I’m eighty years old, doctor! That’s just getting old. I cough sometimes, but I always have, ever since I worked construction. Dust, you know? Nothing new. Oh, and… sometimes I feel a little… breathless. But that could be the stairs at home, too. They’re awful steep. I don’t know. Everything feels a little mixed up.
DOCTOR: Alright. You mentioned fatigue, a cough from past construction work, and some shortness of breath. Has the shortness of breath been getting worse recently, or is it fairly stable?
PATIENT: Stable, I think. It’s not… sudden. It just… happens when I climb the stairs, or walk uphill. It's been like that for a long time, honestly. I just figured it was my age. I don't know if it's worse now, or if I'm just more aware of it. Everything feels…slow these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago. I think… high blood pressure, maybe? The doctor told me something about that years ago. And arthritis, definitely. My joints ache something awful. But that's just old age, right? I don’t remember anything else… Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I had a lot of doctors back when I was younger, but I don't recall all the details.
DOCTOR: Right, high blood pressure and arthritis. Do you currently take any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Not anymore. I… I stopped taking them a long time ago. Too expensive, you know? And I didn't really feel much difference anyway. I just figured it was easier to manage on my own. I try to take it easy, and that's enough, I thought. It’s been a long time though. I don't even remember the names of the pills… It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long, long time ago. And… and maybe something on my knee, years ago? It was construction-related, I think. A bad fall. But it was so long ago, I don't remember much about it. It’s all a little fuzzy, you know? I've had a long life, and a lot of bumps and bruises along the way.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any heart problems or lung disease?
PATIENT: Heart problems… Lung disease… Oh dear. My mother… I think she had something with her heart. She got sick when I was still a boy. But we didn't have good doctors back then, you know? It was a long time ago. And my father… he worked in the fields, very dusty work. He coughed a lot when he got older. But I don’t know if it was anything serious. Everything was so different back then. We didn't talk much about illnesses. It was just… part of life.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a foolish habit. My wife, she didn't like it either. We both worked hard, construction work is dusty enough as it is. Didn't need to add more to our lungs, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright, doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have to get back to work this afternoon. This old body doesn't like being poked and prodded too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Ruocco… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Alright. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. Blood pressure is 150/90. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds on the lower right lobe, and a slight murmur. Your heart rate is a bit fast, 98 beats per minute. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Alright, Mr. Ruocco. I'm concerned about your blood pressure, and the sounds I'm hearing in your lungs and heart. Your symptoms - the chest pain, the shortness of breath, fatigue - combined with these findings… I think we need to get some further testing.
PATIENT: Further testing? What kind of testing, doctor? I don't like tests… they always take so long, and I have to keep missing work. Is it… is it something serious? I just thought it was old age, you know? I don’t want any fuss. I just want this pain to go away. What do you think it is?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concerns. It's difficult to say definitively what's causing your symptoms without more information. However, the combination of your symptoms and what I heard during the exam suggests we need to rule out some potential issues with your heart and lungs. I'm going to order a chest X-ray, an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out other problems. These tests will help us determine the cause of your pain and shortness of breath, and make sure we’re not missing anything serious. It could be something manageable, but it's important to be thorough, especially with your blood pressure being elevated. I'm also going to write you a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for a consultation. They can provide a more in-depth evaluation. I know tests can be a hassle, but it’s the best way to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A cardiologist…? That sounds…serious. Tests, a specialist… I don’t like this. I don’t have insurance, doctor. I can’t afford all this. And missing work… I need to work. How much will all this cost? And how long will it take? I just want to get back to normal. This is…overwhelming. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe some medicine to just… take the pain away?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concerns about the cost and missing work. It's completely reasonable to be worried about that. I’m going to be upfront: the costs will vary depending on the facility and the tests needed. I'll have the office staff work with you to find the most affordable options available, and see if there are any programs to assist with costs. We can also discuss payment plans. As for taking something just for the pain, I'm hesitant to do that without knowing the underlying cause. Masking the pain could delay diagnosis and potentially worsen the problem. While I wish I could just prescribe something to make it go away, it's important to address the root cause. I want to assure you, we'll do everything we can to get you the care you need, even without insurance. I’m also going to write a note to your employer explaining the medical necessity of these tests, and any potential time off. Let's start with the X-ray and EKG. Once we have those results, we'll have a better idea of what’s going on and can discuss the next steps with the cardiologist. The office will schedule those for you. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: I… I guess not. Just… get it over with, then. As quick as possible, please. I have to get back to work. And… thank you, doctor. For trying, at least. I just… hope it's not too bad. Let’s get the tests done. I suppose I don't have much choice.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. The office staff will schedule those tests for you right away. They will also provide you with information about costs and payment options, and a note for your employer. I know this is a lot to take in, and I appreciate your cooperation. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we'll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. We’ll take it one step at a time. .
