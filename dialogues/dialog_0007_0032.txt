DOCTOR: Hi Radford, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Hernandez, you say? A… a fine name. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing to discuss, frankly. An older man doesn’t often find himself needing… assistance in that department. It’s a… a leakage, you see. An unpleasant one. I haven’t… well, it’s been some time since I’ve had any… issues. My wife noticed it, naturally. Women notice everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Radford, no embarrassment at all. These things happen, and we're here to figure it out. So, you're experiencing some leakage?
PATIENT: Yes, leakage. A… a discharge, really. It’s not… copious, thankfully. More of a… a dampness. And… and it’s not entirely pleasant smelling, if I may be frank. I've been trying to keep things clean, of course. A man has some dignity, you know. Though it seems to be… persistent. It’s been perhaps… a week? Or maybe a little longer. Time does rather slip away at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week or so of dampness with some odor. That gives us a starting point. Is this something that happens constantly, or is it more intermittent?
PATIENT: Intermittent, I believe. Not… a constant flow, thankfully. It seems to happen… after I relieve myself, mostly. And… and sometimes just… randomly. There's no particular pattern I’ve been able to discern. I haven’t noticed any… pain, thankfully. Just the… unpleasantness. And my wife's concerned looks, naturally. She fusses so.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's related to urination mostly, but sometimes happens at other times. No pain, just the discharge and your wife’s concern. Have you noticed any changes in your urination itself?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. It doesn’t… burn, no. And the flow itself seems… normal, I suppose. Not weaker, not stronger. Although… perhaps I have to go more often. Yes, that’s it! More frequent trips to the… facilities. Yes, that’s been happening. I hadn't consciously noticed, you understand. My wife pointed it out. She keeps track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency of urination along with the leakage. Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And certainly no chills. Back pain… well, I have the usual aches and pains of an old man, you understand. But nothing… new. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just the normal creaks and groans. My wife gives me liniment for it, you know. A lovely woman, but she does fuss. I don't believe I have been feeling unwell in any other way. Just this… rather embarrassing issue.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no chills, no new back pain, just the increased frequency and the discharge. Have you ever had any problems with urinary infections before?
PATIENT: Urinary… infections? Hmm. That’s a… a good question. I’ve lived a long life, you understand. Seen a fair number of doctors. I recall… something about a prostate issue, many years ago. Perhaps thirty years? They gave me pills for it. Something about being… enlarged. But an infection specifically… I honestly don’t recall. It was so long ago. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of prostate issues about 30 years ago. That's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history a bit more generally. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking about things I haven’t thought about in years. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, I believe so. The doctor put me on pills for that, too. Years ago. And… and something about cholesterol. High cholesterol, I think. Again, pills. I take a number of pills these days, you know. It’s all a bit of a blur. Diabetes… I don’t think so. My wife handles most of the medication details. She’s very organized. I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both managed with medication. No known diabetes. And your wife helps manage your medications. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another good question. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a… a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. A bit of a runny nose sometimes, with certain pollens, but nothing serious. And I don’t recall any… drug allergies specifically. The doctor always asks, of course, and I always say no. But my memory… well, you know how it is. I’ve never been one for keeping track of such things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, and if so, can you tell me what they are?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a difficult question. I take so many pills… Let me see… There’s one for the blood pressure, a small white one. And another for the cholesterol, a yellow one, I believe. And… and something for my arthritis, a pink one. Oh, and a daily vitamin. My wife keeps them all organized in these little… compartments. I just take what she gives me. I honestly couldn’t tell you the names of them. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, cholesterol medication, arthritis medication, and a daily vitamin. We'll try to get a more accurate list from your pharmacy. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would. An old man’s bones aren’t what they used to be, you know. And please, try not to take too long. I have a luncheon appointment later this afternoon. With my wife’s bridge club. A very… lively group of women.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I'll be as gentle as possible. And I'll try to be quick. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick genital exam to assess the source of the leakage. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you're uncomfortable at any time. We'll need you to lie down on the examination table for this part. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh. That part… Well, I suppose it’s necessary. But… must it be so thorough? I’m an old man, Doctor. There's not much to see, I assure you. Still, if you insist. Yes, alright. Let’s get it over with. But please, do be quick. And discreet. I would rather not… relive any youthful embarrassments. My wife needn't hear about this, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as quick and discreet as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. Alright, Radford. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, which is common for men your age. I didn’t feel any obvious masses or tenderness. The urethra looks normal, but I do notice a small amount of discharge. This is consistent with what you've described. Based on my exam, it's likely that this leakage is related to an enlarged prostate, possibly with some inflammation. However, to rule out an infection, I’d like to order a urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An enlarged prostate… yes, that sounds about right. The doctor mentioned something about that years ago. So, it’s not… anything serious? Just old age? That’s… reassuring. A urine test, you say? Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright. Anything to put my mind at ease. Although… must it be such a… thorough specimen? I've always been a bit self-conscious about such things.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily anything serious, Radford. An enlarged prostate is very common as men age. The urine test will help us rule out an infection, which can cause similar symptoms. It will involve providing a sample, and we'll give you instructions to ensure it’s a clean catch. It’s a routine procedure, and nothing to be embarrassed about. I’ll have the nurse come in to collect a sample once we're done here. While we wait for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to help flush things out. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications that might help manage the symptoms. If the urine test is negative, we can consider medication options to help shrink the prostate. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. More fluids, you say? I suppose I could drink a bit more water. My wife always tells me to stay hydrated. And… lifestyle modifications? What sort of things did you have in mind? I enjoy a good afternoon nap, if that counts. As for medication… well, I prefer to avoid pills if possible. But if it’s necessary… I suppose I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… keep it to a minimum, if you would. And please, explain everything thoroughly. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll explain everything thoroughly. Lifestyle modifications can include things like avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder. We also recommend regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight. We’ll start with the least invasive options first. Let's get that urine sample collected, and then we'll see what the results show. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very… thorough, Doctor. And reassuring. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results now. Although… I do have one small question. Will this… leakage… be permanent? Is this something I’ll have to live with for the rest of my days? My wife… she's very understanding, but… it’s not something either of us particularly enjoys.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Radford. It's difficult to say definitively without the urine test results. However, even if it is related to an enlarged prostate, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will be permanent. Medication can often help manage the symptoms and significantly reduce or even eliminate the leakage. There are also other treatment options available if medication isn’t effective. We’ll work together to find the best solution for you. And even if it becomes a long-term management issue, there are products available – like absorbent pads – that can help make it more manageable and maintain your quality of life. We'll discuss all your options once we have the test results. The nurse should be with you shortly. Do you need assistance getting off the table?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I believe I can manage. I’m not completely helpless, you know. Absorbent pads… well, that’s not exactly what I had in mind, but… if it comes to that, I suppose I’ll have to consider it. My wife will likely have a field day picking out the most comfortable ones. Still… I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. And your reassurance. Perhaps this isn’t the end of the world after all. Now, let’s get this test over with. I have a luncheon to attend, you know. With the bridge club. A very… discerning group of women.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Radford. We'll get through this together. And I'm sure you'll be just fine at your luncheon. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the sample. If you need anything at all, don’t hesitate to ask. In the meantime, I'll step out and review your chart again while you take care of that. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in.
