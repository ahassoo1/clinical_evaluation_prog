DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Bacy, you said? Yes, nice to meet you as well. Oh, goodness... well, my wife, she mostly handles these things, but… something about papers? For… time off, maybe? I’m a bit fuzzy on the details, to be honest. It has to do with my work, at the church. I think it's for… leave? Or help with things if I… can’t work as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like you might need some documentation related to your work at the church. We can definitely help with that. Just to clarify, is this related to a recent change in your health, or is it more of a preventative measure?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my back’s been bothering me a bit lately, you see. It comes and goes. Nothing terrible, but… lifting things is harder now, and standing for long periods… that’s not easy either. It’s been worse the last few weeks, I think. My wife said something about needing the papers just in case it gets worse. So, maybe… both? A little preventative, and a little… because of the back. Is that clear? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly clear, Mr. Limtiaco. No need to apologize at all. It sounds like you’re experiencing some back pain that’s been gradually worsening, and your wife is proactively getting documentation in case you need accommodations at work. Let’s talk a little more about this back pain. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, mostly in the lower back. Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but not always. It's worse when I've been on my feet all day, or if I try to lift something heavy. Sitting for too long isn't good either, actually. It gets stiff then. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? Not debilitating, but… noticeable. It’s been building up for a while, I guess. I haven't really done anything about it, to be honest. Just tried to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache in your lower back that sometimes radiates down your leg, worsened by standing, sitting, and lifting. It sounds like it’s been a gradual onset. Have you noticed anything specific that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… lying down helps, definitely. Especially on my side with a pillow between my knees. And… warm baths, maybe? They soothe it a bit. My wife sometimes rubs my back, and that feels good for a little while, but it doesn’t last. Honestly, nothing really makes it go away completely. Just… lessens it for a bit. It's usually better in the morning, but then it starts up again as the day goes on. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lying down, a pillow between your knees, and warm baths provide some relief, but it’s temporary. It’s better in the morning and worsens throughout the day. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling… let me see… I think sometimes my feet feel a little… cold, maybe? Not always, and it doesn't really feel like pins and needles or anything. Just… not as warm as they should be. It's hard to say for sure. I mostly just notice it when my wife points it out. She's very observant, that one. I haven’t really paid much attention to it, to be honest. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Mr. Limtiaco. Changes in temperature or sensation can be helpful information. And your wife’s observation is very valuable. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've been generally healthy, thankfully. A few colds here and there, of course, but nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago, and it didn't cause any trouble since. I don't take any regular medications, either. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, when my back really flares up. Oh, and I had a bit of a knee injury when I was younger, playing rugby, but it healed up fine. It doesn't bother me anymore. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Limtiaco, this is all very helpful. No chronic conditions, gallbladder removed years ago, occasional over-the-counter pain relievers, and a previous knee injury that's healed. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm… Not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife always asks, but I usually tell her no. I don’t really get sick enough to take much medication, you see. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's briefly talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as back problems, arthritis, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had arthritis in her hands when she got older, I think. And my grandfather… he had some trouble with his back, I remember that. He was a fisherman, always lifting heavy nets. But other than that… not really. My father was healthy as a horse, and my sister… she’s doing well too, as far as I know. It’s hard to say, really. We weren’t very good at keeping track of things like that. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Arthritis in your mother and some back problems in your grandfather are helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, years ago, but my wife convinced me to stop. Better for my health, she said. And I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and… well, let's just say I'm a church director. I keep pretty busy with work and family, that’s enough excitement for me. No, no bad habits, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Limtiaco. Very good. Alright, now I'd like to do a quick physical examination. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if I’m making it difficult. I’m not as nimble as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take your time, and let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. I'm going to gently palpate your back to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. Okay, does this feel tender anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, right there. A little bit. Not a sharp pain, but… yeah, that’s a bit sensitive. Right about… there. It’s been bothering me a bit more lately. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. I’m noting tenderness in the lower lumbar region. Now, I'm going to have you gently bend forward, backward, and to each side. Just move as comfortably as you can, and stop if you feel any pain. Okay, go ahead when you're ready.
PATIENT: Oof… that’s a little stiff. It’s hard to get down very far. Feels… tight. And bending backwards… That’s even harder. Not much range of motion there. It’s… not comfortable, Doctor. Sorry. The sides aren’t much better. It's just… tight all over.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. I appreciate you letting me know what you're feeling. I’m noting limited range of motion in all directions with discomfort. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. This will help me assess your nerve function. And can you feel this when I touch your legs?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, I felt that. A little… startling, but yes. Yes, I can feel that too. It feels… normal. Not numb or anything. Everything feels okay down there. Just a little… achy, sometimes. But that’s been happening for a while. Is everything okay? You seem very serious.
DOCTOR: Everything is okay, Mr. Limtiaco. I just need to be thorough. Your reflexes are present and sensation is intact. Based on the examination and your history, it appears you are experiencing lower back pain likely due to muscle strain or age-related changes in your spine. However, given the limited range of motion and persistent discomfort, I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any underlying structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it's best, Doctor, then yes. I don't want anything serious to be missed. Will it… be uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I have a meeting at the church this afternoon, so I hope it won't take too long. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's been bothering me for a while now.
DOCTOR: It won't be uncomfortable at all, Mr. Limtiaco. You'll simply stand or lie down while a technician takes a few images of your back. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. The results will be sent to me, and I’ll review them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities. You can also try applying ice or heat to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the pain. Would you like me to write you a prescription for something stronger, if the over-the-counter medications aren't effective?
PATIENT: No, no, I think the over-the-counter stuff is fine for now. I don't want anything stronger unless it’s absolutely necessary. My wife always says I worry too much about medication. Ice or heat… yes, I can try that. And avoid lifting… I’ll have to ask the young men at the church for help with the heavier stuff. About the paperwork… the FMLA or disability thing? Will the X-ray delay that? I need to get that to the church as soon as possible. They’re very understanding, but… still.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We can definitely work on the paperwork while we wait for the X-ray results. It shouldn’t delay things significantly. I can start filling out the necessary forms based on your current symptoms and limitations. We’ll just need to add the X-ray results once they're available. I'll also include a note recommending temporary accommodations at work, such as avoiding heavy lifting and allowing for frequent breaks. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wonderful, Doctor. Temporary accommodations… that's perfect. Avoiding heavy lifting is a good start. Frequent breaks too… that would be very helpful. You're a lifesaver, you know. My wife will be so relieved. She worries about me constantly. So, you're going to start the paperwork now? And I just need to go get the X-ray done? Where is that, by the way? Is it far?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll start the paperwork now. It will take me a few minutes. The X-ray facility is right across the hall, in Suite 205. The technician is expecting you. It's a very quick procedure, and they'll be happy to answer any questions you have. While I'm doing this, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate it. Just… one thing. Will this… is this something serious? I mean, is it something I should be really worried about? I know you said muscle strain, but… my grandfather had back problems, and… well, I don't want it to be something like that. Is it something that will get worse?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Limtiaco, and I appreciate you asking. While it's impossible to say definitively without the X-ray results, the initial examination doesn't suggest anything particularly serious. The most likely scenario is a muscle strain or age-related changes in your spine. However, the X-ray will help us rule out any underlying structural issues, such as a fracture or arthritis. It's unlikely to get significantly worse if you avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities, and we can manage the pain with over-the-counter medications and gentle stretching. If the pain does worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in your legs, it’s important to let me know immediately. We're taking all the necessary steps to get a clear understanding of what's going on, and I'll be with you every step of the way. Do you feel any better knowing that we are working toward a solution?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I do. That's very reassuring, Doctor. Knowing that we're checking everything, and that you'll be with me… that makes a big difference. My wife is always telling me to get things checked out, and… well, I should listen to her more. So, the paperwork… it will be ready soon? And then I just go across the hall for the X-ray? I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Yes, the paperwork is almost ready. Just a few more details, and then it’s yours. And yes, after that, you can head across the hall for the X-ray. It should only take a few minutes. Here you go. This is the FMLA request form, and this is a note outlining your limitations and recommending temporary accommodations at work. Please review it carefully, and let me know if you have any questions. And remember, if anything changes or you experience any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to contact me. We’re here to help. Now, go get that X-ray done, and we'll go from there. Do you need assistance getting up?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This looks… very official. My wife will be so relieved to see this. No, I think I can manage. Just a little stiff, but I’ll be alright. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. You’ve been wonderful. I really appreciate your help. I’ll go get the X-ray done now. And I’ll let you know if anything changes. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
