DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Londell. Well, I’m gettin’ on in years, and my son, bless his heart, thought I oughta see if there’s things I could be doin’ to, you know, keep things runnin’ smooth. Men’s health optimization, he called it. I mostly just want to feel as good as I can for as long as I can, I reckon.
DOCTOR: “Optimization,” right. Well, we can certainly discuss that. It sounds like you’re interested in a general check-up and perhaps some preventative measures. Let’s start with the basics. Any specific complaints at the moment?
PATIENT: Not really complaints, no. Just…tired more often than I used to be, I suppose. And maybe not as sharp as I once was, if you know what I mean. Little things, mostly. I forget where I put my tools sometimes, which is new. But nothing that keeps me from workin’, thankfully. I still do a good bit of etchings. Keeps the hands busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Etchings…right. And how long has this fatigue and… diminished recall been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, I’d say… maybe six months or so? It came on gradual, not all at once. Like a slow leak, instead of a burst pipe. The forgetfulness is the newest part, really. It started maybe a month ago. I used to be able to remember every detail of a piece, every line I cut… now I gotta jot things down sometimes. It's a little unnervin', to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… nothin’ major, no. My sleep’s been a little… fitful, sometimes. Wake up a couple of times a night, gotta use the bathroom. Old age, I figure. And… well, my appetite ain’t what it used to be, but I’m eatin’ enough. Mostly just don’t crave things like I used to. Used to love a good steak, now it just… doesn’t appeal much. Could be the summer heat, too.
DOCTOR: Sleep disturbances and a decreased appetite… commonplace at your age, Mr. Kammann. We'll note it. Do you have any history of… significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had my share of the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. And a broken arm when I was a boy, climbin' a tree. But nothin' serious. Later in life… I had high blood pressure for a while, they put me on somethin' for it, but I got it under control with diet and exercise. Doctor said I was a good patient. My wife, God rest her soul, always kept me in line. She made sure I ate right and got my walks in. She passed away about five years ago, now. It's been quiet since then.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: Let me see… just a tonsillectomy when I was a kid. And… oh, I had my appendix out when I was about twenty. That was a bad one, but I recovered just fine. Nothing since then, thankfully. I always figured it was best to avoid knives if I could. Seems like I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother lived to be eighty-eight, but she had a lot of arthritis in her later years. My father… he died pretty young, heart attack, when I was just a teenager. And my brother… he had diabetes, type two, but he didn't take care of himself. Smoked like a chimney, drank too much. I always tried to live a healthier life than he did. Learned somethin' from that, I reckon.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, never have. Not a drop of alcohol, not a puff of tobacco, and definitely nothin' else. Always thought it was a waste of time and money. Besides, my wife wouldn’t have allowed it. She had a strong constitution, both physically and morally. I try to honor that, still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I’m aware of. I've had doctors poke and prod at me enough times over the years, and nothin’ ever flared up. Sometimes get a little itchy after a bee sting, but that’s about it. Mostly just try to avoid the bees altogether. They don’t seem to care much for etchings, thankfully.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, mostly. Doc suggested it a few years back, said it couldn’t hurt. And I take a little fish oil sometimes, for my joints. Arthritis is startin' to creep in, you know? Nothin' else. I prefer to keep things natural if I can. My wife always made me herbal teas for everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammann. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… standard procedure. Then we’ll discuss some basic blood work to rule out anything obvious. Sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to cooperate. I trust your judgment. Go ahead whenever you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning given your age and recent stress. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Overall, physical exam is unremarkable. We’ll need some blood work to get a more complete picture. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. That should give us a good starting point.
PATIENT: Sounds sensible, Doctor. Those all sound… thorough. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood work? Fast overnight or somethin'? And how long will it take to get the results back? I'm not in any hurry, but I'd like to know what we're lookin' at, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except water. The lab will give you specific instructions. Results typically take 3-5 business days, but it depends on the lab’s workload. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, continue with your healthy lifestyle. That’s the most important thing.
PATIENT: Alright, 12 hour fast. Water’s fine. I can manage that. And three to five days… that sounds reasonable. I appreciate you explainin’ it all so clearly, Doctor. I reckon I’ll go home and make a pot of tea, then. And try not to worry too much. Is there anything else I should be doin' before the follow-up, or am I just waitin' on the results?
DOCTOR: No, just wait for the results. And try to get some rest. Stress isn't helpful. I'll have the lab send the results directly to the clinic. We'll contact you to schedule a follow-up. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I think you’ve covered everything. I appreciate your time, Doctor Dechene. I’ll go get that tea now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Kammann.
