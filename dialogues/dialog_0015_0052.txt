DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this nausea, see. Been happening most mornings now, for a couple o’ weeks. It’s… well, it’s not pleasant. And the nurse mentioned somethin’ about my heart when I was fillin’ out the forms? It’s a bit worryin’, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see a note regarding a previous cardiology consult. We’ll certainly get to that. Let's focus on this nausea for now. Could you describe it in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Aye, right enough. Well, it’s not like a proper sickness, if that makes sense. It’s not… violent, ye ken? More like a queasiness, a rollin’ in the stomach. It usually starts soon after I wake up, before I’ve even had a chance to get a bit o’ breakfast. Doesn’t always stay all day, mind you. Sometimes it’ll pass after an hour or so, other times it lingers ‘til lunchtime. And it's not linked to anythin’ I've eaten, as far as I can tell. I’ve tried keepin’ a note o’ things, but it happens with everything, really.
DOCTOR: So, it’s a queasiness, predominantly in the mornings, occurring before breakfast, and doesn't seem to be triggered by specific foods. Does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, to be truthful. A wee bit o’ ginger ale sometimes helps settle it, maybe take the edge off. But it’s not a cure, not by a long shot. Mostly, I just… try to ride it out. And hope it doesn't last too long. I’ve been drinkin’ plenty o’ fluids, just in case. I’m not sure if that’s helpin’ or not, mind you. I just… feel a bit helpless, really. It’s just a constant worry, knowin’ it’s comin’ every mornin’.
DOCTOR: Ginger ale… alright. And you mentioned the nurse noted something about your heart. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside this nausea – perhaps dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it… I have been a bit more breathless than usual, especially if I’m walkin’ up the hill to the shops. It's not terrible, just… noticeable. I put it down to gettin’ older, to be fair. And my ankles… they’ve been a bit swollen in the evenings. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest. We’ve had a warm spell lately. Palpitations, no, not really. Chest pain, no, thankfully. Just the breathlessness and the swollen ankles, really. It's all a bit… unsettling. I haven’t told anyone, just keepin’ it to myself. It's probably nothin’, mind you. Old age catchin’ up with me, I expect.
DOCTOR: I see. Breathlessness and ankle swelling are concerning, particularly in conjunction with a previous cardiology consult. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible. Whatever ye think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. It’s just… I worry a bit, ye ken? My mother, she had a bad heart. I always figured I might end up the same way. But I'm tryin' not to dwell on it. Do with me as ye will. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your blood pressure and feel your ankles to assess the swelling. And, if you don't mind, I'll need to take a quick look at your abdomen as well.
PATIENT: Right then. . Away we go. It’s a bit cold on this paper, mind you. But I suppose it’s for the best. Just let me know if I need to move or anything. I'm not the most flexible these days, so be gentle, eh?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a bit elevated: 148/92. Heart sounds… slightly muffled, and I do detect a bit of a rhythm irregularity. Lungs are clear, though. Ankle edema is present bilaterally, grade 2+. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No palpable masses. Alright, Mr. Benic. Findings are a bit concerning. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Aye, well, that doesn't sound too cheerful, does it? Tests, eh? I was hopin’ it would be somethin’ simple. But I suppose it's best to be thorough. What sort o’ tests are those, exactly? Just so I know what to expect. And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got a book club meetin’ next week, and I wouldn't want to miss it. A wee bit o’ escapism is good for the soul, ye ken?
DOCTOR: A complete blood count checks your red and white blood cell levels, looking for signs of infection or anemia. The comprehensive metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. The EKG records the electrical activity of your heart, to identify any arrhythmias. And the chest X-ray will give us a look at your lungs and heart size. As for timing, the lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. The X-ray report will likely take a bit longer, perhaps 3-5 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Aye, right enough. Sounds complicated, all o’ it. I appreciate ye explainin’ it, Doctor. I'm not much of a medical man, ye see. As for medications… just a wee bit o’ paracetamol now and then for aches and pains, nothing regular. And no allergies, thankfully. I'm quite a hardy soul, usually. Though this nausea is knockin’ me for six, to be fair. I’ve always been lucky with my health, up until now, that is. I’m hopin’ it's just a temporary blip. A bit o’ old age, maybe? But I’m glad we’re gettin’ it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with the tests as ordered. And while I appreciate your optimism, Mr. Benic, dismissing these symptoms as “old age” would be irresponsible. We need to rule out any serious underlying causes. I’m also going to order a BNP test. It measures a hormone released by the heart when it’s under stress. That will give us additional insight into your cardiac function. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood and schedule the X-ray. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: A BNP test, ye say? More tests, aye? It’s a bit overwhelmin’, to be honest. I'm not worried, exactly, but… it's a lot to take in. Well… just one thing. Will these tests interfere with my book club meetin’? It’s next Wednesday, and I promised to bring the biscuits. It's a very important meetin’, ye see. We’re discussin’ a particularly scandalous novel. I suppose a bit o’ scandal is good for the soul, too. But I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Benic, with all due respect, your book club meeting is hardly my primary concern at this moment. However, the blood draw should only take a few minutes and won’t interfere with your schedule. The X-ray will require a slightly longer appointment, but we can try to accommodate your Wednesday availability. I will speak with the radiology department to see if they can fit you in. I strongly advise you to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the test results. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Aye, right enough. Ye're quite right, Doctor. My book club can wait. I was just… tryin' to keep things normal, ye see. It’s a habit, I suppose. I understand. No strenuous activity, and straight to the emergency room if I feel poorly. I’ll remember that. And I won’t bother ye about the biscuits. Thank ye, Doctor. For bein’ blunt, and for lookin’ after me. I appreciate it, even if ye are dismissin’ my social life. I suppose it’s best to be safe than sorry. I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Let me know if there’s anything else I need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. And Mr. Benic, please understand that my priority is your health, not your leisure activities. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. And for future reference, attempting to self-diagnose or minimize potential health concerns is rarely a productive course of action.
PATIENT: .
