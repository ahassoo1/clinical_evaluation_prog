DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, good morning. My name is Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Honestly, it’s a bit silly, really. I just… well, I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. My daughter thinks I’m being foolish, but a nice word from a doctor would mean something, don’t you think? It’s just… things haven't been easy lately.
DOCTOR: Well, that's certainly a first, but not silly at all! I'm happy to write you a card, Janeth. It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and sometimes a little encouragement can make a big difference. Before I do that, though – and just to make sure everything is okay – would you mind telling me a little bit about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… everything. My husband, he’s been… difficult. More difficult than usual. Always complaining. And the garden isn’t doing well, even though I spend hours out there. The tomatoes are all blighted. It’s just… a lot. I don’t have anything physically wrong, you understand. My daughter insisted I see you, said I was “down” and needed a check-up. Honestly, I think she just wanted to get me out of the house. But if you must know… I haven’t been sleeping very well. That's about it, really. Do you need to write all that down? It sounds rather pathetic when you say it out loud.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound pathetic at all, Janeth. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of stress, and that can absolutely affect how you feel, both physically and emotionally. And yes, I'm making a few notes – just to have a complete picture, you know?
PATIENT: Stress. That's what she said too, my daughter. Always with the labels. Is that what this is, then? Just… stress? It feels like more than that. It feels like… everything is just getting harder. Even simple things. Do you think it could be… my age? Maybe I’m just… losing my spark. Honestly, I don’t know. It’s probably nothing, really. Just write the card, alright? A nice, cheerful card. Something about… perseverance, maybe? Or finding joy in small things?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to wonder if things are related to age, or just a particularly difficult patch. And it’s good you’re aware of how you're feeling. Before I write that card – and I absolutely will – let me just ask a few quick questions, just to be thorough. It won’t be a long exam, I promise. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm… not really. I still eat, you know. I make sure to cook a proper meal for my husband, even if he complains about it. But I don’t always feel hungry. Sometimes I just… pick at things. I used to enjoy a good mango lassi, but lately… it just doesn’t taste the same. It feels like… everything tastes a bit flat, if that makes sense. And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. But it's probably just the stress, like you said. Honestly, I wouldn’t even have noticed if my daughter hadn’t pointed it out. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Changes in appetite and taste, and some unintentional weight loss… those can be related to stress, definitely. But they can also sometimes indicate other things, so it’s good we're talking about it. Just to get a better picture, have you been feeling tired or fatigued lately, even after getting enough sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, tired. Yes. Constantly. I used to be able to work in the garden all day and still have energy to cook a nice dinner. Now, I feel exhausted after just a few hours. And even when I do manage to get a good night's sleep – which isn't often, thanks to my husband’s snoring – I wake up feeling… drained. It’s a heavy tiredness, you know? Not just physical, but… in my bones. Like all the energy has been sucked out of me. And I’m irritable. Very irritable. My daughter says I’m “short-tempered,” but honestly, she’s very demanding. Always wanting me to do things her way. It’s exhausting, just thinking about it. Honestly, I just want to sit in the garden and read a book, but I don’t even have the energy for that anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Janeth. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing quite a bit of difficulty, and it’s good you came in to talk about it. It sounds like more than just stress, though stress is certainly playing a part. Just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a personal question, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. Things haven’t been… regular, let’s put it that way. More… constipated, mostly. I used to have a good routine, you know, with the garden and everything. But lately… it’s just been difficult. I’ve tried drinking more water, like my daughter suggested, but it doesn’t seem to help much. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a bit nauseous in the mornings, but it passes quickly. It’s probably nothing, honestly. Just… old age catching up with me, I suppose. Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with the card. Can we just get to that now? I'm sure a nice, cheerful card will lift my spirits. Something about the resilience of flowers, perhaps? Or the beauty of a sunrise?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort with these questions, Janeth. And you're right, it may seem unrelated to the card, but these details help me get a complete picture of what’s going on so I can provide the best possible care. Changes in bowel habits and occasional nausea… those are also things we need to consider. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. I didn’t realize it would come to this. Honestly, I just wanted a card. My daughter is going to be insufferable if she finds out I let you poke and prod me. What will you even do? I don’t like the sound of this at all. I thought doctors were supposed to listen, not… examine. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. Can’t you just write the card and be done with it? I promise I’m not contagious. It’s all just… stress, like you said. I feel perfectly fine, physically. A little tired, maybe, but that’s all. Honestly, I think this is all a waste of time. Perhaps I should just go home and have a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Janeth. And I apologize if I’m making you uncomfortable. I promise, it will be a very quick and gentle exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief abdominal exam. It will help me rule out anything that might be causing your symptoms and ensure we’re on the right track. I wouldn’t suggest anything that wasn’t necessary, and I truly believe getting a clearer picture will help me determine the best way to support you, even if it turns out to be just stress management. If you're truly uncomfortable, we don't have to do the exam. But I would strongly recommend it, just for peace of mind. It will also allow me to write a more informed note on the card, and perhaps suggest some helpful resources. What do you say?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You’re very persuasive, aren’t you? And you’re right, I suppose peace of mind would be nice. And a more informed note would be thoughtful. My daughter would be so pleased. But promise me, promise me it will be quick. And gentle. I don’t want any surprises. And no cold instruments, alright? I hate cold instruments. And no needles! Absolutely no needles. I faint at the sight of needles. Alright, fine. You can listen to my heart and lungs. And check my blood pressure. But only a brief abdominal exam, alright? And please be gentle. And quick. Very quick. And tell me what you’re doing beforehand. I don’t like surprises. Honestly, I’m already regretting this. But alright, go ahead. But be gentle, alright? Very, very gentle.
DOCTOR: I promise, Janeth. Very gentle and quick. And I will explain everything before I do it. No surprises, absolutely no cold instruments, and definitely no needles. First, let’s take your blood pressure. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will squeeze for a moment, then release. It doesn't hurt at all. Okay, just relax your arm for me…
PATIENT: Alright. Relax… easier said than done, honestly. My arm feels a bit cold already. And that cuff is awfully tight, isn't it? I hope it doesn’t cut off my circulation. My daughter will have my hide if I get a purple arm from this. And what exactly are you looking for? What does a “normal” blood pressure even feel like? Is it different for old people? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit anxious again. Just hurry up, alright? The quicker this is over, the better. And please tell me what you find. Is it good? Is it bad? Don’t be vague, alright? I hate vague answers. Just tell me straight, what does it mean?
DOCTOR: It is a little tight, I apologize. It needs to be snug to get an accurate reading, but it won't cut off your circulation. It’ll only be for a moment. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. For someone your age, that's a little elevated, but not drastically so. It’s something we should monitor, and there are things we can do to help lower it. It could be related to the stress you're experiencing. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. I’m just going to place the stethoscope on your chest. It’s cool to the touch, I apologize for that, but it won't hurt. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling. That’s good. Now, for a quick abdominal exam. I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Abdominal exam… oh dear. This is getting worse and worse. Are you sure you have to press on it? It feels very vulnerable, you know. Alright, fine. But be very gentle. And don’t poke! Just press lightly. And let me know what you’re looking for. What does a “normal” abdomen even feel like? Is it supposed to be hard? Soft? Squishy? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit faint. And be quick, alright? Very quick. This is very unnerving. Honestly, I don’t like this at all.
DOCTOR: I’m just pressing lightly, alright?
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s… a bit tender there, on the right side. Not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. It feels a bit… bloated. And it feels… hard. Is that normal? Is that bad? Honestly, you’re probably just finding something wrong because I’m old. My daughter always said I worry too much. And now you’re probably going to tell me I have something terrible. Is it my appendix? Is it cancer? Honestly, I don’t want to know. Just stop pressing, alright? It’s making me anxious. You’re probably just finding something wrong. Stop pressing! That’s enough! Honestly, I think I’m going to faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I’m stopping. I apologize for causing you discomfort. It’s perfectly fine to stop at any time. You’re right, it's a little tender on the right side. And it feels a bit firm. That could be due to a number of things – constipation, gas, or even just muscle tension. It’s not necessarily anything serious. Honestly, it’s too early to say anything definitive. Based on what I’ve found, and considering your symptoms – the fatigue, loss of appetite, changes in bowel habits, and the tenderness in your abdomen – I think it would be wise to order a few blood tests, just to rule out anything underlying. We can also do a stool test to check for any infection. That way, we can get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Stool tests? Oh dear. This is getting worse and worse. My daughter is going to be insufferable. She’ll say “I told you so!” And what if they find something terrible? What if it is cancer? Honestly, I just wanted a card. A little bit of encouragement. Now I’m going to have to go through all sorts of tests and procedures. It’s just… too much. Honestly, I don’t think I can do this. It’s just too much stress. I’m already feeling exhausted and anxious. I think I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. And forget about all of this. But… alright. If it will make you feel better, you can do the tests. But promise me, promise me you’ll explain everything clearly. No medical jargon. And if it’s something terrible, just tell me straight. I don’t want any surprises. And can you still write the card? Even if it’s just a little bit of encouragement? I really need a little bit of encouragement right now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. I completely understand your anxiety, and I promise to explain everything clearly, in plain language. And I will absolutely write the card. We’ll take things one step at a time, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. One step at a time. That sounds… manageable. But what exactly do these tests involve? Do I have to… you know… provide a sample? And will they hurt? Honestly, I’m starting to feel faint again. And what about the card? Can you at least tell me what you’re going to write? Something about perseverance, perhaps? Or finding joy in small things? Something cheerful, alright? I really need something cheerful right now. And can we please get this over with quickly? I don’t want to be here all day. Honestly, this is the worst day ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's talk about the tests. For the blood tests, it’s just a simple prick of the finger or the inside of your elbow. A small amount of blood will be drawn and sent to the lab for analysis. It’s quick and relatively painless. You might feel a little pinch, but it doesn’t last long. As for the stool test, yes, you will need to provide a sample. The nurse will give you a container and instructions on how to do that. It’s a bit awkward, I understand, but it’s a valuable test for checking for any infection or other problems. As for the card, I was thinking something along the lines of: “Dear Janeth, it takes courage to reach out for support, and you’ve done just that. Remember that even on the most difficult days, there is always hope, and joy can be found in the smallest of things. Sending you strength and encouragement.” How does that sound?
PATIENT: “Sending you strength and encouragement…” That… that’s nice. That’s very nice, actually. A little bit cheesy, perhaps, but… nice. Alright. I suppose I can do the tests. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything clearly. And don't use any medical jargon. And can you write the card in your best handwriting? My daughter says my handwriting is terrible. And can you make it… colorful? A little bit of sunshine on a gloomy day, perhaps? And please hurry up, alright? I don’t want to be here all day. Honestly, this is still the worst day ever. But… at least you’re being nice. That makes a little bit of difference. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. I promise to be as gentle as possible, explain everything clearly, and use my best handwriting. And I will definitely add some color to the card – a little bit of sunshine for a gloomy day, just as you wished. Alright. Let's get the blood tests done first. I'll call the nurse in to assist us. It will only take a few minutes. And then we can discuss the stool test instructions. "Nurse, could you please come in and assist with a blood draw for Janeth?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood draw… here we go. Honestly, I feel a bit faint again. Maybe I should sit down. Can I sit down? And please tell me exactly what you're going to do, step by step. I don't want any surprises. And please be gentle. Very, very gentle. And make sure the needle is clean. I don't want to catch anything. Honestly, this is the worst day ever. But… at least you're being nice. That makes a little bit of difference. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, please sit down. It's perfectly okay to feel a little anxious. Okay, so here’s what we’re going to do. First, I’ll clean the area on your arm with an alcohol swab. Then, I’ll tie a small tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more prominent. Finally, I’ll insert a small needle into your vein to draw a small amount of blood. The whole process will only take a few minutes. And I promise to be as gentle as possible. I'll use a new, sterile needle, of course. And I'll explain each step as I go, so you're never surprised. Okay, let's begin. First, I'm just going to clean your arm with this alcohol swab. It will feel a little cold.
