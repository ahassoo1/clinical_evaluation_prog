DOCTOR: Good morning, Philipp. I’m Dr. Roseburroagh. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh... my heart. It feels... funny sometimes. Like it’s racing, but not right. It happens... not all the time. I think it started maybe a month ago? Not sure exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” is helpful, but let’s try to be a little more specific. Can you describe what "racing" feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm... okay. It's like… a fast beating. Not a strong beat, you know? More like… flapping. Like a bird maybe? Inside my chest. And it can stop quick, or go for a little bit. Maybe five minutes? Sometimes less. It doesn't hurt, just… feels wrong. Makes me a little dizzy sometimes, but not fall-down dizzy. Just… light.
DOCTOR: Alright, “flapping” is a good way to put it. And it’s good you're noticing the dizziness. Five minutes is… notable. Okay. To get a clearer picture, have you noticed anything before it happens?
PATIENT: Before? Let me think… not really. Sometimes I feel it when I’m just sitting. Or… walking. It doesn’t seem to matter. I was working, fixing some pipes, and it happened then too. Not when I’m sleeping, though. Never when I sleep. I drink coffee… maybe two cups a day? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Two cups a day isn’t usually a problem, but we’ll keep that in mind. It’s good it doesn’t happen during sleep. And the fact that it's happening with different activities… okay. Have you ever had this happen before, even when you were younger?
PATIENT: No, never. Not when I was young, not ever. This is… new. My father… he had some problems with his blood pressure, a long time ago, but not like this. This feels different. He always said his head hurt. I don’t have head pain. Just the flapping. It’s… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of this before, and your father's blood pressure issues are good to know – we’ll add that to his family history. "Flapping" is what you feel, and it’s okay to be worried. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. That’s good. I… I hope you can find out what it is. It just feels strange. Like something is not working right. Pulse... is that like the beating? Is it bad if it's fast?
DOCTOR: Yes, your pulse is the beating. And whether it's fast or slow can give us clues. Okay. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little quick – around 90 beats per minute, which is slightly elevated. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80 – a little high, but not alarming. Now, I want to ask about any other symptoms. Do you ever feel short of breath?
PATIENT: Short of breath? Not really. I sometimes… get tired faster. Like, after working all day I’m more tired than before. But I work hard, fixing pipes and everything. It’s a hard job. But… not like I can’t breathe. Just… more tired. And sometimes… a little sweaty. But it’s hot outside, you know? Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and some sweating, that’s helpful. It is hot, so that explains some of the sweating. Let's rule things out. Have you had any chest pain at all, even a little bit?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not at all. Never. That’s good, right? I mean… if it hurt, that would be bad. Like my friend, he had pain in his chest, and they had to… do something. But me, no pain. Just the flapping and the tired feeling. And the sweating sometimes. I drink a lot of water, though. Maybe too much?
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain is good. You're thinking clearly about these things. Drinking a lot of water is not a bad thing. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like we’re dealing with palpitations – that’s the medical term for what you’re describing, that feeling of your heart racing or fluttering. There are a lot of potential causes, some harmless, some needing attention. Given your slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, and the fact that this is new, I want to order an EKG, just to get a snapshot of your heart’s electrical activity. And a basic blood panel, to check your electrolytes and thyroid function. Those can sometimes cause palpitations. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: EKG… is that like… a picture of my heart? And blood panel… they take blood? Yes, that’s okay. If it helps… yes. I want to know what’s wrong. Electrolytes… I don’t know what that is. But if it helps… yes. When do we do it? Will it take long? I have to go back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. An EKG is like a picture of your heart's electrical activity - it’s quick and painless. They just put some stickers on your chest. And yes, a blood panel means they'll take a sample of your blood. It'll take about 10-15 minutes for the EKG, and the blood draw will only take a few minutes. We can do both right away. Nurse Maria will get you set up. I’ll review the results as soon as they come back, and we'll discuss them. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think… no questions. Stickers and blood… okay. Nurse Maria… I’ll just do what she says. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… better just knowing we’re checking. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s a positive step. Nurse Maria will take excellent care of you. I'll see you shortly after they're done, and we’ll talk through the results. .
