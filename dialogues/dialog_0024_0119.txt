DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Wartick. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me – concisely, if you will – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s a personal matter. It’s about… a discharge. A gentleman friend, you see, has been… experiencing a problem. And frankly, it's quite unsightly. I felt it my duty to inquire about it.
DOCTOR: A discharge… from whom, precisely, Mrs. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, must we be so… blunt? From him, of course! The gentleman friend I mentioned. It's quite distressing, really. Not something one expects. It’s not… normal, is it? And he's quite beside himself with worry, though he is too proud to come here himself, naturally.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Wartick, with all due respect, I am a physician. I require precise information to be of assistance. A “discharge” could indicate a multitude of issues. Is this a urethral discharge?
PATIENT: Urethral? I haven't the faintest idea what that means, Doctor. It’s… coming from down there. You know. Where it comes from with… men. It’s not a pleasant sight, I assure you. And there’s a bit of a… smell, too. Honestly, the whole thing is rather vulgar. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Right. So, a penile discharge. And you say it has an odor. Can you describe the odor?
PATIENT: Penile… yes, that’s the word. The odor… well, it’s not roses, Doctor. It’s… fishy. And a bit… sour. Honestly, it’s quite offensive. He tries to keep things… clean, of course, but it’s a persistent problem. And it’s certainly not getting better. Is that what you needed to know? It feels dreadfully improper discussing such things.
DOCTOR: A fishy, sour odor… Very well. Is he experiencing any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: Pain… He hasn’t said anything about pain, Doctor. He’s a rather stoic man, you see. Doesn't complain easily. But he does seem… uncomfortable. And he’s been going to the lavatory rather more frequently of late, though I assumed that was just… a nervous habit. He’s a bit anxious about this whole thing, naturally. Really, it’s quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Wartick, I understand this is delicate. However, to properly assess the situation, I need more concrete information. Does he have any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… No, not that I’ve noticed. He keeps a very regular schedule, you see, and I always take his temperature when he’s feeling unwell. Perfectly normal, usually. Chills… no, he hasn’t been shivering. Abdominal pain… well, he does complain of a bit of indigestion sometimes, but he's always been prone to that. Is that what you mean? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a nurse! I just know he's not himself. This whole affair is terribly distressing for both of us.
DOCTOR: Very well. Has he had any similar episodes in the past?
PATIENT: Similar episodes… Now that you mention it… yes, actually. Several years ago, he had… something similar. He was quite secretive about it, of course. Went to a… specialist, I believe. But he wouldn’t tell me the details. Said it was… a man’s problem. He did take some pills, I remember that. And he was very careful afterwards. But this… this is happening again. It's most unsettling. Is that… useful?
DOCTOR: It is… somewhat informative. Considering the recurrence and his previous treatment, it is highly likely he is experiencing a sexually transmitted infection, specifically gonorrhea or chlamydia. While I can offer some general advice, I strongly recommend he consult a urologist for proper diagnosis and treatment. I will not be examining him, Mrs. Wartick.
PATIENT: A… what now? Sexually transmitted… Oh, the scandal! Good heavens. He has never… Well, I suppose… there were those trips to… Marseille. But he always insisted it was just business! A urologist? Is that terribly expensive? And… will anyone find out? This is a disaster! I just wanted a simple remedy, not… this! .
DOCTOR: I have documented my assessment, Mrs. Wartick. I can provide a referral to a specialist, but the costs will depend on his insurance coverage. And frankly, his personal affairs are not my concern. Good day. .
