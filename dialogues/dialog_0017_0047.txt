DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I am Dr. Blim. I see here you’re a 47-year-old male. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Uh… right. Forty-seven. Seems like yesterday I was younger, honestly. It’s… about getting some help for the future. My wife, she… she needed a lot of care at the end. And I’m… well, I want to be ready, you know? For when I need it. It’s somethin’ about insurance, I think? Long-term care… that's what the lady on the phone said. I don't really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Insurance, yes. A prudent concern, certainly. Though frankly, coming to a family physician for insurance advice… it's rather unconventional. Nevertheless. Let’s establish a baseline, shall we?
PATIENT: Baseline? You mean… like, how I’m doin’ now? I feel… okay. Old, maybe. But okay. I been workin’ down at the docks, movin’ freight. Hard work, but keeps me busy. I mostly just… lift boxes and stuff. Is that what you mean? I don't really get all the doctor talk, sorry.
DOCTOR: "Doctor talk," as you put it, is essential for proper medical assessment. However, I understand your… simplicity. Very well. Let’s begin with a brief medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Hmm… let me see. My wife, she always took care of all that. I remember… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. And I broke my arm once, fallin’ off a roof. Does that count? Other than that… nothin' comes to mind, really. I've just always been… sturdy, I guess. Never been sick much. I do get kinda achy sometimes, from the work, but that's just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Tonsils and a broken arm are hardly chronic conditions, Mr. Rover. Past surgical history, then. Aside from the tonsils and arm, any other operations?
PATIENT: Operations… uh… no, I don't think so. Maybe… maybe a few stitches here and there over the years. Workin’ on the docks, you get cut up sometimes. But nothin' big. No real… operations. I remember my wife… she had a lot done, but I wasn’t really payin' attention to the details. Sorry. It’s just… hard to remember. A lot's happened.
DOCTOR: Very well. Family history, then. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mom… she had… somethin’ with her heart, I think. She got kinda weak near the end. And my dad… he worked hard all his life, like me. He just… got old, I guess. Didn't really have any big sicknesses, not that I recall. Lots of folks lived a long time on both sides, though. Aleut folks, we're pretty tough. But I don't remember specific illnesses. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about that stuff much. Sorry I can’t be more help.
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, sir. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she tried it once, a long time ago. Didn't like it. Bad for you, she always said. I stick to coffee. Lots of coffee. Keeps me goin’ when I'm movin’ freight. Coffee's good.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I have a beer sometimes. With dinner. Or after work. Not a lot. Just… one or two. Helps me relax. My wife liked a glass of wine now and then. We didn’t… go overboard, you know? Never caused any trouble. It’s just… social. Is that okay? I don’t drink to excess, Doc.
DOCTOR: "Not to excess," you say. Very well. Now, allergies. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I get kinda itchy sometimes when I’m around… certain plants. But that’s just… nature, I guess. And dust… gets to me sometimes. But nothin’ serious. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’, not that I remember. I don't take many pills, Doc. Mostly just coffee and… well, the occasional aspirin for a headache. I’m pretty tough, like I said. Don’t get sick easy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Rover, while your… robustness is admirable, this lack of specific medical information is… problematic. I suppose we should proceed with a basic physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: A… physical examination? What for? I thought we were talkin’ about insurance… Is somethin’ wrong? I feel fine, Doc. Really. Maybe we could just… fill out some forms? I don't like doctors, never have.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, a physical examination is standard procedure. It allows me to assess your current health status and determine if there are any underlying issues that may affect your long-term care needs. It's a necessary step, regardless of your… discomfort. Please, lie down. We will start with your vital signs. It will be brief.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. But just… just be quick, okay? And gentle. I bruise easy, you know. Vital signs… what are those, exactly? Is it gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, temperature. Standard measurements, Mr. Rover. It will not hurt. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. 78 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Breath sounds are clear, but slightly diminished. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your weight is 84 kilograms. Height is 178 centimeters. BMI is 26.5. Overweight. We will need to address this. Now, open your mouth. Let me examine your throat.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. It's kinda dry in here. Haven't been drinkin' as much water lately. Been busy workin'. Everything okay? Is it bad? I told you I don't like doctors…
DOCTOR: Mild pharyngeal erythema. No visible tonsillar enlargement. Palpating your lymph nodes now. Cervical lymph nodes are slightly palpable, but not significantly enlarged. Abdomen is soft, but slightly obese. No palpable masses or tenderness. Your cardiovascular and respiratory systems appear within normal limits, given your weight. But this weight is a significant concern. We will need to discuss dietary modifications and exercise. Do you have any recent laboratory results we should review?
PATIENT: No, Doc. No lab results. Like I said, I don’t really go to doctors. Never had any need to. I feel fine, mostly. A little achy sometimes, but that's just the work. I eat… regular food, I guess. Fish and potatoes mostly. And bread. I like bread. My wife… she made good bread. I don't really… diet, Doc. Never have. It’s kinda hard to change old habits, you know? Is the weight really that bad? It hasn't bothered me yet.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, your weight significantly increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and numerous other health complications. Ignoring it is simply… irresponsible. We will need to schedule a comprehensive metabolic panel and lipid profile to assess your current health status. I will also recommend a consultation with a registered dietitian to develop a personalized dietary plan. Now, do you have any family history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mom… I think she had somethin’ with her sugar. She was always tired, and she drank a lot of water. But I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago. And my dad… he didn't have diabetes, not that I know of. But he did… he did have chest pains sometimes. He just… toughed it out, you know? He didn't like doctors either. Is it bad? The chest pains? Is that what you're worried about? I don't have chest pains, Doc. Not yet.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, your family history, combined with your weight and lack of preventative care, is… concerning. I recommend an electrocardiogram to assess your cardiac function, and a stress test to evaluate for any underlying coronary artery disease. We will also need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the laboratory results and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. This is not optional, Mr. Rover. It is a necessary step to ensure your long-term health. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions…? Uh… well… Is it gonna be expensive? All these tests… I’m on a fixed income, you know? And… will it take long? I got work to do. And… will it hurt? I really don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, Doc. It just makes me nervous. I just wanted to get some insurance, that's all. Is all this… necessary for that?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, your concerns about cost and time are… understandable, but frankly, irrelevant. Your health is paramount. The tests are covered by your private insurance, though you will likely have a co-pay. As for the time commitment, it will require a few appointments over the next few weeks. Here is a referral for the electrocardiogram and stress test. As for the “poking and prodding,” as you so eloquently put it, it is a necessary inconvenience. Now, I believe we have covered everything. I will see you at your follow-up appointment. Please schedule it with the receptionist on your way out. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doc. Thank you… I guess. I just hope it doesn't take too long. And I really hope it doesn't hurt. Insurance… should be simpler than this. .
