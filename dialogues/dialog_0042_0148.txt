DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, it's a bit… difficult to explain. It’s about some pain, yes. Down… there. In the… groin area, I suppose. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. It’s alright, take your time. It sounds like you’re experiencing some pelvic pain. “A few weeks” is perfectly fine – it's common for time to blur when you're dealing with discomfort. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifics… yes. It’s not… constant, thankfully. More like… a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it’s sharp, a quick little stab, but that doesn’t happen often. It’s… worse when I’m active, I think. Walking, especially. Or… lifting things. Though, I do a lot of woodworking, so it’s hard to say what causes it exactly. It just… appears sometimes. And I… honestly, I haven’t noticed anything else. No fever, no… other symptoms. Just the pain. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Noelani, thank you. Don't apologize at all – it’s perfectly normal not to have a perfectly clear picture. A dull ache with sharper pains, worse with activity – that gives us a good starting point. You mentioned woodworking; is that a recent hobby, or have you been doing that for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, for years. Since… well, since before my husband passed, I believe. It’s always been a… comfort. Though, yes, I suppose I’ve been doing it more lately. I have more time now. It’s mostly small projects, you understand. Nothing too strenuous. Though, there is a lot of bending and reaching… and lifting lumber. Perhaps it’s that? I truly am unsure. Is it possible to… hurt oneself doing something like that?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible, Noelani. Bending, reaching, and lifting, even with smaller projects, can strain muscles and ligaments. We’ll need to explore other possibilities, of course, but that's a reasonable place to start. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I saw a doctor regularly when my husband was alive, of course. But after… after he passed, everything became a bit… blurred. I remember having my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And… I think I had a bout of pneumonia once. But beyond that… I honestly couldn’t say. I take medication for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill, every morning. And I have Medicare, of course. Does that help? I apologize again for my… lack of precision. I feel like I'm not being very useful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Noelani. It’s completely understandable that things are a little hazy, especially after a significant loss. Don't worry about precision – we have your records, and we can verify some of this. Gallbladder removal and a history of pneumonia are good to know. And thank you for mentioning your blood pressure medication; that's important. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: The name… oh dear. It’s… a small white pill. As I said. I get it from the pharmacy, of course. I'm afraid I don’t recall the name specifically. I just… take it every morning. It's a routine, you understand. I could… I could ask my neighbor, perhaps? She sometimes helps me with things like that. Would that be alright? She's quite organized. Or maybe the pharmacy could tell you? I really wish I could be more assistance.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. We can certainly get that information from the pharmacy. No need to trouble your neighbor. We have access to your medication list through Medicare as well, so we'll start there. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had… arthritis, I believe. In her hands, mostly. It bothered her a lot towards the end. And my father… he had heart problems. A weak heart, the doctor said. He passed away when I was quite young. Beyond that… My brother was healthy, as far as I know. He lived in California, you understand. We didn’t see each other very often. I don't recall any other significant illnesses, honestly. We weren't a family that discussed such things much. It wasn't… common, you understand. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Noelani. Arthritis and heart problems are important to know. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. Never have. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, take most medications… it’s a blessing, truly. I don’t… I don’t wear any jewelry, you understand. So, no metal allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything, honestly. Does that… simplify things? I feel rather silly not being able to recall more details. But I assure you, I’ve never had any allergic reactions. Perhaps that's a positive thing?
DOCTOR: It is a positive thing, Noelani. No known allergies is excellent. You're not being silly at all – you're providing me with valuable information. Now, to get a better sense of what might be causing your pain, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to gently examine your abdomen and pelvic area. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. I suppose it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, of course. Just… please be gentle. It’s… tender. As I said. I'll do my best to remain still. Whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. <stage>I wash my hands and put on gloves. I begin by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'll gently palpate your abdomen. Is there any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, a little. There. On the… lower left side. It's not sharp, just… uncomfortable. A dull ache, really. Like a pressure. Is that what you expected? It's difficult to say exactly where it hurts, you understand. It seems to radiate a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. That’s helpful. I’m feeling some mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant. Now, I’m going to gently press on a few specific points in your pelvic area. Let me know if you feel any pain, and please tell me how severe it is – on a scale of one to ten, with one being very mild and ten being the worst pain you’ve ever felt. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, there! That’s… that’s where it really hurts. It’s… maybe a six? On that scale, you said. It’s… a sharp pain, but it doesn’t last long. It’s more like a… a throbbing sensation, now that I think about it. It’s… unpleasant, Doctor. Quite unpleasant. Please… be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. A six out of ten, sharp and throbbing pain with palpation in that area. That's good information. Based on your history and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be a musculoskeletal issue, a strain or inflammation of the muscles in the pelvic area, which is consistent with your woodworking activities. However, the sharp pain and the location also raise the possibility of other conditions, such as diverticulitis, or possibly even a gynecological issue. To help us narrow things down, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a urine analysis. We might also need to consider a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, depending on the results of these initial tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A complete… what was it? And a… scan? Oh dear. It sounds… rather serious. Is it something very bad, Doctor? I… I don't want to have a scan if it's not necessary. I’ve always been rather… sensitive to medical procedures. Are you… are you saying it could be something serious? Diverti… what did you call it? It sounds frightening. Perhaps it's just a strain, as you said?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Noelani. It's my job to consider all possibilities, and I want to be thorough. A complete blood count is a simple blood test that checks for signs of infection or inflammation. A urine analysis will check for a urinary tract infection, which can sometimes cause similar pain. As for the CT scan, we don't need to do it right now. Let’s start with the blood work and urine analysis. That will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. If the results are inconclusive, or if your pain worsens, then we can discuss the possibility of a scan. It's a precaution, not a certainty. Diverticulitis is an inflammation of small pouches in the colon, and it can be serious if left untreated, but it's also very treatable. It's just one possibility, and we need more information before we can say anything definitively. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes more sense. Blood work and… the other test. And then we’ll see. That sounds… manageable. You’re right, it’s best to be thorough. I… I suppose I trust your judgment, Doctor. When can I have the tests done? And… will it hurt? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Noelani. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious, and I’m happy to answer anything you need. We can have the blood work and urine analysis done right here in the clinic today. The blood draw will involve a small prick on your arm, and the urine test is simply a sample you’ll provide in the restroom. Neither should be particularly painful, just a brief discomfort. The lab results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activities, such as heavy lifting, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you need them. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll… I’ll go have the tests done now. And I’ll try to rest. Thank you again. I suppose I’ll see you in a few days.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll take it one step at a time. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
