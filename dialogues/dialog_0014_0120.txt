DOCTOR: Right. Carmaleta Villarreal, 43 years old. Hello, I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I just… want to have a baby, okay? And I don’t want any trouble doing it. My husband… well, he was a good man. We always planned on more kids, but… things happen. Now I just want a healthy baby, and I'm not getting any younger. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Trouble” is a rather vague term, dear. And, while I understand your… urgency… we need to be specific. You've been trying, I presume?
PATIENT: Trying? Honestly, not really. We talked about it. A lot. But… he handled most of that sort of thing. And then… well. Now I just want to know if there’s anything wrong with me. Is that so hard to understand? I don't have time for a whole lot of tests, you know? I have a life.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you haven’t actively been trying to conceive, but you’re concerned about your fertility given your age and… past circumstances. We'll need some information to get started, even if it's just to rule things out. Have you had any regular check-ups recently?
PATIENT: Check-ups? Look, I have private insurance, okay? I go when something’s wrong. Not for… preventative stuff. My husband always said it was a waste of money. Honestly, it's been… years. I don't even remember the last time I had a proper one. And please don't tell me I should have. I've had enough of that already.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any pregnancies before?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes. One. A healthy boy. He’s… grown now. Why does that matter? Is this going to take all day? Look, I just want to know if I can have another one, not… a life story.
DOCTOR: It matters because previous pregnancies – or lack thereof – can give us clues. And yes, it will take some time to gather information. We can’t just… magically determine if you’re fertile. Now, was your previous pregnancy uncomplicated?
PATIENT: Uncomplicated? As far as I know, yes! Normal birth, everything was… fine. He was a bit colicky, but… that’s it. Look, I was young, I didn't pay much attention to the details. It was a long time ago. Can't you just… run a test or something?
DOCTOR: A single test won't suffice, dear. We need a comprehensive picture. Alright. Let’s start with some basic questions then. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, if that counts. Honestly, I don't really take much. Like I said, I don’t bother with much of that doctor stuff unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Ugh. That. Honestly? It’s… irregular. Has been for years. I don’t even bother tracking it. It comes when it comes. What does that even matter? Is everything I’ve ever done wrong suddenly going to be thrown in my face?
DOCTOR: It matters because a regular cycle is… indicative of ovulation, dear. It’s a rather important step in conceiving a child. We’ll need to determine how irregular. When was the last time you had a period?
PATIENT: Honestly, I have no idea! Months ago, definitely. I really don’t keep track of that sort of thing. It's been… stressful. Since my husband… Look, can we just skip this part? It’s embarrassing, okay? I’m trying to have a baby, not… reliving my entire life story.
DOCTOR: Skipping crucial information is… not conducive to a proper assessment, dear. However… Alright. We’ll proceed with a physical exam. It's rather standard. And then we’ll order some blood work. It will give us a clearer picture. Now, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Yes. But... don’t get any ideas. It’s… complicated. And please, let’s not discuss the specifics. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not... be interrogated. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with a basic abdominal exam, then a pelvic exam. It won’t be pleasant, but it’s necessary. I'll need you to undress from the waist down. I'll step out and give you a moment to change.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But hurry, please. And try to be… gentle. This is already humiliating enough. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's begin. I’m going to palpate your abdomen first. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender… or painful.
PATIENT: Ouch! That… that feels a bit sore. Right there… on the left side. But… I don't know. Maybe it's just… gas? Honestly, I eat a lot of beans.
DOCTOR: It could be gas, yes. But there's some slight tenderness. We'll need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to proceed with the pelvic exam. Please relax as much as possible. This will allow me to assess your reproductive organs. I will use a speculum and take some samples for testing.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry, please. And don’t… don’t talk so much. It’s… embarrassing. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s done. I noticed some slight inflammation, but nothing overly concerning at this stage. I've collected some samples for a Pap smear and a culture. We'll need to wait for the lab results. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a hormone panel to assess your overall health and ovarian function. It will take a few days for the results to come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly, I just want to know if this is going to work. Is there anything wrong with me? Is it even possible for me to have another baby? And please, don't tell me it's "possible" without knowing anything for sure. I've wasted enough time already. Can't you just… tell me what I need to hear?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, dear. But I cannot provide a definitive answer without the lab results. The inflammation I observed could indicate an infection or other underlying issue. The hormone panel will tell us about your ovarian reserve and whether you're ovulating regularly. We'll also check your thyroid levels and other factors that can affect fertility. It is irresponsible to make assumptions without proper investigation. We need concrete data before we can determine the best course of action. I will call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, try to manage your stress levels. And please, refrain from self-diagnosing online. It rarely yields helpful information. Do you have any further questions before I conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. No. Just call me when you know something. And please, don't waste my time with… possibilities. Just facts. And don't tell me about stress, okay? I've had a stressful life. Just… call.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will contact you as soon as the lab results are available. Here is a requisition for the lab tests. And a pamphlet on… stress management, just in case. Have a good day.
