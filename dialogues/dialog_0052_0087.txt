DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely, and I'm a Family Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Croonquist is fine. Just… lab work, I think? The lady on the phone said something about it. Honestly, I don’t recall exactly. Old age, you know. Just want to get it over with, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. It’s perfectly alright. Many patients have scheduled routine lab work. To ensure I have a complete picture, even for routine tests, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Not that I notice, really. Everything feels… about the same as it always has. A little ache here, a little pain there… that's just getting old, isn’t it? Nothing new though. I don't think so. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. "About the same" is good information, Mr. Croonquist. And you’re right, some aches and pains are a normal part of aging. To be thorough, let's briefly go through a review of your systems – just a few questions about different parts of your body to make sure nothing is being overlooked. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. First, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I eat. Can't say I've been less hungry, maybe. Weight? Doctor, I haven't weighed myself in… years, I reckon. Too much bother. Everything still fits, mostly. Is that good enough? Look, I'm a simple man. Just need the lab work done, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. “Everything still fits” is a good way to put it. We’ll proceed as efficiently as possible. Let’s move on. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes. Sometimes. I wake up… a lot. Get up, wander around a bit, then back to bed. Been happening for… well, a long time now. Don’t bother me much, though. Used to it, I suppose. Don't sleep great, but I sleep. Is that what you want to know? I really need to get this over with. It's...hot out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Croonquist. Frequent awakenings can certainly disrupt your rest. We'll address that later, if needed. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? Doctor, really? Do we have to…? Look, everything’s… regular enough. Old man things, you know. Goes in, comes out. That’s it. Don’t ask me to be specific, alright? Just… can we get to the lab work? I’m starting to feel a bit faint. And this chair isn’t exactly comfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I apologize if I’m being too detailed. We simply try to cover all bases. It’s good to know things are “regular enough.” Before we proceed to the lab work, just a few more quick questions. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations…? No. Chest pain… a little twinge now and then. Probably just gas. Shortness of breath… only when I’m climbing hills. Which I don’t do anymore. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very boring patient. Nothing exciting ever happens. Can we please get this over with? I feel like I’m taking up your valuable time. You’ve got other people to see, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: You are not taking up my valuable time, Mr. Croonquist. It’s my job to ensure I have a complete understanding of your health. Thank you for your patience. Given your responses, and to ensure a comprehensive assessment, I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good baseline. Before we head to the lab, do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medications you are taking?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I haven't taken anything regularly in… years. Maybe some aspirin now and then, for a headache. But that’s it. Doctor, honestly, I'm terrible at remembering these things. If I was taking something, my daughter would probably know. She handles all that sort of business. But I'm not taking anything right now. Can we finally go? I can feel the sun beating down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. No current medications noted, and no known allergies. Excellent. Let's proceed to the lab. I will send the orders electronically, and the lab technician is expecting you. They will draw a small sample of blood. It will only take a few minutes. After the lab work, we can discuss the results and any necessary follow-up. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wonderful. Just get the blood drawn and get it over with. Blood draws are never pleasant, but I'm used to them, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. Let's go. The lab is just down the hall, on your left. I'll be right here when you're finished. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the draw. Oh, and Mr. Croonquist, just one more thing. Do you have any questions for me before we head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… let’s go, please. I’m starting to sweat. And frankly, I’m a bit hungry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. As you wish. .
