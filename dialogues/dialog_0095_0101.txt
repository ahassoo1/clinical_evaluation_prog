DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of me head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now, so I thought I best come and get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And you said "a little while now"—could you tell me roughly how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... It started… oh, maybe three weeks ago? Around the middle of July, I’d say. Not constant, mind you. Comes and goes. But when it is there, it’s a proper nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, about three weeks. And you said it comes and goes. Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a throbbing pain, not a sharp one. More of a… a dull ache, really. Like a weight pressin' on the back of me skull. And sometimes it feels like it spreads down me neck a little bit. Not awful, but definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head, sometimes spreading to your neck. Is there anything that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… bendin’ over does it. Especially if I’m workin’ on someone’s feet for a long time. Havin’ to look down a lot, you see? It’s me job, bein’ a manicurist and all. Lots of close work.
DOCTOR: Alright, so bending over and close work seem to aggravate it. And do you notice anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… lyin’ down helps. Just relaxin’ flat on me back. And a warm cloth on the back of me neck. That takes the edge off a bit, y’know? Doesn’t make it disappear, but it’s a comfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down and a warm cloth on your neck provide some relief. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… No dizziness or nothin’ like that. And I haven’t been seein’ any spots or blurry vision. Just the headache itself. Oh! Wait a minute. Sometimes, when it's really bad, me shoulders feel a bit tense. Real stiff, like. But that could just be from bendin’ over all day, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness, vision changes. Sometimes stiff shoulders. I see. And have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this headache?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. No fever, no feelin' sick to me stomach, and definitely no vomitin’. Just this headache, like I said. It's mostly just… a bother, really. But I don't like things lingerin', if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. I'm glad you came in to get it checked out. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I've always been a pretty healthy man. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but it's under control with… well, with just watchin’ me salt intake, mostly. And I had a touch of arthritis in me hands, but that’s just what comes with the job, I reckon. Lots of small movements. Other than that, nothin' major.
DOCTOR: Okay, managed high blood pressure, and some arthritis in your hands. Are you currently taking any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothin' at all. The doctor said the high blood pressure was mild enough to manage with diet. And the arthritis… well, I just try to pace myself. And use a good hand cream! No pills for this old man, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Nope, thankfully not. I can eat just about anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin’. Lucky me, I suppose. Though, I do avoid shellfish, just personal preference, not an allergy. Never really liked the taste.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Years ago, when I was a young man, I broke me arm playin’ cricket. Had to have a cast on for a good while. But other than that, nothin’ major. No serious illnesses, no hospital stays. I've always been a strong fella, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm years ago. And are you currently smoking, drinking alcohol, or using any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I gave up smokin' years ago, when me wife got sick. Didn't seem right, you see? And I only have a small glass of wine with me dinner now and then, just for enjoyment. Never touched any of those other things. I like me peace and quiet, too much trouble otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don't smoke, rarely drink alcohol, and don’t use recreational drugs. Now, just to finish up with your history, are any immediate family members—parents, siblings—have a history of headaches or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, me mother used to get terrible migraines when she was younger, real bad ones. Had to lie down in a dark room for hours. But me father was always as strong as an ox, never a sick day in his life. And I don’t think any of me siblings had anything like that. Come to think of it, me aunt, on me wife’s side, had some trouble with dizziness when she got older, but I don’t know much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with migraines, aunt with dizziness. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a neurological assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I understand you need to check things out properly. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 135/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so, given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and some basic neurological functions. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I can see it perfectly fine. No trouble at all.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. As tight as I can manage. A bit of arthritis in them hands, mind you, but I'm still fairly strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength seems good on both sides. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion in your neck. I’m going to ask you to gently turn your head to the left and then to the right, and then look up and down. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. How does that feel?
PATIENT: A little bit of stiffness, Doctor, but no real pain. Just like a creaky door, you know? The arthritis, I reckon. It’s worse when it’s cold. But nothing unbearable. I can manage it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little stiffness but no acute pain. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear there. Any discomfort when I do that?
PATIENT: No, sir, no discomfort at all. Everything feels alright there. Like I said, I'm a pretty healthy man, for me age.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have what we call a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by your job and the repetitive movements and neck strain. The arthritis could be contributing to the stiffness. However, to rule out other possibilities, especially given your age, I'd like to order a basic blood test to check your complete blood count and rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. And just to be on the safe side, I'd also like to get a CT scan of your head to make sure there’s nothing else going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A blood test and a scan… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. I don't mind gettin' it checked out properly. Just want to make sure it's nothin' serious, y'know? When can we get those done?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll write you a requisition for both tests. You can get the blood test done at the lab just down the street. The CT scan will need to be scheduled at the imaging center; their number is on the requisition. It's best to get them done as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed, and continue using the warm compress on your neck. Avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms if possible. I'll also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the stiffness. We’ll review the results together once they are available and discuss a long-term plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. Acetaminophen, warm compress, and a muscle relaxant… I can manage that. And I'll get those tests done right away. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me and check me out properly. I feel much better knowin' we're gettin' it sorted. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Here are the requisitions and the prescription. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll schedule that once we have the test results. In the unlikely event of a sudden worsening of your symptoms—such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or severe headache—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I'll get those tests done and call the office if I need anything. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day too, Mr. Popova. Please take care of yourself. .
