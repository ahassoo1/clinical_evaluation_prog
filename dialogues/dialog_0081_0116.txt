DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my… it’s… well, my legs. They bother me something fierce at night. Cramping, you see. Just awful cramping. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. Hard to say exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cramping in your legs, particularly at night. And you said it’s been going on for a while… can you be a little more specific about how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific… that’s… difficult. It feels like… seasons, maybe? Several seasons. Perhaps since last winter? Or the one before? Time… it slips away, you know. I used to be very good with dates, working with the papers and all. But now… not so much. It’s just… there. The cramping.
DOCTOR: Right. Several seasons. So, at least six months, possibly longer. And is this cramping constant throughout the night, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Not all night, thankfully. It’ll wake me up, usually. A sharp pull, then a tightening. Then it eases off… and might come back later. It’s… unpredictable. Like a little… mischievous spirit, I suppose. It doesn’t happen every night, but when it does… it’s enough to ruin my sleep.
DOCTOR: And where exactly in your legs are you experiencing this cramping?
PATIENT: Mostly in my calves, I think. The back of my legs, lower down. Sometimes it feels like it goes up higher, into my thighs a little, but mostly it’s the calves. Both legs, usually. Though sometimes just one will bother me. It’s never… predictable, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Calves, occasionally thighs, and it’s intermittent – both legs, sometimes just one. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these cramps?
PATIENT: Trigger… hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t know if anything triggers it. I haven’t been able to find a pattern. I walk a little, of course. I like to get outside when the weather is nice. But I don't do much… strenuous activity. I drink plenty of water, I think. Not as much as I used to, perhaps. Oh… and sometimes, if I stand for too long, my legs feel a little… shaky. But that’s not always before a cramp. It’s just… a feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some walking, no strenuous activity, you try to stay hydrated. And occasional shakiness when standing for extended periods. Now, let’s talk about other things. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside these cramps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, now you ask. My feet do feel a little… numb sometimes. Not all the time, and not terribly bad. Just a tingling, like when they’ve been asleep. And… I suppose my legs feel a little… weak. Not falling-down weak, but not as strong as they used to be. I've just assumed that’s… old age, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Old age” is rarely a diagnosis, Ms. Bilstein. Numbness and weakness are important things to investigate. Now, can you describe the numbness?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I didn’t mean… it just… feels like things aren’t working as well anymore. As for the numbness… it’s mostly in my toes, I think. And the soles of my feet. It comes and goes, like the cramps. And it’s not a bad numbness, just… a lack of feeling. Like wearing thick socks. Sometimes it’s both feet, sometimes just one. I suppose it’s more of a tingling, really. A pins and needles sensation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Toes, soles of the feet, intermittent tingling. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin color or temperature in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Changes in color… hmm. That’s a difficult one. I haven’t really… looked closely, to be honest. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. I suppose they look… normal. Pale, maybe? I’ve always had pale skin. And sometimes they feel a little… cold. But that’s usually just when the weather is chilly. Or if I’ve been sitting for a long time. I don’t know if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Bilstein. Now, let's go through some medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not to my recollection. I used to take a little something for my arthritis, but that was years ago. And I stopped taking it because it didn’t seem to be helping much. I don’t take anything regularly now. My mother was… sensitive to certain fabrics, I think. But that wasn’t me. Just her.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking. I had… the usual things, I suppose. The measles when I was a girl. Chickenpox. Nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out many years ago. And I had a touch of pneumonia once, but I recovered fully. The arthritis, as I mentioned. But that’s about it. Nothing major. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Past surgical history of gallbladder removal, history of arthritis, and a bout of pneumonia. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had… heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was quite young. My father… he was a strong man, very healthy. He lived to a good age. I had an older brother, but he passed away in the war. I don’t… I don’t really know much about his health. It was a long time ago. And we didn't talk about things much back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of heart trouble. And finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh my, no. Never. Not a drop of alcohol. And certainly no… recreational drugs. I never understood the appeal. I used to drink tea, of course. A nice cup of tea in the afternoon. But I haven’t had much of that lately. I live alone now, you see. My husband… he passed away several years ago. And I mostly keep to myself. I enjoy reading, and… reminiscing. It's a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. It will involve checking your pulses, reflexes, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be gentle, if you would. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. First, let’s check your pulses. Please extend your leg. Hmm. A little weak, but present. And the same on this side. A little weak, but palpable. Patellar reflexes are diminished bilaterally. Now, can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. A little… dull, perhaps. Not as sharp as it used to be, but I can feel it. It feels… faint. Like a tickle, more than a sensation. And... yes, I can feel it on this side too. About the same. Faint and… dull. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Skin is cool to the touch, and slightly dry. I also notice some… diminished hair growth on both legs and feet. Now, I’d like to take a look at your toenails. Hmm. They appear thickened and slightly discolored. Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the physical examination, my initial concern is Peripheral Artery Disease, or PAD, combined with possible neuropathy. The diminished pulses, cool skin, decreased hair growth, thickened toenails, and diminished sensation are all indicative of reduced blood flow to your legs and feet, and nerve damage. The cramping you are experiencing is likely due to the reduced blood flow during activity, and the numbness is due to the neuropathy. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I need to order some further testing.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Peripheral… something? And neuropathy? Is that… bad? My legs feel alright, mostly. Just the cramping and the numbness. What kind of testing do you need to do? And… what can be done about it? I’m not a fan of needles, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Bilstein. PAD is a common condition, especially in individuals with certain risk factors, and it's often manageable with appropriate treatment. Neuropathy refers to nerve damage, and can have various causes. The testing I'd like to order is a Ankle-Brachial Index, or ABI, which is a non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. It will help me assess the blood flow to your legs. I’d also like to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and vitamin levels. The blood work will require a small needle prick, but it's a routine procedure. As for treatment, it depends on the severity of the condition. It may involve lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and smoking cessation, as well as medication to improve blood flow and manage any underlying conditions. We can discuss all of your options in detail once we have the results of the testing. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… I suppose I could walk a little more. I don’t smoke, thankfully. And… are these tests expensive? I don’t have much… savings, you see. My husband… he handled all the finances. And… what if it is PAD? Will I need… surgery? It all sounds rather… daunting, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Bilstein. It is daunting to hear about potential health issues, and the financial aspect is certainly a valid concern. Let's address those points one at a time. Regarding the cost, I will have my staff check with your insurance provider to determine your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. We also have programs available to assist patients with limited financial resources. We will explore all available options to ensure you receive the necessary care. Regarding surgery, it is not always necessary for PAD. In many cases, lifestyle modifications and medication are sufficient to manage the condition. However, if the condition is severe, or if there is a blockage that cannot be treated with medication, surgery may be considered. We will discuss all treatment options with you in detail, and you will have the final say in any decision regarding your care. For now, let's focus on getting the testing done. I will write you a referral for the ABI and the blood work. My staff will schedule the appointments for you, and they will also contact your insurance provider to discuss coverage. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for checking with my insurance… I appreciate that very much. Scheduling the appointments… that would be wonderful. I’m not very good with… paperwork, you see. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It means a lot. Do I need to do anything before the tests? Like… fasting for the blood work, perhaps?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It’s my job to address your concerns and ensure you receive the best possible care. Yes, for the blood work, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. As for the ABI, there are no specific preparations required. Just wear comfortable clothing that allows access to your ankles and legs. My staff will provide you with detailed instructions when they schedule the appointments. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. And kind. I do feel… a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. Thank you again for your patience. And for not making me feel… foolish for not knowing all the medical terms. I suppose I’ll let your staff schedule those tests then. And I’ll try to remember to fast beforehand. Thank you, Doctor Paulino.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It was my pleasure. My staff will be in touch shortly to schedule the appointments. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
