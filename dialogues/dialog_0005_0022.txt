DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I’m Dr. Donate. Now, you’re 90 years young, that’s wonderful. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, ninety. Feels… long time. Um… my tummy. It’s getting big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything just… sits. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Big,” you say. And it’s uncomfortable, not painful. Okay. And how long has your tummy been getting bigger, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… time… it goes so fast. Maybe… a few months? Hard to say. I mostly notice it when I try to button my… my dress. It doesn't want to close anymore. Not a new dress, mind you. Old favorite.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few months. And you said you’re not as hungry as you used to be, and food just… sits. Does it bother you after you eat?
PATIENT: Not really bother… just… full. Even if I don't eat much. Like a heavy feeling. And sometimes… I feel a little… bloaty? Is that the word? Like too much air inside, maybe?
DOCTOR: "Bloaty," yes, I understand. And this fullness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Worse after I try to eat something. Then it settles a little, but it’s always… there. Not a sharp pain, just… present. Like a stone. A little one, not a big one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your… bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… my… That’s… a private question, Doctor. I go… when I need to. Not as regular as I used to be, maybe. Things are… slower. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: It is a relevant question, Ms. McConnon, and I apologize if it made you uncomfortable. It helps me understand what's going on. “Slower,” okay. Any constipation, then?
PATIENT: Consti… what did you say? Is that a bad thing? Oh… going less often? Yes, I think so. It’s harder. I have to… push a little more. Not every time, but… often. Like trying to move something heavy. It’s not pleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. No, I don't think so. I… I look, but… not blood. Just… normal colors. Sometimes light, sometimes dark, but nothing… red. I’d remember red. No, no blood. I hope not, anyway. That sounds scary.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nause… oh, feeling sick to my tummy? Not really. Sometimes a little… queasy, maybe, after I eat. But I haven't… thrown up. No. I haven’t done that in a long, long time. Not since I was a girl, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh my… medical history. That’s a long time ago. Let me think… I had a bad cough when I was younger. Pneumonia, I think they said. And my back… always bothered me. Arthritis, the doctor said. Old age, mostly. Nothing major. Nothing they could really fix. Mostly just… aches and pains. And I've never had any operations. Not a single one. I'm lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Pneumonia and arthritis. And no surgeries. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… funny. I tried something for my back, a long time ago, but it didn't help much and it upset my tummy, so I stopped. No, no medications at all. Just… a little tea sometimes, for my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I eat… most things. I like fish. And potatoes. And cabbage. Never had any trouble with food. Sometimes a little heartburn, but that's just from eating too much. And I haven't been stung by a bee in… oh, a very long time. I don't think I have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to examine your abdomen. Just lie back on the examination table, and I'll take a listen and feel around. It won’t be unpleasant. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Oh… examine? Will it hurt? I’m a little… bony, you know. Not much there to examine. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just be gentle, please. And… tell me what you’re doing, okay? I like to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. It shouldn't hurt. I'll just be listening with my stethoscope, and then gently pressing on your abdomen. I'll tell you what I'm doing as I go. It’s just to get a better understanding of what's going on. First, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. I'll just put this cool gel on your tummy… Now, I'm listening… Sounds are… diminished. A little quiet. Now, I'm going to gently press… I'm starting on your right side… Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little… sensitive. Not painful, just… feels full. Like a balloon. A little bit tender. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like I ate too much cabbage. But I didn't eat that much cabbage.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here, on the left side?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little bit the same. Not as bad as the right side, but… full. And… a little bit hard. Like a stone, maybe? Not a big stone, but… something there. It doesn't move when I push. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. And in the middle?
PATIENT: Oh… the middle. That’s the worst. Feels… tight. Like a… a band around my tummy. And… a little bit achy. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like after I’ve been sitting for too long. And it’s definitely harder there. Not soft like before. It feels… different. Not right.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me and what I've found, I'm concerned about a possible mass in your abdomen. The diminished bowel sounds and the hardness I felt are worrying. Now, this could be something relatively benign, like a build-up of gas, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. I want to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, and the CT scan will give us a clearer picture of what's going on inside. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a mass? Like… a tumor? Oh dear. A CT scan… is that one of those machines? With… with radiation? I don’t like radiation. And blood work… so many needles. I don't understand. What does it mean? Is it… is it bad? Is it cancer? I’m too old for all this. I just want my tummy to feel normal again. Please, Doctor… tell me what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, please try to stay calm. A mass simply means there is something there that shouldn’t be. It could be many things, and cancer is just one possibility, and not necessarily the most likely. We need to do these tests to find out what it is. The CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, yes, but it’s a very low dose, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. And the blood work… well, yes, there will be needles, but I promise to be as gentle as possible. We’re going to take things one step at a time. First, the blood work and the CT scan. Then, we’ll discuss the results and figure out the best course of action. I’m going to refer you to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s a specialist in digestive issues and will be able to provide you with more detailed information and answer any questions you have. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a specialist? Dr. Sharma… is she nice? And the tests… how long will they take? And what if… what if it is something bad? Will it hurt? Will I have to… have surgery? I’m so confused, Doctor. All I want is to feel better. And I don't want to be a bother to anyone. I’m just an old woman. Can we… can we just try some tea? Maybe some ginger? For my tummy?
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, you are not a bother. And I understand your fear and confusion. Dr. Sharma is a very compassionate and skilled doctor. I chose her specifically because of her bedside manner. The blood work will take about 15-20 minutes. The CT scan will take longer, maybe 30-45 minutes, but you’ll just be lying down. As for what if it is something bad… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. There are many treatment options available, even for more serious conditions. We'll discuss them all thoroughly if that becomes necessary. Surgery is just one possibility, and we won't even consider it until we know exactly what we're dealing with. Ginger tea won’t hurt, but it won’t give us a diagnosis. It’s best to focus on getting these tests done so we can understand what’s going on and develop a plan. I’ll write you a referral for Dr. Sharma and the orders for the blood work and CT scan. I’ll also have my nurse, Maria, come in and explain the process for the CT scan in more detail. She's very good at calming people’s nerves. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Maria… she sounds nice. And Dr. Sharma… you said she’s good? Yes… alright. Blood work and the scan. And then… we’ll see. Please… just tell me… tell me what to expect. I don’t like surprises. And… and thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. I’m just… scared. It’s just… I’m so old. And I’ve lived a long life. I just want to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: You've lived a full life, Ms. McConnon. And we’re going to do everything we can to help you stay comfortable. For the blood work, Maria will draw a few vials of blood from your arm. It might sting a little, but it shouldn’t last long. For the CT scan, you'll lie on a table that slides into a large machine. It’s open on both ends, so you won't feel claustrophobic. The machine will take pictures of your abdomen. You'll need to lie very still during the scan, and you might be asked to drink a special liquid beforehand to help improve the images. It’s painless, but you’ll need to lie there for about 30-45 minutes. Maria will go over all the details with you. I’ll also give you a copy of the referral and the orders so you have everything you need. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I'll be monitoring your results closely, and we’ll discuss them as soon as they’re available. Now, let me call Maria to come in and explain everything in more detail. And please… try not to worry too much. We're going to take this one step at a time.
PATIENT: Alright… one step at a time. Thank you, Doctor. You're a kind man. One step… at a time. .
