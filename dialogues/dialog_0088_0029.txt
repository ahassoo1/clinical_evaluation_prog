DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Norval is fine, please. Well, it’s… it’s my stomach, mostly. I get full awful quick these days. Even if I don't eat much, I feel like I've had a big meal. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval. “Just Norval” is perfect. And it’s good you’re telling me about this. Getting full quickly, even with small amounts of food… that's something we need to look into. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks. Maybe six, seven weeks? Hard to say exactly, time slips away when you get to be my age, you know? It's not painful or anything, just… uncomfortable. And it makes it hard to enjoy my food, which is a shame. My wife does a wonderful salmon bake, and I can barely get a couple bites in now before I’m stuffed.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Six or seven weeks… alright. And no pain, just discomfort and feeling full quickly, even with small amounts. And it's affecting your appetite, even with food you enjoy. That is helpful to know. Let me just pull up your chart here... Okay, I see you've been seen here before for… blood pressure management, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Old man problems, mostly. Dr. Henderson used to see me for that, but he retired, didn't he? Good man, Dr. Henderson. I haven’t really had much trouble with it lately, been keeping an eye on it myself, mostly. But this… this fullness is new. And it’s worrying me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know your blood pressure is stable, and you were under Dr. Henderson’s care. And it’s smart to be proactive about it. I understand your concern about something new happening, especially the fullness. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Well, usually for breakfast, I have a bit of oatmeal, maybe with some berries if my wife has them. Lunch is usually a sandwich, something simple. And supper… well, that depends. Sometimes it’s fish, like my wife’s salmon, sometimes it’s just soup and a bit of bread. We don't eat a lot of fancy stuff, just good, solid food. It’s mostly the amount, I think. I used to be able to eat a good plate of food, and now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, oatmeal, sandwich, and a simple supper, nothing too heavy. And you've noticed a decrease in how much you can eat overall. Do you have any trouble swallowing the food?
PATIENT: No, not really. The swallowing isn’t a problem at all. It just… fills me up fast, even if it's not much. Like, I could take a few bites of a sandwich and feel like I ate a whole feast. And it doesn't matter what I'm eating, really. It’s not like it’s something heavy or greasy. Oatmeal, salmon, soup… they all do the same thing. It’s just… quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no difficulty swallowing, and it happens regardless of the type of food. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I've been a bit tired lately, but I figured that’s just getting older. My wife says I’ve been a bit more… quiet, but she also says I’m always quiet. Nothing specific that I can think of, no pain, no bloating, nothing like that. Just the fullness and the tiredness, I guess. And maybe a little less energy, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and a little less energy along with the fullness. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever had any problems with your stomach or digestion before, like ulcers or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had a bit of heartburn now and then, but nothing serious. My mother had some trouble with her gallbladder when she was older, but I don’t think that runs in the family, or at least, I haven't had any trouble with mine. Never had an operation on my stomach, never been sick or anything like that. I've always been a pretty healthy guy, up until recently, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of stomach problems or surgery. And you haven't had any other significant illnesses. Good. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a small pill for my blood pressure, like I said. It’s a low dose, and I take it every morning. Nothing else. And I don't take any vitamins or supplements, unless my wife gives me something. She's always trying to get me to take something for my bones. But I always forget.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication. And you mentioned your wife. Do you live alone or with family?
PATIENT: With my wife, of course. Been married to Eleanor for sixty years this November. We live in our own home, out by the ocean. It's a small place, but it’s comfortable. She’s a good woman, Eleanor. Always looking after me. She worries about me, especially with this… stomach thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Having support at home is important. Norval, based on what you’ve told me, it could be a number of things. It’s possible it's something simple, like a change in appetite or even just a mild stomach upset. However, given your age and the fact that it's been going on for a few weeks, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and possibly order some blood work just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I appreciate you taking it seriously. I’d rather be safe than sorry, especially with my age. Blood work and an exam… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s start with the exam. If you don’t mind, please lie down on the examination table over there. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll feel your abdomen. It won’t be uncomfortable, just a gentle check.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. A little stiff these days, but I'll manage. Just let me know if anything feels… odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. And your abdomen… not tender to the touch, no masses. It is a little bit distended, which could explain the fullness, but it’s not significant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Alright, that wasn’t uncomfortable, was it?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just a little poking and prodding. It didn't hurt a bit. It’s good to know nothing serious is going on, at least from the feeling of it. Distended, you say? What does that mean, exactly? I don’t really understand all the doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Distended just means your abdomen is slightly larger than usual. It can be caused by a lot of things, some simple, some more serious. That’s why I want to do a little bit of blood work to get a better idea of what's going on. It will help me rule out things like problems with your liver or kidneys, or any signs of inflammation. We'll check your complete blood count, your electrolytes, and your liver and kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Blood work is fine. I just hope it doesn't take too long. Eleanor is making a salmon bake for tonight, and I'd hate to miss it. Even if I can only manage a couple of bites.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It won't take long to draw the blood. I'll write the order now. Here's a requisition form. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of it. They are just down the hall, second door on the left. I’ll have the results sent over here, and I should be able to review them within a couple of days. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or significant changes in your condition, please go to the emergency room right away.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Hopefully it's nothing serious. I'll go get the blood work done right away. And I'll try not to miss that salmon bake.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval. You take care. And I hope you enjoy your salmon bake. If you have any questions before I get the results, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic.
