DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Woodring, yes. Thirty-seven years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get to it. It’s my stomach. Been…well, it’s been awful. Just constantly going to the bathroom. And nothing seems to help. I've tried…things. Over-the-counter stuff. It just won't stop.
DOCTOR: “Constantly going to the bathroom.” Right. And you said you've tried some over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Yes. You know, the usual. Imodium, Pepto-Bismol… all that stuff. Honestly, I expected something to work by now. It's been going on for… I don't know, almost a week? It's really inconvenient, to say the least. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And you haven't noticed any blood in your stool, fever, or nausea with this?
PATIENT: Blood? No. I haven’t checked, honestly. I just… deal with it. Nausea, sometimes, but not much. Just… really weak from losing so much. Look, is this going to take long? I’m really not one for dwelling on… details. Just fix it, okay?
DOCTOR: "Fix it." Right. Well, "fixing it" requires some information. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. I eat… normal food. I haven’t been traveling or anything. Look, I eat what I always eat. Burgers, fries… you know. Nothing fancy. Is there something wrong with that? I haven’t been sick or anything. I just… want to feel better. It's probably just something I ate, right? Something that didn’t agree with me. I don't need a full investigation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick abdominal exam then. Lie back on the exam table for me. I’ll need to listen and feel around. It’s fairly standard.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. And be gentle, please. I have… sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are…present, hyperactive. Not a lot of distension. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule anything else out.
PATIENT: Just hurry up. This is… embarrassing. And cold. Is there a blanket or something? I really don't like being cold. Look, are you finding anything wrong? Because I need to know if I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Heart and lungs are clear. Look, Ms. Woodring, while everything appears normal on initial examination, you've had diarrhea for a week now. We need to rule out a possible infection. I’m going to order a stool sample – it's a simple test to check for bacteria or parasites. And frankly, your diet isn't helping matters. I recommend a bland diet for the next few days. Rice, toast, bananas. Things that won’t upset your stomach further.
PATIENT: Ugh, bananas? Seriously? Look, I appreciate you trying, I guess, but I don’t see what a little rice and bananas is going to do. And I already told you, I eat normal food. It's not my diet, it’s… something else. But fine, whatever. Just give me the container. I want to get this over with. Can I just go now? Because I really don’t have time for this. And don’t expect me to change my whole life because of some… stomach bug.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the container. Instructions are on the label. Bring it back to the lab within 24 hours. If things worsen - fever, severe abdominal pain, dehydration – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Lab, 24 hours, emergency room. Got it. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Can I just go now? I’ve wasted enough time here already. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. Try to follow the dietary recommendations. And if you experience any changes, please contact the clinic. .
