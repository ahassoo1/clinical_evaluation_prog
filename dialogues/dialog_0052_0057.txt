DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Lucht. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…about the cancer. I was told to come see you. I don’t…really know what happens next, or what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Ms. Lucht. It’s perfectly alright to feel unsure. We'll take things one step at a time. To begin, could you tell me a little more about what you were told regarding the cancer?
PATIENT: They…the other doctors…said it’s in my lung. And it’s not good. That’s…mostly what I remember. It was a lot to take in. I don’t know what kind it is, or…how bad. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering details when I’m worried.
DOCTOR: That is completely understandable, Ms. Lucht. Receiving news like that is incredibly difficult, and it’s very common to feel overwhelmed. Don’t apologize at all for not remembering everything. We have access to your records here, and I can review what the other doctors have documented. While I do that, could you perhaps tell me if you’ve been experiencing any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh…okay, good. That’s…relieving to hear you have the records. I’ve been…tired. A lot. More than usual, and it doesn't go away with rest. And I’ve had a cough. It started small, but it’s gotten worse. Sometimes it hurts to breathe, a little ache in my chest. That’s about it, I think. Mostly just tired and coughing.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Lucht. That’s helpful. And when you say it hurts to breathe, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It’s…not a sharp pain. More like a dull ache. It feels…deep inside. And it’s worse when I take a deep breath, or when I try to cough hard. It doesn't hurt all the time, just when I’m…doing something. Like walking up the stairs, or when I get really…emotional. Is that making sense? I’m trying to explain it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Lucht. A dull ache that worsens with exertion or deep breathing is very descriptive. Now, regarding the cough – is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: It…it brings stuff up. Sometimes. It’s…clear, mostly. But sometimes it's…a little bit yellow. Not a lot, though. It doesn't happen every time I cough, just…sometimes. And it smells…bad. I’m sorry, that’s probably…gross to talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Lucht. These details are important, and I assure you, I’ve discussed much more detailed symptoms with patients before. It's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable talking about these things, but it helps me understand what’s going on. The fact that you sometimes bring up yellow mucus is a useful piece of information. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had…the flu, a couple of times when I was younger. And a bad cold last winter. But nothing serious. My family…we didn't really go to the doctor much. I’m a widow, you see. My husband…he took care of everything. And after he passed…well, I haven't really needed to see anyone. Until now. I hope that makes sense. It’s a long story.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Lucht. I am very sorry to hear about your husband. It’s understandable that you haven’t needed to see a doctor much recently. And it’s perfectly alright to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Moving on, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve always been…pretty healthy, all my life. Until this. It’s just…scary. I don’t know what to expect. I keep thinking…what if it’s really bad? What if…I don’t make it? I’m sorry. I shouldn't be…bringing this up. You’re a doctor, you probably hear this all the time. I should just…let you do your job.
DOCTOR: Ms. Lucht, it’s perfectly alright to express your fears. It’s entirely normal to feel scared and anxious in this situation, and you are not bothering me at all. In fact, it's important for me to understand how you’re feeling so I can provide the best possible care. You are very brave for coming in today. Now, regarding your family history – are there any instances of cancer in your family, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or any other types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s…a good question. My mother…she had some kind of illness when she was older. I don’t remember exactly what it was. She passed away when I was young. My father…he was healthy, as far as I know. He worked on a ranch, mostly outdoors. He didn't…talk much about things like that. I don't think anyone else in the family had…cancer. But honestly, I don't really know. We weren’t a close family. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It feels like I’m not saying anything useful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Lucht. You’ve provided valuable information, and it’s not always possible to know the full medical history of family members. It sounds like you didn’t have much opportunity to discuss these things. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? Like…what I do every day? Well, I…I used to volunteer at the local school, helping with the kids. But I stopped after…after my husband passed away. I mostly stay home now. I read a lot. And I try to take walks, when the weather is nice. But I haven't been feeling up to it lately, with the cough and…everything. I don't…drink or smoke, if that’s what you’re asking. I’ve never really been interested in that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Lucht. That's helpful to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband used to give me medicine when I was sick, and I never had any problems. I don’t take any medicine regularly, except for…a vitamin D supplement, sometimes, in the winter. But that's about it. I hope that’s all. I feel like I’m rambling. I’m just…nervous.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. Lucht. You’ve answered all my questions very thoughtfully, and I appreciate you sharing everything with me. It sounds like you’ve lived a very healthy life, and I commend you for that. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I…trust you. Just…please be gentle. I’m a little worried about coughing during the exam. It hurts, sometimes. But…I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Lucht. We’ll take things at your pace, and I will be as gentle as possible. If you need to stop at any time, please let me know. And coughing is perfectly alright; we can pause whenever you need to. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs with the stethoscope. Please take deep breaths in and out. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds on the lower left side of your chest, and some mild wheezing. I also note a slight dullness to percussion in that area. This could indicate fluid buildup, but we need further investigation to determine the cause. Your heart sounds are normal, and your pulse is steady. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation level with this pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is slightly lower than normal. That could be related to the diminished breath sounds. Finally, I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes to check for any swelling. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Overall, the physical exam findings are concerning and warrant further investigation. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a CT scan of your chest to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. X-rays and…CT scans…will they hurt? I’m just…worried about more tests. But if you think it’s important, I trust you. What will the tests show? Will I know right away? I…I just want to know what’s happening. It’s scary, not knowing.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried about more tests, Ms. Lucht. I want to assure you that both X-rays and CT scans are non-invasive and generally painless. The X-ray uses a small amount of radiation, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. The CT scan may require a contrast dye, which is injected intravenously, but it is usually well-tolerated. Regarding what the tests will show, the X-ray will provide a general overview of your lungs and help identify any abnormalities, such as tumors or fluid buildup. The CT scan will provide a more detailed image and help determine the size, shape, and location of any abnormalities. We should have the results of the tests within 24 to 48 hours. Once we have the results, I will review them with you in detail and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any allergies to iodine or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. My husband always took care of…things like that. He would ask me about allergies before any tests. I don’t remember ever having a reaction to anything. I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to iodine, but…I can’t be completely certain. It’s been a long time. I just…don't remember. Is it important? Should I ask someone?
DOCTOR: It's good that your husband was diligent about asking about allergies. Since you're unsure, and to be on the safe side, I'm going to recommend a pre-contrast allergy assessment before the CT scan. This involves a simple questionnaire and potentially a small skin test to check for any reaction to the contrast dye. It's a standard precaution, and we want to ensure your safety. Now, while we wait for the test results, are there any symptoms you're experiencing that are particularly bothersome, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or fatigue?
PATIENT: The fatigue is the worst. I just…have no energy. Everything feels so hard. And the cough…it keeps me up at night. It’s worse when I lie down. Sometimes I feel…lightheaded when I cough hard. But the chest pain isn’t too bad, just…a dull ache, like I said. It’s just…everything is exhausting. Even talking feels tiring. I used to be so active, and now…I can barely walk up the stairs. It's scary how quickly things have changed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly frustrating and frightening to experience such a rapid decline in your energy levels and overall health. It's good you're sharing these details with me. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I'm going to prescribe you a cough suppressant to help you sleep at night, and an inhaler to help ease any shortness of breath. I also recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. Regarding the fatigue, it's important to pace yourself and avoid strenuous activities. We'll need to determine the underlying cause of the fatigue with the test results, but for now, prioritize rest and allow your body to recover. I'm going to have my nurse schedule the allergy assessment and the chest X-ray and CT scan for you. She will also provide you with the prescriptions for the cough suppressant and inhaler. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think…I think that’s everything. You’ve been very…patient with me. I’m still worried, of course. But I feel…a little bit better, knowing we’re doing something. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. When will the nurse call me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Lucht. It’s my pleasure to help. And it’s perfectly normal to feel worried; I would be concerned as well. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. The nurse should be calling you within the next hour to schedule the tests. She’ll explain the process in detail and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. We’re here to support you every step of the way. I’ll see you back in the clinic once we have the test results. Take care, Ms. Lucht, and remember to prioritize rest.
