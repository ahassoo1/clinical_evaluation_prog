DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my throat. It hurts. Badly. I don't have much time, if you don't mind. Just want to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time, we’ll do our best to get things sorted quickly. “Hurts badly” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More... well, it feels like something is stuck. And scratchy. Very scratchy. Like sandpaper, almost. It's been this way for... a few days, I think. Honestly, I don't keep track of such things. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know how long something’s been going on, yes, but don't worry if you aren’t precise. "A few days" is good enough for now. And sandpaper is a good description – that tells me a lot. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Worse when I… talk. Or swallow. Which is, you know, a problem. It's not always hurting, but when it does, it’s a sharp pain. Like a little… poke. Is this going to take long? I have things to do. Very important things.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain with talking and swallowing… that gives us more information. Not too long, Tammie, we’ll try to be efficient. Just a few more questions, then I’ll listen to your throat and see what’s going on. Have you had any fever, cough, or runny nose accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? I… don't know. I haven't felt feverish. No cough. Maybe a little stuffy sometimes? It's hard to say. I don't pay attention to those things. Honestly, Doctor, I just want something for the pain. Is that possible? It's very distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, maybe a little stuffiness. We can certainly discuss options for pain relief. Before we do that, just to be thorough, have you noticed any white spots or pus on your tonsils, or any difficulty breathing or swallowing liquids?
PATIENT: Pus? Oh, goodness. No, I haven't looked at my tonsils. I don’t… do that sort of thing. Difficulty breathing? No, not really. It’s just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Look, are you going to examine me or ask questions all day? I really need to be going soon. This is taking up too much of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Tammie. Let’s do a quick examination of your throat. It will only take a moment. If you could open your mouth wide and say “Ah,” that would be great.
PATIENT: Ah… Is this necessary? It's… quite intrusive. Just hurry, please. I have important things to attend to. Really important.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some redness and a little swelling. Your tonsils look a bit irritated, but nothing overly concerning at first glance. No visible pus, which is good. It does look like you're experiencing some inflammation. Now, have you been around anyone who has been sick recently?
PATIENT: Sick? I… work with machines all day. People are always coughing and sneezing around me, but I don't pay attention. It’s a factory, Doctor. Everyone is always sick with something. It wouldn’t be unusual. I doubt it’s important. Are you going to give me something or not? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, working in a factory with frequent exposure to illness… that’s good information. Given your symptoms and the lack of high fever or other severe signs, it sounds like you likely have a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat caused by a virus. We usually don’t prescribe antibiotics for viral infections, as they won’t help. However, we can definitely manage your symptoms to make you more comfortable. Do you have any allergies to medications, particularly pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t think so. I’ve taken things before. Painkillers, mostly. Whatever the shopkeeper gave me. I don’t keep track of brands or ingredients. Honestly, Doctor, I just want something that will stop the pain. I have a very busy schedule and I can’t afford to be sick. This is a waste of my time. Can you just write me a prescription, please?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Given your discomfort and the need for quick relief, I can recommend over-the-counter lozenges to soothe your throat. They can provide temporary pain relief. I would also suggest taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen as directed on the package for pain and inflammation, unless you have any contraindications that you are aware of. I'm also going to write you a note explaining you have been seen for a sore throat and are being managed with over-the-counter medications. Do you have any issues with swallowing pills?
PATIENT: Pills? No. I can manage. I've taken worse. Just give me something, anything, to make this stop. Look, I really have to go now. I'm losing valuable time. Can I just get the note and be on my way? I'm sure it's nothing serious. I've dealt with worse in the factory. It’s probably just dust. A lot of dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, here's the note. As you're aware, I recommend over-the-counter lozenges and acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed. If your symptoms worsen, such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing, please seek immediate medical attention. Please keep me updated if you aren’t improving in the next few days. Thank you for coming in today, Tammie. I hope you feel better soon. .
