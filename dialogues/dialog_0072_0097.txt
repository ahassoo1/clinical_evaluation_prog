DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 44 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. I am Marija Chilla. Actually, it’s a bit…sensitive. My husband and I have been discussing, well, planning for…the inevitable. He suggested I get one of those forms, an Advance Directive, I believe he called it? Or perhaps a POLST form? I'm not entirely clear on the difference, to be honest. We just want to be prepared, should anything…unforeseen happen.
DOCTOR: I see. Advance care planning is… prudent, certainly. It’s good of you and your husband to be thinking about this now. There is a difference between an Advance Directive and a POLST form, and it’s understandable to be confused. An Advance Directive, often a Living Will, outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to speak for yourself. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a medical order based on your current wishes and is for those with a serious illness or frailty. Before we delve into the specifics of forms, though, let’s get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Doctor Armand Dubois. He’s… quite good, though sometimes a bit too focused on the physical, if you understand my meaning. He doesn’t always appreciate the… finer points of a patient’s wellbeing. But he’s competent. I see him annually, for a check-up. Though, frankly, I’m perfectly healthy. I maintain a very…disciplined lifestyle. I doubt any of this is truly necessary, but my husband is… particular.
DOCTOR: A disciplined lifestyle is commendable, Ms. Chilla. However, even the healthiest individuals can benefit from proactive planning. And it’s wise to ensure all your healthcare providers are on the same page. Let's start with a brief review of your medical history, just to have a comprehensive picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything similar?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I have never been diagnosed with any such… ailments. I maintain a very strict diet, regular exercise, and a generally… elevated mental state. I find a lot of people fall ill simply due to poor choices, a lack of self-discipline, and frankly, a negative outlook. I assure you, Doctor, my health is… exemplary. It’s rather insulting to even suggest otherwise. Though, I suppose it's your job to ask. I simply don't have a medical history worth noting.
DOCTOR: Very well. No chronic medical conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid any such… indignities. I find preventative care and a strong constitution are far more effective than relying on… interventions. I've only ever had the standard childhood vaccinations, and even those were… regrettable. My husband insisted, of course. But beyond that, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. I pride myself on maintaining my physical integrity. It’s a rather important principle, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, family. A complicated subject. My mother… she was prone to migraines. Terrible, debilitating migraines. And my father… well, he succumbed to what the doctors called “heart failure,” but I suspect it was largely due to his… poor lifestyle choices. He enjoyed his wine, shall we say, and wasn't one for physical activity. A rather undisciplined man, frankly. And my siblings… they all seem to have inherited his… weaknesses. Nothing truly serious, mind you, just a general lack of… fortitude. It's a rather unfortunate genetic predisposition, but I have actively worked to counteract it, of course.
DOCTOR: Migraines in your mother, heart failure in your father, and a general lack of…fortitude in your siblings. Noted. Now, briefly, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: My social history? I fail to see the relevance, Doctor. I maintain a respectable household with my husband. We have a… quiet life, focused on intellectual pursuits and cultural enrichment. We do not engage in… frivolous activities. We occasionally attend the opera and support local charities. I don’t spend my time… socializing for the sake of it. Is this truly necessary? It feels rather… intrusive. I find a person's social life is hardly indicative of their overall health. Though, my husband does enjoy a weekly game of bridge with his colleagues. Is that what you are interested in?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Chilla. Lifestyle factors can certainly impact health. Just to be thorough, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, do I look like someone who would engage in such…debauchery? I maintain a strict adherence to healthy habits. I have never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband enjoys a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally, but I myself abstain entirely. And the notion of recreational drugs is… frankly, appalling. I find it rather insulting that you would even ask. I assure you, my lifestyle is beyond reproach. It’s a testament to discipline and self-control, qualities I find sorely lacking in many people. I do drink herbal tea, if that is what you meant. Chamomile, primarily, for its calming properties.
DOCTOR: No smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drugs. Chamomile tea. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… That is a good question. I recall a slight reaction to penicillin as a child, a mild rash. But that was decades ago. I have no known allergies to food, pollen, or… anything else of note. My husband always ensures any medications he acquires for me are thoroughly vetted. He is very meticulous about such things. Though, I do find some perfumes… unpleasant. They tend to give me a headache, but I wouldn’t classify that as an allergy. It’s simply a matter of… sensitivity. And lavender, ironically, also causes a similar reaction. Rather inconvenient, really. Otherwise, no, I am remarkably resilient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. Given your reported medical history – or rather, lack thereof – and your current condition, a physical examination would be…prudent, simply to confirm your overall health status. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? After all this… questioning? Honestly, Doctor, I find it rather unnecessary. I assure you, I am in excellent health. It seems a bit…demeaning, frankly, to subject myself to such scrutiny. But… I suppose if it’s standard procedure, and it will expedite this process, very well. But I expect it to be… thorough, and respectful. I do not appreciate being poked and prodded unnecessarily. And I trust your methods are… hygienic?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Chilla. Hygiene is paramount. We will proceed with a standard examination. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a brief abdominal examination. If you would kindly remove your jacket…
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must reiterate, I find this rather unnecessary. One expects a certain level of… efficiency, Doctor. I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, and I do not wish to be delayed any longer than is absolutely necessary. Let us proceed, then. But please, be gentle. I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16, unlabored. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses palpated. Everything appears normal at this point, Ms. Chilla. Although, as you are quite thin, I would like to check your reflexes and assess your muscle strength to ensure there is no underlying issue. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Reflexes and muscle strength? Doctor, are you implying something? I assure you, I maintain a rigorous exercise regimen. I am perfectly capable, and my physical condition is… exemplary. But… very well. If it will expedite this process and satisfy your… procedural requirements, proceed. Though, I trust this will be conducted with the utmost discretion and…respect. I do not appreciate being treated as though I am… fragile. And please, do not expect me to perform any… acrobatic feats.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Chilla. This is simply a standard assessment. Please relax your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Reflexes are normal, and muscle strength is within normal limits. Ms. Chilla, while your physical examination is unremarkable, your reported history of a disciplined lifestyle and no significant medical events is… somewhat unusual. Have you had any recent blood work performed?
PATIENT: Unusual? Doctor, I assure you, my lifestyle is not a medical anomaly. It is a testament to self-discipline and prudent living, qualities sorely lacking in modern society. As for blood work… no, I have not had any recent blood work performed. My husband handles all such matters, and he has not deemed it necessary. He is quite meticulous about my health, and if he hasn't recommended it, I trust his judgment implicitly. Frankly, I find this line of questioning… intrusive, and rather insulting. Are you implying I am somehow… deficient?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I am not implying anything. However, given your age and your consistently healthy profile, a baseline blood work panel – a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and lipid panel – would be prudent to establish a benchmark for future health assessments. It would allow us to monitor any potential changes over time and ensure your continued well-being. It’s a preventative measure, nothing more. Now, regarding your original concern about Advance Care Planning…do you have specific questions about the difference between an Advance Directive and a POLST form, or would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: A preventative measure... Honestly, Doctor, it feels as though you are deliberately attempting to prolong this consultation. My husband already has all of this information, and he has assured me that he is well-versed in these matters. However… since you insist, and to finally expedite this process, a brief explanation of these forms would be… acceptable. But please, keep it concise. I have a luncheon engagement to attend, and my time is valuable. Begin, then. What, precisely, is the difference between an Advance Directive and this… POLST form? And which one is most suitable for a woman of my…condition?
DOCTOR: Very well. An Advance Directive, or Living Will, outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to communicate them yourself – for example, if you’re in a coma or have a severe stroke. It covers things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, artificial nutrition, and pain management. It’s a broad document, applicable to a wide range of scenarios. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is different. It’s a medical order, based on your current wishes and health status, specifically for those with a serious illness or frailty. It’s much more specific – it details what treatments you want now, and it’s typically used by those with a limited life expectancy. Given your consistently good health, an Advance Directive is likely the more appropriate choice at this time. It allows you to clearly outline your wishes for the future, should the need ever arise. A POLST form is generally reserved for those with a more immediate health concern. Do you understand the distinction?
PATIENT: I believe I… comprehend the difference, though it seems rather… morbid to contemplate such scenarios. An Advance Directive for the future, and this POLST form for…the imminent. Honestly, it feels rather… unnecessary. My husband is perfectly capable of making informed decisions on my behalf, and I trust his judgment implicitly. But… if it is simply a matter of completing a form, to satisfy procedural requirements, then I suppose I am amenable. Where does one acquire such a document? And does it require a notary? I do not wish to be inconvenienced any further than is absolutely necessary. And please, assure me that this information will be kept confidential. I do not wish to be the subject of… speculation.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Chilla. Your privacy is paramount. Advance Directive forms are available at most hospitals and online through state-specific resources. You can also find them through the American Hospital Association website. Most states do require the form to be witnessed by two adults, and some require notarization. I can provide you with a list of resources specific to our state, including information on notarization requirements. Here’s a brochure with information on Advance Directives, including contact information for local legal resources if you wish to consult with an attorney. It also lists the specific requirements for our state. Do you have any further questions about Advance Care Planning, or shall we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No. I believe that is… sufficient. Honestly, Doctor, this entire process has been rather… tedious. I assure you, my health is perfectly stable, and I do not anticipate requiring any… interventions in the foreseeable future. I shall discuss this brochure with my husband, and he can determine whether further action is necessary. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though I must reiterate, I found this consultation to be… unnecessarily prolonged. I trust you will refrain from further inquiries regarding my… hypothetical health concerns. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon engagement to attend. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. Have a pleasant day. .
