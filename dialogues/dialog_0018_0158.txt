DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's about a letter. A letter for my… pet. I need a letter saying I can have him, you see. Some place needs it. Honestly, the bureaucracy these days… It’s just… a letter. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wrye. A letter regarding your pet. Certainly, I can assist you with that. However, to properly complete such a document, I'll need a bit more information. It’s important to ensure the letter is accurate and meets the requirements of the requesting entity. Could you tell me what kind of pet you have, and what organization requires this letter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s a… a dog, I believe. Yes, a dog. A lovely one, really. As for who needs the letter… Honestly, I can’t quite recall. It was something to do with… renting? Maybe an apartment? I just know they wouldn’t let me bring him without it. Everything is so… complicated these days. It wasn’t a big place, though, if that helps. A small building.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye, no need to worry. We'll figure this out together. It sounds like the letter may be required by a landlord as part of your rental agreement. To ensure I can write a comprehensive letter, could you tell me a little more about your dog?
PATIENT: Oh, a landlord, yes, that sounds right! He's… well, he's a good size. Not too big, not too small. Brown, mostly. And… fluffy. He sheds, terribly, I’m afraid. A real mess, sometimes. He's a rescue, you know. A very good boy, though. Very good. I don't remember where I got him, exactly. Everything is just… a bit hazy, these days. Is the color important?
DOCTOR: The color isn't essential, Ms. Wrye, but it can be helpful for identification. Knowing he's a rescue is also good information. Do you happen to know his approximate age or breed?
PATIENT: Breed… oh dear. I really haven’t a clue. He just is. A dog. A lovely, brown, fluffy dog. Age… hmm. Maybe… three? Four? He wasn’t a puppy when I got him, that much I remember. Not a little thing, anyway. He was already… grown. A bit lazy, if I’m honest. He likes naps. A lot of naps. Does it really matter what his breed is? It seems awfully specific, doesn't it? I just want the letter!
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Wrye. It does seem quite specific. However, some rental agreements have stipulations regarding breed or size. Knowing these details will help ensure the letter is accepted. Since you're unsure of the breed, we can simply describe him as a medium-sized brown dog. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Medium-sized… yes, that sounds about right. Brown, definitely brown. And fluffy. Don’t forget fluffy! Honestly, the shedding is a nightmare. Alright, medium-sized, brown, fluffy… just get the letter done, please. Is there anything else you need to know? I have things to do, you see. Not that they’re terribly important, but… things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. Just a few more questions to ensure I have a complete picture. Has your dog had any recent medical issues, or is he currently on any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. I don’t think so. He seems perfectly healthy, honestly. A bit overweight, perhaps, but who isn’t these days? He eats… well, he eats whatever I give him, I suppose. No special diet. He’s been to the vet… sometime. I can’t recall when, exactly. A routine check-up, I believe. No illnesses, no, not that I remember. He just sleeps a lot. Is sleeping a medical issue? He snores, terribly, you know. Loudly. Perhaps that’s something to mention in the letter?
DOCTOR: I don’t believe snoring is typically a medical concern requiring mention in the letter, Ms. Wrye. It’s good to know he’s been to the vet for a routine check-up, even if you don’t recall the exact date. To confirm, he hasn’t been diagnosed with any specific medical conditions, and he isn't currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no conditions. No medications. Just a sleepy, brown, fluffy dog who sheds a lot and likes naps. Honestly, that about sums him up. Can we please get to the letter now? I’m starting to feel a bit… flustered, if I’m honest. All these questions… it’s bringing on a headache.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wrye. My apologies for the extensive questioning. I simply wanted to be thorough. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical examination. I'd like to listen to his heart and lungs, check his weight, and briefly examine his skin and coat. This will help me confirm he’s in good health, which I can then include in the letter. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination. Of him? Here? Now? Well… I suppose it’s necessary. But please be gentle. He doesn’t like strangers touching his tummy. And he might lick you. He likes people, mostly. Just… be prepared. And quickly, if you don’t mind. I really do have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please, bring him in when you’re ready. I’ll be ready to receive him.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss over a dog… It’s just a letter! Coming, Doctor! Just give me a moment to coax him out of his nap… He gets grumpy when disturbed, you know.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Wrye. We’ll wait patiently.
