DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like all I do is go. Not… not a problem, exactly, just… frequent. My wife, bless her heart, she keeps nudging me to come see someone. Says I’m disrupting her stories on the television. Old age, I suppose. Though I don't feel old.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. And it's a relatively new development, or has this been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… that’s a difficult one. It’s not sudden, not like a switch flipped. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe a few months? Hard to say, really. I’m usually out in the fields, busy with things. Don't pay attention to such things. My wife keeps better track of these matters. She'll tell you precisely when it started, down to the day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And would you describe it as a complete emptying of your bladder each time, or do you feel you have to go back shortly after?
PATIENT: Complete? Well, I think so. Usually. Sometimes… sometimes it feels like there’s a little bit left. Not much, mind you. Just enough to… well, you know. Make you want to go again soon after. It's bothersome, but not terrible. Honestly, I've probably just got a weak bladder. It happens when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Burning? Heavens, no. It’s just… the urge, you see? Comes on strong, and then… well, you have to go. It's not a comfortable feeling, but it doesn’t hurt. I’ve had real pain before, from fixing fences and such. This isn’t like that. It's… a nuisance, mostly. A silly little nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? It gets cool at night, of course. We keep the house a little drafty to keep the bugs away. But no chills. And my stomach… feels alright. A little gassy sometimes, from the cabbage my wife makes, but nothing that would bother me. I'm a sturdy man, you know. Always have been. These little aches and pains… they don’t worry me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, old man things, I suppose. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once. Years ago. I take a little pill for it, when I remember. My wife keeps track of those, too. And… something with my knees. Arthritis, maybe? They ache when it rains. I don’t see much point in dwelling on it. It’s just part of getting older. Honestly, I've always been a healthy man, right up until recently.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and arthritis. And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, besides the pill you mentioned for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes I take something for the knees. An over-the-counter thing, I think. My wife buys it. A cream, mostly. Rub it on. Doesn’t do a lot of good, but it feels nice. And… sometimes a pain reliever if they’re really bothering me. But I don’t take much of anything regularly, if that’s what you’re asking. I prefer to let things heal on their own.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though, I don't go around taking a lot of pills. That's my wife who tries all sorts of things, and she tells me if anything makes me feel funny. She's a practical woman. I've never been one for fussing with doctors and such. Unless something really bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me about any major surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh, years ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix taken out. That was a long time ago. And… I had a hernia repaired, I think. Something with my stomach. But that was also a long time ago. I don't recall many details. It all happened so quickly. I was young and strong then. I recovered quickly.
DOCTOR: And finally, is there any family history of medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my father, he had a weak heart, I think. He didn’t live to be very old. And my mother… she had trouble with her legs, near the end. Swelling, mostly. As for kidney problems or diabetes, I don’t really know. We weren’t a family that talked much about such things. We were too busy working the farm. It’s not like these days, with everyone worrying about every little ailment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. We’ll also need a urine sample.
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination? Well… I suppose so. Though I don’t see what good poking and prodding will do. I told you, it’s just a weak bladder. Still, if you think it’s necessary… I just hope it doesn't take too long. My wife is expecting me to help her with the tomatoes. They're ripening quickly. And a urine sample… where exactly do you want me to…?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, let’s proceed. First, please follow me to the restroom. There’s a collection cup in there. Try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample about halfway through. I'll explain as you go. After that, we'll check your blood pressure and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Right this way.
PATIENT: A mid-stream… well, that sounds complicated. My wife always said I wasn’t one for following instructions. But alright, alright. Let’s get this over with. Tomatoes aren't going to pick themselves, are they? Just hope I remember what you said about the… mid-stream. It all sounds very scientific.
DOCTOR: It’s quite simple, Mr. Segretto. Just relax, and I'll explain everything clearly. Don't worry, it's a routine procedure. And yes, tomatoes are important. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Do take your time.
