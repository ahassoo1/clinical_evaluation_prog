DOCTOR: Hi Deloris, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s…nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, it’s a bit of a fuss, isn’t it? My landlord, you see… he’s being difficult. Something about needing a letter for…a pet? I barely remember getting a pet, but he's insisting. Something about rules and regulations. It's all a bit much, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so he needs a letter from me stating you're a patient here, and… confirming you have a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A letter. That’s all. It’s not like I’m ill or anything, just paperwork. Honestly, these things. Do you need to know what kind of pet it is? I...don't recall. A small one, I think? Maybe? It just appeared one day. Honestly, people these days… bringing things into your life without asking. It’s terribly disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get worked up over it. We can definitely get a letter sorted for you. Knowing the type of pet isn't essential for the letter itself, but it might be helpful for our records. And just to be thorough, have you had any medical issues recently, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical issues… Let me think. Everything feels a bit…fuzzy, to be honest. I had a little… something with my back a while back? A twinge? But it went away. And my knees creak a bit when it rains, but that's just getting old, isn't it? Nothing serious, truly. I'm generally quite… robust. Though, I did have a rather bad headache last week, but I just took some of those… what are they called? The little pills. They helped. Honestly, I don't like bothering doctors unless absolutely necessary. It's all a waste of time, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a twinge in your back, creaky knees, and a headache last week that responded to over-the-counter medication. That’s helpful to know. Just to get a clearer picture, when you say a "twinge" in your back, can you describe where exactly it was, and how long ago that happened?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Details… It was… lower back, I think? On the left side. It happened… oh, months ago. Maybe six months? Seven? It wasn’t anything debilitating, just a little… discomfort. It flared up when I bent over to pick something up, and then it went away. Like I said, not serious. I just rubbed some cream on it and it was fine. Honestly, I don’t remember much beyond that. It's just… life, isn't it? Things ache and then they don't. Why make a fuss?
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, left side, about six to seven months ago, resolved with cream. And you mentioned your knees creak when it rains. Is that a constant issue, or only when the weather changes?
PATIENT: Only when it rains, dear. Or when it’s very cold. It’s just…old age, I tell you. Like a rusty gate. Not painful, just…noticeable. It doesn’t stop me from doing anything. Honestly, I'm still quite active, you know. I go to…well, I get out. I walk. I do things. It's just a little creaking. And truthfully, I suspect it's all the walking I do. Everything has a price, doesn’t it? Now, about this letter…are we getting closer?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting closer. Just a few more questions, and then we’ll get that letter sorted for you. Have you been taking any medications regularly, besides the over-the-counter pain relief for the headache?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… Let me think. No, not really. Just the occasional… little pill for a headache, as I mentioned. And sometimes, when my… digestion isn't quite right. But nothing regularly. I prefer to… take care of things naturally, you know? Lots of water. Healthy food. That sort of thing. Honestly, I don’t like filling my body with chemicals. It’s terribly unnatural. And frankly, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast, let alone what medications I'm taking. It's all a bit of a blur, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications. Just as-needed pain relief for headaches, and something for digestion occasionally. And you mentioned you've been quite active - can you tell me a little bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I like to get out and about. I enjoy… visiting friends. And I walk a lot. I used to do… a bit more, but honestly, these days it's mostly just strolling. I go to the park sometimes, people-watch. And I like to shop, naturally. Though it's tiring, all that walking. Honestly, it’s not terribly strenuous. I'm not running marathons, if that's what you're thinking! Just…keeping busy. Maintaining a semblance of a social life. It's important, you know. Though it does leave me rather exhausted sometimes, if I'm honest. Especially all that…bending and stretching in the shops. Honestly, it's a wonder I haven't broken a hip!
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. It’s good to stay active. Now, just a couple of final questions, and then we can move on to the letter. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I'm aware of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat… pretty much everything. Though I don’t particularly like shellfish. But that's a matter of taste, not an allergy! Honestly, I've always been quite robust, as I mentioned. I don't fuss over food. A little spice here and there, but nothing drastic. Honestly, people these days are so sensitive about everything. A little sniffle and they're convinced they're allergic to the air! No, I haven't any allergies. As far as I recall. Though, now that I think about it… there was that one time with the… oh, never mind. It was years ago. Not important. It wasn't an allergy. Just a…disagreement with my stomach. Now, are we finally getting to this letter?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are finally getting to the letter! And just one last quick question: Do you have any family history of any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Now you're asking things! Honestly, my family… well, they were a bit of a scattered bunch. I didn’t keep close track. My mother… she lived to a good age, I think? But she wasn’t terribly forthcoming with details about her health. And my father… well, he wasn’t around much. Honestly, I wouldn't know if anyone in my family had any of those…diseases. It’s all a bit of a blur. Honestly, I suspect they were all too busy living their lives to worry about such things. Now, can we please get to this letter? I have a luncheon to attend, and I'm already running late!
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No problem at all. It sounds like you’re generally quite healthy, and it’s perfectly fine that you don’t have a detailed family medical history. Let me just type up a quick letter confirming you're a patient here, and that you have a pet. I’ll make a note to document your general good health and that you haven't reported any significant medical concerns. Just to be clear for the landlord, is there anything specific he needs to know about the pet?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! Finally. No, no specifics. He just wants proof I have one. Honestly, the man is… particular. He probably just wants to make sure I’m not keeping a rhinoceros in the apartment. Though I wouldn’t dream of it! Honestly, a small one is all. Perhaps a…cat? Or a dog? I truly can’t recall. Anything that doesn’t…shed excessively, preferably. Now, how long will this letter take? I really must be going. Honestly, these luncheons… people will talk!
DOCTOR: Here you go. It states you’re a patient here, and confirms you have a pet. I’ve also noted your good overall health in your chart. Hopefully, that will satisfy your landlord. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you, dear. That should do it nicely. Honestly, you’ve been very patient with me. My memory isn’t what it used to be, as you’ve probably noticed. No, I think that’s everything. Just this letter. Thank you again, dear. You’ve been a lifesaver. Now, I really must be off. People are expecting me. Honestly, luncheons wait for no one! Good day to you!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. It was a pleasure meeting you. Enjoy your luncheon! And don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day.
