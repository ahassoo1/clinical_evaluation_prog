DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. Just…tired. Real tired. And I’ve been…eating dirt. Not on purpose, you know? Just…craving it. It’s weird, okay? Can we just…figure out what’s wrong and get it over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re feeling very tired and experiencing unusual cravings. We’ll definitely try to figure out what’s going on as efficiently as possible. When you say “eating dirt,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It's…clay, mostly. Red clay. From the…back of my property, I think? Honestly, I don't remember exactly where. It just…feels good in my mouth. Don't judge me. And it started a few months ago, maybe? Everything's kinda blurry these days. It’s not like I'm going out of my way for it, but if I'm outside...I find myself. You know? Just…picking at it. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging you at all, Ms. Cantoran. It's important to be honest about everything, and I appreciate you telling me this. That craving for clay is something we need to investigate. It's a condition called pica, and it can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. You mentioned it started a few months ago and that things feel blurry these days. Can you describe what you mean by “blurry”?
PATIENT: Blurry…like…I forget things. Important things. What I had for breakfast. Where I put my keys. Even…names, sometimes. It’s not all the time, but it’s happening more and more. And I just…don’t have the energy to do things. Everything feels like a huge effort. My garden…it's a mess. I used to love that garden. Now? Forget it. I just sit. A lot. Is that…normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so memory problems and fatigue are also new symptoms. And you're saying these started around the same time as the cravings for clay?
PATIENT: I think so. Everything's kinda…mushed together now. A few months, definitely. Maybe spring? Look, I’m not good with dates, okay? I just…felt more tired. Started forgetting things. And then…one day I was outside and…I just had to have some dirt. It sounds crazy, I know. Are you gonna think I’m losing it? Because my daughter…she keeps saying I should slow down. But I have things to do!
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, you’re not losing it at all. It’s good you’re aware of these changes, and I’m here to help figure out what’s going on. It's very helpful you're sharing all of this with me. Let’s go through a bit more detail. First, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… Honestly? I don’t really remember. I went to a doctor years ago, when my husband was still alive. But that was…a long time ago. They probably checked my blood pressure or something. I don’t recall anything specific. Maybe I had the flu once? I just…can't remember. I was always healthy, though. Always worked. Always busy. I never had time to be sick. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited recall of past medical history. That’s alright, we can work with that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I take…nothing. Never really needed to. I try to avoid pills if I can. They make me feel…funny. Honestly, I don't even see a doctor unless something's really bad. And it's been a long time. This…dirt thing…is just weird. Can we just figure out what’s causing the tiredness and…the cravings? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and currently not taking any medications. I understand your frustration and wanting to get to the bottom of this quickly. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he was a strong man. Worked hard his whole life. I don't recall him being sick much. Honestly, we didn't talk about that kind of thing. Just didn't. Everyone on both sides… pretty sturdy folks, I guess. Not much sick leave, if that makes any sense. Is that helpful? I really don't remember a lot about their health. It’s been a long time. .
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of possible heart condition in your mother and generally healthy relatives. That's helpful. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
