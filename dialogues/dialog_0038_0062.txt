DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Auelua. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here regarding the requirements at my place of work… about wearing masks and other protective equipment. It’s causing me some difficulty, and I was hoping to discuss a possible exemption.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it sounds like you’re having trouble with the requirements at work – the masks and protective equipment – and you’re looking into whether a medical exemption might be possible. Can you tell me a bit more about what difficulties you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Well, it's not a simple thing to explain. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and a good portion of my job involves being… present with people. Being able to read faces and body language is very important. The masks… they make that much harder. Also, I have some… sensitivities, and the feeling of things on my face for long periods is quite uncomfortable. It makes concentrating on the people I’m helping very difficult, and I need to be fully present for them.
DOCTOR: Right, that makes sense. Protective Service Work does rely heavily on non-verbal cues. And it's good you're recognizing the impact it's having on your ability to do your job effectively. When you say sensitivities, can you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… a feeling of being restricted, almost. I’ve always been a bit particular about what touches my skin. Not an allergy, mind you. More… a strong dislike for certain textures and the feeling of being confined. When I wear a mask for a long time, it makes me feel… anxious, and a little disconnected. It's hard to explain, but it interferes with my ability to focus on the people I’m assisting. It’s like… a wall between us, even though I’m trying to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it sounds like there’s a sensory component to this, causing anxiety and difficulty concentrating when you’re wearing a mask for extended periods. Have you experienced this feeling before, or is it new since the mask requirements at work?
PATIENT: It’s… always been there, Doctor, but it’s definitely been made worse by the mask requirements. As a child, I didn’t like tight collars, or hats that felt too heavy. Just things pressing on my head or face. But I could usually avoid them. Now, with my work… it’s unavoidable. It's been getting progressively harder to manage since they made the mask-wearing mandatory. It impacts my ability to de-escalate situations, and really connect with the individuals I’m trying to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a pre-existing sensitivity that's being exacerbated by the current situation at work. That’s good to know. Have you ever been formally evaluated for any sensory sensitivities or anxiety?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. We didn’t have much access to those kinds of resources where I grew up. It was always just something I… managed. I learned to avoid situations that triggered it, and I’ve generally been able to cope. It's only recently, with the mask requirements, that it’s become a significant issue. I’ve never needed to seek professional help before now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing that with me. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall health history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am generally quite healthy, thankfully. I have managed high blood pressure for some time now, and I take medication for that. Otherwise, I don't have any other significant medical conditions. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I am physically active whenever possible. I also have Medicare, if that’s helpful information.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, well-controlled hypertension, and otherwise healthy. And you're covered by Medicare. Thanks for letting me know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the medication for my blood pressure. I take it daily, as prescribed. No vitamins, supplements, or anything else. I try to keep things as simple as possible. I believe in a natural approach to health whenever feasible, and I find that diet and exercise are usually sufficient for maintaining my overall well-being.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any known allergies. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I am aware. I can eat most foods without issue, and I haven’t had any adverse reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past. I consider myself quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No allergies, just medication for hypertension. Now, let’s quickly go over your past surgical history, if any. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t had any surgeries. I’ve been very fortunate to avoid needing any surgical interventions. I’ve always been careful to maintain my health and avoid risky behaviors, and I’ve generally been able to manage any health issues without resorting to surgical treatment. I am grateful for my good health, and I hope to continue to avoid needing any surgeries in the future.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No past surgical history. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a bit complicated, Doctor. My family… we don’t have a strong history of specific illnesses, at least not that I’m aware of. It’s difficult to track, as many of my ancestors lived a traditional lifestyle, and medical records weren't kept. There was some heart trouble on my mother’s side, but beyond that, I don’t have much information to share. There’s also a history of… resilience, if that counts. We’re a strong people, and we tend to endure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some heart trouble on your mother's side, and a general history of resilience. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. I've never been inclined towards those habits. I find that a healthy lifestyle and strong relationships are far more rewarding. I prioritize my well-being, and I believe in making choices that support my physical and mental health. I also value my community, and I strive to be a positive influence on those around me.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I understand the need for a physical exam, and I am happy to cooperate. Please proceed at your convenience. I trust your professional judgment, and I am confident that you will provide me with the best possible care. I will do my best to remain still and follow any instructions you may have.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's a little elevated, but within an acceptable range, given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Good. Now, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Everything looks good so far. Now, I’d like to check your neurological function, just a basic assessment. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am able to follow your finger without difficulty. I’m happy to cooperate with any further assessments you may have. I want to be thorough and ensure we have a complete understanding of my health status. I’m doing my best to remain still and attentive.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am able to squeeze your hands with a good amount of strength. Please let me know if you require any further assessments. I am committed to providing you with any information you may need. I understand the importance of a thorough examination, and I am happy to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Alright. Finally, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal. Given your history of managed hypertension, and the findings from the exam, I don't suspect any underlying medical conditions contributing to your sensitivity to masks. It sounds like you are experiencing a sensory aversion, possibly exacerbated by anxiety. Would you be open to discussing some strategies for managing this, and potentially exploring a referral to a specialist who can help with anxiety or sensory processing?
PATIENT: That is a relief to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to conduct a thorough examination. Yes, I would be very open to discussing strategies for managing this. And a referral to a specialist sounds like a good idea as well, if you believe it would be helpful. I want to find a way to continue doing my job effectively, and I am willing to explore any options that might assist me. Perhaps there are techniques I could learn to better cope with the anxiety, or ways to modify my approach to minimize the discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, let’s talk about some strategies. First, mindful breathing exercises can be very helpful for managing anxiety. There are many resources online and apps available that can guide you through these. Secondly, progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce tension. It involves systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. Finally, it might be helpful to try different types of masks. Some are more comfortable than others, and finding the right fit can make a big difference. As for the referral, I think it would be beneficial to see a therapist specializing in anxiety and sensory processing. They can help you develop coping mechanisms and explore potential underlying causes. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to someone in the area?
PATIENT: Those strategies sound very helpful, Doctor. I’m definitely willing to try them. I’ve heard of mindful breathing exercises, but I’ve never actually practiced them. I’ll look into some resources online and see if I can incorporate them into my daily routine. The idea of progressive muscle relaxation also sounds appealing. And yes, I would be very grateful if you could provide me with a referral to a therapist specializing in anxiety and sensory processing. I want to explore all available options, and I believe professional guidance would be invaluable. Thank you for your thoughtful suggestions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Okay, I’m sending a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a therapist specializing in anxiety and sensory integration therapy. Her contact information and a brief description of her services will be sent to the email address we have on file. Also, I'll write a brief note summarizing our conversation and your concerns. As for a work note, do you need documentation for your employer regarding the possible need for accommodations?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a work note would be very helpful. Something stating that I’ve discussed my sensitivities with you, and that we are exploring potential accommodations would be greatly appreciated. It might assist in facilitating a more understanding conversation with my employer. Thank you for being so thorough and accommodating. I truly appreciate your assistance in this matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, here's a note for your employer. It states that you've been evaluated and are under my care for sensitivities that may be exacerbated by wearing masks for extended periods. It also mentions that we are exploring potential accommodations. It does not specify the exact nature of the accommodations, as that needs to be discussed with your employer. To summarize, we've discussed your concerns, performed a physical exam, and I don't suspect any underlying medical condition. We are pursuing strategies for managing anxiety and a referral to Dr. Vance. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been incredibly helpful and thorough, and I feel much more confident moving forward. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously and providing me with such thoughtful guidance. I’ll follow up with Dr. Vance and begin exploring those strategies you mentioned.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the future. Take care, and I wish you all the best. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. Have a good day. .
