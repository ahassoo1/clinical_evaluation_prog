DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, to put it plainly, I feel like I need a bit of… a jumpstart, if you will. I’m not sick, not exactly. Just… old, I suppose. And a little tired of feeling old. I’m hoping you can help me feel a bit more like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common to want to feel your best at any age, and "tired of feeling old" is a perfectly valid reason to come see me. Let's try to figure out what's going on and see what we can do. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “not feeling like yourself”?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. Things just take more effort now, you know? Getting up in the morning, even. And I used to be very active, gardening mostly, but I don't have the energy for it anymore. My memory isn't what it used to be, though I don’t think it’s bad bad, just… slower. And I seem to be bruising easier than I used to. Little things, mostly. But they add up, you see? It's just not how I used to feel.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see. Those are all things we should definitely look into. So, let’s start with the bruising. Have you noticed any specific areas where you bruise more easily?
PATIENT: Oh, my arms, mostly. If I bump into something, even lightly, I get a mark. And my hands sometimes, just from… well, from doing things around the house. It didn't used to be like this. It’s not painful, usually, just… noticeable. And a bit worrying, to be honest. Is that normal for someone my age? I always thought bruises were for children who fall off their bicycles.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re bringing this up. Bruising more easily can be more common as we get older, simply because the skin and blood vessels become more fragile. But it's also important to rule out other possibilities. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes, Doctor. I’ve been managing it with medication for… oh, maybe ten years now? My regular doctor, Dr. Camacho, keeps a close eye on it. I don’t have diabetes, thankfully. And no heart trouble, as far as I know. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees when I was younger, but it doesn’t bother me much anymore. Mostly just a little stiffness in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And you said you’re currently taking medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. It’s… let me see… Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. A small white pill. I take one every morning, right after breakfast. Dr. Camacho increased the dosage about six months ago, because my numbers were a little high at my last checkup. He said it was nothing to worry about, just a small adjustment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, if I need it. And I take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one from the pharmacy. Oh! And sometimes, if I'm feeling particularly achy, I'll take some fish oil capsules. My daughter swears by them for her joints. I can’t say I’ve noticed a huge difference, but she insists. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful information, thank you. We need to consider everything. Now, let’s quickly go over any allergies you have. Any reactions to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, thankfully, not much. I’m not allergic to any food, as far as I know. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication before. I am a little sensitive to bee stings, though. When I was a child, I got stung and my arm swelled up something awful. But that was a long time ago, and I haven't been stung in years. Nothing serious, though, just a bit of swelling. No trouble breathing or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, Ms. McNabb, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. I'm ready whenever you are. I've always believed in listening to the doctor. You're the expert, after all.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/85. Your pulse is regular at 72. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. As you mentioned, I do see some bruising on your forearms. It doesn’t appear painful, but it’s definitely present. I'm also noting some dryness of your skin. Everything appears generally normal, but the bruising and skin dryness are worth investigating further.
PATIENT: That doesn't surprise me, to be honest. My skin has been feeling rather dry lately, no matter how much lotion I use. And the bruising… well, I've just been trying to ignore it, hoping it would go away on its own. What do you think is causing it? Is it something serious? I hope it's not my blood pressure medication. I wouldn't want to stop taking it if I need it, but I also don't want to be walking around covered in bruises.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing this up, and it’s wise to be cautious about your medication. While the bruising could be a side effect of Lisinopril, it’s not the only possibility. To rule things out, I'd like to order a complete blood count, or CBC, to check your blood cell levels, and a basic metabolic panel, or BMP, to assess your kidney function. These tests will help us determine if there's anything else going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. If those tests will help you figure out what’s happening, then I'm happy to have them done. I trust your judgment completely. Where will I need to go for those tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a church luncheon next week, and I was hoping to feel a bit better by then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the lab draw the blood right here in the clinic. It’ll only take a few minutes, and they usually have the results back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, continue taking your medications as prescribed. And to address the dryness, I recommend a heavier, fragrance-free moisturizer, applied several times a day. We can also discuss a vitamin D supplement if the results show a deficiency. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds wonderful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and not dismissing them as just “old age”. I'll go get the blood drawn right away, then. And I'll be sure to pick up some of that heavier moisturizer on my way home. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. It’s my job to listen and help you feel your best. We'll take it one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
