DOCTOR: Good morning, Sharifa. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine. Honestly, it’s my legs. They just feel… weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really bad cold. Not just a little sniffle, a proper cold, you understand? And now, walking feels like… well, like I’m wading through mud. It’s quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness in your legs, starting a few days after a pretty significant cold. That is inconvenient, I can imagine. Could you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: It’s…hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t walk at all, but it takes effort. Like everything is… heavier than it should be. And it’s both legs, which is odd, isn’t it? Usually things happen on one side, not both. It’s not painful, just… uncooperative. I suppose. I was hoping it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. I have tours planned, people relying on me.
DOCTOR: Right, both legs, not painful, just a feeling of heaviness and effort. And it’s not improving after a few days. That's good information. You mentioned tours – what kind of tours do you lead?
PATIENT: Oh, you wouldn't believe the sorts of people I get. Mostly historical sites, you know? Old ruins, colonial architecture…things real people should be interested in, not…amusement parks. I lead small groups, usually tourists from the US, some from Canada. It requires a lot of walking, a lot of standing, explaining things... it's a proper job. And I pride myself on being knowledgeable. It's just…difficult when one can barely walk. It’s rather embarrassing, actually. Do you think it could be something serious? Not that I’m expecting you to know everything, mind you.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, I don’t expect to know everything! But it's good to get the full picture. Leading tours that involve a lot of walking certainly explains why this is concerning for you. It sounds like you’re very dedicated to your work. Let's go through some questions to get a better understanding of what might be going on. First, can you recall anything specific about the cold you had?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I remember it perfectly well. It started with a sore throat, then a terrible cough. Really productive, you understand? A lot of… mucus. And a fever, though I didn’t bother taking my temperature, I knew it was a fever. Achy all over, you know, the usual. It lasted about a week, I’d say. Took some over-the-counter stuff for it, decongestants, that sort of thing. Helped a bit, but it was a nasty one. I haven't been this sick in years, honestly. A proper cold. I always get sick when the tourists arrive, honestly, they bring everything with them. Though, I shouldn’t say that.
DOCTOR: Right, a productive cough, fever, body aches, lasting about a week, and you used over-the-counter medications. That's helpful. And you mentioned it started around the time the tourists arrived. Now, besides the leg weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms since the cold?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't? It’s August, it’s hot. And I’ve been a little… shaky, I suppose. Not a full tremble, but like a slight… vibration. Mostly in my hands. And my appetite hasn’t been the best, but again, the heat… I don’t have much enthusiasm for cooking when it's this warm. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one to complain. I just want my legs to work properly. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. Fatigue, shakiness in your hands, and a decreased appetite alongside the leg weakness... alright. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or hands?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yes. A little tingling, actually. Mostly in my feet. Not constant, just… comes and goes. It’s not painful, just… odd. Like pins and needles. And sometimes, it feels like my feet are a little… cold, even when they’re not. It’s very subtle, I didn’t think much of it, honestly. I thought it was just the shoes, maybe. I walk a lot, you see. I have a good pair, but still. Is that something I should be concerned about? Honestly, I just thought it was… something I’d get used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, tingling and coldness in your feet. That's definitely something we need to consider. Now, have you had any problems with your balance or coordination since the cold?
PATIENT: A little, yes. I haven’t fallen, mind you, but I’ve felt a bit… unsteady on my feet a few times. It’s hard to explain. Like I’m not quite sure where my feet are, if that makes any sense. I have to concentrate a bit more when I walk, especially on uneven surfaces. It's rather embarrassing, actually. I'm usually so graceful, you know? I pride myself on being able to navigate those old ruins without tripping. Honestly, it's a bit unnerving. I don't like feeling off balance. Is it possible this is all related to the cold? Because, frankly, I'm starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s certainly possible it’s related to the cold. Those symptoms – the weakness, tingling, unsteady balance – do sometimes follow viral illnesses. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. I’m usually very healthy. I eat well, I walk a lot, I don't smoke, I rarely drink… a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. My mother had high blood pressure, but I've never had problems with it. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing serious. I’ve never been a sickly person, really. That's why this is so concerning. I don’t usually need to see a doctor. Honestly, I prefer to avoid them if at all possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to know you generally have good health. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a child, climbing a mango tree, but it healed perfectly well on its own. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Honestly, I’m very careful. I don’t take unnecessary risks. I need to be in good shape for my tours, you see. It’s my livelihood. I can't afford to be laid up in a hospital bed. Honestly, this is all very frustrating. I just want to know what’s wrong and how to fix it. Are you thinking it's something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, I’m not going to jump to any conclusions. But given your symptoms, and the fact that they started after a viral illness, it’s important to investigate. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Only the over-the-counter cold medicine I mentioned earlier, when I had the cold. A decongestant, a cough suppressant, that sort of thing. I stopped taking it once the cold was over, about a week ago. I don’t really take any other medications. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. A cup of chamomile tea, a bit of ginger…that sort of thing. Honestly, I think doctors overprescribe medication these days. It’s not always the answer, you know? I prefer to let my body heal itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, I travel a lot, I’ve tried all sorts of foods… I’ve never had any problems. Honestly, I’m a very healthy person. That’s why this is so puzzling. I’ve never had allergies. It’s just… strange. Are you thinking it’s something rare, Doctor? Honestly, I’m starting to get anxious. I have tours booked for next week, and I can't afford to cancel them.
DOCTOR: No, I’m not thinking it’s rare. It’s more likely something we can identify and treat. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I suppose I should have expected that. Honestly, I just want to know what's wrong. I'm a bit nervous, but… go ahead. Just try not to take too long, if you don't mind. I have a lot on my mind, you see. Tours, cancellations, clients… It's a bit overwhelming. I pride myself on being organized, and this has thrown everything off.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Next, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Your coordination is slightly off, and you do exhibit some mild unsteadiness. Finally, I'm going to check the sensation in your feet. Sensation is slightly diminished in both feet, particularly to light touch. Okay, those are the basics. Findings show some diminished sensation and slight unsteadiness, which does correlate with what you've described.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn't sound very good, does it? Diminished sensation…unsteadiness… Honestly, I was hoping it would be something simple. A pulled muscle, perhaps. But diminished sensation sounds…serious. Is it something to worry about, Doctor? Honestly, I’m starting to get quite anxious. What does it mean? I have to be able to walk, you see. I simply have to. What’s the next step? Are we talking tests? Scans? Honestly, I’m not fond of hospitals. Is it possible it could just be a nerve issue? Or…something I can treat with…ginger?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re anxious, Sharifa. Diminished sensation and unsteadiness do warrant further investigation. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions, but it's important we rule out some potential causes. You're right to ask about nerve issues. That's certainly a possibility, and it's one of the things we need to explore. It's less likely to be something treatable solely with ginger, unfortunately, though that's a good idea for general well-being. The next step would be some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, and possibly a nerve conduction study to see how well the nerves in your legs and feet are functioning. We may also consider an MRI to rule out any issues in your spine or brain. I understand you’re not fond of hospitals, and we’ll try to keep things as streamlined as possible. The blood work can be done here, and the nerve conduction study is usually done on an outpatient basis. As for the MRI, we can discuss the details and ensure you’re comfortable with the process. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood work, I suppose I can manage that. A nerve conduction study…sounds unpleasant, but if it’s necessary…and an MRI… Honestly, I’m not thrilled about the MRI, but if it rules things out… Very well. Streamlined, you say? I appreciate that. I have a tour booked for next week, you understand. I simply cannot afford to be laid up for weeks. What exactly does the nerve conduction study involve? Is it painful? And the MRI…is it loud? I’ve heard terrible things about MRIs. Honestly, the thought of being enclosed in a loud tube… It’s not my idea of a good time. Please, tell me everything. I need to be prepared. The more information, the better. And… are there any immediate things I should be doing? Resting? Anything? Ginger, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything as thoroughly as possible. The nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin along the nerves in your legs and feet. A mild electrical stimulation is then applied – it feels like a tiny, brief tingling sensation, not painful, but you might feel some discomfort. It helps us measure how quickly the nerves are transmitting signals. The whole process takes about 30-60 minutes. The MRI is loud. It involves lying inside a large, cylindrical tube. It’s important to lie very still for about 20-30 minutes while the machine takes pictures of your spine and brain. You will be given earplugs or headphones to help with the noise. It’s not a comfortable experience for everyone, but it’s generally well-tolerated. We can discuss options for managing any anxiety you might have, such as medication or having a friend or family member accompany you. As for immediate things, yes. I recommend resting as much as possible and avoiding any strenuous activity. While ginger can be helpful for general inflammation, it won’t address the underlying cause. It’s also a good idea to stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet. I'm going to order the blood work now. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule the nerve conduction study and discuss the MRI in more detail. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Blood work first, then the nerve conduction study, and a discussion about the MRI. I suppose that’s as good a plan as any. Resting, staying hydrated, healthy diet… I can do that. Honestly, it's just the uncertainty that's getting to me. And the thought of being stuck in a loud tube… But I’ll try to remain calm. I'm usually a very pragmatic person, you see. The blood work… how long does it usually take to get the results? And what exactly will it be testing for? I don’t want to be needlessly worried, you understand. I just want to know what's going on, so I can get back to my tours. People are relying on me. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite stressed. Is it possible this could be…something serious? I don’t mean to pry, but I need to know. And if it is serious…what are we looking at? Long-term treatment? Surgery? I need to be prepared. Perhaps I should cancel my tour… But I simply can’t afford to… Oh, never mind. Just tell me about the blood work.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re stressed and worried, and you’re right to ask those questions. I want to be as transparent as possible. The blood work usually takes 2-3 business days to come back. We’ll be checking for several things, including vitamin deficiencies – particularly B12 and D, which can affect nerve function. We’ll also check for inflammation markers, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or other medical condition. As for whether it's serious… it’s too early to say definitively. The symptoms you're experiencing could be caused by a number of things, some more serious than others. It’s important to remember that the tests are simply gathering information – they’re not a diagnosis. If the tests do reveal something serious, the treatment will depend on the specific diagnosis. It could range from medication and physical therapy to surgery in some cases, but we won’t know until we have the results. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work done. I’ll order it right away, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. And regarding your tour…let’s hold off on canceling it for now. We’ll have a better idea of what’s going on after the tests, and then we can make an informed decision. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable. Yes, that sounds…reasonable. Blood work first, hold off on canceling the tour, and then…informed decisions. I suppose that’s all I can ask for. Informed decisions. The blood work…where do I go for that? Do I need to fast beforehand? And what if I…can’t make the follow-up appointment? I have tours scheduled, you understand. It's difficult to reschedule things at the last minute. And… what if the results are…bad? What sort of support is available? I don’t have… family nearby. And I pride myself on being independent, you see. I don’t like asking for help. But… it's good to know what my options are. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed again. Perhaps I should cancel the tour… No. Informed decisions. That’s right. Informed decisions. Just tell me about the blood work. Where do I go, and do I need to fast?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask those questions. It's important to be prepared, and I want to make sure you feel supported every step of the way. You can go to the lab located at 123 Main Street. It’s a short drive from here. You do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand – that means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water, but that’s it. Regarding rescheduling the follow-up appointment…we can be flexible. We can work around your tour schedule. Just let the receptionist know when you book the appointment, and we’ll do our best to accommodate you. And if the results are concerning…there are resources available. We have a social worker here at the clinic who can help you navigate the healthcare system and connect you with support groups and other resources. And I will be here to guide you through the process, every step of the way. We can also discuss options for managing your anxiety and stress. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work done. Here’s a lab requisition form. Just take it to the lab at 123 Main Street. They’ll take care of the rest. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get through this together. And remember, informed decisions. That’s right. That’s the plan. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s…everything. The form, the address, fasting… rescheduling…support… I’ve got it. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for…explaining everything. And for being…patient. I’m not usually so… anxious. But this is… unsettling. I suppose I should go. Get the blood work done. And then… wait. Wait for the results. I appreciate your help, Doctor Asami. Truly. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sharifa. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
