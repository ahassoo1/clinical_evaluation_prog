DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really have a lot of time for this, to be honest. I just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to work, you know? My first one was… easy. I don’t want any trouble this time. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Trying to conceive can definitely be stressful, and it's good you’re getting things checked out. "Easy" doesn’t always mean everything is straightforward, but we’ll do our best to figure things out. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about your cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? What do you mean? Like… when I get my period? Honestly, I don’t really keep track. It’s usually… around the same time each month, I guess. It’s not like it’s irregular irregular. Just… normal. Look, is this going to take long? Because I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Yes, when you get your period is a good start. And how long does a typical period last?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? I don't know! A few days. Like… five? Maybe? Look, I just want to know if there's something wrong with me. I don't need a quiz on my… womanly things. My husband… well, my late husband, never asked me about this stuff. Just get to the point, okay? Is there a test? Can we just do a test?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. It's important to get a complete picture, but we can definitely move towards testing if that’s what you’d prefer. It's good you're proactive about this. Before we order anything, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being tired? I'm always tired! Running a household is exhausting, you know. And I get… mood swings sometimes. But who doesn't? Honestly, it could be anything. I don't know what you're expecting me to say. This is all very… invasive. Look, just… check if I'm okay, and if not, tell me what's wrong. Can we just skip the details? I really don’t want to dwell on this.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re feeling tired and experiencing some mood swings. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, changes? What kind of changes? I eat. I mean, I try to eat healthy, but sometimes I just want chocolate. Weight? Maybe I’ve gained a little? It's hard to say. I don't weigh myself every day, you know. I'm not obsessed. Honestly, is this going anywhere? This feels like a waste of time. I just want a simple answer. Is there a problem, or isn't there? Can we get to that part now?
DOCTOR: Okay. I hear you, Carmaleta. Let’s move toward some initial testing then. I'd like to start with a blood test to check your hormone levels and rule out any common causes of difficulty conceiving. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood test. Just… make it quick. And don’t ask me a million questions while you're doing it. I really hate needles, and I don't want to sit here all day. Can I at least get a glass of water afterwards? I always get lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A glass of water afterwards is no problem at all. We'll get the blood draw done quickly. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to get that started. She’s very good. While we wait, can I ask about any allergies you might have to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies? Honestly, I don't really know. Maybe… penicillin? I think I had a bad reaction to it when I was a kid. But it was a long time ago. Look, just… don’t give me anything weird. And can we please hurry this along? I have things to do. This is really cutting into my day. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I've made a note of the penicillin allergy. Sarah will confirm that with you. She’ll be right in to get started. We'll do our best to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. I'll be back to discuss the results once they're available.
