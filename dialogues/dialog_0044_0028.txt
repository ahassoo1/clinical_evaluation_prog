DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. Welcome. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it doesn’t feel right when I get to coughing. It's been going on for a few weeks now, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for a few weeks, and you're noticing some heart palpitations when you cough. That’s good information to start with. Let's try to get a better picture of what’s going on. First, can you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it's not a dry cough, exactly. It brings up a little bit of… phlegm. White, mostly. And it’s worse when I lie down, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. Not every time, but often enough. I have to prop myself up with pillows.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a productive cough—you're bringing up white phlegm—and it's worse when you lie flat, causing some trouble sleeping. That definitely gives us something to work with. And you mentioned your heart doesn't feel right when you cough. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. It feels like it’s skipping a beat, or fluttering. Not painful, just… off. Like it's working too hard. It doesn’t happen with every cough, mind you. Just some of the bigger ones. And it goes away pretty quickly. But it worries me, you know? My husband… he had heart trouble, and… well. I just want to make sure it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nadene. It's very wise to get these things checked out, especially with your husband’s history. It’s good you’re paying attention to this. “Skipping a beat” or “fluttering” is definitely something we need to investigate. Now, besides the cough and the heart feeling off, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I get tired pretty easily. More than usual, I suppose. And my ankles… they swell up sometimes, at the end of the day. Nothing terrible, but noticeable. And I haven’t been eating much lately. Food just doesn’t seem appealing. It’s like… I lose my appetite quickly. I'm down a few pounds, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, ankle swelling, and decreased appetite with some weight loss. That's helpful information. Let’s go a little further back. Have you had this cough before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: No, never like this. I get a little sniffle now and then, like anyone, especially in the winter. But this is different. It's been going on steady for weeks, like I said. It started gradually, just a little tickle in my throat, then it got worse and worse, bringing up the phlegm. And that's when I noticed my heart acting up, when I really started coughing hard. It all seems connected, somehow.
DOCTOR: You’re right to think it might all be connected. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it, every day. And… oh, a few years back, they told me I had something wrong with my heart valves. Something about not closing properly, I think. They put me on a water pill then, too, to get rid of extra fluid. I think that's it. I've been seeing a cardiologist for that, but I haven’t been in a while. I just… try to stay on top of things with the pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure and some valve issues with your heart, and you're taking medication for both. That's very important information. Do you remember the names of those medications, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Let me see… for the blood pressure, it’s… Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril. And for the heart… Furosemide, that’s the one. A white pill. I take one of each every morning. And I haven't missed a dose in years, I promise you. I’m very good about my pills. My daughter keeps a close eye on me, too.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Lisinopril and Furosemide. And it's good to hear you're so diligent with your medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. And I’ve never had a reaction to any of the pills the doctor has given me. My daughter used to worry about that, when I first started taking them, but I’ve been fine. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, just to finish up with your history, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Oh! Years and years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was a long time ago, when I was still living in El Salvador. And… oh, I was in the hospital for a few days once with pneumonia. That was maybe ten years ago. But other than that… no, not really. Just the gallbladder and the pneumonia. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a previous case of pneumonia. And finally, Nadene, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she died of a heart attack when she was in her seventies. And my father, he had high blood pressure, just like me. And my brother, he has diabetes. That's about it, really. Not a lot of serious illness in my family, to be honest. Everyone lived to be pretty old, mostly. But my mother’s heart… that’s what I worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. That’s helpful. Alright, Nadene, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles for swelling, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to find out what’s going on. My heart… it's been worrying me, as you know. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated, around 92 beats per minute. And I do hear a slight murmur—a whooshing sound—which is consistent with what you told me about your valve issues. Your lungs sound a little congested, with some crackling sounds, especially at the bases. And yes, your ankles do have some noticeable swelling, as you mentioned. Your blood pressure is 148/86, which is a bit elevated. Alright, Nadene. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like we're dealing with a few things that could be connected. The cough, the shortness of breath, the ankle swelling, and the heart palpitations all point towards possible heart failure, but we need to do some further testing to confirm that. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, and also some blood tests, including a BNP level, which can help us assess your heart function. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. My mother… it sounds like what happened to her. But… yes, Doctor, if that’s what it takes to find out what’s going on, then yes, please do the tests. An X-ray and an EKG and… what did you say? A… BNP level? I just want to know what I’m dealing with. And if it is heart failure… what does that mean? What can be done?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Nadene, especially with your mother’s history. Let me assure you that knowing what’s going on is the first step towards managing it effectively. A BNP level is a blood test that measures a substance released by your heart when it's under strain. It can help us determine how well your heart is functioning. If it is heart failure, it means your heart isn't pumping blood as efficiently as it should. This can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, and ankle swelling, which is what you've been experiencing. However, heart failure isn't necessarily a death sentence. There are many treatments available, including medications to strengthen your heart, reduce fluid buildup, and manage your symptoms. We can also make lifestyle changes, such as reducing your salt intake and getting regular exercise, to help improve your quality of life. I'm going to have my nurse draw the blood for the tests now. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, and the EKG will only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and create a plan that’s right for you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. Knowing what's going on is important. And if there are things I can do, medications I can take… then I want to do them. Please, go ahead with the tests. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. It helps to know I’m not alone in this. Just… try not to worry me too much, okay? My heart can only take so much.
DOCTOR: You're not alone at all, Nadene. And I promise I’ll do everything I can to keep you comfortable and informed. I’ll explain the results as clearly as possible, and we’ll take things one step at a time. I'll have the nurse come in now to draw the blood and get the X-ray ordered. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while we wait?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m alright for now. Just… a little worried, that’s all. But I’m in good hands, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, Nadene, you absolutely are. You're in very good hands. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll work together to take care of you. Let's just focus on getting these tests done, and then we’ll go from there. I’ll be right back after the nurse has taken care of you. Just relax, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together.
PATIENT: .
