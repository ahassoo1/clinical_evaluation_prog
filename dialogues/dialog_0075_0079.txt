DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s my bruising. It’s just…worse lately. I’m on a blood thinner, and I keep getting these big bruises, even from just bumping into things. It’s kinda worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising easily is definitely something we want to investigate, especially with you being on a blood thinner. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this bruising becoming more of a problem?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started maybe…three weeks ago? Noticed it after I accidentally walked into the doorframe. Usually a little bump, you know? But this one was…different. Bigger, darker. And then it just seemed to happen more easily after that. Like, just from carrying groceries. I didn't even feel like I hit anything hard. It’s probably nothing, but…well, that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, following a bump into the doorframe. And it’s been progressively worse since then, happening with minimal trauma. I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. Now, can you describe the bruises themselves?
PATIENT: They’re…big. Not tiny little spots. Like, the size of my palm, sometimes bigger. And really dark purple at first, then they turn kinda greenish-yellow as they heal. They don’t really hurt, just…look bad. And they seem to pop up everywhere – arms, legs, even my back once, which was weird 'cause I don't remember hitting anything there. I can show you if you want. I have one on my arm right now.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you're comfortable, could you show me the bruise on your arm?
PATIENT: Here. See? It’s pretty bad, huh? And this was just from…reaching for something on a high shelf. Not even a fall or anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. That is quite significant. And you said this happened with minimal trauma. Okay. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions to get a broader picture of your health. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Um…let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But honestly, who isn’t tired these days? And maybe a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs, but I'm not exactly a marathon runner to begin with, so… I don’t know if that's connected. Nothing else, really. No bleeding gums or nosebleeds or anything like that. Just the bruises and maybe feeling a bit run-down.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and some shortness of breath with exertion. That’s good information. Now, can you tell me what blood thinner you are currently taking, and what is it prescribed for?
PATIENT: Oh, right. It’s… Warfarin. I think that's how it's spelled. The doctor put me on it about six months ago. It’s for… atrial fibrillation. That’s what he called it. Something to do with my heart not beating right. He said it would help prevent a stroke, which…scared me a lot, so I started taking it right away. I just didn’t expect this. I thought it was supposed to help, not make me look like I’ve been in a fight!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. Warfarin is a very effective medication for preventing strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it does require careful monitoring due to the risk of bleeding. And it sounds like we need to investigate why you're experiencing increased bruising. Now, let's go over your medical history a little bit more thoroughly. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been controlled with medication for years now. And…I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was ages ago. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy, as far as I know. I try to eat okay, get a little bit of exercise when I can…you know, normal stuff. Honestly, I haven't been to the doctor much in the last few years, except for routine checkups. This bruising is really throwing me off.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, and gallbladder removal in the past. Good to know. And you said routine checkups. Do you recall when your last blood work was done?
PATIENT: Let me think… um… Dr. Lei did some tests about…January, I think? Just a regular checkup, you know? He said everything looked good then. He checked my… INR levels, I think he called them? Something to do with the blood thinner working right. Everything was in the normal range. That's why I'm so confused about all this bruising! I had blood work, and it was fine!
DOCTOR: Okay, so your INR was stable in January. That is important information. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members who have had issues with bleeding or bruising easily?
PATIENT: Hmm…not that I know of. My mom had heart problems, and my dad had diabetes, but no one ever talked about bleeding issues or anything like that. My grandma on my mom’s side, she was pretty tough. She broke her hip once when she was really old, but that was just a normal break from falling, as far as I know. No one ever mentioned anyone bruising easily or having trouble stopping bleeding. I'm the only one in the family who's had issues like this, as far as I know. Honestly, I'm starting to worry it's something…serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. Okay, no family history of bleeding disorders. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty boring person, honestly. I work, I go home, I watch a little TV, I try to see my friends when I can. That's about it. I don't do a lot of things that would mess with my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. Just occasional social alcohol use. Lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can take pretty much anything without a problem. I’ve never had a reaction to a medication before, and I don’t have any food allergies or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky that way, honestly. This bruising is just…weird. And worrying. That's why I came in. I just want to know what’s going on and what we can do about it. Is it the Warfarin? Do I need more tests? I'm just really confused and a little scared.
DOCTOR: I understand, Courtnye. You’ve given me a lot of very helpful information, and I appreciate you being so thorough. Based on what you've told me, and the fact that your INR was stable in January, it's less likely to be a simple over-anticoagulation issue. However, since the bruising has become more pronounced, we need to investigate further. I want to order some blood work. We'll check your complete blood count, your coagulation panel, and also run some tests to rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing this. I'd also like to get a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Do you have any questions about the blood tests?
PATIENT: No, that sounds…okay, I guess. What exactly will the tests show? Will it tell us if it's something serious? I just…I don't want it to be something bad. And how long will it take to get the results? I have a busy schedule, so knowing when to expect a call is important. I'm sorry, I'm just anxious. This is all a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Courtnye, and I want to reassure you that we’re taking this seriously. The blood tests will give us a broader picture of your overall health and help us rule out potential causes for the bruising. The complete blood count will check for any signs of anemia or other blood cell abnormalities. The coagulation panel will assess your clotting factors and make sure your Warfarin levels are within a safe range, even if your last test was normal, things can change. The basic metabolic panel will look at your kidney and liver function, as these organs play a role in blood clotting. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. The clinic will call you as soon as they are available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, heavy bleeding – like nosebleeds that won’t stop, bleeding gums, or blood in your urine or stool – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. The emergency room thing is good to know, so thank you for mentioning that. I guess… I just have to wait and see what the tests say. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything. And for not making me feel like I’m overreacting. I really thought you'd just tell me to take less Warfarin and send me home. I think that's all for now. I should get going before I get even more worried. Thanks again, Dr. Panjoj.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. And please, don’t worry unnecessarily. We'll figure out what’s going on, and we'll come up with a plan to get you feeling better. Have a good day, and I’ll talk to you soon.
