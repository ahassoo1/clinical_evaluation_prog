DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have several patients scheduled after you, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… my sinuses. They… bother me. It’s been… a little while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long. It feels… full, like. And… sometimes hurts, a little.
DOCTOR: “A little while now…” Yes, well, that isn’t terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: Oh! I am sorry. I… do not remember things very well. Maybe… a few weeks? Or a month? It is hard to say, Doctor. It doesn’t keep me up at night, but… it’s always there. A dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. And is this ache localized to a specific area—your forehead, cheeks, perhaps—or is it more… diffuse?
PATIENT: Um… diffuse? I think… it’s mostly… here. <points to bridge of nose and forehead> And… maybe a little bit in my cheeks too? It’s hard to tell. Sometimes it feels like… all my face. Is that… right? I'm not good with… the words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this… facial discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Sometimes my nose feels… stuffy. Not always, but often. And… <pauses, furrowing brow> I think… maybe I cough a little more than usual? It’s not a bad cough, just… small. And sometimes… I feel tired. But, I work long hours, so… maybe that’s just from work. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Tiredness is a rather vague symptom, Ms. Boham. Is there any nasal discharge?
PATIENT: Nasal… discharge? You mean… when I blow my nose? Yes. It’s… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little yellow, but usually clear. Not a lot, though. Just… normal, I think. Like when you have a little cold, but not like a cold. Do you understand? I’m trying to explain… it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: And have you had a fever, chills, or any change in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't think so. I haven't checked. And chills… no. Sense of smell… no, I think it smells the same. Everything smells… normal. My husband cooks, so I smell what he’s cooking. <chuckles softly> He makes good food! But… no change. Sorry, I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… I don’t know. I’ve never been told I have allergies. Maybe to dust? Sometimes I sneeze when I’m cleaning. But everyone sneezes when they clean, right? I… I’ve never had a test, or anything. I work outside, so maybe… plants? But I don’t get… really sick. Just a little stuffy sometimes.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… I don't take anything regularly. Nothing for my… sinuses, or anything else. Sometimes, when my back hurts from work, I take something for the pain. But that’s it. Just… when I need it. A white pill. I don't remember the name. <shakes head slightly> I don’t keep track of these things very well.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just have a seat, I'll have a quick look. Please, try to be still.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. <carefully sits on the examination table> I will try my best. It’s just… sometimes it’s hard to stay still. My legs… they get restless. But I will try.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness here… and here. <continues palpation> Nasal mucosa appears mildly inflamed. No significant purulent discharge observed. Your ears look clear. Palpating your lymph nodes… slightly enlarged, but not alarmingly so. <steps back, making notes>
PATIENT: Okay. Does that… hurt? <winces slightly> It feels… a little bit of pressure. But not too bad. Is something… wrong? I can feel the pressure now that you’re touching it. I'm sorry I can’t tell you more about it. It just… feels stuffy and achy.
DOCTOR: It appears you have some mild sinus inflammation. Given your symptoms and my examination, it is likely a common viral sinusitis. However, your lack of a clear recollection of the duration and any associated fever is… concerning. To rule out any secondary bacterial infection, I will need to order some blood work.
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh… um. Is that… necessary? I don’t… I don’t like needles, Doctor. And I don’t have much money… will it be expensive? I just thought it was… a little sinus problem. It doesn't feel so bad, really. I've worked through worse.
DOCTOR: Ms. Boham, I understand your concerns. However, it's my professional obligation to ensure an accurate diagnosis. The blood work will help determine if antibiotics are necessary. We can discuss a payment plan with the laboratory. It is a relatively standard panel, so I don't anticipate it being excessively expensive. <pauses> Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. Just… work. I work very hard. And my husband… he worries about me. He always tells me to go to the doctor. <looks down at hands> I don’t like to bother people. I’m okay. I think. It’s just… I get tired, and my sinuses ache. That’s all. A payment plan… okay. That would be good. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll do what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is a requisition for a complete blood count and a C-reactive protein test. Take this to the laboratory across the hall. They will draw some blood. It will take about fifteen minutes. Once you have had the blood work done, return to me, and we can discuss the results. <hands the form to Ms. Boham> And please, try to get some rest. <turns away, examining another chart>
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. <takes the form carefully> Fifteen minutes… I can do that. Rest… yes, I will try. <rises slowly from the examination table, clutching the form> Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. <hesitates briefly, then slowly walks towards the door>
