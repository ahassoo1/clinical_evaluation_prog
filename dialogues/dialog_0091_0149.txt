DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about this…fuss. All this poking and prodding. Honestly, I don’t see what the bother is. I've lived a long life, you know. Eighty-three years! And I’ve managed just fine without anyone telling me what to do with my feet.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. It can be unsettling to have changes to your routine, and I apologize if it feels like unnecessary “fuss.” However, even a long and healthy life benefits from ensuring everything is functioning as it should. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this “fuss” you’re referring to?
PATIENT: Oh, it's…well, it's my daughter, mostly. She's always been a worrier, that one. She keeps saying I need “tests” and “procedures.” Something about my…circulation? Honestly, I barely listen anymore. I just tell her I'm fine and she fusses more. And now you want to poke around too? It’s ridiculous, really. I just want to be left alone. It’s my body, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Gunasekara. It sounds like your daughter is very concerned about your health, and I can see how that concern, while well-intentioned, might feel overwhelming. You are absolutely right, it is your body, and we want to make sure any decisions we make are ones you are comfortable with. Your daughter mentioned something about your circulation. Could you describe what's been happening that prompted her concern, in your own words?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, my feet get…cold. Sometimes. Not always cold, you understand. Just…cool. And they ache a bit after I've been standing for a while. I used to be able to stand all day, you know. Baking, mostly. I made the best pastries in the neighborhood, everyone said so. But now…well, now I sit a lot more. It's just old age, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t see what a doctor can do about old age. It happens to everyone.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when changes occur with age, and it's natural to wonder what, if anything, can be done. While we can't stop aging, we can certainly address some of the symptoms that come with it and help you maintain your quality of life. You mentioned cold feet and aching after standing. How long have you been noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Months, I suppose. Maybe…a year? Time just slips away when you're older, you know. It's all a blur of doctor's appointments and…well, not much else, really. It started gradually, just a little discomfort. Now…it's more noticeable. Especially in the evenings. And sometimes, my feet feel…tingly. Not painful, just…odd. But I told my daughter it was just my slippers being too tight. She never listens.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Ms. Gunasekara. A year of gradual onset of coldness, aching, and now tingling in your feet. It’s good you’ve been aware of the changes, even if you’ve dismissed them previously. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your skin on your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Color? Honestly, I haven’t been looking at my feet that closely. I suppose they look…normal? A little pale, maybe? But I have fair skin, always have. I don’t spend much time in the sun. It’s not like I’m going on vacations or anything. Just…pale. That’s all I can say. Is this going to be a long interrogation? I really don't see the point of all this questioning.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Ms. Gunasekara. I assure you, I’m just trying to gather enough information to understand what’s happening. Pale skin can sometimes be a clue, but it’s not necessarily a cause for concern. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your feet or legs – any breaks, sprains, or cuts?
PATIENT: Breaks? Oh, goodness, no. Never broken a bone in my life. I was always very careful, you see. Sprains…maybe a little ankle twist here and there when I was younger, dancing. But nothing serious. Cuts? Well, little kitchen mishaps, of course. I used to bake, remember? But nothing that required a doctor. I always bandaged them up myself. I don’t go to doctors for little things. It's a waste of time and money, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s good to know you haven’t had any significant injuries. Now, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have been diagnosed with, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, the doctor told me years ago my pressure was a little high, but I don’t take anything for it. He said I should watch my salt intake, but…well, I like salt. Everything tastes better with salt! And…I think I had a touch of the arthritis in my hands, but it’s not bad enough for medication. And… honestly, I forget half the things the doctors tell me. Old age, you know. They keep changing their minds about everything anyway. Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. It can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. It’s good to know you’ve been told about slightly high blood pressure and have some arthritis. To clarify, you said “slightly high blood pressure.” Do you know approximately when you were told this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time ago. Maybe… ten years ago? More? I don't really recall. He just said to watch the salt. And I've been trying…sort of. It’s hard, you know? Everything tastes so bland without it. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things. I just try to live my life. Is there a point to all this questioning? I’m starting to feel tired.
DOCTOR: I understand your fatigue, Ms. Gunasekara. I apologize for the extensive questioning. We're trying to build a complete picture of your health history. Knowing you were told about high blood pressure approximately ten years ago is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmmm…let me see. Well, I take a little something for my joints, sometimes, when they’re acting up. It’s that…glucosamine? Chondroitin? Something like that. I get it at the drugstore. And…sometimes, I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because the doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. Other than that…no. Nothing regular. I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel worse than whatever ails me. Is this going to be over soon? I'd like to sit down.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Gunasekara. You take glucosamine/chondroitin occasionally and vitamin D in the winter. Before we move on, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or children – had problems with diabetes, heart disease, or problems with circulation in their legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... that's a difficult one. My mother... she had a bit of everything, really. A weak heart, I think. And my father… he was a strong man, mostly healthy, but he did have some swelling in his legs towards the end. And my brother… well, he wasn't a healthy man, always smoking and drinking. He had some kind of trouble with his blood, I think. But honestly, I never paid much attention to the details. It's all a bit of a blur, you know? So many years ago. I just remember they all eventually... passed away. Is this getting anywhere? I don’t see how knowing about my dead relatives is going to help my feet. I’m getting quite tired now.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s difficult to recall details about family history, and it can be upsetting to think about loved ones who have passed away. Knowing your mother had a weak heart, your father had leg swelling, and your brother had blood problems is helpful, even if the details are vague. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmph. What does that even mean? I live a quiet life. I live alone. I read. I watch television. I used to bake, as I mentioned, but my hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. I don't go out much anymore. It's not safe these days. And I certainly don't exercise. I used to walk to the store, but now I have my daughter do the shopping for me. Is this going to lead to me having to start running marathons? I'm too old for that nonsense.
DOCTOR: I assure you, no marathons are required, Ms. Gunasekara. I was just trying to get a sense of your daily activity level. It sounds like you live a relatively quiet life, which is perfectly fine. Now, just a few more questions about habits. Have you ever smoked cigarettes?
PATIENT: Smoked? Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, a terrible habit, ruined her lungs. I always thought it was disgusting. I wouldn't dream of putting something like that in my body. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's all. Is this really necessary? I feel like I'm being interrogated. I just want to be left alone.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Gunasekara. You've never smoked, and you only occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just from the spicy food. I’m a very hardy person. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I want. I think all this worrying about allergies is just a modern fad. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite faint. Can we please be done with this now? I’m not sure how much longer I can sit here.
DOCTOR: You've never experienced any allergies, Ms. Gunasekara. Alright, we’re almost finished. Last question, and it's a simple one. Are you currently experiencing any pain, other than the aching in your feet that we discussed?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Just the feet, sometimes. And a little stiffness in my joints in the morning. I’m an old woman, you know? A little aches and pains are to be expected. I don’t complain much. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve had worse. Honestly, I think I’m done answering questions. Can we finally get to the end of this? I just want to sit down and rest. My legs are killing me. Is there anything you can do for my feet, or are we just going to keep talking?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Gunasekara. Thank you for your patience and for answering all of my questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your feet and legs. I’ll need to check your pulses, look at the skin, and assess your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: sigh Oh, alright. But be gentle, please. My skin is very delicate. And don't poke too much. I don’t like being poked. Just get it over with quickly. I'm not sure how much longer I can sit here. And please explain what you're doing as you go along, I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I will be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go along. First, I'm going to check the pulses in your feet. This tells me how well the blood is flowing to your legs and feet. The pulses feel a bit… diminished on both sides, meaning they’re not as strong as I’d like to see. Now, I’m going to look at the skin on your feet and legs. I notice some slight discoloration on your lower legs, a bit of a brownish tinge, and the skin does feel a little cooler than it should. There is no evidence of any open sores or injuries. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit sluggish, which can be normal with age, but it’s something we’ll keep an eye on. Okay, that completes the physical examination. I appreciate your cooperation. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of peripheral artery disease, which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your legs and feet. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this diagnosis. Would you be willing to have some blood work done and a simple test called an ankle-brachial index, which measures the blood pressure in your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Peripheral artery…what? Honestly, all these fancy medical terms… it’s just too much. Blood work… I hate needles. And another test? Are you sure it’s necessary? I told you, I just have cold feet! It’s probably just old age. I don’t like the sound of all this…testing. It sounds expensive and complicated. And it's not like you can fix old age, can you? I'd rather just leave things alone. I'm starting to feel very anxious now. Is there anything else you need to poke and prod? I think I need to sit down. And maybe a glass of water.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed by medical terms and the thought of further testing. “Peripheral artery disease,” or PAD, simply means that the arteries that supply blood to your legs and feet may be narrowed, which can cause symptoms like cold feet, aching, and fatigue. The blood work and ankle-brachial index are relatively simple tests that can help us determine if PAD is present and how severe it is. If PAD is confirmed, there are treatments available that can help improve blood flow and relieve your symptoms. These treatments can range from lifestyle changes, such as exercise and smoking cessation, to medications or, in some cases, minimally invasive procedures. I want to assure you that we only recommend tests that are necessary to provide you with the best possible care. We’ll discuss all of your options with you and answer any questions you may have before proceeding with any treatment. Right now, I’m going to order a glass of water for you. And let’s not make any decisions right away. How about we focus on getting you comfortable for now?
PATIENT: …Alright. Water would be nice. And maybe a small biscuit, if you have any? I'm getting a little weak. But I still don’t like the sound of all those tests. I’m not sure I want to do them. I'll think about it. But no promises. I just want to be comfortable. And left alone. Is there anything else you want to ask me? I'm starting to feel very tired now, and I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I will ask the nurse to bring you a glass of water and a biscuit right away. I understand your hesitation about the tests, and you are absolutely right to take your time and consider all your options. We can certainly hold off on them for now. Your comfort is our priority. At this point, I don’t have any other questions for you. I would like to summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’ve been experiencing cold feet and aching in your legs, which you've attributed to old age. Based on your history and the physical examination, it’s possible you may have early signs of peripheral artery disease. We discussed some tests that could help confirm this diagnosis, but you've expressed reservations, and that's perfectly fine. I’m going to write a note for you outlining our conversation and the possibility of further testing. I will also order a mild pain reliever for your legs, just to make you more comfortable. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: …Just… what’s the worst that could happen if I do have this… artery thing? I don't want to scare my daughter. She worries enough as it is. And…is it painful? I don't like pain. Honestly, I just want to know if it's something serious, or if it's just old age. And if it is serious, what can be done about it? Don’t use any fancy medical terms, please. Just…tell me in plain English. And bring that water soon, I'm parched.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to explain everything in plain English. If you do have peripheral artery disease, the worst-case scenario is that the blood flow to your legs and feet could become severely restricted, which could lead to pain, numbness, and, in rare cases, even the need for amputation. However, it's important to emphasize that this is a rare outcome, and with early diagnosis and treatment, most people with PAD can manage their condition effectively and avoid serious complications. As for whether it’s painful, the level of pain varies greatly from person to person. Some people experience no pain at all, while others experience mild to moderate pain, especially during exercise. In more severe cases, pain can be present even at rest. As for what can be done about it, there are several treatment options available. These include lifestyle changes, such as exercising regularly, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications can also help improve blood flow and reduce your risk of complications. In some cases, minimally invasive procedures, such as angioplasty or stenting, may be necessary to open up blocked arteries. These procedures are generally well-tolerated and have a high success rate. I want to assure you that we will work with you every step of the way to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs and preferences. We will also monitor your condition closely to ensure that you are receiving the best possible care. The nurse should be here with your water and biscuit shortly. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: …No, I think that’s enough for now. My head is spinning. Just… bring the water and let me rest. And please, don’t tell my daughter everything you said. She’ll fuss too much. I’ll think about the tests. Maybe. But no promises. I just want to go home. And maybe have a nice cup of tea. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. That’s perfectly alright. I will make sure not to share all of the details with your daughter. We can discuss it with her together, if you’d like, or I can simply let you take the lead. Your comfort and peace of mind are our priority. I will let the nurse know to bring you your water and biscuit right away. Here is a summary of our visit for you to review, with my contact information should you have any questions later. Please, take your time, rest, and have that cup of tea. If you change your mind about the tests, or have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Gunasekara.
