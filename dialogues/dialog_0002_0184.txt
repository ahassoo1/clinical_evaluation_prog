DOCTOR: Hi Kern, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Good to meet you too, I suppose. Look here, Doctor, I don't have all day. It's… well, it's this body. Always been lean, you see. Always. But now… now it's too lean. Skin all loose. Like an old shoe. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about some recent weight loss and changes in your body composition, specifically noticing looser skin. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Let me just pull up your chart here… Kern Trendler, age 76. I see your height and weight are listed as 178cm and 122lbs, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's right. Always been a light man. Worked with steel my whole life, you know. Pile driver. Not a job for the… well, for the larger gentleman. But I ain't worried 'bout my weight, I'm worried 'bout what's under the skin. It's… sagging. Like a washin' on the line after a good rain. Don't you have… things for that? Creams or… I don't know. Fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed a change in your body composition despite maintaining your usual weight, and it's the looseness of your skin that’s concerning you most. I understand. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me about how long you’ve noticed this change?
PATIENT: About… hmm. Maybe six months now? Started after that bout of the flu, I reckon. Bad one, that was. Lost my appetite for a bit, even though I needed to eat. Wife always made sure I was fed, bless her soul. But she’s gone now, you see. So I ain't been eatin' like I used to. Still, shoulda kept more weight on, I suppose. But fixin' the skin is the main thing. Can you do that?
DOCTOR: I see. So it started around six months ago, following a bout of the flu where you experienced some loss of appetite. And you've noticed changes since then, and you’re understandably concerned. Okay. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk a little more about what's been going on with your appetite since the flu. Have you been actively trying to maintain your weight, or has it just been a matter of eating what you feel up to?
PATIENT: Just eatin' what I feel up to, mostly. Don’t have the hunger like I used to. And truthfully, Doctor, I ain’t much of a cook. Wife did all the proper meals, all the… the nourishment. Now it's mostly toast and tea. Simple things. No need for fancy cookin' for one old man. But this skin… it's botherin' me. I look like a crumpled paper bag. Is there a cream? A rub? Anything?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've had a significant change in your routine and diet since your wife passed away, and that’s understandably impacted your appetite. And you’re right to want to address this; feeling good about how you look is important. There are some creams and lotions that can help with skin elasticity, but they’re usually most effective if there hasn't been significant weight loss. Given that you've lost some weight and appetite, we need to figure out why that's happening before we focus on the skin itself. Have you noticed any other changes besides the loss of appetite and the loose skin?
PATIENT: Humph. You always gotta make it complicated, don’t ya? Just fix the skin. But alright, alright. I get tired easier now, that's for sure. Used to be able to work a full day, no problem. Now I gotta sit down after a few hours. And my hands… they tremble a bit sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to make pouring a cup of tea a… a challenge. Doctor, are you listenin' or just writin' down everything I say?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Kern, and those are very important things to tell me. Fatigue and trembling hands – those aren’t things we should ignore, and they could be related to the weight loss and appetite changes. It's important to figure out the underlying cause, and it’s good you brought those up. Now, when you say you get tired easily, is that a new fatigue, or just a general feeling of being older?
PATIENT: New. Definitely new. Used to be… strong. Could still outwork most of the young fellas, even a few years back. This is different. It's like… the batteries are runnin' down, you see? And it ain’t just after workin’. Sometimes I wake up tired. Just… no energy. And these hands… they shake when I try to read sometimes. Makes holdin’ the paper a bother. It’s all connected, I reckon. Weight, tiredness, hands… and this blasted skin. You still think it’s just a cream I need?
DOCTOR: No, Kern, I definitely don’t think it's just a cream we need. The new fatigue, trembling hands, and weight loss are all concerning, and they do seem connected. It’s good you’re noticing these changes and telling me about them. To get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and just get a general sense of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Exam, is it? Alright, alright. But don’t take all day, Doctor. I got things to do. And no pokin’ and proddin’ unnecessarily. Just… get it done. I’m a practical man, you see. No time for fuss. But make sure you remember what I came in for – this skin. It’s embarrassin’.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kern. I understand. We'll be as efficient as possible. And I assure you, I haven’t forgotten why you’re here. I'll keep that in mind throughout the exam. If you could just sit up on the table for me, and we’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. I'll also check your reflexes and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get on with it. And try not to make a mess. I ain’t used to bein’ poked and prodded by doctors. Used to fixin’ things, not bein' fixed. But do be quick, alright? My tea’s gettin’ cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kern. Let's get started. Okay, breathing sounds are a little diminished on both sides, but nothing immediately concerning. Heart rate is regular, a bit slow, actually… 68 beats per minute. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes… Knee reflexes are a little diminished on both sides, and the ankle reflexes are… also a bit weak. And finally, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen… Abdomen is soft, no tenderness, but… I do notice a slight enlargement of the liver. Not dramatic, but something to note. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. It was quick, as you requested. Just a few things I noticed, but we'll need to run some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: Humph. Blood tests, is it? Always somethin' more, ain't it? Well, alright. But don't keep me here all day. And tell me what these tests are for, not just tell me to do 'em. I'm a practical man, remember? What are you lookin' for? And will it tell you about this skin, finally?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kern. I understand your frustration, and I'll explain everything. The blood tests will help us look for a few different things. First, we'll check your complete blood count – that will tell us if you're anemic, which could explain the fatigue. We'll also check your liver function to investigate that slight enlargement I felt during the exam. We’ll check your thyroid levels, as an underactive thyroid can also cause fatigue and weight changes. And finally, we'll check your vitamin levels, particularly vitamin D and B12. As for the skin, the blood tests themselves won't directly tell us about the skin, but they might give us clues about why you’re losing weight and experiencing changes in your body composition. If we can identify the underlying cause, that will help us determine the best course of action to address the skin concerns. Here's the requisition form. You can take this to the lab just down the hall. They'll draw a few vials of blood, and the results should be back in a few days. I'll give you a call as soon as I have them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Humph. A few days, you say? Alright, alright. As long as it ain’t a week. I got things to do, you know. And don’t call me with nothin’ less than answers. I ain’t got time for maybes and could-bes. Now, what about this skin? While I'm waitin' for these tests, is there nothin' you can do? A cream? A rub? Anythin' to make it look a little less… crumpled? I ain’t askin’ for miracles, just a little improvement. I’m a proud man, you see. Don’t like lookin’ like an old rag.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Kern, and I completely respect your desire to address the skin concerns. While we wait for the blood test results, there are a few things we can try. A good emollient lotion, applied several times a day, can help improve the hydration and elasticity of your skin. Something with hyaluronic acid or ceramides would be a good choice. It won't magically fix the looseness, but it can help improve the appearance and feel of your skin. Here’s a handout with some recommendations for over-the-counter lotions. It also has some tips for keeping your skin hydrated. We could also discuss a referral to a dermatologist if the lotions aren’t providing enough improvement. They have some more advanced treatments available, such as laser therapy or microdermabrasion, but we need to rule out any underlying medical causes first. For now, let's focus on keeping your skin hydrated and getting those blood tests done. Once we have the results, we'll have a better idea of the best course of action to address your concerns. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Humph. Alright, alright. Lotion, is it? Well, I suppose it can’t hurt. I ain’t expectin’ miracles, mind you. Just… somethin’ to make me feel a little less like an old shoe. Now, you said somethin’ about seein’ a… a derm-a-tol-o-gist? Is that a fancy doctor for skin? Well, alright. I’ll think about it. But no promises. I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded by too many doctors. Now, can I go? My tea’s probably cold by now, and I got things to do. And don’t forget to call me with them answers, alright? Don’t keep me waitin’. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kern. You can go. I won’t keep you any longer. I understand your reluctance to see another doctor, and we can definitely hold off on that for now. I’ll make sure to call you as soon as the blood test results are back, and we can discuss the next steps. Thank you for coming in today, Kern. I’ll be in touch soon. .
