DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… a check-up, yes? For the insurance. They require this before they… allow the coverage. I have Medicare, you see. It is all very… complicated.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Those insurance requirements can be a real headache. A check-up to satisfy Medicare – no problem at all. We’ll get everything documented to make sure you’re covered. So, just to be thorough, even though it’s a required check-up, are you experiencing any specific health concerns right now?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I am… fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. It is… a simple life. I do not go to the doctor unless it is… needed. Like this. For the papers. Is there a form I must fill? Perhaps that will be quicker.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Kiwane. A simple life sounds good! And yes, there is a form – just some basic medical history and demographics. It'll help me get a better overall picture. We’ll go through it together, and it shouldn’t take too long. Here you go. Let’s start with your date of birth… and then we'll confirm your address and insurance information. Do you mind reading through this and filling it out as best as you can?
PATIENT: A tablet… hmm. I am not very good with these… devices. But… alright. Let me see. This asks for my mother’s maiden name? Why does the insurance need to know this? Is this… safe?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Kiwane. Honestly, it is a bit invasive, and a lot of people wonder the same thing. It's part of their identity verification process, to help prevent fraud. I understand your concern about safety, and I assure you, your information is kept confidential and secure, as per HIPAA regulations. If you’re uncomfortable filling it out, we can skip it, and I can try to verify your identity another way, though it might delay the coverage approval. What are you most comfortable with?
PATIENT: Delay… is not ideal. Very well. I will… provide the information. But if anything… happens, I will know where to… complain. My mother’s name is… Fatima. And her mother’s name was… Aisha. Is that sufficient? I do not understand all these questions about… family history. Is my father’s side important too?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Kiwane. Fatima and Aisha are all we need for now. And yes, family history on both sides is helpful, but we can start with your mother's side if that's easier. It helps us identify potential risks for certain conditions, like heart disease or diabetes. Alright, next it asks about any past medical conditions you've had – anything you've been treated for before, even something minor?
PATIENT: Past conditions… hmm. I broke my arm, once. When I was a boy. Climbing a tree. And I had… the measles, when I was very young. But that is all. I have not been… seriously ill. I take no… medications. I am a healthy man. Do they require a list of childhood… scrapes and bruises? This seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: No, scrapes and bruises aren’t necessary, Kiwane. A broken arm and the measles are perfect. We just need to document any significant illnesses or injuries. And you’re right to question it – it can feel a little excessive sometimes. Okay, so broken arm as a child, measles… no current medications. Good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I have not… allowed anyone to cut me open. I avoid doctors, you see. Unless… it is required. This insurance… is a difficult thing. It feels like they want to know my entire life story. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Kiwane. It does feel intrusive, and you’re not alone in feeling that way. Unfortunately, it's becoming increasingly common with insurance companies. They're trying to gather as much information as possible. Okay, so no surgeries. That's good to know. Now, just a couple more questions to finish the form. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I have never had… a reaction to anything. Spices, sweets, fruits… everything is fine. My mother made sure I ate a good diet, you see. She said it builds… strength. So, no. No allergies. I am… robust. Is that the word? Robust.
DOCTOR: Robust is a perfect word, Kiwane! Excellent. No allergies. That simplifies things nicely. Alright, one final section. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, I find that question… rather personal. I live a… respectable life. I do not partake in such… vices. I drink tea, sometimes. And occasionally, a sweet pastry. But those are… comforts. Not… vices.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that way, Kiwane. It is a personal question, and I apologize if it felt intrusive. It’s standard procedure for medical history, but you are perfectly within your rights to decline answering. Alright, we’ve finished the form! Now, just to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just basic vitals and a listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Very well. But please, be quick. I have… things to do. And do not expect me to… undress. I am a modest man. I trust you are… professional. Just the vitals, yes? And the listening… quickly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kiwane. Completely professional. Just vitals and listening – no need to undress at all. We'll keep it quick and efficient. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Can you tell me your height, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: I am… tall. Approximately one hundred and eighty-eight centimeters. I have been measured before. My mother… insisted. She said a man must know his height. It is… important.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not a major concern at this time. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. I don't hear anything unusual. Now, just one final thing - can you tell me your weight, if you know it?
PATIENT: My weight… Approximately ninety kilograms. I maintain a… healthy physique. I do not… overindulge. I exercise… occasionally. Mostly, I just… work. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Kiwane. Ninety kilograms. Everything sounds good, and your vitals are within a reasonable range. Alright, we've completed the physical exam and the form. We have everything we need to satisfy Medicare's requirements. I'll submit everything electronically today. You should receive confirmation within a few weeks. Do you have any questions for me at all?
PATIENT: Finally. No, Doctor. I do not think so. I simply… wish to be covered by the insurance. That is all. Thank you for your… professionalism. And for being… quick. Now, if you will excuse me, I have… matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kiwane. I understand completely. I'm glad we could get this done for you. And you're very welcome. If anything comes up in the future, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor. Goodbye. .
