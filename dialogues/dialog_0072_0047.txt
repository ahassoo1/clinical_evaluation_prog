DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 47 years of age. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, 47… feels like longer some days. Uh… it’s about… well, long-term care. My wife… she took care of things. Insurance stuff. Now… I just need to figure out what I need, you know? It’s… a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be…disorienting to assume those responsibilities. While I am a physician specializing in internal medicine, my expertise doesn’t directly extend to insurance or long-term care planning. However, I can certainly assess your overall health, which may be relevant to the types of care you might anticipate needing. To start, perhaps you could tell me a little about your wife’s illness?
PATIENT: Oh… her. Mary. She… she got sick. Real sick. It was… something with her brain, I think. She needed a lot of help towards the end. I did what I could. It was… a long time ago now. Hard to remember all the details. It wasn’t quick, that’s for sure. Mostly… she just… faded. Does that make sense? I’m not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: “Faded” is…a rather vague description, Mr. Rover. While I appreciate you sharing this difficult experience, a more precise understanding of her condition would be helpful. Do you recall the specific diagnosis?
PATIENT: Diagnosis… You know… they said a lot of things. Something about… build-up? In her head? Alzheimer’s, maybe? Or… Parkinson’s? They did tests, scans… lots of them. I mostly just listened to the doctors and tried to take care of Mary. I wasn't the one reading the charts. I wish I could tell you more, I really do. It was… a blur. A really, really long blur.
DOCTOR: Very well. It appears we’re working with limited information regarding your wife’s specific neurological condition. While not ideal, we can proceed with a general assessment of your current health status. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… Not really. I mean… I get a bit of aches and pains, you know? Old work injuries. I used to do a lot of heavy lifting, moving freight down at the docks. My back’s not what it used to be. And my knees… they bother me when it rains. But… I wouldn't call it a condition. Just… getting old, I guess. The doctor gave me some pills for the pain a few years back. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: “Pills for the pain…” Do you recall the name of those medications, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… they were… little white ones. No, maybe they were yellow? I just asked the pharmacist to give me something for the aches. I don't really remember the name, sorry. I just take 'em when I need to. It’s been a while since I had to take them. Mostly, I just try to stay moving. Keeps the stiffness away, you know?
DOCTOR: It is important to have a comprehensive list of all medications you are taking, even if they are taken infrequently. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. Ate everything my mother put in front of me, and she made some… interesting things. No allergies. Nope. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: One cannot always rely on memory alone, Mr. Rover. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother lived to be a pretty old age, I think. Ninety-something. She just… wore out. My father… he had some heart trouble, I think. But he didn't take care of himself. Smoked like a chimney, drank too much… you know. And my brother… he got sick, a long time ago. Something with his lungs. But I wasn't very close to him. So… not much else. Mostly just… regular people stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Regular people stuff” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Rover. Do you know if your father or brother’s conditions were diagnosed specifically?
PATIENT: Specific… I think… my father had something with his… cholesterol? They said it was bad. And my brother… I think it was… emphysema? Or maybe pneumonia? He was always coughing. They sent him to a hospital, and… well, he didn’t come back. I was young then. Didn’t really pay much attention to the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Not anymore. Used to drink a bit, back in my younger days. Just beer, mostly. But I gave it up. Didn't like how it made me feel. And never touched the other stuff. Never had any interest. Always been a pretty simple man. I like my coffee, though. Strong coffee. That's about it.
DOCTOR: And how much coffee would you say you consume on a daily basis, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Oh… a couple of mugs in the morning. Maybe three. And sometimes another one after lunch. Depends on how tired I am. It keeps me going, you know? Helps with the aches and pains. Strong stuff. Black. No sugar.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Rover, given your wife’s illness and your own medical history, I believe a basic physical examination is warranted. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just want to get this figured out. Been putting it off long enough, I guess.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just follow me. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then proceed with a general assessment of your cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological systems. Please remove your shirt and shoes, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay. Never been one for doctors, if I'm honest. But… alright. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated – 142 over 90. Your pulse is regular at 78 beats per minute. Temperature is normal. Heart sounds are… somewhat muffled. Respiratory sounds are clear, but there is some mild wheezing upon exhalation. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness in the lower quadrants. Your reflexes are… a bit sluggish. And your gait appears slightly unsteady. Overall, your physical examination reveals some concerning findings. The elevated blood pressure, sluggish reflexes, and unsteady gait warrant further investigation. I recommend a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a neurological evaluation. We should also consider a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying respiratory issues. Does that sound acceptable, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Whoa… hold on a minute. That sounds… serious. Sluggish reflexes? What does that mean? And a chest X-ray? Is something wrong with my lungs? I just thought… just aches and pains, you know? Not… all this. I don't want a lot of tests. Just tell me what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, it is precisely because you are experiencing aches and pains, and because of your wife’s medical history, that these tests are necessary. I am not attempting to alarm you, but it is my professional obligation to rule out any potential underlying conditions. "Sluggish reflexes" simply indicate a possible issue with your nervous system. This could be due to a variety of factors, ranging from minor vitamin deficiencies to more serious neurological disorders. The chest X-ray is a precautionary measure to assess your respiratory function, given the mild wheezing I detected. I understand your reluctance, but without these tests, I cannot provide an accurate diagnosis or appropriate treatment plan. Do you consent to these tests, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: … Alright. If you think it’s necessary. But… can you explain what happens with each one? And… how long will it take? I don’t like being poked and prodded, if I’m honest. And I have things to do, you know? Just want to get this over with. Just… tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. The complete blood count will require a simple blood draw – a small sample will be taken from your arm. It will take approximately 10 minutes. The metabolic panel is a similar procedure, also requiring a blood draw, and will take another 10 minutes. The neurological evaluation will involve a series of simple tests to assess your reflexes, balance, coordination, and cognitive function. This will take approximately 30 minutes. Finally, the chest X-ray is a non-invasive procedure that will take approximately 15 minutes. You will simply stand in front of the X-ray machine while a technician takes a picture of your lungs. The results of these tests will provide a clearer picture of your overall health and allow me to determine the appropriate course of action. Are there any further questions before we proceed, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… get it over with. Where do we start? And… will it hurt? Be honest with me, Doctor. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: The blood draw may cause a slight pinch – a brief, fleeting discomfort. The neurological evaluation is non-invasive and should not cause any pain. The chest X-ray is also painless. We will start with the blood draw. The phlebotomist is ready in the lab, just down the hall. I will be with you shortly after to discuss the neurological evaluation. Please inform the phlebotomist of your anxiety, and they will be as gentle as possible. Let's proceed, Mr. Rover. The sooner we obtain these results, the sooner we can address any potential concerns.
PATIENT: Alright. Lead the way. Just… try to be quick about it, okay? This whole thing is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: I assure you, we will proceed as efficiently as possible. Follow me. .
