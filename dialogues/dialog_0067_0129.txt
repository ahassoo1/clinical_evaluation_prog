DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. It’s about my… well, it’s about what comes out the back end, if you must know. Black stools. It’s been going on for a bit now, and honestly, I haven’t got all day to sit here describing things. I take pills, lots of them, for the arthritis, you know? And this just started happening. It’s probably those pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Black, tarry stools are definitely something we need to investigate. It's good you brought it up, and don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of it. It could be related to your arthritis medication, but we need to rule out other possibilities. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the black stools?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember the exact date. People don't just write these things down, do they? It was… maybe a couple of weeks ago? Give or take. I noticed it when I was, you know, using the toilet. It just looked… different. Darker. And it’s been happening pretty much every time since then. Really, is that all you need to know? Because I have errands.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Every time for the past couple of weeks. Okay. And has there been any change in the amount of stool you're passing?
PATIENT: No, not really. About the same as always. Look, I don't spend my time analyzing my… waste products, alright? It goes in, it comes out. Same quantity. It’s just the color that’s different. And frankly, I find this whole line of questioning a bit… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. I apologize if the questions seem detailed, but the color and consistency of stool can give us important clues about what’s going on internally. Let’s switch gears for a moment. Besides the color change, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Like what? Do I need to list every single time I go to the bathroom? Honestly. No, nothing else is different. It comes out… when it’s supposed to. No pain, no… nothing. Just black. Like I said, the pills are probably the problem. I read somewhere that they can cause stomach bleeding. Are we going to do something about that or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be proactive about potential causes, and stomach bleeding from medication is certainly a possibility we need to consider. Let’s get a better understanding of your medical history, and then we can discuss testing options. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I'm Czech, you know. We're a hardy people. I haven’t got time for allergies. Maybe a little sniffle if the pollen’s bad, but nothing serious. And I certainly haven't had a reaction to any of my pills. I'd know if I was allergic, wouldn’t I? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. You’re going to make me list everything? Fine. Let’s see… there’s naproxen, two pills twice a day for the arthritis, of course. And omeprazole, because the naproxen gives me heartburn. Then there’s… let me think… a little bit of lisinopril for my blood pressure, and… oh, and a multivitamin. Is that all you need? I really must get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen, omeprazole, lisinopril, and a multivitamin. Thank you for that list. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently press on your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. And be gentle, alright? I'm not some young spring chicken anymore.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. I am noting some mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, but no rebound or guarding. No palpable masses. Alright, Dawnetta. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, the black stools are concerning, and we need to investigate further. The tenderness in your abdomen adds to that concern. We need to rule out any internal bleeding. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and a stool test to check for blood. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just do it. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I’ve got a garden that needs tending, you know. And frankly, I’d like to know when I can expect these results. Don't tell me it's going to be weeks. I'm not a fan of waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the wait time, Dawnetta. We can get those tests processed fairly quickly. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. Our nurse will call you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. I'm going to recommend that you temporarily stop taking the naproxen until we get the results back. Continue taking the omeprazole and lisinopril as prescribed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Stop the naproxen? Ugh. That’s the one that actually helps with the pain. But… alright. Fine. If you think it’s necessary. Just don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if I’m in agony, I’m calling you, understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. Stopping the naproxen might cause some discomfort, but it's important to determine the cause of the black stools. If the pain becomes severe, please call the office immediately – don’t hesitate. We can discuss pain management options if needed. I’m also going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, just to have another set of eyes on things. They specialize in digestive health and can provide more comprehensive evaluation if necessary. Would you like me to have the nurse schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: A… a gastroenterologist? Oh, for goodness sake. More doctors? Look, I’m not running a marathon here. I’m an old woman with some… unpleasant bowel movements. I don’t need a specialist. I’m perfectly capable of dealing with this myself, once I know what’s going on. No, thank you. Just get the results back quickly, and I’ll deal with it. Honestly, I’m starting to feel worse just being here.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Dawnetta. However, black stools can indicate a serious underlying issue, and a gastroenterologist can perform further testing, such as a colonoscopy, to rule out anything concerning. It's better to be safe and thorough. I strongly recommend we at least schedule a consultation, even if you decide not to proceed with any further testing. Would you allow me to at least leave you with some information about gastroenterologists in the area, so you have the option?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Information. That’s all. Just information. Don’t bother me with phone calls or appointments or anything like that. I’ll… I’ll look at it when I have time. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my afternoon. Are we finally finished here?
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I’ll have the nurse leave some information for you. And yes, we are finished for today. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if your symptoms worsen or if you have any questions. We’ll get those lab results back to you as quickly as possible. Thank you for coming in. I hope you feel better soon.
