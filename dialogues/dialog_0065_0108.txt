DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, it’s… well, it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’. Not a pretty sight, let me tell you. Happened a couple times now. Thought I could tough it out, but it’s gettin’ worse.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. And this has happened more than once?
PATIENT: Yeah, twice now in the last week. First time, just a little. Thought it was somethin’ I ate, you know? Bad shrimp maybe. But then it happened again last night, and… a good bit more. Enough to worry a man. It's not like I'm a delicate flower, but this ain't right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say "a good bit more," can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn't just a little speck in the bowl, alright? It was… dark. Really dark. And there was a fair amount of it. Enough to make me feel lightheaded, standin’ up. Had to sit right back down. And it smelled… different. Not like normal. I don't know how to explain it. Like old metal, almost. Does that make any sense? Look, I deal with… things all day. I know what colors shouldn't be comin’ out of a person, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does give me some information. Dark, and a metallic smell… and it caused you to feel lightheaded. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bleeding?
PATIENT: Lightheaded, yeah. And tired. Real tired. Not just regular tired, like after a long shift. This is… bone-deep tired. I could sleep for a week and still feel drained. And my stomach's been achin’. A dull ache, mostly. Comes and goes. And, uh… I haven't been… regular, if you know what I mean. Constipated, I think the young folks call it. Everything just feels… slow. Is that makin' sense? Look, I ain't a doctor. I just tell folks what's what.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Tiredness, abdominal pain, and constipation alongside the bleeding. Now, have you noticed any change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I eat. Never been a big eater, to be honest. Doesn't really change much. It ain't like I'm starvin’ or nothin’, just… don’t crave nothin’. Mostly just… tasteless. Everything tastes kinda… flat. Even my wife's cooking, God rest her soul, doesn't seem to have the same kick anymore. I figured it was just me gettin' older, losing my tastebuds. But now that I think about it, it's been a while. Is that important? I don't know what's important anymore.
DOCTOR: It is relevant. Loss of appetite and a change in taste can be indicative of several things. Let’s go through some other things. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm. Not that I recall. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. But nothin’ major. Never been a sickly man. Strong as an ox, always have been. My wife, bless her heart, she was the one always at the doctor. Me? Just the occasional cold. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothin’ like that. Never needed insurance, never needed much. She took care of all that stuff. It's been a while since I've had a proper checkup, to be honest. After she… well, after she passed, I just didn't bother. What's the point, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I've seen enough… parts in my line of work, I don't need to be under a knife myself. Never broken a bone, never had an appendix removed, nothin’. Perfectly intact, if you need to know. I always figured a man should keep all his original parts, if he can help it. Stupid, maybe, but that's always been my philosophy. Look, I handle the… the remains. You don’t wanna know. Point is, I'm used to seein’ what happens when things go wrong. But never to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, not much left. Had a brother, but he passed a few years back. Heart trouble. And a sister, but we ain’t spoken in… decades. Long story. Point is, no family history I'm aware of that would be relevant. My mother… she lived a long life, mostly healthy. Father… worked in a factory, hard life. Didn’t live long, but wasn’t sick, just… worn out. They weren't ones for doctors much either. "Tough it out" was their motto. Not much help, if you ask me. Is that what you're gettin' at? Family history? Not much to tell, Doc. Not much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you use any tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Heavens no. Never touched the stuff. Not my style. Alcohol… I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes. A single one. Maybe two on a Friday. Nothing serious. And tobacco? I smoked a little when I was younger, back when everyone did. But I quit… oh, must be thirty years ago. Good riddance, too. Point is, I ain't one for vices. Never needed 'em. Look, I see enough bad things in my day. I don't need to add to it myself. You got any more questions, Doc? This is gettin' long.
DOCTOR: Just a few more. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. My wife always took care of the medications, if I needed 'em. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, maybe. But nothin’ serious. Penicillin, tetracycline, all that stuff… never bothered me. I’ve been poked and prodded enough in my life, I’d know if I was allergic to somethin’. Point is, no. I'm a pretty durable fella. You got any idea what's goin' on, Doc? This bleedin' is worryin' me. And I ain't one to worry easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Based on what you've told me – the dark stool, feeling lightheaded and tired, abdominal pain and constipation, and the loss of appetite – we need to investigate this further. The dark stool is particularly concerning, as it often indicates bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. I need to perform a physical exam to assess your abdomen, and then I’d like to order some blood work to check your hemoglobin and other levels. We may also need to consider an endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to determine the source of the bleeding. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Endo… what now? Look, Doc, I ain't a fan of folks stickin' things inside me. Is that absolutely necessary? And what's this gonna cost? I ain’t insured, like I said. I can barely afford the bills as it is. Blood work, okay, fine. Physical exam, I guess. But stickin' tubes down my throat? That sounds… unpleasant. What are we lookin' for exactly? Is it serious? And can you give me some idea of the cost before you… start stickin' things? I'm a simple man, Doc. I just want to know what's wrong and how much it's gonna cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. It allows us to directly visualize these areas and identify the source of the bleeding, whether it’s an ulcer, inflammation, or something else. As for the cost, without insurance it can be significant. The endoscopy itself will likely be around $1500 - $2000, and the blood work will be another $200 - $300. However, we can discuss payment options with the billing department. Before we proceed with the endoscopy, we’ll start with the physical exam and blood work. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine if the endoscopy is absolutely necessary. And to be upfront, the bleeding is serious, and we need to find the cause quickly. It's important to rule out anything life-threatening. Now, if you’re comfortable, let’s start with the physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: $2000? Good Lord. That’s… that’s a lot of money. Look, Doc, I appreciate you explainin', but I’m still not thrilled about stickin’ a tube down my throat. But… fine. Physical exam, yeah, alright. Do that. Listen and poke, whatever you need to do. But I’m makin’ no promises about this other stuff until I know exactly what we're lookin' at. And I expect you to be honest with me about the cost every step of the way. No surprises. I'm a simple man, remember? Just tell me what's wrong and how much it's gonna cost. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. I assure you I will be transparent about the costs. Now, please lie back on the exam table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me assess the sounds within your digestive system. Take a deep breath in… and exhale. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Deep breath… out. It’s… tender. Right there. A little achy, like a dull pressure. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And… uh… there. Same thing. Not terrible, but I definitely feel somethin' when you press. Feels like… somethin's swollen, maybe? Don't know. I ain't a doctor, remember? Just tell me what you see. And try not to poke too hard, alright? It ain’t exactly pleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting tenderness in the upper middle abdomen, particularly around the epigastric region and slightly to the left. There doesn’t appear to be any guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good, but there is some mild discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some slight fullness. There’s no evidence of any masses or organomegaly. Based on the physical exam, the tenderness and fullness could indicate inflammation of the stomach lining, possibly gastritis, or potentially a peptic ulcer. However, we need the blood work to rule out other causes and assess the severity of your condition. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a test to check for Helicobacter pylori infection, a common cause of gastritis and ulcers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Gastritis… ulcers… it all sounds… unpleasant. Helicobacter pylori? What is that, some kinda bug? Look, Doc, is this serious? Am I gonna need surgery? I just want to know straight. I ain’t one for fancy medical talk. Is this something you can fix with pills, or is this gonna be a long, expensive nightmare? And… what happens while we’re waitin’ for these blood tests? I feel kinda… weak already. Can I at least get somethin’ for the pain? This achin’ is gettin’ worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, let’s take this one step at a time. Helicobacter pylori is a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach lining and cause inflammation and ulcers. It’s very common, and thankfully, it’s usually treatable with antibiotics and medication to reduce stomach acid. As for whether it’s serious, it can be, if left untreated. Ulcers can bleed, as you’ve experienced, and in rare cases, they can lead to complications like perforation or obstruction. However, we caught this early, and with proper treatment, we can usually manage it effectively. Regarding surgery, it’s unlikely you’ll need surgery at this stage. Most ulcers are treated with medication. While we’re waiting for the blood tests, I can prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to help reduce your stomach acid and alleviate the pain. It won’t cure the problem, but it will provide some symptomatic relief. I’ll also recommend a bland diet, avoiding spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. I understand you’re concerned about the cost, and I’ll do everything I can to keep it affordable. We can discuss payment options with the billing department. But for now, let’s focus on getting you some relief and determining the cause of the bleeding. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Pills to reduce the acid… and a bland diet. No spicy food… no caffeine… no alcohol. Sounds… boring. But if it helps… alright. And you’ll help me with the cost? I appreciate that, Doc. I really do. And you think these blood tests will tell you what’s wrong? Is there anything else I should be worried about? I don't wanna keep comin’ back here if it’s just gonna be bad news. I’m just… tired of all this. I just want to feel normal again. Alright. Give me the pills, Doc. And let’s get these blood tests done. The sooner we know what’s wrong, the sooner I can get back to… well, to whatever it is I do. Just tell me where to go for the blood work, and I’ll get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to help you feel better. I’m prescribing you Omeprazole 20mg once daily, to be taken in the morning. It should provide some relief within a few days. The blood tests will help us determine the cause of the bleeding, rule out any other underlying conditions, and assess your overall health. We'll check your hemoglobin levels to see how much blood you’ve lost, your liver and kidney function, and your H. pylori status. Here’s a slip for the lab. It’s located just down the hall, room 203. They’re open until 5 pm today. Please let them know you’re here for the blood work ordered by Dr. Duplichan. Once the results are back, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or black, tarry stools, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Room 203… alright. I can find that. And… if the bleedin’ gets worse, go to the emergency room. Okay, got it. No, I think that’s all for now, Doc. Just… thank you. For explainin’ everything, for not makin’ me feel like an idiot, and for tryin’ to help. It means a lot. I guess I'll go get these blood tests done, and wait for the phone call. Hopefully, it's nothin' too serious. Alright. Thank you again, Doc. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gentz. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
