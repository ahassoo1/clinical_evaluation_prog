DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing some…lapses. With my memory, you understand. It is concerning, as I manage many properties, and I must remember details. I am Venus Alvara, by the way. Perhaps you have my chart?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Venus Alvara, age 53. Thank you for clarifying. “Lapses” – can you tell me more about those?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Fifty-three. It is… frustrating. Just yesterday, I was speaking with a tenant about a leaking roof, and I completely forgot his name. His name! I had spoken with him only last week. And the week before. It is not a common occurrence, but it happens more and more. Small things, mostly. Dates, names… things I should know instantly. I do not…lose time, if you understand. Just… the details slip.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's primarily difficulty recalling names and dates, recent events mostly?
PATIENT: Yes, that is…a very good way to put it. Names, dates, even where I placed my keys this morning! Small things. Things I used to recall without a second thought. It is… distressing, Doctor. I keep very detailed notes, you see. For all my properties. But even reading my notes sometimes… the information does not seem… familiar.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question. Perhaps… six months? It began slowly. I thought it was just stress, you understand. Managing so many properties… it is a great responsibility. But it has been…steadily worsening. I noticed it more frequently in the last three months, I believe. It is becoming… noticeable to others, I fear.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the memory lapses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else, that I have noticed. No headaches, no dizziness… no changes in my vision. I sleep well, though I do worry frequently. And my appetite is… normal. I have been feeling a little more… tired, perhaps. But that could simply be the stress. I do not believe it is related. I have a… history of high blood pressure, you see. I take medication for it. Has been for many years.
DOCTOR: Alright. You mentioned high blood pressure medication. Can you tell me the name of the medication and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… Lisinopril. Twenty milligrams, once daily. I have been taking it for… almost ten years, I believe. It keeps the pressure under control, mostly. My doctor – Doctor Petrov – monitors it regularly. He is… retired now, actually. I see a new doctor, but he is not as… thorough, I find. I do not wish to name him, if you do not mind.
DOCTOR: No, I understand completely. Lisinopril, 20mg daily. Any other medications, vitamins, or supplements you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the Lisinopril. I do not take vitamins or supplements. I believe in a healthy diet, mostly. And plenty of water. I do not… indulge in unhealthy habits, if you understand. No smoking, very little alcohol. I try to maintain a… disciplined lifestyle. It is important, with my responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have never experienced a reaction to any medication or food. I am… quite fortunate in that regard. My mother… she had many allergies. But I seem to have inherited… none of them. It is a blessing, truly. I am a very… robust woman, generally. Apart from the blood pressure, of course. And now… this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question. My paternal grandmother… she became quite confused in her later years. But it was attributed to a stroke, I believe. And my mother’s sister… she had some difficulties with remembering things, but it was dismissed as simply “old age.” No one spoke of… dementia, or Alzheimer’s. It was not… common to discuss such things, you understand. My family… they were very private people. And now… many of them are gone. It is difficult to recall precisely. I do not believe so, but… I cannot say with certainty.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am… widowed, you see. My husband passed away… five years ago. It was… sudden. A heart attack. We had no children. I live alone, in a large apartment. I am… very independent. I manage my properties myself, as I said. I have a small circle of friends, mostly colleagues. We meet occasionally for… coffee, or dinner. I enjoy reading, and… walking. I keep… busy. I do not… allow myself to become idle. It is important to maintain a… sense of purpose, you understand. It is… difficult to be alone, but I manage.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ms. Alvara, thank you for providing that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a routine check. Can you please follow my instructions as best as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I will do my best. I am a… cooperative patient. Please, proceed. I understand a physical exam is necessary. I just… hope it does not take too long. I have many appointments scheduled for this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… good. Everything sounds clear. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are normal. Balance appears steady. Now, I'm going to perform a very brief cognitive assessment. This will involve some simple memory and attention tasks. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I am… comfortable with that. Though I must admit, I am a little… apprehensive. My memory, you see. But I will do my best. Please, proceed. I understand it is necessary. I just… hope I do not embarrass myself. It is… difficult to concentrate when one is worried.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry at all, Ms. Alvara. This is just to get a baseline. It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Okay. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Hmm. Let me see… It is… August. The second of August. 2025, is it? Yes, the second of August, 2025. I believe so. It is… difficult to keep track of the days, sometimes. But yes, August 2nd, 2025. I am quite certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, tell me the words. I will repeat them as accurately as possible. I am… trying to concentrate. It is… difficult to focus, but I will do my best. Please, proceed. I am ready.
DOCTOR: The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. Apple, Table, Penny. I believe I have them. It is… strange, repeating words. But I have them. Apple, Table, Penny. Are those correct? I am… hoping I have not forgotten them already. It is… disconcerting, this.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock face, showing the time as 10:10. I just want to see how you orient yourself on the page. Do you have a good sense of spatial awareness?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. I have always been… quite good at drawing. Though it has been some time since I last did so. A clock face… 10:10. I believe I can manage. Please, hand me a pen and paper. I will do my best. It is… a little nerve-wracking, but I will try. I am… generally quite good with spatial awareness. For managing properties, it is essential, you understand.
DOCTOR: Take your time. No rush.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I have drawn the clock face. It is… not perfect, perhaps. I have not drawn in a long time. But I believe I have indicated the time correctly. Ten… ten past ten. Or… is it? Oh dear. I am… terribly sorry. It is… more difficult than I anticipated. I seem to have… miscalculated the placement of the hands. It is… disconcerting. It is… a little off, is it not? I am… terribly sorry. It seems my memory… and my spatial awareness… are not what they once were.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That’s alright. It is as you say, slightly off. No need to apologize. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam and cognitive assessment, you’re experiencing subjective memory lapses that are progressive and causing you concern. The clock drawing test suggests some mild difficulty with visuospatial skills. Given your age and the nature of your symptoms, it’s important to investigate this further. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, which could be contributing, but the memory issues warrant further attention. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be affecting your memory, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or anemia. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to get a better look at the structure and rule out any other issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds sensible. Blood tests and an MRI… whatever is necessary to determine the cause. I am… quite willing to comply. I just… wish to know what is happening. The uncertainty is… distressing. If it is simply the blood pressure, that is one thing. But if it is something more… I would prefer to know. Yes, please, proceed with the tests and the MRI. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Is there anything I should… prepare for beforehand? Or… refrain from doing? I just… wish to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: Good. For the blood tests, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drink except water. For the MRI, you’ll need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, anything like that. The MRI itself is painless, but it can be a little loud, so we’ll provide you with earplugs. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They specialize in brain health and can provide a more detailed assessment and treatment plan if needed. I want to emphasize that this doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It could be a number of things, and we’re just being thorough. But it’s important to rule out anything concerning. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not… believe so. You have explained everything very clearly. Blood tests, MRI, neurologist… I understand. Fast for twelve hours, remove metal objects… I will remember. I am… grateful for your thoroughness. And for your… reassurance. It is… comforting to know that you are taking this seriously. I just… hope it is nothing too… alarming. But if it is, I would rather know. Yes. I think… that is all. Perhaps… when will I be scheduled for the tests and the MRI? And the appointment with the neurologist? I wish to… plan accordingly. Thank you, Doctor Vanochten. You have been… very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. The lab will call you to schedule the blood tests, and the MRI facility will contact you as well. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the neurology appointment for you before you leave. I expect you’ll be able to get in within the next two weeks. I’ll also give you a referral note for the neurologist with the results of the blood tests, once they come back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to manage your blood pressure as prescribed and focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about managing your medication or lifestyle that I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have been… quite diligent in managing my blood pressure, as you know. And I maintain a… healthy lifestyle. I eat well, I exercise, I sleep adequately. I do not believe I have any specific concerns in that regard. I just… wish to know the results of the tests as soon as possible. The uncertainty is… unsettling. But I trust your judgement, Doctor. And I am grateful for your help. I believe… that is all. I do not wish to take up any more of your time. Thank you, Doctor Vanochten. You have been… very kind and patient. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Alvara. Sarah will be in shortly to go over everything with you and schedule those appointments. We’ll get those results to you as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m confident we’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Ms. Alvara.
