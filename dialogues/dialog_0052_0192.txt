DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, Dr. Shely, right? Look, it’s pretty simple. I gotta take this exam for the… the army thing. They want me to get checked out first. Seems like a waste of time, honestly, but rules are rules. So, here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hartness. A pre-employment physical for the army. Certainly, we can complete that for you. To ensure I have a complete picture of your health, I'll need to ask you a number of questions, and then perform a physical examination. Let's begin with a bit of background. Could you please tell me about any current medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Nothing really. I mean, I get a bit of a sore back sometimes, from work. Building engines all day isn't exactly easy on a man. But that's it. I'm strong as an ox, always have been. Don't go lookin' for somethin' that isn't there. What kind of questions are these anyway? Feels like a lot of bother for somethin' that shouldn't be necessary.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Hartness. Even seemingly minor issues can be important to document for a comprehensive assessment. The purpose of this examination is to ensure your overall health and suitability for service, and to establish a baseline for any future needs. Regarding the back pain – could you describe it further?
PATIENT: Look, I told ya, it’s just a sore back! From bendin' and liftin' all day. It comes and goes. Sometimes I wake up feelin' a little stiff, sometimes not. I take some… some pills my wife gets me. The orange ones. I don't know what they are, she handles all that. It usually sorts itself out. I’ve been doin' this work for thirty years, you know. A little ache isn't gonna stop me now. It’s not like I’m fallin’ apart. Honestly, I think they’re makin' a big deal out of nothin’.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It’s helpful to have a clearer picture of the medication you’re taking, even if it’s just occasionally. Do you happen to know the name of those orange pills, or perhaps where your wife obtains them?
PATIENT: No, I don't. She gets 'em from the… the pharmacy, I guess. Down the street. She handles all that. I just take 'em when I need to. It's not like I'm addicted to anything. I don't need to know the fancy names of every little pill. It’s just pain relief, alright? Really, are we gonna spend the whole day talkin’ about orange pills? I got things to do, you know. This army thing... it’s not gonna wait forever.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Hartness. It's important for me to have a complete understanding of everything you are taking, as some medications can interact with others or have implications for service. If you’re unsure of the name, perhaps your wife could provide that information at a later time. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. I’ve broken a few bones workin’ over the years, a finger here, a wrist there, but never had to go to the hospital. Just patched myself up and got back to work. Tough as nails, that’s me. What are you tryin' to find out? You think I'm gonna be fallin' apart on the battlefield or somethin'? That’s ridiculous. I’m in better shape than half these young fellas runnin’ around these days.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Hartness, I am simply gathering information to ensure your health and well-being. It’s standard procedure. Have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never been cut open in my life. I told you, I'm tough. I fix things, I don't need fixin'. Look, this is gettin' old. I’m startin’ to think this whole thing is a waste of my time. I gotta get back to work, and frankly, I don’t have all day to answer questions about things that haven’t happened. Are we almost done here?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hartness. We are getting close to completion. I just need to gather a few more details. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history... hmm. My father… he had a bad heart. Died young, I think it was. Sixty-something. My mother… she lived to be old, I think. Eighty, maybe? She just… got old, you know? Nothing special. Everyone in my family was pretty tough, didn’t complain much. Didn’t go see doctors much either. So, there's your family history. Happy now? Can we please get this over with? I’ve got a machine to fix.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hartness. That is helpful. One final section before the physical examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. None. I eat everything. I don't break out in rashes or nothin'. I'm a pretty simple man. Give me a good steak and a strong coffee, and I'm happy. No allergies. Seriously, is that it? Are we finally gonna get to the actual exam? I’m starting to feel a bit dizzy sittin' here answering all these pointless questions. I need to get back to work. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That completes the questionnaire portion of the examination. Now, we’ll proceed with a brief physical exam. I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Would you please sit up and remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Yeah, alright. Get this over with. I got things to do. This is a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. Honestly, you'd think they'd trust a man who's been buildin' engines for thirty years. More reliable than half these computer fellas. There. Are you happy now?
DOCTOR: I'm simply performing a standard assessment, Mr. Hartness. This cuff will inflate around your arm to measure your blood pressure. It may feel a little tight for a moment. Now, I’ll just check your pulse. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me. "Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some mild diminished breath sounds at the bases. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? Bronchitis? No. Never. I told you, I’m a tough man. I’ve worked in dusty shops my whole life, always have. Maybe that’s it? Dust. I don’t get sick. A little cough now and then, but that’s it. I’m not some weakling with asthma, alright? This whole thing is startin' to irritate me. Are you gonna poke and prod me all day? Honestly, I think I'm more reliable than half the people who need checkups. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Mr. Hartness. I'm simply completing a thorough assessment to ensure your overall health. Now, I’ll just take a quick look at your ears and throat. "Ears appear normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection." "Lymph nodes are not enlarged." Now, I'm going to ask you to stand up and I'll check your reflexes and gait. “Please stand with your feet flat on the floor. I’m going to tap your knees with this small hammer to check your reflexes.” “Your reflexes are normal.” “Please walk a few steps forward, and then backward.” <stage>I observe his gait.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? I walk perfectly fine. Been walkin' all my life. What are you lookin' for? I’m not some crippled old man. Honestly, I think this is a waste of both our time. I got work to do, you know. Machines don’t fix themselves. Are we done yet? Please tell me we are done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That completes the physical examination. Based on my assessment, your overall health appears stable. However, I did note some diminished breath sounds in your lungs, which could be related to your long-term exposure to dust. And your blood pressure is slightly elevated. I recommend a chest X-ray to further evaluate the lungs. And I suggest you monitor your blood pressure at home, and consider making some lifestyle modifications, such as reducing sodium intake and increasing exercise. I’ll write up a referral for the chest X-ray, and provide you with some information on blood pressure monitoring. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Chest X-ray? Lifestyle modifications? Look, I'm a mechanic, not a… a health enthusiast. I build engines, I don't run marathons. I’ve been breathin’ dust for thirty years, and I’m still standin’. I think I’ll be alright. And I don’t need a referral. I think I'm gonna skip the X-ray, if you don't mind. Honestly, I think they’re makin' a big deal outta nothin’. I just need a form signed so I can get this army thing over with. Can we please just get to the paperwork? I’m startin’ to feel like I'm wastin’ my whole afternoon here. Just the form, alright? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Hartness. However, I strongly recommend the chest X-ray. It’s a simple procedure that can provide valuable information about your lung health. While you may feel fine now, early detection is key to preventing potential complications. However, I respect your autonomy. I can document your refusal of the chest X-ray. But I must advise you that this could potentially affect your eligibility for service. Let me write up the paperwork for the army physical, documenting your health status and your refusal of the chest X-ray. <stage>I begin typing on the computer. Do you have any current medications you are taking, or any allergies I need to document on the form?
PATIENT: Look, just write what you gotta write. I told you, my wife gets me some orange pills sometimes for my back. I don’t know what they are. And no allergies. Just… write it down. I just want this form so I can get outta here. Honestly, I think this whole process is ridiculous. Machines don’t need forms. They just need wrenches. Just hurry up, alright? I got work to do. This is a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. Just the form. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Here is the completed form for the army physical. <stage>I hand him the form. I strongly advise you to discuss the findings of this exam with a medical professional if you experience any changes in your health, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or persistent cough. Thank you for your patience. I wish you all the best. <stage>I offer a polite nod, signaling the end of the consultation.
PATIENT: .
