DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. My name is Dr. Laquanta Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been noticing a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen for a little while now. It’s… concerning me, so I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A lump in your lower abdomen is certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… it’s not particularly painful, honestly. More of a… fullness, I suppose. I noticed it maybe a month or so ago, just when I was… getting ready in the morning. It feels… firm, but not hard, if that makes sense? And it seems to be getting a little bit bigger, slowly.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. "Firm but not hard" is a good description. And you've noticed it gradually increasing in size over the past month. Is it located on one specific side, or more central in your lower abdomen?
PATIENT: It's… more on the left side, I think. Not directly in the middle, but definitely leaning left. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, to be honest. I’m not very good at identifying things internally, if you understand what I mean. It just feels like it’s over there.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – it can be difficult to locate things internally. Left-sided is good to know. Has anything specific made it more noticeable – like straining, coughing, or certain movements?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don't think so. It doesn’t seem to change with straining or coughing. And no particular movements make it worse or better. It's just… there. Constant, really. I suppose when I’m lying down, it feels a little more prominent, maybe? But that could just be because I’m focusing on it then.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant and more noticeable when lying down. That's good information. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this lump – any changes in your bowel habits, weight loss, fatigue, or fever, for example?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No changes in my bowel habits. My weight has been pretty stable, maybe even a little up recently, if I’m being honest. I haven’t felt any more tired than usual, and definitely no fever. It really is just… the lump. That’s why I’m worried, because it’s… new. And I don't know what it could be.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring to hear about the lack of other symptoms. It's always best to get something new checked out. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I have… well, I had a bout of diverticulitis a few years ago, maybe five or six years. But that was treated and hasn’t bothered me since. Otherwise, just the usual colds and flus. No serious conditions, no major surgeries. I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the previous diverticulitis – we’ll certainly keep that in mind. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare coverage. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, maybe. Nothing regular. I don’t take any supplements either. I believe in a healthy diet and getting enough rest, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. And you said you had a bout of diverticulitis five or six years ago - do you recall if that was confirmed with a scan, like a CT scan, or just a clinical diagnosis?
PATIENT: I believe it was confirmed with a CT scan, yes. I remember being quite uncomfortable during it, but the doctor said it showed inflammation in my colon. I was treated with antibiotics, and it cleared up quickly. I haven’t had any problems with it since, so I haven’t needed to follow up. I think it was at the local hospital here, but honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, confirmed with a CT scan, treated with antibiotics, and no recurrence. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much everything. No reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I can recall. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction, thankfully. I’m quite lucky, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit complicated. My mother had… well, she had some stomach issues, but I don't know the specifics. She passed away a few years ago, and I wasn’t very involved in her medical care. My father is still alive, but he lives in Palestine, and communication is… difficult. I don’t know much about his medical history either. So, unfortunately, I don't have a very clear picture of my family's health background.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That’s not uncommon. It’s helpful to know even if the information is limited. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently palpate, or feel, your abdomen to assess the size, shape, and tenderness of the lump. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, which is good. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. … Okay. I am noting a soft, non-tender mass in the left lower quadrant. It’s approximately 3 centimeters in size, and it’s somewhat firm, as you described. There is no rebound tenderness, which is also reassuring. Do you feel any discomfort with this pressure?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s… a bit strange, feeling it being pressed on, but not painful. It just feels… like a fullness, as I said before. It doesn't radiate or anything. It’s… honestly, not much different than when I’m just feeling it myself, just… more focused, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No pain, just a sensation of fullness. And no radiation of pain. I’m also going to check for any enlarged lymph nodes in your groin and abdomen. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. Given your history and the findings on the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to your previous diverticulitis, although it’s been several years. It could also be a cyst, a lipoma – a benign fatty tumor – or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I recommend ordering a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will allow us to visualize the mass and determine its characteristics. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A CT scan sounds like a good idea. I’d like to know what’s going on, and visualizing it seems like the best way to do that. So, yes, please. I trust your judgment. I’m… a little anxious, of course, but I’d rather know than worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and I commend you for proactively addressing this. A CT scan is the best next step. I'll write the order for the scan now. It will likely be scheduled at the local hospital, and they will contact you directly to arrange a time. The radiologist will interpret the results, and I will review them with you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any of the following symptoms – fever, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. Just… when do you think I might hear back about the scan? A rough estimate would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Of course. Typically, the radiologist will have the results available within 24 to 48 hours. My office will contact you as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them, so you can expect to hear back within two to three business days. I understand your anxiety, and I want to reassure you that we are taking this seriously. While we don’t want to jump to conclusions, it's always best to investigate any new mass. I will be in touch as soon as I have more information. Do you need a work note for any time off while awaiting results?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you to ask. No, I don’t think so. I can still work, thankfully. It’s just… the waiting, I suppose. No, I don't need a note. Thank you. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Well, Amy, I’m glad we were able to discuss this today and formulate a plan. I want to reiterate that if you experience any worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Here is a summary of our plan, and a contact number for my office if you have any questions before your scan results are in. Thank you for coming in today, and please take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Quicksey. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I will. Goodbye.
