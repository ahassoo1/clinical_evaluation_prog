DOCTOR: Hi Delron, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. It’s… Hartness. Delron Hartness. I’m here for… this exam. For the army. Gotta get this done, you know? Before they change their minds about taking a… a man my age. Not everyone can do this work, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Delron. So this is a physical exam required for the army. That’s good to know. And you’re worried about being a bit older for the requirements, is that right?
PATIENT: Worried? No. Aware. There’s a difference. I keep myself in shape. Mostly. Used to be a lot more, but… things happen. Still, I can outwork most of these… youngsters. Just want to make sure this exam doesn't… hold things up. Waste of time, if it does.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re proactive about it. We'll do a thorough exam and see where we stand. Let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? What does that even mean? I had the chickenpox when I was a kid, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. Stupid tree. Other than that… nothing. Maybe a bad flu here and there, but who hasn’t had the flu? My wife keeps telling me I should go to the doctor more, but I tell her I’m built different.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major illnesses or surgeries, just childhood chickenpox and a broken arm. That’s helpful to know. And you generally feel healthy, aside from occasional colds or the flu?
PATIENT: Generally? Yes. Look, I work with machines all day. Heavy machines. It keeps you moving. Keeps you… honest. I don’t sit around complaining. And I eat alright. My wife makes good food, mostly. Sometimes too much, but… good food. I don’t have any… aches and pains or anything. Not that I’d admit to it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never. I don't do pills. Waste of money. And I don't trust 'em. My grandfather used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." And I'm pretty functional, if you know what I mean. Sometimes a little… ibuprofen for a headache, if it's really bad, but that's it. And not often.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat everything. Well, not everything. I don’t like beets. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. And I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife tries to get me to take allergy pills during pollen season, but I tell her I’m tougher than that. Honestly, the world’s gone soft.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, just to finish up this history part, could you tell me a little bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh. Where do I even begin? My mother lived to be… well, old. But she was always complaining about something. My father was… strong. Worked in a factory his whole life. Kept it all bottled up, I think. His brother had… something with his heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to all that. Everyone gets sick eventually. It’s just… inevitable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's common not to have a lot of details. Knowing your mother lived to an old age is good to hear, and the heart issue with your uncle is something we can keep in mind. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll start with your height and weight, then check your blood pressure and pulse. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I already told you I keep myself in shape. Shouldn’t take long to see that. Just… don’t expect anything fancy. I’m a practical man. Machines don't need fancy, and neither do I. Though, I suppose a quick check is alright. Just don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with height and weight. Okay, 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear, heart sounds are normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Ears, nose and throat appear clear. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Do you mind?
PATIENT: Reflexes? What for? I’m not a… a broken machine that needs fixing! But… alright, fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it. I have things to do. This isn't a spa day, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, reflexes are normal. Everything seems okay so far. Now, just a quick neurological check – could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Happy? I’m following your finger. Can we get this over with? I swear, I’ve had more thorough inspections at the scrap yard. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Yes, good. And can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There. Squeezed 'em. Strong grip. Always have. Used to crush walnuts with these hands. Still could, probably. Now can we…?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, just a quick check of your range of motion. Can you lift your arms above your head?
PATIENT: There. Like this? Perfectly functional. See? No problems. I told you, I keep myself in shape. This is a waste of my time, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you bend over and touch your toes?
PATIENT: There! Close enough. Honestly, my back’s a little stiff from working on that engine yesterday. Doesn’t mean I can't work. This isn’t a gymnastics competition, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Delron. That completes the physical exam. Overall, everything appears within normal limits, though your back has some limited range of motion, which you attribute to recent work. Your weight is a bit low for your height, but you appear healthy and active. I'd like to run some blood tests just to get a baseline and rule out anything underlying. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really? For what? I told you, I’m fine. But… fine. If you have to. Just get it over with. And don’t tell me I have something wrong. I don't need that. Just...prove I'm healthy and let me get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. We'll get the blood tests done and I'll review the results as quickly as possible. It's just a standard procedure to make sure everything is optimal. I'll need to draw a small sample from your arm. Do you have any preferences about which arm?
PATIENT: Doesn't matter. Take whatever one's easiest for you. I don't fuss about needles. Built tougher than that, remember? Just… don't take all day. I have things to do. Important things. Not sitting around waiting for blood tests.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get this over with quickly. Okay, all done. It might feel a little sore for a few minutes. I'll give you a bandage. The lab results should be back in a few days, and I'll contact you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when will I know if I can join the army? That's all that matters. Don't waste my time with things I don't need to know. Just give me the green light or don't.
DOCTOR: Once the lab results are back and I’ve reviewed them, I’ll give you a clear assessment of your suitability for service and discuss any necessary steps. I’ll also provide a physical exam report that you can submit with your application. I anticipate having the results to you within three to five business days. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Just… get it done. And don’t lose the results. That’d be… inconvenient. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. We’ll make sure everything is taken care of. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Hmph. Right. .
