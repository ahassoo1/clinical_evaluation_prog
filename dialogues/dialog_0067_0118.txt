DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Pfennig, was it? Yes, well, it's about this... certification, you see. I believe it's required for my continued practice. Something about keeping up with standards. Honestly, the paperwork these days… it’s quite a bother. I seem to recall needing an eye and ear exam. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Pfennig is correct. And I understand your frustration with the paperwork – it can definitely be a lot! It sounds like you're referring to a re-certification requirement for your practice. To clarify, are you needing this exam specifically for your practice, or is this a general health check-up that happens to include those components as well?
PATIENT: For my practice, of course. What a curious question. Do people simply… have these done for enjoyment? No, no, it's quite essential. I wouldn't be allowed to continue, you understand. Though, I confess, I can’t quite recall the exact governing body requiring it. Something to do with… regulations. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. I just know I need the documentation.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to need documentation for practice requirements, and it’s common for those details to get a bit lost in the shuffle. We can certainly get that sorted out for you today. To begin, let's just do a quick review of your medical history. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly, or have you had any recent hospitalizations or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That is a question. Let me think... I believe I saw a specialist a few years back, for… something with my shoulder. A rotator cuff, perhaps? It was quite painful for a time, but it seems to have resolved itself. And… there was that incident with the skiing trip, but that was decades ago. Honestly, Doctor, it all feels rather distant. I try not to dwell on these things. I’m generally a very healthy man, you understand. It's mostly just routine, this whole affair.
DOCTOR: Okay, a shoulder issue a few years ago and a skiing incident long ago. That’s helpful to know. And I appreciate you letting me know you generally consider yourself healthy - that’s excellent. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications... let me see. Well, I take a multivitamin, naturally. Good for maintaining one's health, you understand. And… occasionally, if I have a particularly stubborn headache, I might take an aspirin. But that's hardly regular. No, I don’t believe I’m on any prescribed medications. I pride myself on avoiding such things, if at all possible. All those side effects… dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, a multivitamin and occasional aspirin. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness no. I’m Norwegian, you know. We’re a sturdy people. I've eaten everything imaginable during my travels. No, I don’t have any allergies. Though… I once had a rather unpleasant reaction to a particularly potent cheese in France, but I hardly consider that an allergy. It was simply… a strong cheese. A very strong cheese. Are you quite certain this is necessary, Doctor? All these questions… it’s a bit intrusive, don't you think?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Oriley. I apologize if I'm being intrusive; I just want to have a complete picture of your health to ensure we provide the best possible care. It’s standard practice to ask about allergies, even to things like strong cheeses, as reactions can vary. Alright, let's move on. Now, before we begin the examination, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What exactly do you mean? I live a reasonably quiet life. I retired from my practice several years ago, so I no longer have the demanding schedule I once did. I enjoy reading, particularly historical biographies, and I occasionally travel to visit family. I try to maintain a balanced diet, though I confess I have a weakness for pastries. Is that what you were inquiring about? Honestly, Doctor, my lifestyle is rather unremarkable. I’m not an athlete, nor do I have any particularly exciting hobbies. It's a comfortable existence, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Oriley. “Comfortable” sounds lovely. And it's good to know you enjoy reading and travel! Now, before we proceed with the eye and ear exam required for your practice certification, I'd like to quickly check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Vital signs… Very well. Though, I assure you, everything is perfectly normal. But if you must. Just don't take too long, Doctor. I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon. Something to do with… estate planning. Yes, estate planning. It's a tedious affair, really. Get on with it, then. I trust your equipment is calibrated correctly? I wouldn’t want any inaccurate readings, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Oriley. I assure you our equipment is regularly calibrated and maintained. Let's just take a few moments, and then we'll get right to the exams needed for your certification. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, let’s start with the eye exam. I’m going to have you read the letters on this chart, starting with the largest ones. Just read the letters as clearly as you can.
PATIENT: Very well. Though, I must warn you, my vision isn't what it once was. I’ve been meaning to get new spectacles for some time now. Honestly, the optician keeps trying to sell me those progressive lenses… dreadful things, I tell you. Absolute nonsense. Alright, let's get this over with. "E… F… P… T…" Is that correct? Or are you expecting me to identify shapes now? This is rather frustrating, you know. I haven't had my eyesight properly tested in years.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are reading them correctly. It’s alright, reading some of them can be tricky. And I understand your reluctance towards progressive lenses – they aren't for everyone. Okay, with your right eye, you can see 20/30. With your left eye, it's 20/25. That indicates some mild vision impairment, but nothing too concerning. We can discuss options for correction at the end of the exam, if you'd like. Now, let’s move on to the ear exam. I’m just going to look inside your ears with this instrument. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Ear exam… Oh, very well. Just be gentle, please. I have rather sensitive ears. And honestly, I’ve never understood the point of sticking things inside one’s ears. It seems rather… barbaric. Alright, proceed. But if it hurts, I will let you know. I have a very low tolerance for discomfort, you understand. Especially when it comes to my ears.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a few moments. Your ear canals appear clear, and your tympanic membranes look normal. There's no sign of infection or fluid buildup. Everything looks healthy in both ears. Okay, that’s all done. No issues with your ears either. So, to summarize, you have mild vision impairment, but your ears are healthy. Everything else appears within normal limits. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Mild vision impairment… well, that’s not entirely unexpected. Honestly, I’ve known that for some time. And no ear problems, you say? Excellent. That’s a relief. Regarding this certification… what exactly do I need to do? Do I need new spectacles? What sort of documentation will you provide? And will this process interfere with my afternoon appointment? It’s rather important, you understand. Estate planning. It's a tedious affair, and I’m already running behind schedule. I’d appreciate a clear explanation, Doctor. And perhaps a written summary of your findings, just to be safe. I do like to keep meticulous records, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. Let's get everything sorted out for you. Regarding the certification, the requirements simply state that you need a current eye and ear exam performed by a licensed physician. Your results today fulfill those requirements. As for new spectacles, that’s entirely up to you. Your mild vision impairment may benefit from an updated prescription, but it’s not a requirement for the certification. I can absolutely provide you with a written summary of my findings, including the results of the eye and ear exams, for your records. I'll have my assistant print one out for you before you leave. It will include my signature and license number, as required for official documentation. This process shouldn't interfere with your afternoon appointment, as we’ve completed the exams. I estimate you'll be able to leave within the next 15 minutes. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes, you say? Very well. That is… acceptable. And you will provide a written summary with your signature? Excellent. That’s precisely what I needed to hear. Regarding these spectacles… perhaps I should at least consider getting a new prescription. But no progressive lenses, you understand. Absolutely not. Are there other options? Bifocals, perhaps? Or those… single-vision lenses? I do enjoy reading, you see. A clear vision for close-up work is essential. Yes, please, tell me about the options. And how much would they cost, approximately? I do like to keep a close eye on my finances, you understand. Estate planning is expensive enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. There are several options available besides progressive lenses. Bifocals are a good choice if you need clear vision for both close-up reading and distance viewing. They have a visible line separating the two different prescriptions, which some people find bothersome, but they are generally more affordable than other options. Single-vision lenses, as you mentioned, are designed for one specific distance – either reading, distance viewing, or computer use. If you primarily need clear vision for reading, single-vision lenses would be a good choice. Another option is anti-fatigue lenses, which gradually correct your vision for different distances, reducing eye strain during prolonged reading or computer use. They don’t have a visible line like bifocals and are a good compromise between single-vision and progressive lenses. Regarding cost, single-vision lenses typically range from $200 to $400, bifocals from $300 to $500, and anti-fatigue lenses from $400 to $600. Progressive lenses are the most expensive, ranging from $600 to $1000 or more. These prices can vary depending on the frame you choose and any additional coatings or features you add. I can provide you with a referral to a local optician who can help you choose the best option for your needs and budget. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Hmm… anti-fatigue lenses, you say? That sounds… promising. A gradual correction, reducing eye strain… yes, that appeals to me. I do spend a considerable amount of time reading historical biographies, you understand. Eye strain is a definite concern. Very well. A referral to a local optician, please. One who is… reputable, of course. I don’t want to be taken advantage of. And preferably one who doesn’t try to push unnecessary features. I believe that will be all for today, Doctor. Thank you for your assistance. And please, ensure that written summary is accurate and includes all the relevant details. Estate planning demands precision, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. I will provide you with a referral to Dr. Emily Carter at Coastal Vision – she has an excellent reputation and is known for her honest and patient approach. I’ll also make sure the written summary is accurate and detailed. My assistant will have it ready for you before you leave. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Oriley. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and best of luck with your estate planning.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. And to you as well. I trust you’ll continue providing excellent care to your patients. It’s a valuable service, you understand. Good day to you. .
