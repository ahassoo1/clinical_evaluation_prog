DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, I just need some forms signed. A lot of places are asking for these health things now, and I don’t really understand them. I just want to make sure everything is official, you know? I hope that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia, that's perfectly alright. We see that quite a bit. I'm happy to help you with any forms you need signed. Please, have a seat. Before we get started with the forms, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well… overall health. Hmm. I'm 76, so things aren’t perfect, naturally. I get around okay, though I'm not as spry as I used to be. I have a little trouble with my knees sometimes, and my eyesight isn’t what it once was – that’s why I have these glasses! Other than that… I’m pretty good for my age, I guess. I try to stay positive. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying positive, Melvenia. That makes a big difference. And it's helpful to know about the knee trouble and your eyesight. Just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you’ve been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me years ago, put me on a little pill for it. I take it every day, hasn’t bothered me none. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Never been told that. Heart problems… well, it skips a beat sometimes, but who doesn’t get that when they get older? I haven't been to a doctor regularly in a while, to be honest. Just for check-ups, I mean. If something really hurt, I’d go, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Melvenia. High blood pressure is very common. And it’s good you’re taking your medication regularly. Skipping heartbeats can be a sign of a few things, so we’ll keep that in mind. You mentioned not seeing a doctor regularly. Do you mind if I ask why?
PATIENT: No, not at all. It’s mostly… the cost, to be frank. I’m not on any insurance, and it adds up. And honestly, sometimes it’s just the hassle of getting here. I live a little ways out, you know? This rural clinic is the closest thing, but it’s still a bit of a trip. I try to stay healthy on my own as much as I can.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Melvenia. The cost and transportation can definitely be barriers. We do our best to work with patients who don’t have insurance. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Years ago, when I was much younger, I had my tonsils out. That’s about it, really. Nothing since then, thankfully. No hospital stays either. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, nothing serious. I’ve been pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Melvenia. No recent surgeries or hospitalizations is positive. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had heart trouble, later in life. Spent some time in the hospital for it. And my brother… he had some kind of cancer, lung cancer, I think. It was a long time ago, though. On my father’s side… I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. They weren’t big on talking about things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Melvenia. Knowing about the heart trouble and cancer in your family is important. Now, just to finish up with some background, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking – besides the blood pressure pill you mentioned?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the blood pressure pill. Nothing else regularly. Sometimes I take something for my arthritis when it’s really acting up, an over-the-counter thing, ibuprofen, you know? But that’s only when I need it. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little something for that too, but not every night. Just when I’m really restless. Nothing fancy, really. Mostly just the basics.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, before we get to the forms, I'd like to ask a few quick questions about any allergies you may have - to medications, foods, or anything else. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I used to be around a lot of animals growing up, too, and never had any trouble with allergies there. I think I’m pretty lucky, honestly. Seems like I’ve been blessed with a pretty strong constitution.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Melvenia! No known allergies is good. Alright, now, before we start with the forms, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It’ll be quick. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I don’t mind. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable or anything. I’m not as flexible as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable, Melvenia. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… there. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Your heart rate is a little fast, 88 beats per minute, but otherwise sounds regular. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m trying to relax. It’s always a little nerve-wracking being at the doctor’s, you know? What was that number before, you said? 88? Is that high?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious at the doctor’s, Melvenia. Your blood pressure is 142/85. That's slightly elevated. We'll keep an eye on it. It's good we checked it today. Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear. Throat is a little dry, but no redness or swelling.
PATIENT: Alright. That wasn’t too bad. So, is everything okay? I mean, is something wrong? I’m not wanting to cause any trouble, you know. I just need these forms signed.
DOCTOR: No, you're not causing any trouble at all, Melvenia. Everything seems okay at first glance, but your blood pressure is a little high, and your heart rate is a bit fast. Your throat is dry, which could be from a number of things – just needing fluids, or a mild irritation. Because your blood pressure is elevated, I'd like to repeat the reading in a few minutes, just to be sure it’s consistent. And because you mentioned the skipping heartbeats, and it's been a while since you've had a check-up, I recommend we do an EKG – that’s a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. It's quick and painless. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… oh dear. I don’t know… does that mean something’s really wrong? I just came in to get these forms signed, you know? Is it going to be expensive? I really don’t have insurance… I just want to get this over with, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Melvenia, and I want to assure you that we're just being thorough. An EKG is a very common test, and it doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It simply gives us more information about what's going on with your heart, and helps us rule out any potential issues. Regarding the cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. We do have a financial assistance program, and we can discuss options to make it affordable. Let's at least get the EKG done, and then we can talk about the results and the cost. Would you be willing to proceed with the EKG?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, I suppose so. If you think it’s best. But please, be gentle. And… please, let me know how much it’s going to cost before you do anything. I just… I don’t want any surprises, you know? And can we still get those forms signed afterwards? I really need those forms signed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. We absolutely can still get those forms signed afterwards. And I promise, I’ll let you know the exact cost of the EKG before we proceed with anything. The EKG technician, Maria, is just down the hall. She's very gentle and will explain everything to you. It involves placing a few stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It won't take long at all. Let me go ahead and get Maria for you, and then we can talk about the cost of the EKG. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. I'm ready, I guess. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. <stage>I stand up and walk towards the door, calling out, “Maria, could you come here for a moment?
