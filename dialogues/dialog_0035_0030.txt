DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, I guess. My body odor. It just doesn’t smell like me anymore, and it’s making me a bit worried.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's good you're bringing this up – changes like that can definitely be worth looking into. When did you first notice this change in your body odor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, about three weeks ago? Maybe a little longer. Around the 10th of July, I think. I was doing some extra work outside, laying that stone patio for Mrs. Henderson, and that’s when I first really noticed it was… different. I usually just smell… normal, you know? A little bit like sweat after hard work, but this was… sharper, almost?
DOCTOR: Okay, July 10th. And you said it was sharper than your usual sweat smell. Can you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: It's hard to explain. Not exactly bad, just… not right. It’s not like a typical underarm smell, if you know what I mean. It’s… almost chemical-like? And it seems to be strongest after I’ve been working, especially when I’m really hot, but I’ve noticed it even when I’m just relaxing at home sometimes. Not as strong, but it’s there. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chemical-like, even when you’re resting, but stronger with exertion. And it started around July 10th after some work outside. Have you changed anything recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me see… not really. I’ve been using the same deodorant for years – Old Spice, the original scent. Same soap, too. No new laundry detergent. I did switch brands of work gloves, though. Went from those cotton ones to a newer, synthetic material, thought they’d be more durable. I started using those around the same time as the smell started, now that I think about it. They're like a… a nylon blend, I think the package said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A change in work gloves around the same time. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, besides the change in smell, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. No new rashes, no sweating more or less than usual. I'm still as tired as always after a long day – and that's saying something! No fever, no weight loss, nothing like that. Just the smell. It’s… it's just a weird, nagging feeling, you know? Like something isn’t right, even if I can't put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Okay. No other symptoms. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin, especially in areas where you notice the odor. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I appreciate you taking this seriously – it's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’m glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice deep breath for me… and again… Good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Can you point to where you notice the odor most prominently?
PATIENT: It's… mostly under my arms, I think. And it seems to be a little bit stronger on my chest, right here. Not a lot, but I can definitely smell it if I sniff. It's not like a rash or anything you can see, Doctor. Just… the smell is there.
DOCTOR: Okay. I don't see any rash, redness, or any other visible abnormalities. Skin appears normal. Let me smell your underarms myself, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. It's a little strange, but I understand. It’s probably easier for you to tell than for me to describe it. It’s just… it’s not a normal sweat smell.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're right. It is different. There’s a slightly unusual odor, almost faintly chemical-like. It's subtle, but definitely not typical body odor. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Otherwise, nothing major. No diabetes, no asthma, no allergies that I know of. I get regular checkups with my primary care doctor, and everything's always been pretty stable. Oh, and I was divorced about five years ago, if that's relevant. That was stressful, but I'm doing okay now.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, well-controlled. Gallbladder removed ten years ago. And you had a divorce five years ago. No other major medical conditions or allergies. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for my blood pressure. And I take a multivitamin every morning, that's it. Nothing else. I try to stay away from a lot of medication if I can help it. I like to keep things simple. And I really don't have any habits I need to worry about - no smoking, no drinking. I just work hard, try to eat healthy, and get a good night's sleep when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril 20mg daily and a multivitamin. No smoking or drinking. Alright. Given the timing of the odor change with the new work gloves, and the unusual smell, I suspect it could be a reaction to the material in the gloves. Sometimes, the chemicals used in manufacturing synthetic materials can cause a change in body odor. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel just to make sure everything else is normal. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If it's the gloves, that would be a relief! I’m happy to get some blood tests done just to be sure. I appreciate you thinking through everything. So, just a regular blood draw then? Do I need to fast or anything beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, a regular blood draw. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. No food or sugary drinks – water is okay. We'll get those results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend switching back to your cotton work gloves and seeing if that makes a difference. If the odor improves after switching gloves, that would strongly suggest that they were the cause. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. I can definitely switch back to the cotton gloves. I still have a few pairs tucked away. And I'll remember to fast before the blood draw. Thank you so much for your help. I feel a lot better knowing what we're looking at. It's probably the gloves, and it’s good to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help. We'll get those labs ordered, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they come back. In the meantime, if the odor worsens or you develop any other symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here's a lab requisition form, and the nurse will give you instructions on where to go for the blood draw. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for taking the time to listen and being so thorough. I really appreciate it. I'll switch back to the cotton gloves and get the blood work done as soon as I can. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. You have a good day too. And don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
