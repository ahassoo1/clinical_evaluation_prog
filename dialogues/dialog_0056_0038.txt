DOCTOR: Hi Evann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to explain precisely. I understand you assist with preparations for… future medical situations? I believe I need some paperwork completed, something to ensure my wishes are known, should I become unable to communicate them myself. I was told an Advance Directive or… a POLST form, perhaps? I apologize, my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. We definitely do those here – Advance Directives and POLST forms. It’s smart to get these things sorted out. An Advance Directive covers a lot of general wishes, while a POLST is more specific for current medical conditions, if you have any serious ones. Let's start with a bit of background. Do you have any current medical issues or are you generally healthy?
PATIENT: Generally healthy, I believe. Though… it’s hard to say with certainty. I don’t recall any significant diagnoses recently. I see a specialist for… some minor discomfort in my hands, due to my profession, but nothing that would require… extensive care, I don’t think. I am an etcher, you see, and the work is… quite detailed. It does cause some strain. Other than that… I am reasonably well, I suppose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. So, hand discomfort related to your etching work. We'll make a note of that specialist visit. Just to be thorough, have you been hospitalized for anything in the past few years, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… no, I don’t believe so. Not recently. There was… something a long time ago, when I was quite young, but it was… minor. A broken bone, I think. A fall. It wasn't serious, certainly not requiring extensive treatment. Surgeries… no, I haven’t had any surgeries. I’m quite certain of that. It’s just… the details are… elusive, you understand. Everything feels a bit… distant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's common for details to fade. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just this. A mild pain reliever, for the occasional ache in my hands. Ibuprofen, I believe. Only as needed. It’s… a very low dose. I rarely use it, to be honest. I prefer to rest when the discomfort becomes too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never experienced a reaction to anything. Though… I did once have a mild rash after using a new type of ink, but I assumed it was simply a sensitivity, not a true allergy. Nothing life-threatening, certainly. I can’t recall any severe reactions to food either. I eat… quite a varied diet. Mostly simple things, though. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Okay, so generally healthy, ibuprofen as needed for hand discomfort, no known allergies. Now, before we get started on the paperwork, I just want to quickly check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – just as a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. A baseline is a good idea. Please, proceed. I apologize again for my… lack of precise recollection. I assure you, I am usually more organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, regarding the Advance Directive and POLST… are you thinking about specific wishes you want documented, or would you like me to walk you through some common options?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. I haven't given it a great deal of thought, to be honest. I know I want… I want my wishes respected, of course. But I am not certain what those wishes are, specifically. Perhaps… walking me through some common options would be best. I would like to understand what is… typically considered. And then I can decide what applies to my situation. I suppose I am most concerned with ensuring I am not subjected to… prolonged suffering, should that become necessary. Is that… reasonable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely reasonable. That's a very common concern, and a perfectly good place to start. Okay, let’s talk about the Advance Directive first. This document allows you to name a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions for you if you become unable to make them yourself. It also lets you outline your general wishes regarding things like life-sustaining treatment – whether you want aggressive measures taken to prolong your life, or if you prefer a more comfortable, palliative approach. We can go through each section together, and you can indicate your preferences. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… quite thorough. A healthcare proxy… that is a sensible idea. I have a sister, Lena, who I trust implicitly. She is… very level-headed. I believe she would be a suitable choice. Perhaps we can include her information in the document? As for the wishes… I am willing to listen, and then indicate my preferences as you explain. Life-sustaining treatment… that is… a rather daunting thought. But I suppose it is important to consider all possibilities. Please, proceed at your own pace. I want to ensure I understand each section completely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll definitely include Lena as your healthcare proxy. And we will take it slowly. Don't hesitate to interrupt if anything is unclear. Okay, the first section is regarding your general values and beliefs about medical care. It asks about things like your comfort level with pain management, whether you prioritize extending your life at all costs, or if you value quality of life above all else. It’s more of a guide for Lena, to help her understand your overall philosophy. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: That does make sense. A guide for Lena… yes, that is helpful. I… I believe I value quality of life above all else. Prolonging life without dignity… that doesn't appeal to me. And I am… reasonably comfortable with pain management, as long as it doesn’t… completely remove my awareness. I would like to be comfortable, of course, but I also want to… remain myself, as much as possible. I suppose that is… a difficult balance. Is that the sort of thing you are looking for? A general philosophy?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That’s exactly the sort of thing we’re looking for. You’re articulating your wishes very clearly. We can document that you prioritize quality of life and prefer comfort, even if it means accepting a shorter lifespan. And that you want to remain as aware as possible, even with pain management. The next section addresses specific treatments. It asks about things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition and hydration. Do you have any initial thoughts about those?
PATIENT: Those… those sound rather… drastic. CPR… I suppose if my heart were to simply… stop unexpectedly, then yes, attempting resuscitation would be sensible. But… mechanical ventilation and artificial nutrition… I’m not certain. If my… my organs were to fail, and there was no reasonable hope of recovery, then I would prefer… not to be subjected to those measures. Prolonging a life that is… fundamentally unsustainable… that doesn't seem… ethical, somehow. I apologize. I’m not very good at this. It’s… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine. It is a lot to process, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. And you're articulating your wishes very thoughtfully. So, we can document that you would want CPR in the event of unexpected cardiac arrest, but you would not want mechanical ventilation or artificial nutrition if you have a terminal condition with no reasonable prospect of recovery. Does that accurately reflect your feelings?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that is… accurate. CPR in an emergency, but… not prolonged intervention if there is no hope. It feels… difficult, but… right, somehow. I suppose I am most concerned with maintaining my dignity, and… not being a burden. Is there anything else? Anything I should be considering?
DOCTOR: That’s very well put. You’ve articulated your wishes beautifully. The next section is about your designated healthcare proxy – Lena. We just need to confirm her contact information and that you've discussed these wishes with her. Have you had a chance to talk to Lena about what we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: I have mentioned… generally, that I wanted to complete this paperwork, and that I wanted her to be my proxy. But… not in detail. Not with the specifics we have covered today. I suppose that is… something I should do immediately after leaving here. Is there… a summary I can take with me, to facilitate that conversation? Something outlining the key points? I realize I am asking a great deal.
DOCTOR: Not at all. It’s my pleasure. Here you go. This summarizes your wishes regarding CPR, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and your designation of Lena as your healthcare proxy. It's a good starting point for your conversation with her. Now, we’ve covered the Advance Directive. Do you want to discuss the POLST form as well, or would you prefer to stop here for today?
PATIENT: This is… very helpful. Thank you. As for the POLST form… perhaps we should stop here for today. I need time to process everything, and… discuss this with Lena. It feels… overwhelming to tackle too much at once. I am grateful for your patience, Doctor. And for your guidance. I will schedule another appointment to discuss the POLST form at a later date.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That sounds like a very sensible plan. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions in the meantime. It was my pleasure to meet you, Evann. Have a good day, and I’ll see you again soon.
