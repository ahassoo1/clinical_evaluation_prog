DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you as well. It’s… rather embarrassing, truthfully. It’s about a… problem. A gentleman friend, you see, and… well, there's a discharge. It’s most unpleasant. I wouldn’t normally bother a doctor with this sort of thing, but it's been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright, Jinnie. Many things can cause a discharge, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. We can certainly take a look and figure out what’s going on. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not pleasant to look at, I can assure you. It's… yellowish, I suppose. Not a bright yellow, thankfully, more of a… dingy shade. And there’s a… smell. Not horrendous, but certainly noticeable. He tries to be clean, you understand, but… it persists. It’s been… oh, a week, maybe a little longer? I'm not entirely sure; one loses track.
DOCTOR: Alright, a yellowish discharge for about a week or so. And you mentioned a smell. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… more noticeable after… activity, shall we say. And in the mornings, definitely. He doesn't seem to feel anything, which is… confusing. One would think something causing that would be… uncomfortable. Honestly, the whole thing is rather uncouth. It's not something one expects. It makes me question his… hygiene, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie. It's good that he isn't experiencing any pain, but discharge with no other symptoms can still be caused by a number of things. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about your, and his, medical history?
PATIENT: His medical history? Really? I hardly think that’s relevant. It's his problem, isn't it? I mean, I suppose I have the usual… a bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing serious. Medicare covers it, thankfully. And I had the flu shot last year, I believe. But to ask about his history… it feels a bit… intrusive, don’t you think? I just want this… resolved, and quickly. I don't see why his personal matters are any concern of yours.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask that, Jinnie. I apologize if my question came across as intrusive. It's simply that sometimes, his medical history can give us clues as to the cause of the discharge – conditions like diabetes, for example, can sometimes lead to infections. But of course, it’s perfectly alright if you’d rather not share that information. We can certainly proceed without it. Perhaps we could start with your history – any previous sexually transmitted infections, or other similar issues?
PATIENT: Good. That’s more reasonable. Sexually transmitted infections? Heavens, no! I am a respectable woman! I have never… well, that's a private matter. Let’s just say I've been… careful. And I certainly wouldn’t associate with someone who would have such things. Honestly, the very suggestion is quite offensive. I’ve always used… precautions. That should be enough, shouldn't it? I fail to see why this is even being discussed. It’s the discharge that’s the problem, not my… personal life.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. It's perfectly alright, and I apologize for asking. We'll focus on the discharge then. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as burning when you urinate, or any itching or irritation?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not! Are you suggesting… I haven't experienced anything of the sort! I have excellent personal hygiene, I assure you. Everything is… perfectly normal, aside from the… unpleasantness. Honestly, I find these questions rather… vulgar. It's one thing to discuss the discharge itself, but to inquire about… that… it's simply inappropriate. I really think we should focus on finding a solution, and quickly. I don’t have all day to sit here answering… these questions.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Jinnie. I apologize. I am simply trying to gather all the information I need to understand what's going on. Let's focus on the discharge itself. Would you mind if I took a quick look?
PATIENT: A… look? At him? Absolutely not! I am not having a stranger examine my… companion. That is simply out of the question. This is becoming increasingly unpleasant. I came here for a diagnosis, not a… physical inspection! I will not allow it. Find a cream, or a pill, or something that will resolve this issue, but I will not be subjected to such… indignity. It’s preposterous! I think I want a second opinion.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. I respect your boundaries and wouldn't dream of proceeding without your consent. Since a physical exam isn't possible, it will be more difficult to determine the cause of the discharge. However, we can try a few things. Given the yellowish color and lack of other symptoms, it could be a mild infection. I can prescribe a topical cream, which you can apply to him. If that doesn't improve things within a week, we may need to consider other options, such as a referral to a specialist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A cream… yes, that sounds… acceptable. As long as it doesn't require… further examinations. And it must be discreetly packaged, of course. I wouldn’t want the neighbors to… speculate. And it must be effective. I don't want this lingering any longer than necessary. A week… yes, a week is acceptable. If it persists beyond that, I suppose a specialist would be… unavoidable. But I do hope it doesn't come to that. This whole situation is quite… distressing. And please, make sure it’s not too expensive. Medicare only covers so much, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. I’ll prescribe a topical cream that’s generally very effective for mild infections. It will be packaged discreetly, and I’ll make sure it's a medication covered by Medicare. It’s important to apply it exactly as directed, and to complete the full course of treatment, even if things improve quickly. I’ll also give you a written instruction sheet with detailed information. If the discharge doesn’t improve within a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss a referral to a specialist. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. Just… thank you. I suppose. It wasn’t the most pleasant experience, but I appreciate your… discretion. I do hope this resolves the issue quickly. I’m not one for… complications. And please, ensure the prescription is ready promptly. I don't want to have to come back again unnecessarily. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. I’ve made a note to have it ready for you as quickly as possible. If you have any concerns or questions after you start the treatment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I wish you both all the best, and I hope you see improvement soon. Have a good day. .
