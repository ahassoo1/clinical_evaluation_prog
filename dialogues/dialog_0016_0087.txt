DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That’s what the lady on the phone said. Medicare sent something, a paper. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. Just need it done, if that’s alright. I’ve got things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. Medicare does send a lot of papers! Let me pull up your information… ah, yes. It looks like you're due for your annual wellness check, which includes some routine blood work. Is that what the paper referred to?
PATIENT: Annual… right. Wellness. Sounds… important. Honestly, Doctor, I get so many things in the mail, it all blurs together. Blood work, yeah, that sounds right. As long as it doesn’t take too long, that’s fine with me. I’m not good at sitting around for hours. Is there a form I need to fill out? Or do you already have everything?
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Croonquist, we can definitely keep it efficient. It looks like we have most of your information from a previous visit, but just to be sure, let me quickly review a few things. It’ll only take a moment. First, can you confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: Uh… let me see. August… the 12th. 1952, I think. Yes, that sounds right. Though, honestly, sometimes I get the years mixed up. It was a hot summer, I remember that. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Mr. Croonquist. August 12th, 1952. Thank you. And just to confirm, you’re still with Medicare, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Medicare. Still with them, as far as I know. They send me all sorts of things. Bills, papers… everything. I haven't changed anything, so I suppose that’s still right. You know, it’s all a bit much to keep track of. Can we just… get the blood drawn? I'm starting to feel a little impatient.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I understand. Before we do that, just a couple quick questions to make sure I have a good picture of your overall health. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Generally… well. As well as can be expected for an old man, I suppose. No major complaints. A little stiff in the mornings, but that's just age, I figure. Nothing to bother the doctor about. I haven't been to the hospital in… oh, goodness, years. Years and years. Mostly just trying to stay out of trouble. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Croonquist. "Staying out of trouble" is always a good plan! And just to clarify, when you say "stiff in the mornings," is that in your joints?
PATIENT: Yes, joints. My knees mostly. And my back. Gets easier as I move around, but it takes a bit to get going. Used to work out at the plant, you see. Lots of walking, lifting. Now… not so much. It's the sitting, I think. Too much sitting. Is that important? Should I be doing something about it? I don't really know what to do anymore.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Croonquist. Sitting for long periods can definitely contribute to stiffness. We can talk about some simple exercises later if you'd like. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not much change, I suppose. Eat when I'm hungry. Weight… probably lost a bit. Hard to say exactly. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t stepped on a scale in ages. I mostly eat… simple things. Rice, vegetables, some meat. Nothing fancy. Am I supposed to be keeping track of this stuff? It sounds like a lot of work.
DOCTOR: No, you're not supposed to, Mr. Croonquist, it’s just helpful information. Just trying to get a sense of things. One last quick question before we move on to the blood work: are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any recent surgeries?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, I believe. The doctor gave it to me a while back. Small white pill. Can’t remember the name, honestly. And no surgeries. Never had any surgeries. Too afraid of hospitals, you see. That’s about it. Just the blood pressure pill. And maybe an occasional pain reliever for my knees, if they’re really bothering me. Is that everything? Can we get this over with now? I'm really starting to feel anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist. That’s very helpful. So, a medication for blood pressure, and pain relievers as needed. Alright, let’s get this blood work done. The phlebotomist will be right with you. It should be quick and relatively painless. After that, I’ll take a quick look at your knees, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Quick is good. Yes, quick. And painless would be even better. Knees are fine… I suppose. They ache, but what can you do? Just get it over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better. I have things to do, you see. Important things. Are you sure it won't take long?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I promise to be as efficient as possible. The blood work should only take a few minutes, and the knee exam will be very brief. I understand you have important things to do. Let me go get the phlebotomist started, and she’ll be right in. Just relax, and we’ll get through this quickly.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. Just… let me know when she's ready. I’ll just sit here and try to stay calm. It's just… needles, you see. Never been good with needles. But quick is good. Quick is very good.
DOCTOR: She’s just setting up now, Mr. Croonquist. I'll be right back to check on you in a moment. Take a few deep breaths, and try to focus on something else. You’re doing great.
