DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my wife and I... we want... maybe a baby? She think is good time. I think so too, but… is long time since last time. I not remember so much. We just want to make sure everything okay, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It's smart to get checked out, especially after a while. It's good you're both thinking about this. So, you'd like to discuss trying to start a family. Let's start with a little bit about you, if you don’t mind. You mentioned it’s been a while… roughly how long has it been since you and your wife have been trying, or thinking about trying?
PATIENT: Trying… not for long. Maybe… six months? No, less. Thinking… a long time. Maybe a year? More? I not good with dates. My wife, she remember more. We been married… oh, very long time. Thirty years, maybe? I make models, you know. Metal and plastic. Not dates! Is better with my hands.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Dates aren't everyone's strong suit! Thirty years is wonderful, congratulations! And model making sounds fascinating. We can definitely focus on what you do remember. So, six months of thinking about it, and less than six months of actively trying. That’s good to know. Just to get a clearer picture, have you and your wife been able to conceive before?
PATIENT: Conceive… mean… baby come? Yes, we have… children. Two. Grown up now. Very far away. They visit sometimes. It was… long time ago when we had them. Before we came here. Everything is… fuzzy. Is why we want to check, you know? Make sure… still possible. Old now. Both of us.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, conceive means to get pregnant, to have a baby. And that makes perfect sense – you've had children before, but it was a long time ago, and you want to be sure everything is still working as it should. That’s very responsible of you both. Okay. Let’s do a quick review of your health history, if that’s alright. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly… not so much. I have Medicare, but… I only go when something hurt. Old man problems, you know? I had a little trouble with my knee last year, but is better now. And… I think I had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy a few times. Nothing serious. Mostly, I am okay. My wife, she go to the doctor more. She is very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly you see a doctor when needed, and your wife is more regular with check-ups. That's helpful to know. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no. Not that I know. Heart problems… sometimes my chest feel a little tight when I walk up hill. But I think is just because I am old and not so fit anymore. I used to be strong, before. When I first come here. I work very hard then. But now… just models. Not so much running around.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some chest tightness when walking uphill. We might want to look into that a bit more, just to be safe. And models sound lovely, a nice relaxing hobby. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. I don't think so. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish, but my wife say it’s just because I eat too much. She say everything is bad for you if you eat too much! I not take much medicine. Only when I really need it. Painkillers, sometimes. And… cough syrup in the winter. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no known serious allergies, just a little itchiness with shellfish and occasional painkillers and cough syrup. Good to know. And your wife sounds very sensible! Now, just one more quick question before we do a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly… no. Not really. Sometimes I take something for my knee when it bother me. But not every day. Just when it hurt. My wife keep all the medicine. She know what I take. I not so good with remembering names. She will tell you if I take anything special. She remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good, it’s helpful she keeps track of things. Okay, that gives me a good starting point. If you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of your overall health. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knee. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need. You are the doctor. Just… be gentle with the knee, please. It still bother me sometimes. And maybe tell me what you think after? I not so good with medical words, you know. My wife can explain it to me later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. I will be as gentle as possible. And I will absolutely explain everything in plain language. We can go slowly and I’ll make sure your wife understands everything too. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You tell me if I need to relax my arm, yes? I try to be still. But I am old man, sometimes my body has its own ideas.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. We'll take it slow. Just try to relax as much as possible. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… Is that okay, Doctor? I always worry when people listen to my chest. My father… he had trouble with his lungs. But I am okay, I think. Just old.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, Mr. Carlotta. I didn't hear anything concerning. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's a common finding in people your age, and doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it's something we should investigate further. Now, let’s take a look at your knee. Could you please bend it for me, and tell me if you feel any pain?
PATIENT: Okay… knee. Ooh… yes. There is pain. Not so much now, but when I bend it all the way… it hurt a little bit. And it click sometimes. Like little rocks moving around. My wife say I need to stop walking so much. But I like to walk.
DOCTOR: I feel some slight swelling around the knee joint, Mr. Carlotta, and I can feel a bit of crepitus—that’s the clicking you mentioned. It sounds like you might have some mild osteoarthritis in your knee. That's a common condition, especially with age, and can cause pain and stiffness. Alright, that completes the quick physical exam. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Osteo… what? Is that bad, Doctor? Will I not be able to walk anymore? And that heart… you say murmur? Is that serious? My father… he had a serious heart problem. I just want to be able to walk and… maybe have a baby with my wife. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Carlotta, it's not too much to ask at all. Let's take things one step at a time. Osteoarthritis just means there's some wear and tear in the knee joint. It doesn't mean you won't be able to walk, but it can cause pain and stiffness. We can manage it with things like physical therapy, pain relievers, and sometimes injections. And the heart murmur… it’s not necessarily serious. It just means there’s a slightly unusual sound when your heart beats. To be sure, I'd like to order an echocardiogram, which is a non-invasive test that creates a picture of your heart. It will help us determine if there's anything we need to be concerned about. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Echo… cardio… gram? Is that… a lot of tests? Will they hurt? And my wife… she will worry so much. She is very… sensitive. I just want to make sure everything is okay, you know? So we can… try for a baby. Is that possible, Doctor? Even with my old heart and my bad knee?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Carlotta, I understand completely. An echocardiogram is a completely painless test, like an ultrasound. They just put some gel on your chest and move a wand around to create a picture of your heart. It doesn't involve any needles or anything uncomfortable. And yes, it is possible. It’s wonderful that you and your wife are considering this. We need to make sure your heart is healthy enough, and that you're both in good overall health. The echocardiogram will help us assess that. I also want to order some blood tests to check your general health and rule out any other potential issues. It’s also important to talk to your wife. I can explain everything to her as well. I understand she’s sensitive, and we want to make sure she feels comfortable and informed. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Schedule the tests. And… please tell my wife. She is better with all the details. She can ask you the questions. I just… I want to make her happy. And maybe… have a baby. Is that too much to ask? Even for an old man like me?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Carlotta. It’s not too much to ask at all. We'll do everything we can to help make that happen. I'll schedule the echocardiogram and blood tests for you right now. I'll also have the nurse contact your wife to schedule a time for her to come in and discuss the results and any concerns she may have. I'll write down the dates and times for the tests for you now. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. We're here to support you both. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you for being so kind. And… thank you for not laughing at my old heart and bad knee. My wife… she will be very happy. I just want to be a good husband and… maybe a father again. That is all.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I absolutely understand. And please, there's no need to thank me – it's my job. And I assure you, there’s nothing to laugh at. You’re taking wonderful care of your health and considering a beautiful thing with your wife. We’ll get these tests done and go from there. I’m optimistic that we can figure things out. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Carlotta. And please give your wife my best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye.
