DOCTOR: Bula! And good day to you, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… hello, doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, it’s this cough. Been… a long time now. Just a dry cough, really. Nothing… exciting. It just won’t go away. I don't even remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Feels like forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long-standing dry cough. That can be frustrating. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “forever,” can you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Rough idea… hmm. Maybe… six months? Or was it a year? Time… it all runs together, you know? My wife, she used to keep track of things… but that was a while back now. It’s just… been a long time. It doesn't hurt, just… annoying. Especially at night.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months to a year. That is a while. And it's worse at night, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, at night. When I lie down, it seems to bother me more. I have to… sit up sometimes. And drink water. Doesn't really help help, just… makes it a little easier for a bit. I don't have any other trouble breathing, though. No wheezing or anything like that. Just the cough. It's a… tickly cough, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense – a tickly cough. And no shortness of breath or wheezing, that’s good to know. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse – dust, smoke, cold air, maybe certain foods or drinks?
PATIENT: Hmm… Dust, maybe? I used to work on cars, you know. Automotive repair. Lots of dust and fumes back then. But that was… well, a long time ago too. I don't really go around in dusty places much now. Smoke… not really. I don't smoke, and people don't smoke in my house. Cold air… maybe a little? But it's been hot lately, so… I don't know. It just happens. I can't really pinpoint anything. I’m sorry, I'm not much help. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Pavlovic, you’re doing just fine. It's helpful to know what doesn’t seem to make it worse. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. Not that I noticed. And chills… no. Weight loss… Maybe a little. But I haven’t been eating as much lately. Just… not much of an appetite. But I don’t know if that’s from the cough, or just… getting old. Everything feels a bit… smaller, you know? Clothes are a little loose. But I haven't been trying to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, and some unintentional weight loss. We'll definitely want to look into that. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all – things like a sore throat, runny nose, body aches, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… Sore throat… no, not really. Runny nose… sometimes, maybe. But just a little. I always figured it was allergies. Body aches… well, I always have a little ache here and there. Old age, you know? And fatigue… yes, I get tired easily. But I'm ninety years old! I figure that's just part of getting old too. It’s hard to say what’s from the cough and what's… everything else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any significant medical problems in the past – like heart trouble, lung problems, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a hard one. My wife, she kept all those records. I think I had high blood pressure once, a long time ago. They gave me some pills for it. But I don't take anything now. And… I had my gallbladder out, I think. But that was ages ago too. I can’t really remember anything else. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's all… a bit fuzzy. I just know I've been pretty healthy for a long time, all things considered. Mostly just the cough now.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, gallbladder removal, and otherwise pretty healthy. That’s good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Not that I know of. I haven't taken much medicine in my life. Just… aspirin sometimes, for a headache. Never had a reaction to anything. But like I said, my wife, she always knew these things. I really wish she was here to help me remember. I'm just… a bit lost without her.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. I understand it’s difficult to remember things, especially without your wife here. We'll do our best. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart, and take your temperature and blood pressure. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, doctor. Just… try not to take too long, okay? I get a little… anxious, sometimes. But do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic. I’ll be as quick as I can. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? It feels a little… tight in my chest. But I guess that's the cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I do hear some wheezing and your breath sounds are a bit quieter than I'd like on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 150/90, and your pulse is 88 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. I’m also going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little dry, but nothing remarkable. Overall, your lungs are the most concerning finding right now.
PATIENT: Oh… concerning? What does that mean, doctor? Is it… bad? I just want this cough to go away. I don't want anything bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic, let's not jump to conclusions. “Concerning” just means we need to investigate a little further to figure out what's going on. The wheezing I heard suggests there might be some narrowing of your airways, and the diminished breath sounds could mean some congestion. Given your age and the long-standing cough, we need to rule out a few possibilities, like bronchitis, pneumonia, or even COPD. To do that, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test. The X-ray will help us see if there's any inflammation or fluid in your lungs, and the blood test will check for signs of infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood test… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it going to be painful? And expensive? I… I don’t have insurance, doctor. I’m just a simple man. I just want to be able to breathe again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Pavlovic. Let’s take things one step at a time. The X-ray is painless – you’ll just stand or sit in front of the machine for a few seconds. As for the blood test, it’s just a small prick of your finger or arm. It will be a little uncomfortable, but it’s quick. Regarding the cost, I know you don’t have insurance, and that’s something we can definitely discuss. I can check if there are any financial assistance programs available at the clinic, or we can explore lower-cost options. We’ll figure something out. I don't want the cost to prevent you from getting the care you need. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done so we can understand what's going on and get you feeling better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, let’s do the tests. I just… I just want to know what’s wrong. And I hope it’s not too serious. And I really appreciate you looking into the cost. It’s a big worry for an old man like me. When can we do them? And… will I have to wait a long time? I get tired easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm glad we're on the same page. We can get the X-ray and blood test done right away. I’ll write the orders, and then the nurse will take you to the radiology department and the lab. The wait times are usually not too long, but I’ll let them know you're an older gentleman and may get tired easily. They’ll do their best to accommodate you. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It’s a bronchodilator called albuterol. It won’t cure anything, but it should provide some relief. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: An inhaler… Yes, that sounds good. Anything to help me breathe easier. What do I do with it? Is it hard to use? I don't want to mess it up. And… will it interact with anything? I haven’t taken any medicine in years, like I said. I just hope it works. I really, really hope it works.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic, don't worry, the inhaler is very easy to use. The nurse will show you exactly how to do it, and I’ll make sure you feel comfortable with it before you leave. You simply take a deep breath and press the canister to release the medication. As for interactions, albuterol doesn't usually interact with many medications. But since you haven't taken anything in years, it's always best to be cautious. I'll double-check your medical history and make sure there are no contraindications. The nurse will also go over some potential side effects, like shakiness or a racing heart, but those are usually mild. And if you experience any unusual symptoms, you should contact the clinic right away. Let me call the nurse now to get things started. “Hi, this is Dr. Kimm. I have Mr. Pavlovic here who needs an X-ray, blood tests, and some education on his inhaler…”
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very kind. I… I appreciate it. I really do. It’s nice to have someone listen. My wife… she always knew what to do. But she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It's my job, and I’m happy to help. And I understand. It’s never easy losing someone you love. It sounds like your wife was a wonderful woman. We'll take good care of you, and we’ll figure things out together. Now, let's get you feeling better, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Thank you. That sounds… good. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: .
