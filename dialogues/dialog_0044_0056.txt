DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Though, I must say, I find these…pleasantries rather unnecessary. I have a very busy schedule, you see. What brings me in? Honestly, it's this…job. This library job. It’s quite tiresome, dealing with…people. And their requests. Utterly tiresome. I suppose that’s the reason. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schlatterer, that’s perfectly sufficient. It sounds like the stress and demands of your work are concerning you. We can definitely explore that. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any specific physical symptoms alongside this feeling of being tired and stressed – perhaps headaches, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, or anything else?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Oh, goodness, no. Not…precisely. I sleep…adequately. Though the quality is debatable, naturally. And my appetite…well, I eat. One must sustain oneself. It’s more a…mental exhaustion, you see. A weariness of the spirit, if you will. All these…modern novels, and the questions people ask about them. It’s…debasing. Do we need to go into detail about the specific novels? I assure you, it will be rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schlatterer, we absolutely don’t need to go into detail about the novels if you’d prefer not to. It sounds like this mental fatigue is the primary concern, and that’s what we’ll focus on. To get a better understanding, could you describe a typical day at work?
PATIENT: A typical day? Honestly, it's a parade of…impertinence. Students, mostly. Asking the most dreadful questions about…plot points. And the research requests! Utterly frivolous. “Oh, Doctor, can you find me information on…romance novels?” As if I haven't more important things to do. I spend hours…rectifying their poor research skills. And the librarians…they’re quite…inefficient, truthfully. Constantly needing assistance. It’s…draining. Is this helpful? Or do you require a more exhaustive recitation of their failings? Because I assure you, the list is extensive.
DOCTOR: This is very helpful, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you’re carrying a significant workload and feeling quite frustrated with the demands of your job and the perceived lack of support. It’s understandable that would be draining. Now, beyond work, are there any other stressors in your life?
PATIENT: Stressors? Well…there’s my ex-wife, of course. A rather…unpleasant woman. Though we rarely speak. And the neighbours. They insist on playing that…modern music. It’s quite jarring. But those are…minor irritations. The true stress, as I’ve explained, is this job. The constant…intellectual assault. It’s…diminishing, frankly. Do you understand? It feels as though my faculties are…eroding. Are we making any progress here? I have an appointment with the bookbinder later, and I'd prefer not to be delayed unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schlatterer, I understand perfectly. It sounds like you’re dealing with a combination of workplace stress and some ongoing life frustrations. It’s good you’re acknowledging these feelings. Before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. I haven’t been to a doctor in…decades, truthfully. I find them…unnecessary. A waste of time, mostly. I had a bout of…indigestion, years ago. And a rather nasty cold, in ‘87. But otherwise, perfectly healthy. I maintain a…strict diet, and I exercise my mind constantly. Reading, of course. Though, admittedly, the quality of the material these days is…deplorable. Is that sufficient? I assure you, a detailed recitation of every minor ailment would be…tedious for both of us.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Schlatterer. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I believe in…natural remedies. And a strong constitution. I occasionally take a…digestive biscuit, if I’m feeling particularly unwell. But that’s hardly a medication, is it? I find these…pharmaceuticals…rather barbaric, truthfully. Interfering with the body’s natural processes. No, I assure you, I take nothing. I wouldn’t dream of it. Are we nearing the end of this…inquisition? I have books to sort, you see. A rather urgent matter.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Mr. Schlatterer. Just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. I eat everything. Though I do avoid…certain modern fruits. They lack flavour, you see. And the texture is…unacceptable. But allergies? No. I’m perfectly robust. I assure you. This is…rather repetitive, isn't it? Asking about allergies. Are we done now? I really must get back to the library. The Dewey Decimal System is not going to organize itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Thank you for answering my questions. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing significant stress and mental fatigue, likely related to your work environment and other ongoing frustrations. While you describe feeling robust physically, the prolonged stress can certainly take a toll. I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, if you’re willing. It’ll just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? Really? I assure you, Doctor, I know my own body. Perfectly well. I’ve lived in it for eighty-seven years, you know. But…very well. If you insist. Though I must warn you, I haven't been subjected to such indignities in decades. And I have a very low tolerance for…prodding. Just get it over with quickly, please. I have books to sort, and a bookbinder appointment. Time is of the essence. Honestly, the inefficiencies of modern healthcare are…appalling. Let’s just proceed, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. If you could just sit here, we'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, which is common with stress. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit fast. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. And tell me what day it is.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Not surprising. Dealing with…the public is rather taxing, you know. And the questions! Honestly. The day? Hmm…Is it still August? I believe it’s the…second. Yes, the second of August. Though frankly, they all blur together these days. A relentless march of…mediocrity. Are we almost finished? This is quite undignified, you know. I’m a scholar, not a…guinea pig.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schlatterer, we’re almost finished. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, but as you mentioned, your heart rate is a bit fast, likely due to stress. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it seems the primary concern is stress and mental fatigue. I wouldn’t say this is anything immediately alarming, but it’s important to address it before it potentially leads to more serious issues. I’d recommend a few things. Firstly, exploring ways to manage stress – perhaps mindfulness exercises, deep breathing techniques, or even just setting boundaries at work to limit your workload. Secondly, ensuring you’re getting adequate rest and nutrition, even if it just means a small indulgence like a digestive biscuit. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I’d suggest considering talking to someone about the frustrations you’re experiencing. It could be a friend, family member, or even a therapist. Sometimes just having someone to listen can make a big difference. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Mindfulness? Breathing exercises? Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting I…meditate? With students asking me about romance novels? The very idea is preposterous. And setting boundaries? They wouldn’t understand. They’re…students. Talking to someone? I assure you, no one would understand. They all live in a world of…trivialities. My ex-wife certainly wouldn't. And my neighbours are too busy playing that…infernal music. A digestive biscuit…well, that’s not entirely unreasonable. Perhaps one with tea. But the rest of it? Utterly impractical. I suspect you’re simply trying to…appease me with platitudes. Very well. I'll consider the biscuit. But don't expect miracles, Doctor. My situation is…irreparable. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have books to sort. And a bookbinder appointment. Is there anything else? I really must be going. This has been…taxing, to say the least. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m not trying to offer a quick fix, just some suggestions that might help alleviate some of the stress. I can write you a note summarizing our conversation and these recommendations, if you'd like. And if you ever do decide you'd like to explore talking to someone, I can provide you with a list of therapists in the area. Otherwise, I wish you all the best with your work and your appointment. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if anything changes or if you have any concerns. Take care, Mr. Schlatterer. .
