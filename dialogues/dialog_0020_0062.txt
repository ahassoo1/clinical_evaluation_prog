DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Beinborn. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. Specifically, about the masks they are requiring. I have some difficulty with them, and I was hoping to discuss a possible exemption, or maybe some other options.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're hoping to discuss options regarding the mask requirement at your work, potentially an exemption. I can certainly see how that could be a concern. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me a little more about why you’re having difficulty with the masks?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It's… difficult to explain precisely. It’s not a discomfort, not exactly. More… a feeling of being restricted. A tightness in my chest, a quickening of my breath. It’s not painful, but it’s unsettling, and it makes it hard to focus on my work. I work with people, you see, and I need to be calm and present for them. It’s… a personal thing, I suppose. I’ve always felt this way, even before all of this started. It reminds me of… well, never mind. It’s just a feeling I have. It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you're experiencing some anxiety or discomfort related to the feeling of restriction the mask creates, and that it impacts your ability to focus and perform your work. It's good you're recognizing that. Just to clarify – and please correct me if I'm wrong – this feeling isn’t new, it’s something you’ve experienced before, even without wearing a mask?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. It is not a new feeling at all. It has been with me for a long time, though it usually only comes up when I feel… confined, or pressured. The mask just… brings that feeling forward more readily. It’s like a trigger, perhaps. It doesn’t cause it, but it certainly makes it worse. I’ve tried to ignore it, but it’s becoming harder to do, especially with the masks being required all day now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, the mask seems to be exacerbating a pre-existing sensitivity to feelings of confinement. And it's impacting your ability to concentrate at work. Let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you ever been diagnosed with any anxiety disorders, or have you ever received any treatment for anxiety or panic?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not been diagnosed with any anxiety disorders, nor have I ever sought treatment for anything of that nature. I… well, my people don’t often go to doctors. We have our own ways, our own healers. I’ve always managed this feeling on my own, through… quiet reflection, and spending time in nature. But this situation is different. It’s a work requirement, and I need to find a solution that allows me to do my job effectively, while also respecting my… sensitivities. I apologize for being vague, Doctor. It’s difficult to put into words.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knabenshue. There’s absolutely no need to apologize. It’s perfectly alright to have difficulty expressing these kinds of feelings, and I respect your cultural background and preferences. It sounds like you’ve developed coping mechanisms that have worked for you in the past. To help me understand the situation better and determine the best course of action, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am a Protective Service Worker. I work with families, mostly those experiencing difficulties, or those who are at risk. It involves a lot of home visits, assessments, and… well, just being a supportive presence for people in need. It requires a lot of calm and focus, as I am often dealing with sensitive situations and vulnerable individuals. I need to be able to read people, to listen carefully, and to make sound judgments. The mask… it feels like it interferes with that. It muffles my voice, it hides my expressions, and it makes it harder to connect with people on a personal level.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very important information. A Protective Service Worker requires a high degree of interpersonal connection and the ability to assess nuanced situations. The mask could definitely impede those abilities. Let's do a quick check of your overall health. Have you had any recent illnesses – like a cold or the flu – that might be affecting your breathing or making you feel more sensitive?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not been ill recently. I have been in good health, as far as I know. I haven't even had a cold in several years. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, with regular exercise and a balanced diet. I spend a lot of time outdoors, which I believe is beneficial for both my physical and mental well-being. It's just this mask… it feels unnatural to me. It’s… a barrier, both physically and emotionally.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying issues that might be contributing to this feeling of restriction. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I understand the need for due diligence. Please, proceed as you see fit. I am willing to cooperate in any way that may help us find a solution.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally, in and out through your mouth. Your lung sounds are clear, bilaterally. No wheezing, crackles, or diminished breath sounds. Your oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, which is excellent. Your heart rate is 72 beats per minute, which is also normal. Physically, everything seems normal. This suggests that the discomfort is likely not related to an underlying respiratory issue.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring, Doctor. I am grateful for your thoroughness. So, what does this mean? Is there anything we can do to address this feeling? Perhaps some alternative forms of protection, or a way to modify the mask to make it more… tolerable? I truly want to fulfill my duties, but I am concerned about compromising my ability to effectively serve my clients.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Since your physical exam is normal, and you’ve not had any recent illnesses, it seems likely this is related to a sensitivity to the feeling of restriction, as we discussed. Given your role as a Protective Service Worker, maintaining clear communication and building rapport with clients is critical. A standard mask could be hindering that. Here are a few options we can explore. First, have you tried different types of masks?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. They simply provided us with the standard N95 masks, and instructed us to wear them at all times while interacting with clients. I assumed that was the only option available. I did not even consider that there might be alternatives. Would different materials or a looser fit potentially make a difference? I suppose I was hesitant to question the protocol, as I didn't want to appear… difficult.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It’s common to assume the provided equipment is the only option. Different materials and fits can definitely make a difference. A looser-fitting cloth mask might be less restrictive, but it won’t offer the same level of protection as an N95. Another option is to discuss this with your supervisor. Perhaps they would be open to providing a variety of mask options for employees to choose from, or potentially allowing for face shields in certain situations. Face shields offer some protection and allow for better visibility of facial expressions. Have you considered discussing this with your supervisor already?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. I have been… hesitant to bring it up, for fear of being perceived as resistant to safety protocols, or as someone who is not a team player. It is a delicate situation, as we are all under a lot of pressure to maintain a safe working environment. I suppose I was hoping to find a solution through other means, before resorting to a direct conversation with my supervisor. But you are right, perhaps that is the most practical course of action. Would you perhaps be willing to provide me with a brief note, summarizing our conversation, and outlining my concerns? That might give me a little more leverage when speaking with my supervisor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. I can absolutely provide you with a note summarizing our conversation. It will outline your concerns regarding the impact of the mask on your ability to effectively perform your duties as a Protective Service Worker, and the fact that a physical exam did not reveal any underlying respiratory issues. Here's what I'll write: “Rayshun Knabenshue presented today with concerns regarding difficulty wearing an N95 mask due to a pre-existing sensitivity to feelings of restriction. He reports this impacts his ability to concentrate, communicate effectively, and build rapport with clients in his role as a Protective Service Worker. Physical exam revealed normal lung sounds and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Further evaluation may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen. Recommendation: Discuss alternative mask options or accommodations with supervisor.” Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly accurate. Thank you very much for taking the time to document our conversation so thoroughly. Your note will be immensely helpful when speaking with my supervisor. I truly appreciate your understanding and support. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any further steps I should take at this time?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help. At this time, I recommend having an open and honest conversation with your supervisor. Explain your concerns clearly and respectfully, and present the note as supporting documentation. If you find that the situation doesn’t improve, or if your concerns are not adequately addressed, you may want to consider reaching out to your union representative, if you have one. Otherwise, just monitor your symptoms. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Beinborn. I believe that covers everything. You have been most helpful and considerate. I truly appreciate your time and your willingness to listen. I feel much more confident now, knowing that I have a plan of action. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. Take care, and I wish you all the best in your conversation with your supervisor.
