DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me over, said I needed a check-up to be all set. Nothing major, I hope!
DOCTOR: Forms, alright. While that's…unusual as a primary complaint, Medicare does occasionally have its quirks. Still, a check-up is always a good idea. But let’s not just fill out paperwork. I still need to understand why Medicare sent you. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns recently?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t think so. They just sent the notice, said it was time for a general check-up for coverage. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything… maybe they just send them to everyone at a certain age? I’m not sure. I haven’t really paid much attention to it, to be honest. It’s mostly just paperwork stuff for me.
DOCTOR: Right. “Paperwork stuff.” Well, even without specific complaints, a thorough assessment is important. We need to establish a baseline, especially with Medicare coverage involved. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My mom had some trouble with her joints when she got older, arthritis I think, but I haven’t had any problems like that. I work out on the reservation sometimes, mostly just walking and helping with things around the place. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I did have pneumonia once when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a child is noted. And no other diagnosed conditions. Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed 'em, thankfully! I've been pretty lucky with avoiding hospitals and all that. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work, nothing serious enough for a doctor's visit, usually. My husband handles most of those, he's pretty good with first aid.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my dad was a strong man, lived a long life, but he had some heart trouble towards the end. And like I said, Mom had arthritis. Her side of the family… there was some talk of diabetes, I think? My aunt had it, but I don’t know much beyond that. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t really talk about health stuff much back then. Things were different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never liked it, and my husband doesn’t either. We both try to stay pretty healthy, like I said. Mostly just fresh air and good food, when we can get it. It can be tough out on the reservation sometimes, but we manage.
DOCTOR: And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, like birthdays or holidays. Nothing regular, and definitely not enough to cause any trouble. My husband enjoys a beer sometimes, but he doesn’t drink much either. We mostly stick to water and tea, honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well. And finally, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve taken over-the-counter stuff for headaches and colds without any problems. I think I'm good there, Doctor. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, to summarize: you're a 35-year-old female with no significant medical, surgical, or family history, no allergies, and minimal alcohol consumption. You're here for a Medicare-mandated check-up, despite having no specific complaints. While I appreciate your apparent good health, a complete physical examination is still necessary. Let’s start with your vital signs: height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll move on to a basic physical assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. That makes sense. Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable. Just let me know if you need anything from me. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's begin. Please step onto the scale. And I’ll need you to remove your jacket. I’ll be documenting everything as we go. 171 centimeters and 70 kilograms. That puts your BMI at… within the normal range. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good so far. That's good to hear about my heart and lungs. Is everything alright? You seem… focused. Not that I'm complaining, just checking.
DOCTOR: "Focused" is a professional demeanor, Ms. Fabing. I am conducting a thorough assessment. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please extend your arms. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, just checking. Sorry! There. Is that alright? My grip’s pretty strong from working outside.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is good. Now, I need to examine your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I will be palpating your abdomen to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. No apparent tenderness or masses. Soft and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normal. Everything appears normal, Ms. Fabing. However, given your age and to be thorough, I would like to order a basic blood panel: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. We should also check your vitamin D levels, given your location and lifestyle. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure everything is alright, even if it seems like it is. Vitamin D sounds good, too. We get a lot of winter up on the reservation, not a lot of sun. So, what happens next? Do I need to go somewhere else for those tests?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, Room 203. You don’t need an appointment. Just take this requisition form to the phlebotomist, and they’ll draw the necessary blood samples. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back—usually within a week—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms—chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, any unexplained bleeding—please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, Room 203, got it. Thank you, Doctor. That sounds straightforward enough. No, I don’t think I do, actually. You’ve answered everything. I appreciate you taking the time to be so thorough, even if it was just for paperwork. I’ll go get those tests done now. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Fabing. .
