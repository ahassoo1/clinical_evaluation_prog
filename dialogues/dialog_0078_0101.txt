DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been gettin'. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin' me for a little bit now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A headache at the back of your head. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Right. It’s not a terrible pain, not like a migraine or anything. More like… a dull ache, constant really. Feels like pressure, almost. It comes and goes, but mostly it's just… there. Been like this for, oh, maybe a week and a half, I’d say. Started gradual-like, and hasn’t really gotten worse, thankfully. Just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent, dull ache at the back of your head for about a week and a half. That’s helpful. And you said it started gradually?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Didn’t just boom one day. Started as just a little somethin', barely noticeable. Thought it was maybe from bendin' over too much while doin' nails, you know? But it hasn’t gone away with restin’ it. That’s why I thought I should come see you. I don’t like things lingerin’ on.
DOCTOR: That’s wise of you to get it checked out. And you do nails as a profession, or as a hobby?
PATIENT: It’s how I earn a livin’, Doctor. Been a manicurist and pedicurist for… well, a long time now! Since I was a young man, actually. It keeps me busy, keeps my hands nimble. But like I said, I thought maybe it was from that, but it just isn't goin' away.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s good to know. Being a manicurist and pedicurist for a long time could certainly contribute to some muscle strain. Let's explore that a little further. Besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No dizziness, no blurry vision. No fever or nothin’ like that. My neck’s been a little stiff sometimes, especially in the mornin’, but I put that down to sleepin’ wrong. And… oh! Sometimes my shoulder on that side feels a bit tight, like it's knotted up. But that comes and goes too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, blurry vision, or fever. Some neck stiffness and occasional tightness in your shoulder on the same side as the headache. That’s good information. Have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting with the headache?
PATIENT: No, no sickness at all. Not even a little bit. I’ve got a good appetite, still enjoyin' my food. And I haven’t been feelin’ more tired than usual, either. Just this constant ache at the back of my head, really.
DOCTOR: Good. That helps to rule some things out. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’ major, Doctor. I had high blood pressure for a little while, years ago, but I’ve been keepin’ an eye on it, watchin’ my salt intake and such. It’s usually alright now, but I don’t go to the doctor regular-like, you know? Too expensive, and I usually just feel things out myself. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ like that. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high blood pressure that you've been managing with diet, and otherwise generally healthy. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Never been in the hospital overnight, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses when I was a boy, measles, chickenpox, nothin’ serious. Oh! I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, climbin' a mango tree, but that healed up fine. That was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries or hospitalizations, just a childhood illness and a broken arm that healed well. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had arthritis, bad in her hands, couldn't do much towards the end. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart, I think, but he didn’t go to the doctor much either. He just… slowed down over time. My sister, she's fine as far as I know, livin' in Florida. Not much else that I can think of, really. We weren't a family that talked much about illnesses. Mostly just kept on keepin' on.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of arthritis in your mother and some heart trouble in your father. And you said your sister is currently healthy. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I can eat anything, take most medicines without any trouble. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not even insect bites. I’m a pretty lucky man, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes, when my joints get achy. Nothing regular-like, just when I need it. And I take a multivitamin every now and then, but I’ve been forgettin’ lately, to be honest. Old age, you know? Things slip your mind. Mostly, I just try to eat a good diet and get enough rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional ibuprofen for joint aches and a multivitamin sporadically. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Popova. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around your neck and shoulders to see if I can identify anything that might be contributing to your headache. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. I’ve been puttin’ off seein’ a doctor for too long, so I’m glad I finally came in. Hopefully you can figure out what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. I'm feeling some slight tenderness in the muscles at the base of your neck and along your shoulder blades. There's also some tightness in those muscles. Your heart and lungs sound clear. And I don’t detect any neurological deficits, like weakness or numbness. Based on this initial exam, it appears you may be experiencing a tension headache, likely related to muscle strain from your work as a manicurist and pedicurist. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing as well.
PATIENT: Tension headache… that sounds about right. I do spend a lot of time bendin’ over, workin’ with people’s hands and feet. And I guess I’ve been a bit stressed lately, thinkin’ about… well, never mind. So, what do you recommend, Doctor? Is there anything I can do to ease the pain? And should I be worried about this blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good you’re acknowledging some stress, that can certainly play a role. For the headache, I recommend trying a few things. First, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the pain. Heat or ice packs on your neck and shoulders can also be very effective. And gentle stretching exercises, focusing on your neck and shoulder muscles, can help relieve tension. I can show you a few simple exercises before you leave. Regarding your blood pressure, it’s slightly elevated, and we should address it. I'd like to monitor it over the next few weeks. I recommend checking your blood pressure at home with a home blood pressure monitor, if possible. And we need to focus on lifestyle modifications: a healthy diet low in salt, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. I’m not immediately concerned, but we want to prevent it from getting worse. We can discuss medication if lifestyle changes aren’t enough, but let’s try those first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I can definitely try the stretches and heat packs. And I suppose I should be more diligent about watchin' my salt intake and gettin' more exercise. A home blood pressure monitor… I’ll have to ask my daughter about that. She’s good with those things. And I’ll try to keep the stress down, easier said than done sometimes, but I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. That puts my mind at ease a bit. So, no need for any fancy tests or anything? Just keep an eye on things and try to be healthier?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. And you’re right, for now, we can take a watchful approach. I don’t think any immediate, extensive testing is necessary. However, if your headache worsens significantly, becomes accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Also, if your blood pressure consistently remains elevated despite lifestyle changes, we will need to consider further evaluation and possibly medication. I’ll write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the tension, just to give you some short-term relief. I’ll also provide you with a handout outlining the stretches I mentioned, as well as information on healthy blood pressure management. And I’ll give you a list of resources for stress reduction techniques. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A muscle relaxant would be very welcome, and the handouts are a great idea. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything so clearly. And I'll be sure to pay attention to those warning signs you mentioned. I feel much better now, thankin' you. I think I can manage things from here, with a little bit of effort. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. You’re a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Here’s the prescription for the muscle relaxant. Please take it as directed. And these handouts should provide you with some helpful information. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to check your blood pressure and see how you’re doing with the stretches and lifestyle changes. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds just fine, Doctor. Thank you for thinkin' of that. I really appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me and explain everything so thoroughly. You’ve put my mind at ease, and that’s worth a lot. I'll see you in two weeks then. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was my pleasure. And you have a good day as well. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. .
