DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammann, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to see you too, Doctor Gorga. I reckon I'm here for a check-up, sort of. My daughter – bless her heart – she's been on me about getting things… optimized, she called it. Says a man my age needs to keep an eye on things. I'm feeling alright, but I don’t want to get to feeling not alright, you know? It's just… a general men's health thing, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right, a general check-up. That’s… sensible. Your daughter sounds like a good one. Optimized, huh?
PATIENT: She is. Very sensible, that one. Always lookin' out for me. And yes, “optimized” is the word she used. She sent me a whole bunch of articles… honestly, went right over my head. Something about hormones and… well, a lot of things I didn't understand. I just told her I'd come see a doctor and see what they thought. I figure you folks know what all that means.
DOCTOR: We try to. Hormones can be a factor as we get older, it's true. Okay. Let's start with the basics then. Any specific concerns you have besides just the general “keeping an eye on things”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My sleep ain't been the best lately. Not terrible, but I wake up a few times a night. Used to be I could sleep through anything. And… well, I don't have the… drive I used to, if you catch my meaning. Not that it's a huge deal, but it's noticeable. It's been slow, over the last few years, nothin' sudden. Mostly just tired, and… a little less interested in things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Sleep disturbances and a decrease in energy… alright. Have you noticed any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, a little. I haven't been weighin' myself regularly, but my pants feel a bit tighter. Not a lot, but enough to notice. I used to be pretty steady around 165, 170. Now… I'd guess closer to 175, maybe a bit more. I haven't changed my eatin' habits much, and I still get out and walk when the weather's good.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a full picture… any problems with urination?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that is a question. Let me think… sometimes, I have to get up once or twice at night to go. Used to not have to do that at all. And… it feels like I don't empty my bladder completely sometimes. Not every time, but often enough to be a little… annoying. I figured it just came with gettin’ older, honestly. Is that somethin’ I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that. Frequent urination, especially at night, and not fully emptying your bladder… those are things we want to check out. It could be a number of things, and it's better to rule things out. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then we can talk about some potential tests. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds just fine. A physical exam is good. I haven’t had a proper one in… well, a while. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your abdomen. After that, we’ll do a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. We'll finish with a prostate exam, if that's alright with you. It’s a standard part of a men’s health check-up, particularly given what you’ve told me about your urination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Well, now… a prostate exam. That don’t sound particularly pleasant. But… if it’s standard, and you think it’s important… then yes, alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not the most comfortable exam, but it's quick, and important. Alright, let's get started. Please have a seat on the exam table and lie down. Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 76, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. A little pressure, but no pain at all. Feels… normal, I guess. Like you said, just pressure. I've always been able to take a bit of pressure. Worked with my hands a lot over the years, you know. Etching and engraving… takes a steady hand and a strong grip. But no pain. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, let's check your reflexes. Please keep your legs straight and relaxed. Both knees have a good reflex response. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There you go. Feels pretty strong, I think. Used to carve a lot of detail work, needed a good grip for that. I can hold that… feels strong enough. Is that what you're lookin' for? Are we gettin' close to the… other part now?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything feels good so far. Your grip strength is excellent. And yes, we’re getting to the prostate exam now. I’ll explain what I’m doing as I go. It involves a digital rectal exam. I’ll be using a gloved, lubricated finger to gently examine your prostate gland. It will feel like pressure, and it might be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Try to relax as much as possible. Deep breaths can help. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths, you said. Yes. Ready as I’ll ever be, I reckon. Just… get it over with, if you could. And… try to be gentle, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm starting now. Deep breaths… The prostate gland feels… slightly enlarged, but smooth. No obvious nodules or tenderness. There’s some mild resistance, which is common for men your age, but nothing overly concerning. Alright, that's done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Well… that wasn’t as bad as I feared, honestly. A little uncomfortable, yes, but… not awful. Glad it’s over, though. So, what did you find? Is it somethin’ I need to worry about? You said enlarged… is that bad? My daughter’s gonna have a fit if I need special tests or somethin’.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear it wasn't too bad. Enlarged prostate is very common with age – it's called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The mild resistance I felt is also consistent with BPH. However, given your symptoms – the frequent urination and incomplete emptying of the bladder – and the enlargement, I'd like to order a few tests just to be thorough. First, a urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. Second, a PSA test – prostate-specific antigen – which is a blood test to screen for prostate cancer. And finally, I'd recommend a kidney function test just to get a complete picture. Do that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I figured there’d be tests. My daughter will be happy I’m takin’ it seriously. Alright, yes. Those tests sound… sensible. Urinalysis, PSA, and the kidney test. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… let me know what I need to do to get them done. And… about the PSA test… is that a scary one? Is it likely to show somethin’ bad?
DOCTOR: The PSA test can sometimes be a little concerning, but it's important to remember it only screens for possible issues. An elevated PSA doesn't automatically mean you have prostate cancer. Many things can raise your PSA level – infection, inflammation, even age and medications. We'll discuss the results thoroughly when we get them, and if it's elevated, we can talk about the next steps, which might include further testing or a referral to a urologist. It’s better to know, and be proactive. I'll write you a referral for the lab work now. They'll just need a urine sample and a blood draw. The nurse will give you instructions on how to prepare. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, that sounds… like a plan. A plan is good. Nurse will give me instructions… and we'll talk about the results when they're back. I appreciate you explainin' it so clearly, Doctor. It's… less scary when you know what to expect. Hopefully, it’s just my old prostate bein’ stubborn. I reckon I can handle a stubborn prostate. <>
DOCTOR: That’s the spirit. Most likely, that's exactly what it is. We’re just being thorough. The nurse will be in shortly with the instructions. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Alright, is there anything else I can help you with today?
