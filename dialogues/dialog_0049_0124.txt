DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Paes. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Nestingen. Well, I've been feeling really tired lately, and my skin... it's gotten darker. Not like a sunburn, just… overall darker than usual. It's a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Darkening of the skin and fatigue… alright. Could you tell me a little more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like I can’t do things, you know? I still go to work at the plant, I still keep up with things around the house. But by the end of the day, I’m just… wiped out. Like all my energy is gone. And it's been going on for maybe a month or so now, getting slowly worse. It's not a sudden thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over a month. And you said work at a plant… is it physically demanding work?
PATIENT: It can be, yeah. I'm a chemical plant operator, so there's a lot of walking, checking gauges, sometimes lifting things, but nothing too heavy. Mostly it's just being on my feet a lot and paying attention for long stretches. It's not always physical, sometimes it's more mental, making sure everything's running right. Do you think that could have something to do with it? I just… I don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Possibly. It’s good you’re observant. And you mentioned the skin darkening… where exactly are you noticing this change?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, I think. It’s hard to say exactly. It’s not patchy or anything. Just… my whole body seems a little… browner. And my hands, maybe more noticeable there. I haven't been out in the sun any more than usual, so that’s why I was worried. I used to have a pretty even skin tone, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just see what your records say… Have you had any recent bloodwork done?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had a check-up last year with my primary care doctor, and I think they did some basic stuff then, but nothing specific. I don’t usually go to the doctor unless something’s really wrong, to be honest. Medicare covers a lot, but you still have the copays and everything, and it adds up. I'm not sure what they checked for exactly, though. Would that be in here?
DOCTOR: Yes, it should be. Okay… last annual physical was July 15th, 2024. Let’s see… CBC, CMP, lipid panel, TSH… all within normal limits at that time. No documented history of skin issues. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I guess I've been a little thirstier than usual, maybe? And I’ve been going to the bathroom a bit more often, but I thought that was just because I was drinking more water. Nothing major, honestly. Just little things here and there. And sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I wear glasses, so I figured it was just my prescription needing an update. It's hard to say what's new and what's just… me, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Increased thirst, frequent urination, blurry vision… okay. And you mentioned you wear glasses. How long have you been wearing them, and when was your last eye exam?
PATIENT: I’ve had glasses since I was a kid, probably since I was eight or nine. My last eye exam… oh, goodness. It’s been a while. Probably… two years ago, maybe? I should really get that checked. I just… I don’t like going to a lot of different doctors. It’s a hassle, and I usually put it off. It's just one more thing, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any unexplained weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I think I have lost a little weight. Not a lot, maybe five or ten pounds. I hadn't really noticed because it's been so gradual, and I haven't been eating much differently. I've just been… tired, and not really hungry, I guess. I figured it was just the stress of work. Does that sound like anything?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, skin darkening, increased thirst, frequent urination, blurry vision, and unintentional weight loss… We need to investigate this further. I’m going to order some bloodwork, a more comprehensive panel than your annual check-up. We’ll check your glucose levels, kidney function, liver function, and a few other things. And I strongly recommend you schedule an eye exam. I can give you a referral.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Bloodwork and an eye exam… I can do that. It's probably a good idea. Yes, a referral would be great, thank you. I'm a little worried now, to be honest. What are you thinking it could be? Not that I expect you to tell me everything right away, but just… a general idea?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s far too early to say definitively. But the combination of symptoms you’re describing… we need to rule out some possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like a vitamin deficiency, but it’s also important to investigate things like diabetes, or other endocrine disorders. We’re being thorough, that's all. Don’t jump to conclusions. The bloodwork will give us a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Diabetes… that runs in my family, actually. My grandmother had it, and my aunt does too. I guess that makes sense. So, what do I need to do about the bloodwork? Do I need to fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. No food or drinks, except water. I'll give you a lab requisition. The lab is just down the hall, on the left. Try to schedule it first thing in the morning, that’s always best. And please schedule that eye exam as soon as possible. I don’t want you delaying that. We need to get all the information we can. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, 12-hour fast, and the lab is down the hall. And schedule the eye exam. Got it. No, I think that covers it for now. Thank you, Dr. Nestingen. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I'll get the bloodwork done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow up with me once you have the results. Have a good day. .
