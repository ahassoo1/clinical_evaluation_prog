DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Nestingen. It is good to meet you. I have... a problem with my ear. There is... liquid coming from it. It started, I think, maybe three days ago? I woke up and noticed it on my pillow.
DOCTOR: Three days ago, you say. And liquid... can you describe the liquid for me?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. It is… clear, mostly. A little bit yellow sometimes. Not much, but enough to notice. It does not smell bad, if that is important. It just... comes out when I lay down, I think. Mostly the left ear.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Clear or slightly yellow discharge... and only when lying down. Alright. Have you experienced any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That is good, yes? Just… the liquid. Sometimes, maybe a little bit of… fullness, in the ear. Like when you go up high in an airplane, but not so bad. And a little bit hard to hear, but I can still hear. Not completely gone, the hearing.
DOCTOR: Fullness and a little difficulty hearing… I see. Have you had any fever, chills, or any dizziness associated with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No chills either. And no dizziness. I feel… normal, except for the ear. I have been sleeping okay, eating okay. Nothing else feels different. I am… a teacher, you see. I need to be able to hear my students!
DOCTOR: A teacher, yes, important to have good hearing. Alright. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, tubes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a young man, maybe twenty years old, I had an ear infection. A very bad one. I had to go to the hospital, and they put… something in my ear. A small tube, I think. But it has been many years. No problems since then, until now. I do not remember the doctor’s name. It was… in Somalia.
DOCTOR: Previous ear infection with a tube placement… alright. And have you tried anything at home to treat this – any ear drops, cleaning it with anything?
PATIENT: No, no. I do not put anything in my ear. I clean the outside with a cloth, very gently. But I do not put drops in. I was afraid to make it worse. I thought… I should come to the doctor first. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that was sensible. Alright, Mr. Radillo, let’s have a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope. Just lean forward a little.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will lean forward. Please tell me if you see anything... concerning. I hope it is not too bad. I have a class tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there is some fluid visible in the ear canal, and the eardrum appears slightly… cloudy. There’s a little bit of redness as well. It doesn’t look severely infected, but there is something going on. I'm going to check your temperature and listen to your lungs just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay, that is good. Checking everything is wise. My temperature is… normal, I think? I do not feel sick, just the ear. Listening to the lungs… that is good too, yes? I try to stay healthy. A teacher must not share germs!
DOCTOR: Temperature is normal, lungs are clear. Alright, Mr. Radillo, it appears you have otitis externa - an outer ear infection. It's likely caused by bacteria or fungi, and the moisture could be contributing. It's not a severe infection, fortunately, but it needs to be treated.
PATIENT: Otitis... externa? Is that... bad? I do not understand. Moisture... you mean from sweating? Or from… rain? I walk to work sometimes. What is the treatment, Doctor? Will I be able to teach tomorrow? I have a very important lesson.
DOCTOR: It’s not serious, Mr. Radillo, but it's uncomfortable and can worsen if left untreated. The moisture could be from sweat, rain, or even just humidity. As for teaching tomorrow, it depends. I’m going to prescribe you some ear drops with an antibiotic and a steroid to reduce inflammation. Use them as directed. If the pain or discharge worsens significantly, you’ll need to stay home. But if it remains stable, you should be able to manage. I will also recommend keeping your ear dry, avoid using cotton swabs, and try to avoid getting water in your ear.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Ear drops… with antibiotic and steroid. I will use them as you say. And keep it dry. No cotton swabs. I understand. And if it gets worse, I will stay home. Thank you, Doctor Nestingen. You have been very helpful. How often should I use the drops? And… are there any side effects I should watch for?
DOCTOR: Three drops in the affected ear three times a day for seven days. As for side effects, some people experience mild stinging or itching, but it should be temporary. If you notice any severe pain, rash, dizziness, or hearing loss, stop using the drops immediately and contact me. I also recommend a follow-up appointment in one week to check your progress. The nurse will schedule that for you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Seven days, three times a day. And watch for pain, rash, dizziness… I will remember that. A follow-up appointment in one week, that is good. I think… no, I do not have any other questions. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your help. I will go see the nurse now to schedule the appointment. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Mr. Radillo. Get well soon. .
