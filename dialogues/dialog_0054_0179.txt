DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… pleasant to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a little difficult to explain. The words… they don't come so easy these days. I find myself… searching, you understand? It is frustrating, yes. I am Sherrell Gyamfi, by the way. Perhaps you have my paperwork?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sherrell, I do have your paperwork here. It says you're 46 years old. You’re right, it does seem a bit difficult to put into words. No need to rush. Just take your time, and tell me what's been going on. You mentioned searching for words… is this a recent change, or has it been happening for a while?
PATIENT: Recent… yes, I believe so. It’s… hazy, to be honest. Maybe six months? Perhaps a little longer. It isn’t every word, you see. Some come fine. But others… they are… distant. Like a memory I cannot quite grasp. It makes conversations… tiring. And I worry, of course. I do not… want to be a burden. My wife… she would… never mind. But she is gone now. It’s just me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six months, and it’s intermittent… some words are easier than others. That's helpful to know. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Sherrell. Losing someone close is incredibly difficult. It's perfectly natural to feel worried when something changes with your health, especially with everything else you've been through. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you notice this difficulty?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… kind of you to say so. When… hmm. That is a good question. Not always when I am speaking, you understand. Sometimes… when I think of a word, it is gone before I can say it. Other times, it’s when I am tired. Or… stressed, perhaps? I do not remember a specific moment it began. It just… was. Like a slow… fading. It does not happen with every conversation, thankfully. Small talk is usually fine. It is… more complex thoughts that are the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be more noticeable with complex thoughts, and can be affected by fatigue or stress. It's not consistent, and small talk is generally easier. That gives us a good starting point. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. My balance is not what it was, I suppose. I do not fall, thankfully. But I feel… unsteady sometimes. And I forget things. Not… important things, usually. Like where I put my glasses. Or the name of that actor… you know, the one in the westerns. But it comes back eventually. I have also… not been sleeping very well. I wake up often, and it is difficult to get back to sleep. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sherrell, that is relevant. Balance issues, forgetfulness, and difficulty sleeping – those are all things we need to consider. It sounds like there are several symptoms here that could be related. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more specific questions. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. No, not that I am aware of. I wear glasses, you see. I have worn them for many years. I get them checked regularly, by the optician. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but that is just my age, I think. I do not see… spots, or double vision. No, my vision is… stable. I believe that is the correct word.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable vision. That’s good to know. Now, have you experienced any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Not… severe ones, you understand. More like… a dull ache. At the back of my head. They come and go. I used to get them more frequently, but they have been… less bothersome lately. I take… over-the-counter medicine. It usually helps. Is that… important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know. Occasional, mild headaches that respond to over-the-counter medication. We're building a good picture here. Now, I'd like to ask about any weakness or numbness you might have experienced, in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not really. Perhaps a little stiffness sometimes, in my knees. But that is just… age, I think. And I do a lot of gardening. It’s hard work, you see. Numbness… no. I can feel everything. I can wiggle my toes, and move my arms. Everything feels… normal. Unless I am very cold, then my fingers get a little numb, but that is… temporary.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. So, no persistent weakness or numbness. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. That is… a little difficult. I do not… remember everything. I have been to see doctors, of course. For check-ups. And when I have a cold. My wife… she always kept track of everything. Now… I know I had my vaccinations, when I was younger. And I had… appendicitis, many years ago. They removed my appendix. That is… all I can recall, Doctor. I have Medicare, if that is relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare is helpful to know, and appendicitis with removal in the past. I'm pulling up your records now through Medicare to see if we can fill in some of the gaps. Do you know if you've ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I believe the doctor mentioned it once, years ago. But I do not recall being given any medication for it. High cholesterol… no, I don’t think so. Diabetes… no, definitely not. My wife… she was the one who was careful about those things. She always watched her diet. Heart problems… no, I do not believe so. I have never had any chest pain, or shortness of breath.
DOCTOR: Okay. The records show a diagnosis of hypertension – high blood pressure – about ten years ago, and it appears it was managed with medication for a few years, but the medication was discontinued. There's also a note about slightly elevated cholesterol levels, but no specific treatment was initiated. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Oh. That is… surprising. I do not remember being prescribed anything for blood pressure. Perhaps it was a different doctor? It was a long time ago. As for current medications… no, I do not take anything regularly. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers, when I have a headache. And sometimes… a sleeping pill, if I cannot sleep. But that is very rare. I believe it is… melatonin.
DOCTOR: Okay, over-the-counter pain relievers as needed and melatonin occasionally for sleep. That’s helpful. Now, to complete the picture, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I live alone, in a small house with a garden. I enjoy gardening, of course. I used to… travel with my wife. But now… I mostly stay close to home. I do not smoke. I do not drink very much. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. I try to eat healthy. I walk… when the weather is good. It is… a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sherrell. That gives me a very good understanding of your history and current situation. Based on what you've told me, and what I'm seeing in your records, it sounds like we need to investigate a few things. Your symptoms—the difficulty with word-finding, the balance issues, the forgetfulness, and the sleep problems—could be due to a number of factors. I'd like to start with a physical exam, to assess your reflexes, coordination, and overall neurological function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just… want to feel better. And… understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s perfectly understandable, Sherrell. We'll take things one step at a time. First, let’s have you sit up on the examination table. I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes and coordination. It’s a fairly standard exam. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. It feels… a little strange, being here. But I am glad I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 145/90. It's not alarmingly high, but it's higher than we'd like. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and extend your arms. And finally, I'd like you to touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger. Okay, everything seems… relatively normal, but your coordination is a little slower than I'd expect. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think it would be helpful to order some blood work and a brain scan. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a brain scan? Yes, I suppose so. If it will help… yes, please. A brain scan… that sounds… a little frightening. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. It is just… a little overwhelming, all of this.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be overwhelming, Sherrell. A brain scan—an MRI—will give us a more detailed look at your brain and help rule out any structural problems. The blood work will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other factors that could be contributing to your symptoms. It's a standard procedure, and it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I’ll write the orders now and send them to the lab and radiology department. They'll contact you to schedule the appointments. It’s important to schedule these as soon as possible, so please keep an eye out for their calls. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help manage your blood pressure. It's a low dose, and we can adjust it as needed. It is also important to make sure you are well hydrated. And I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Yes, perhaps. About the brain scan… will it hurt? And… will it take long? I am… a little claustrophobic, I think. Small spaces make me… uneasy. And the medication… are there any side effects I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Sherrell. Let's start with the brain scan. It's a painless procedure, but it does involve lying inside a fairly narrow machine for about 30-45 minutes. It can be noisy, which some people find unsettling. We can provide you with headphones to listen to music or a guided meditation during the scan. And if you are feeling claustrophobic, you can let the technician know at any time, and they can pause the scan or help you get out of the machine. They are very experienced in dealing with patients who feel anxious. We can also discuss the possibility of taking a mild sedative if you're particularly concerned. As for the medication—it’s a common blood pressure medication called Lisinopril. The most common side effects are a dry cough, dizziness, and fatigue. Some people experience mild headaches as well. These side effects are usually mild and temporary, and they often subside after a few days or weeks. It’s important to let me know if you experience any concerning side effects, and we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication if needed. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this point?
PATIENT: A sedative… that sounds… helpful, actually. I think I would… feel more comfortable with that. And the Lisinopril… if I experience dizziness, should I stop taking it immediately? And… how long will it take to see if the medication is… working? I just want to… feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly discuss prescribing a mild sedative to help you relax during the brain scan. I'll write that into the order, and the radiology department will contact you to discuss the details. As for the Lisinopril, if you experience dizziness, especially when standing up quickly, you should lie down until the dizziness passes. If the dizziness is severe or persistent, or if you experience any other concerning side effects, such as swelling of the face or difficulty breathing, you should stop taking the medication immediately and contact me or go to the nearest emergency room. It usually takes a few weeks to see the full effects of the medication. We'll monitor your blood pressure regularly to see if it's improving. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for about four weeks from now to review the results of the tests and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I want you to focus on getting enough rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding any strenuous activity. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact my office. Do you have any other questions before we finish for today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that covers everything. You have been very… thorough. And patient. Thank you. I just… hope it is nothing too serious. I do not want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It’s my pleasure. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious, and I want you to know that we're here to support you every step of the way. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll figure out what's going on. I'll have my nurse come in and give you the orders for the tests and the prescription. She'll also give you some information about the medication and some resources for managing anxiety. In the meantime, please try to relax and take care of yourself. Remember, you're not alone in this. Do you need any assistance getting off the examination table?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I believe I can manage. It was… kind of you to ask. I appreciate your… compassion.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. I am glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: .
