DOCTOR: Hello, Jase! It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Maskal, it's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's my stomach, I guess. It’s been... not good, lately. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It's been going on for a bit, and honestly, I can't really remember when it started, exactly. Just… a while. I think it’s something to do with… well, someone told me it could be something I eat, or something with my insides? I don't really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not good” and diarrhea for a while now. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. You mentioned you’re not sure when it started – that’s alright, we can try to narrow it down. When you say “a while,” are we talking days, weeks, or months?
PATIENT: Hmm… Months, definitely months. Maybe… three or four? It’s hard to say. Things just kinda… blend together, you know? It’s not like a sudden thing. It just slowly got worse, I think. I don’t really keep track of dates well. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly okay, Jase. It’s common to not remember exact timelines. Three or four months is helpful though. And slowly getting worse… can you describe what “worse” means?
PATIENT: Well, at first it was just… a bit loose, you know? Like after something didn’t agree with me. Now… it’s just more often. And… more watery. And it's tiring, honestly. I feel drained after… each time. And sometimes I get cramps, too. Not awful cramps, but uncomfortable. It's just… a lot. It's messing with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increasing frequency and wateriness, accompanied by fatigue and occasional cramps. That gives us a better picture. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or a change in the color – darker than usual, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… um… blood? I don't think so. Not that I've noticed. I usually don't… really look, if you know what I mean. I've noticed it’s… paler, maybe? Lighter than usual, but I just thought that was from… something I ate? I eat a lot of rice, sometimes. Does that make a difference? I really don’t know much about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood that you’ve seen, and paler stool, possibly related to your rice intake. That’s good to know. Rice can certainly affect stool color. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss associated with this?
PATIENT: Fever… not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing bad. No vomiting, thankfully. And… weight loss… I don't know. I haven’t really been weighing myself. My husband might know? He worries about me eating enough. I guess I haven’t felt like eating much lately, because of my stomach. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no vomiting, and potential weight loss—we’ll ask your husband about that. Reduced appetite because of your stomach issues makes sense. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any pain in your abdomen – anywhere specific?
PATIENT: It’s… kind of all over? Not like a sharp pain, but a dull ache. Mostly in the lower part, I think. Like… where your belly button is, and down below. It’s worse after I… you know. After I go to the bathroom. It doesn't last long, though. Just a few minutes. It's not constant, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, diffuse abdominal pain, lower abdomen primarily, worse after bowel movements, and not constant. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a little about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. I think… maybe? Someone said something about my insides being… inflamed? A few years ago, I saw a doctor about stomach problems, but I don’t really remember what he said. My husband handles all the paperwork and appointments, usually. He said something about needing special tests, but it wasn't… serious, he said. He said it was just… something I had to live with. Does that make sense? I feel terrible for not knowing!
DOCTOR: Okay, so there may have been a prior diagnosis related to inflammation, and some tests done. It’s alright you don’t remember all the details, that's why we're here. We can look into your records to get more information. Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay, it says here you were evaluated for Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, approximately two years ago. Some tests were done, including a stool sample and blood work. The results were… inconclusive. And it does note a recommendation for dietary changes. Do you recall anything about those dietary changes?
PATIENT: IBS! That rings a bell! Yes… my husband made me cut out… wheat, I think? And dairy. He was really strict about it for a while. It didn't really make much difference, though, honestly. I still had problems. He stopped being so strict after a few months, because it was so hard. I mean, I love bread! And cheese! He’s a good husband, though. He just wants me to feel better. Is it bad that I didn’t stick to the diet?
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad at all if you didn’t stick to the diet. Dietary changes can be very difficult to maintain, and if they weren't providing enough relief, it’s understandable. Let’s talk about some other things now. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um... I take a vitamin D supplement, sometimes. My husband says I don't get enough sun. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Oh! And I use an inhaler for… my wheezing. It's not asthma, the doctor said, just… sensitive airways. I don’t use it very often, though, only when it’s cold or dusty. That’s all, I think. I really don't like taking pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D intermittently, ibuprofen for headaches as needed, and an inhaler for sensitive airways. Good to know. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um... no, not really. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always checks when I try something new, though. He’s very careful. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just dust, or something. I haven’t ever had to go to the hospital for an allergy, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, I'm going to ask a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no! Never. My husband doesn't approve. And I don't like those things. Never have. I drink tea, sometimes. And I like to walk in the park when the weather is nice. That’s about it. I’m pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Tea and walking are good! Alright, Jase, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just lie back and relax. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, but a little bit of… increased activity. Not concerning, but worth noting. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen – that means I’ll press on it to feel for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if anything feels painful. A little tenderness here in your lower left quadrant, but not severe. No masses that I can feel. Your abdomen is soft overall. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And your blood pressure and pulse are good. Overall, the physical exam is pretty unremarkable, but the tenderness in your lower left quadrant and the increased bowel sounds are things to consider.
PATIENT: Okay… that doesn't sound too bad, I guess. My lower left side does feel a little… achy sometimes. Is that something serious, doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you pointed that out, Jase. Mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, combined with your history of IBS and the increased bowel sounds, is suggestive of a few possibilities. It could be a flare-up of your IBS, but it could also be something else, like diverticulitis—inflammation of small pouches in the colon—though your symptoms don’t fully fit that picture. It's also possible it's related to the location of your colon, and just some muscular discomfort. To rule things out and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a couple of tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. I don't… I don't really like tests. What kind of tests? Will they hurt? Are they expensive? My husband handles all that stuff, usually, and I don’t want to cause him any trouble. I just want this to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Jase. I wouldn’t suggest them if they weren't important. The first test I'd like to order is a stool sample – you’ll just need to collect a small amount of stool in a container, and it’ll be sent to the lab to check for any infection or inflammation. It doesn’t hurt at all. The second test is a blood test, just to check your white blood cell count and rule out any signs of infection. That one involves a small needle prick, but it’s quick. As for the cost, it depends on your insurance coverage, but I can have the billing department check with Medicare and give you an estimate before you leave today. It’s important to get these tests done to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Stool sample and blood test. If it will help me feel better, I guess. Can they do it quickly? I don't want to be sick for much longer. And please tell my husband about the cost, so I don't worry him. He gets so stressed out when I’m not well. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jase. We’ll get it done as quickly as possible. The stool sample can be collected here at the clinic today, and the blood test can be done right after. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. I'll make sure to write down detailed instructions for the stool sample collection, and I'll have the billing department contact your husband directly with a cost estimate. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend staying well-hydrated with clear fluids, and eating smaller, more frequent meals. You can also try over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, like loperamide, if your symptoms are severe, but I recommend checking with your husband first, to make sure it won't interact with any other medications you're taking. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Water, smaller meals, and talk to my husband about the medicine. I think I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening to me. It’s nice to finally have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. So, to recap, we're ordering a stool sample and a blood test, you’ll stay hydrated and eat smaller meals, and you’ll check with your husband about the anti-diarrheal medication. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you the instructions for the stool sample collection, and we’ll get the blood test scheduled. We’ll follow up with you as soon as the results come back, usually within three to five business days. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just hope it’s not something serious. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. You’ve put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. That’s my job. I’m optimistic we’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be right in. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
