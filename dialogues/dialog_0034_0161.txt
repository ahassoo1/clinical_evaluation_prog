DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Antonis Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly, I just... well, a friend mentioned I should talk to someone about staying safe, and this seemed like the best thing to do. It's about preventing HIV, I think? She called it PrEP. I don't really know much about it, but I want to learn. I'd like to get this sorted out quickly if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. That’s very proactive of you to consider preventative measures. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a very effective way to reduce the risk of HIV infection. It’s good you’re thinking about this. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, well… let’s see. I’m generally pretty healthy, I think, for my age. I try to walk when I can, being a parking attendant means I’m on my feet a lot. No major illnesses, thankfully. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor when I need to, you know, the usual check-ups. I haven’t been sick with anything serious in years. I don’t really take any medications regularly, just the occasional pain reliever for my knees, but that's it. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Trefren. Thank you. And it’s good to hear you’re generally healthy and active. You mentioned occasional pain relievers for your knees. Could you tell me a little more about that – what kind of pain reliever do you use, and how often do you need it?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just ibuprofen, the regular kind you get at the drugstore. I don't take it that often, maybe once or twice a month when they really bother me. It’s just from being on my feet all day at work, you know? The parking lot isn’t exactly forgiving. It’s not a constant thing, thankfully. I try to stretch and rest when I can, but sometimes it’s just needed. Nothing serious, I promise. Is that what you’re worried about? Interfering with… the PrEP thing?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Trefren. Ibuprofen is generally fine, but it’s important for me to have a complete picture. We will consider it when evaluating if PrEP is appropriate for you. Now, to get a better understanding of your risk, could you tell me a little bit about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… this is a bit personal, isn’t it? I’ve… not been with anyone regularly for a long time. I’ve had a few… encounters over the years, nothing serious, and it’s been a while since the last one. I’m single, as you can see. I'm not actively looking, either. I'm more focused on my work and keeping busy. I'm not with anyone currently. Does that… answer your question? I'm just trying to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren, that is perfectly honest and sufficient for now. It's important to be open, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. We understand this can be a sensitive topic, and your privacy is very important. To clarify, when you say “encounters,” were these encounters with men, women, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly men, if I’m being truthful. A couple with women, a long time ago. But really, the vast majority have been with men. And, like I said, it's been quite a while since anything happened. It’s not like I’m… active at all right now. I just want to be prepared, you know? If something were to happen, I’d like to know I’m doing everything I can to protect myself. That's why I'm here. It's really all I can say about it. I'm not trying to be difficult, it's just...personal.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Trefren. It's good you're thinking ahead and taking preventative measures, even if you aren't currently sexually active. That's very responsible. To move forward, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been tested for HIV or other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I think… maybe ten years ago? I had a check-up then, and they did all sorts of tests. Everything came back negative, as far as I remember. I don't really keep track of those things, to be honest. It was just a routine thing with my regular doctor. I haven't had any reason to get tested since then, because I haven’t been… with anyone. But I can ask my old doctor if you need exact dates or something? It’s a bit of a hassle, though. Does that help? It was definitely negative, I’m sure of that.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Trefren. Knowing you had a negative test ten years ago is good information. While we can always re-test to be certain, it's a good starting point. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have to medications or other substances. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I've taken antibiotics a few times over the years for colds and things, and never had any issues. I'm not allergic to any foods either. I can eat anything. I wish I was allergic to chocolate so I wouldn’t eat so much of it, but sadly, no allergies here. Is that alright? I’m trying to think of anything, but I truly can’t recall ever being allergic to anything. My knees ache, but that’s not an allergy!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Trefren. No known allergies is helpful. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a quick look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Get it over with quickly if you can, please. I've got a bit of a busy afternoon at the lot. I'm just eager to find out if this PrEP thing is right for me, and get on with things. I’m not usually one for doctor visits, so the quicker the better. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. I understand. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Overall, your physical exam appears within normal limits. Now, to determine if PrEP is appropriate, we’ll need some blood work to check your kidney function and screen for any underlying conditions. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, blood work is fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. Can I still work after? Being a parking attendant doesn’t allow much flexibility for long appointments. Honestly, the faster everything gets done, the better. I’m just hoping this PrEP thing can give me some peace of mind. So yes, blood work, definitely. Let's get it over with. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Trefren. The blood draw itself should only take a few minutes. You can go back to work afterwards; there are no restrictions. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician is ready for you. Once the results are back – usually within a few business days – we’ll review them and discuss if PrEP is a good fit for you. If it is, we'll talk about potential side effects and how to take the medication. Do you have any questions before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… please hurry. The sooner I know, the better. I appreciate you getting me in and out quickly. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I still don't fully understand how this PrEP thing works, but I trust you'll explain it all when the results come back. Okay, let's go get the blood drawn. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. Right this way. The lab technician, Sarah, is expecting you. She'll take excellent care of you. Just let her know you're here for PrEP screening. I'll review your results as soon as they are available and will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them.
PATIENT: .
