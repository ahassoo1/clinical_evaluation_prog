DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 42 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. I am here because I am having… painful difficulties. It is with my body, and I would like it resolved as quickly as possible, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: "Difficulties," is rather vague, Ms. Reihner. While I appreciate your desire for a swift resolution, I require specifics to provide appropriate medical care. Could you elaborate on these “difficulties”?
PATIENT: Alright. My back… it hurts. A lot. It started about a week ago, I believe. I do fence work, you see. Erecting fences. It is… strenuous. And now, when I move… or even try to move… there is pain. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… deep ache. And it feels worse at the end of the day. Does that clarify things?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is somewhat more helpful. So, lower back pain, onset approximately one week ago, related to your profession… fencing work. You describe it as a deep ache, exacerbated by movement and at the end of the day. Do you experience any radiating pain – does it travel down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating… you mean, does the pain go down my legs? No. Not exactly. Sometimes I feel a little… stiffness in my hips, but the pain itself stays in my back. Mostly in the lower part. I do not believe it goes down my legs. It's… contained. As much as that's possible, anyway.
DOCTOR: "Contained," yes. Right. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. It is not… always there. When I am resting, it is much better. But as soon as I start working… or even just walking for too long… it returns. And gets worse. It is definitely worse with activity. And like I said, at the end of the day, it’s… quite bothersome. I do not sleep well when it is particularly bad.
DOCTOR: I see. So, intermittent lower back pain, exacerbated by activity, relieved by rest, with some impact on sleep. Do you recall any specific event that started this pain?
PATIENT: No, not exactly. It did not come suddenly. It was… gradual. I was building a particularly long stretch of fence, a difficult piece of land. Lots of uneven ground. Perhaps that contributed? I do not recall lifting anything unusually heavy, or twisting in a strange way. It just… started hurting more and more each day. Slowly. Like a slow burn.
DOCTOR: I see. Gradual onset, related to strenuous work. No acute injury. Have you experienced back pain like this before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve been doing fence work for… well, for a long time now. Fifteen years, I think. And I’ve never had pain like this. It is… new. And quite unpleasant. I just want it to stop, if that is possible. It’s affecting my ability to work, you see. And that is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years without incident, and now this. Alright. Now, let’s move on to some more general questions. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing that I know of. I do not regularly see a doctor. I am… generally healthy. I take no medications. Just… this back pain. I do have Medicare, of course. But I prefer to avoid doctors when possible. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: "Avoid doctors," yes. Well, preventative care is always advisable, Ms. Reihner, but we’ll focus on the current issue. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I am aware of. I have never had a reaction to any medication. I have taken… pain relievers, from time to time, for headaches. But nothing serious. And no… swelling, or rashes, or difficulty breathing. Nothing like that. I am quite sure I have no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My family…? My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. In her hands. And my father… he had heart trouble. But I do not… I do not know much beyond that. We were not… close. And I do not have a lot of information about their medical histories. Does that suffice? I would rather not dwell on things if it is not necessary.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and heart trouble. Noted. Now, let’s perform a brief physical examination to assess the source of your discomfort. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Very well. If you think it is necessary. I would like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if that is alright. I have things to do, you see. And lying down won't fix it, I'm certain. But, if it must be done...
DOCTOR: Certainly. This will simply assist in determining the cause of your pain. Please lie flat on your stomach. Okay, Ms. Reihner, I'm going to gently press on your lower back. Please tell me if you feel any pain. I am noting some tenderness to palpation over the lumbar region, particularly at L4-L5. There is mild muscle spasm present bilaterally, but no significant restriction of range of motion at this time. No radiating pain with palpation or movement. Now, I'd like you to gently bend forward, as far as is comfortable. And then try to bend backwards. Let me know where you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… tender. Right there. It’s not… sharp, but it’s uncomfortable. It’s the same spot that has been hurting. Oof. Yes. That’s… unpleasant. The pain gets worse when I bend forward. It’s… a deep ache, like I said before. And bending backwards… it’s not as bad, but I still feel it. It feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased pain with forward flexion, tightness with extension. No neurological deficits noted at this time. Based on the examination and your history, it appears you are experiencing a lumbar strain. It is likely related to the strenuous activity of fence work. While it is unlikely to be anything serious, it is important to manage the pain and prevent further injury. I recommend rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen. I will prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant to help alleviate the spasm. It is essential to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for the next week.
PATIENT: Rest, ice… and medication. That is… what I expected, I suppose. A muscle relaxant? Is that… safe? I do not usually take medication. And a week without work… that is… difficult. Will this really help? And what if it doesn’t get better after a week?
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant is generally safe, Ms. Reihner, but it can cause drowsiness. Avoid operating heavy machinery or driving while taking it. As for the duration of recovery, a week is a reasonable timeframe for a typical lumbar strain. However, if your symptoms do not improve after a week, or if they worsen, you should schedule a follow-up appointment. In rare cases, a lumbar strain can be more serious, such as a disc herniation or spinal fracture. We would need to consider further imaging, such as an X-ray or MRI, if your symptoms are not resolving. But for now, let’s focus on conservative management. It is crucial to adhere to the rest and activity restrictions. Do not push yourself too hard. It is better to err on the side of caution. Do you have any questions regarding the medication or the treatment plan?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Rest, ice, medication… and avoid work. It’s… frustrating. But I suppose it’s better than something worse. Will this affect my ability to… do things, in the future? Will I be able to go back to fence work? That is my livelihood, you see. And how long will the medication take to work? I do not want to be drowsy all the time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Reihner, most patients with a lumbar strain are able to return to their normal activities, including physically demanding work, after a period of rest and rehabilitation. However, it is important to listen to your body and gradually increase your activity level. We can discuss a physical therapy referral if you are concerned about safely returning to fence work. As for the medication, the muscle relaxant should start to take effect within a few hours. The drowsiness is typically mild and temporary. If it becomes bothersome, you can reduce the dosage or discontinue the medication. However, I recommend completing the full course as prescribed. I will print out a prescription for the muscle relaxant and provide you with written instructions on rest, ice, and activity modification. Please follow these instructions carefully. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No. I think that is everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… assistance. I will follow your instructions as closely as possible. And I hope… I hope this works. .
DOCTOR: Very well. If your symptoms persist or worsen, do not hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Reihner.
