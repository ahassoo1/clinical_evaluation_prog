DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be…easy. My husband – well, was my husband – and I always planned on kids, but things…happened. I don't want any trouble, you know? No complications. Is that…possible?
DOCTOR: I understand. Planning for a pregnancy is important, and wanting a smooth process is perfectly reasonable. It’s good you're thinking ahead. “Easy” is a relative term, of course, but we can certainly do everything we can to optimize your chances and minimize potential complications. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… honestly? It’s all a bit of a blur. I went to the doctor when I had to, you know? For check-ups, when I was sick… nothing major, ever. My husband handled most of that stuff, remembering dates and medications and…everything. He was really good at that. I’m… fairly healthy, I guess. I eat okay. I try to. I don't smoke. And… what else? Oh, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Does that matter? Honestly, I don’t remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It's alright if details are fuzzy; we can work through it. The gallbladder removal could be relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. Do you remember roughly when you had that surgery?
PATIENT: Ugh, when? Honestly, Doctor, it was ages ago. Before…before everything. Probably… oh, goodness. Maybe fifteen years ago? Somewhere around there? It was definitely before we even thought about kids. I… I really don’t remember the exact year. It was just…a thing that happened. I was sick, they took it out, and then I got better. Is that good enough? I’m really not good with dates, okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s okay. Approximately fifteen years ago is helpful. We can always look it up in records if needed. Okay. And have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations since then?
PATIENT: No. No, nothing like that. Just…the usual colds, you know? A flu here and there. Nothing that kept me in the hospital, or anything scary. I’m… pretty robust, normally. I get sick like anyone else, but I bounce back quickly. Honestly, I feel fine. I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t wanting to get pregnant, would I? It’s just… I want to make sure everything is fine, before I even try. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. You want to be proactive and ensure you’re in the best possible health for a pregnancy. That's very responsible. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, vitamins… I think I take a multivitamin sometimes. I keep meaning to get back into it. It’s…one of those things. And I take something for my…aches. Just an over-the-counter thing, for when my joints bother me. It’s not a regular thing, though. I don’t take anything daily, if that makes sense. Honestly, I try to avoid pills as much as possible. I don’t like taking things I don’t need. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for aches?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You want the name? Honestly, I don't even look at the bottle. My neighbor gave it to me. She said it was good for…arthritis, maybe? Something for old people. It's… blue, I think? And it comes in a little plastic bottle. I just grab one when my knees start acting up. I really don't pay attention to those things. This is ridiculous, isn't it? I just want to get pregnant, not pass a pharmacology exam!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It's perfectly alright to not remember specifics. However, knowing what you're taking, even if it's an over-the-counter medication, is important for your health and the potential health of a pregnancy. Some medications, even seemingly harmless ones, can affect fertility or pregnancy. I'm not trying to quiz you, I promise. Perhaps we can try a different approach. Do you happen to have the bottle with you, or could you recall where you purchased it?
PATIENT: Ugh, no, I don't have the bottle. And honestly? I have no idea where I got it. My neighbor just…handed it to me. She gets all sorts of things from… I don't know, the internet, maybe? I really don't ask questions. She’s a nice lady, but she’s a bit…eccentric. Look, is this really necessary? I’m perfectly healthy! I just want to know if I can get pregnant without any problems. Is there a test for that? Can’t you just…check?
DOCTOR: Carmaleta, I understand your desire for a quick and simple answer. However, determining if you can safely get pregnant requires a thorough assessment, and knowing all the medications you're taking, even if you perceive them as minor, is crucial. Taking a medication of unknown origin could potentially pose risks. I'm going to recommend a blood test to check your general health and hormone levels. This will give us a baseline understanding of your reproductive function. It would also be ideal to consult with your primary care physician, if you have one, to review your medical history and any medications you may have taken in the past. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests… fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don’t have a primary care physician. My husband always took care of all that stuff. Look, can we just skip the questions, and do the test? I have an appointment later this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. I really need to know if I can just… try. Is that too much to ask? This is getting ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Carmaleta. We can proceed with the blood test. It will give us a starting point. My nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. While you wait, I will have her print out a form with some basic questions about your family history. If you have time, filling that out would be helpful. Also, I strongly recommend establishing care with a primary care physician. They can provide ongoing health monitoring and address any concerns you may have. Before you leave, I’m going to give you a referral form for a specialist in reproductive endocrinology. They specialize in fertility and can provide more comprehensive evaluation and guidance. Would you like me to do that now?
