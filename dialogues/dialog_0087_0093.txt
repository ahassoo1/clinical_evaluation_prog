DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, good morning. Soodeen, right? Look, honestly, it’s a bit of a blur, but my wife… she passed a while back. And things haven’t been… great, sleep-wise, since then. I suppose that’s a good place to start. I just feel… off. Like I’m not really getting rested, you know? And I figured… maybe some fitness stuff would help. Though I haven’t really done much fitness stuff in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Redfern. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s completely understandable that you’re not feeling yourself, and it’s good that you’re seeking help. Trouble sleeping after a loss is very common. When you say "off," can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm. It's just… everything feels a bit… muted, I guess? Like I'm watching life happen to someone else. And I'm always tired, even when I sleep. Not like… physically exhausted, more just… drained. And I get… irritable. Little things bother me, you know? Things that wouldn’t normally even register. My work... I fix instruments, mostly violins and cellos. It requires a bit of focus and honestly, I've been dropping things more than usual. Not constantly, but enough to be annoying. And concerning, I suppose. It's hard to explain. It's not painful or anything, just… wrong.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Redfern. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms – the persistent fatigue, the irritability, the difficulty concentrating, and feeling disconnected. It's good you've noticed these changes. To get a better understanding, could you tell me approximately when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Symptoms… right. Honestly? It's… fuzzy. Immediately after… well, you know. But it’s been… months, definitely. Maybe six? Seven? Time sort of… blends together these days. It wasn’t sudden, it sort of… crept up on me. One day I was just… a bit more tired than usual, and then another day a bit more irritable. And now… well, now I’m here, I suppose. It's been consistently bad for… maybe three or four months, I’d guess. Though, like I said, it’s hard to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistently worsening over the past three to four months. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight during this time?
PATIENT: Appetite… Not really. I eat, when I remember to. I suppose I don't have much of an appetite, but I force myself to eat something. Don't want to waste away, right? Weight… I haven't weighed myself in… goodness, I don’t even remember the last time. I haven't noticed anything dramatic, if that helps. I'm a fairly tall guy, so maybe I could lose a few pounds and not notice, I don't know. I feel… thinner, maybe? But that could just be the general… drained feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in appetite or weight, although you feel a bit thinner overall. Now, I’d like to ask about your sleep a bit more specifically. How many hours of sleep are you typically getting each night?
PATIENT: Hours? That’s… a good question. It varies. Some nights I’m up half the night just… staring at the ceiling. Other nights I crash and sleep for… maybe six? Seven? But it’s not good sleep. I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all. And I get up a lot to… well, to use the restroom. And sometimes I just… can’t get back to sleep after that. I wouldn't say I have a regular bedtime either. It depends on when I feel tired, I suppose. It's a mess, honestly. A complete mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so inconsistent sleep patterns, difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. That certainly sounds disruptive. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about other areas of your health. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really? Is that… necessary? Look, I go when I need to. It's… normal, I guess. Maybe a little… irregular sometimes? Nothing drastic. It's not like I'm doubled over in pain or anything. I haven’t really paid attention to it, if that answers your question. It’s not exactly a topic I enjoy discussing. I mean, with all due respect.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. It’s not a comfortable topic. I just ask to rule out other potential issues. No significant changes, you said?
PATIENT: Right. No, nothing… alarming. Just… normal. Maybe a bit less regular than it used to be, but nothing that would send me to the emergency room. Honestly, Doc, I just want to feel… normal again. That's all. Sleep better, have some energy, not drop all my tools… is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Redfern, that’s not too much to ask at all. We’ll work towards that. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmm. Let me see. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, measles… Nothing serious. As an adult… I don’t think so. I had a check-up every year with my family doctor back home… everything was always… fine. Blood pressure was always a little high, maybe, but nothing they ever worried about. They just told me to watch my salt intake. Apart from that… no, I can’t think of anything. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. Until… well, until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past but otherwise healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. I've always been lucky, I suppose. Or maybe just careful. I haven't had any… accidents or anything that required a trip to the operating room. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that just required a cast. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgical history. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… that’s a tough one. My parents… they’re both gone now. My mother died of… I think it was a stroke, when I was still young. My father… heart problems, I believe. He wasn't very forthcoming about his health, honestly. And I don't really have much family left. A few distant cousins, but I haven't seen them in years. So, I guess… heart problems on my father's side, maybe? And a stroke with my mother. But I don't have a lot of details. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of heart problems and stroke, but limited details. And finally, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? Am I being investigated? Look, I live alone. I own a small workshop, fix instruments. I don't really… go out much. Not since… well, not since my wife. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do any drugs. I mostly just work and… try to get through the day. I had some friends, once, but… we’ve all drifted apart. It’s a quiet life, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, lives alone, owns a workshop, no smoking, no alcohol, no drug use. Very quiet lifestyle. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don't think so. I've never really had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had any issues with bee stings or anything like that. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach. So, no. No allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Thank you for providing all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a neurological assessment. It will just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s wrong, if anything is wrong. And hopefully… get some sleep. So, yeah. Go ahead. Though, don't expect much. I haven’t exactly been taking good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to quickly assess your cognitive function. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. August… the second? Yes, August the second. 2025, right? Is that right? Honestly, Doc, the days just sort of… blend together. I try to keep track, but… it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Really? Fine. What are they? Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Please remember these words and I’ll ask you to recall them later. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions. Do you have any feelings of sadness or hopelessness?
PATIENT: Sadness? Hopelessness? What kind of question is that? Of course I do. My wife… she’s gone. What do you expect? I’m not exactly bouncing off the walls with joy. It's just... a constant weight, you know? A dull ache. I don’t cry much anymore, I just… feel numb. So, yeah. Plenty of sadness. Plenty of hopelessness.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way after such a loss. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, complicated by grief. The fatigue, irritability, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of sadness all point in that direction. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. These will help to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I also recommend a referral to a psychologist specializing in grief counseling. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a psychologist… Honestly, Doc, I'm not a fan of labels or… talking about my feelings with strangers. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? But… fine. Blood tests, I suppose. If it will rule things out. But I'm not promising anything with the psychologist. I just… don’t see how talking about it will help. It happened, she's gone, and nothing will bring her back. But… okay, fine. Tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Redfern. It’s completely valid to feel that way. I’m not pushing you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. The blood tests will give us a baseline and help to rule out any other medical issues. The psychologist is simply an option, and you can decide if it’s right for you after you’ve met with them. I’ll order the blood tests now. You can go to the lab down the street, and they’ll send the results to me. I’ll also give you a referral for a psychologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. Her contact information is on this paper. In the meantime, let's focus on some things you can do at home. Try to establish a regular sleep schedule, even if you're not feeling tired. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed, and make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet. And most importantly, be kind to yourself. Grief takes time, and there’s no right or wrong way to feel. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A regular sleep schedule… easy for you to say. But fine, I’ll try. I suppose. And be kind to myself… That'll be a first. No, I don't think I have any questions. Just… when will the blood test results be back? And is there… anything I can take for the sleep? Something over the counter? I really just need to rest.
DOCTOR: The blood test results usually take 2-3 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. As for sleep, I generally don’t recommend relying on over-the-counter sleep aids for long-term use. They can have side effects and may mask underlying issues. However, if you’re struggling to fall asleep in the short term, you could try melatonin. A low dose, 3-5mg, about an hour before bedtime. But please, don’t use it regularly without discussing it with me first. I'll also write you a note for work, excusing you from any strenuous activities for the next week. Here. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. I just want to go home and… try to sleep, I suppose. Thank you, Doc. I guess. Hopefully, these tests will show something. And maybe, just maybe, I can get some rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Redfern. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you’re not alone in this. We’ll work through this together. Take care, and try to get some rest. I’ll be in touch soon.
