DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Hmm... what brings me in? Oh, yes. My sinuses. They… they bother me. It’s been a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinuses. I understand. And when you say “a little while,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… It feels like maybe… a few weeks? Maybe longer. Time… it goes so fast, you know? I don’t really keep track very well. It's just… pressure, mostly. And sometimes, it’s hard to breathe through my nose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy to lose track of time. A few weeks of sinus pressure and difficulty breathing – that gives us a starting point. Is the pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. When I work… the noise, maybe it helps? I don’t know. But when I rest… it feels worse. Especially at night. It’s hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be exacerbated by rest and potentially improved with activity. That's helpful to know. And where specifically do you feel the pressure?
PATIENT: Right here, and here. Sometimes, it feels like… behind my eyes, too. It’s not a bad pain, not really. Just… uncomfortable. Heavy. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: Alright, pressure in your forehead, cheeks, and sometimes behind your eyes. And you’ve mentioned it’s not a bad pain, more of a heavy discomfort. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pressure?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. Sometimes my nose feels… stuffy. Very stuffy. And… I think I have been more tired than usual. But I work long hours, so maybe that’s just… the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, nasal stuffiness and increased fatigue. We'll take all of that into consideration. Do you have any drainage from your nose, and if so, what color is it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, sometimes. A little. It’s… clear, mostly. Sometimes it’s a little… yellow, I think? But not always. It’s hard to say, really. I don’t pay it much attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly clear nasal drainage, sometimes a little yellow. We will want to explore this further. Now, I’d like to ask about some other things, just to get a complete picture. Have you had a fever, sore throat, cough, or any recent changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No sore throat. And no cough, thankfully. My smell… and taste… I don’t think so. Everything seems normal there. I can smell my husband’s cooking just fine!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, have you had any issues with allergies in the past?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t ever been to a doctor about allergies. Sometimes I sneeze a little, but everyone sneezes, right? I don’t think it’s… bad enough to be allergies.
DOCTOR: That's fair. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma, for example?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. I work with the drills, you know, the oil and gas. It’s… hard work. I get tired. I don’t think I have any conditions. My husband always tells me I worry too much. He says I'm strong. But no, I don’t think so. I haven’t been told I have anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. No surgeries. I've been very lucky, I think. Just a few aches and pains from the work, but nothing… serious enough for surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she… she has some trouble with her heart, I think. But she is very old. And my father… he passed away a long time ago. He worked very hard, like me. I don't think anyone else… had anything… serious. They were all strong people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother has some heart trouble, and your father passed away some time ago. And no other major medical issues reported in the family. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your work and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I operate the drills. It’s… noisy and hard. Long hours. Lots of dust and… things. I work with a team, which is good. I like my coworkers. At home… I cook for my husband. And I try to rest when I can. We don't have much time for… hobbies. Just work, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, demanding physical work with long hours and exposure to dust. Do you smoke, or are you exposed to second-hand smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. My husband doesn’t smoke either. We don’t allow it in the house. It’s bad for you, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, um… Sometimes, when my muscles hurt from the work, I take… something. A little pill. But I don’t remember the name. My coworker gives it to me. It’s… for the pain. But not every day. Just when I need it. And nothing else, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, an occasional pain pill given to you by a coworker, name unknown. That’s helpful to know, although we do need to be careful about taking medications not prescribed to you directly. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat all kinds of food. My husband is a wonderful cook, you know. He makes everything. And I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for answering all of my questions. Now, I would like to perform a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72, and your temperature is 98.6, all within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to examine your ears and throat. Your ears look normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to say "ah." Your throat is clear, no significant redness or swelling. Finally, I’m going to gently palpate your sinuses to check for tenderness. You do have some tenderness over your frontal and maxillary sinuses. No significant swelling or other abnormalities noted.
PATIENT: Mmm… yes, that’s where it hurts. Not a bad pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a pressure. It feels a little better when you’re not touching it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for letting me know. Based on the history and the physical examination, it sounds like you are likely experiencing sinusitis – inflammation of your sinuses. The tenderness over your frontal and maxillary sinuses, along with your reported symptoms of nasal congestion, pressure, and fatigue, are consistent with this. However, to be certain and rule out any other possibilities, I would like to order a CT scan of your sinuses. This will give us a clearer picture of what's going on inside. Do you have any concerns about getting a CT scan?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Oh dear. Is that… dangerous? I haven’t ever had one of those before. What does it… do? And how much will it cost? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s smart to be concerned about costs and risks. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your sinuses. There is a small amount of radiation exposure, but it's generally considered safe for adults, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis often outweigh the risks. As for the cost, I understand your concern, especially without insurance. Let me see what the approximate cost would be at the clinic. It is approximately $300 without insurance. We can also explore options for financial assistance or reduced rates. We can also discuss treatment options before the scan, if you would prefer, to see if your symptoms improve without it. It’s possible this is a mild case that will resolve on its own with supportive care. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Three hundred dollars… that is… a lot of money. Maybe… maybe we should try the other things first? The things that don't cost so much? I don’t want to spend all that money if it might not be necessary. What kind of things could I do… to help it get better on its own?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable approach. We can definitely try a course of conservative treatment before considering the CT scan. I recommend the following: Saline nasal rinses: This helps to clear congestion and reduce inflammation. You can use a neti pot or a saline nasal spray several times a day. Warm compresses: Applying a warm compress to your face can help relieve pressure and pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage any discomfort. Plenty of fluids: Staying hydrated helps to thin mucus and promote drainage. Rest: Getting enough rest allows your body to recover. I’m also going to recommend a trial of a decongestant for a few days. However, please do not use it for more than three days, as it can cause rebound congestion. We'll see how you feel in about a week. If your symptoms don't improve, or if they worsen, we can revisit the possibility of the CT scan. Does that sound like a plan you’re comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. I can try those things. They don’t sound too difficult. And I will be careful with the medicine, only for three days like you said. Thank you very much. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much better knowing what I can do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. I'm glad I could help. If you experience a high fever, severe headache, vision changes, or any swelling around your eyes, please seek immediate medical attention. Those could be signs of a more serious infection. Otherwise, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s the clinic’s phone number. I'll make a note in your chart to follow up with you in one week to see how you're doing. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your kindness and your help. I will try those things and I will call if anything changes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. You have a good day as well, and please take care of yourself. .
