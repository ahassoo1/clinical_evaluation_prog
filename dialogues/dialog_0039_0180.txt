DOCTOR: Hello Hedy, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. I'm just… tired. Really tired. And I keep… well, it’s embarrassing. I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. Clay, mostly. It's stupid, I know. Is that what you need to know? Just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Hedy. It’s not stupid at all. It's good you're telling me what's going on. "Tired" can mean a lot of things, and the craving… well, we'll definitely look into that. It's called pica, and it can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Oh, jeez. A long time. Years, probably. It just… gets worse. I used to be able to push through it, you know? Work all day, come home, still have energy. Now… now I just want to lie down. Everything feels like… wading through mud. Honestly, I don’t even remember when it started being this bad. Maybe a year or so? It all kinda blends together, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Hedy. It sounds incredibly frustrating. A year of increasing fatigue… okay. And is it constant fatigue, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Definitely constant. Some days are worse than others, sure. But it's always there. Like a weight on my chest. Even when I sleep, I don’t feel rested. I just… exist. Not like I’m enjoying anything. Is this going somewhere? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are going somewhere, Hedy. It’s just taking a little time to gather the pieces. Constant fatigue is significant, and we need to figure out what’s causing it. Now, let's talk about the dirt craving. How often are you eating clay, and how much at a time?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't make me talk about this. It's… a few times a week, maybe? It’s not like I’m eating buckets of it! Just… handfuls. When I'm gardening mostly. I dig it up, and… I just… eat a bit. It feels… good. I don't know why. And it's not like the good dirt, either. It’s usually reddish clay. I can’t explain it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few times a week, handfuls of reddish clay, mostly when gardening. That's helpful. It is unusual, and it's good we're talking about it. Sometimes, cravings like this can be a sign of an iron deficiency or other nutritional issues. Before we go further, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and cravings?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Jeez. Let me think. I get… headaches sometimes. Dull ones. And my hands… they ache. A lot. Especially after I've been digging around in the garden. Everything just feels… brittle, I guess. And I'm always cold. Even when it's warm out. I just figured it was getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, aching hands, feeling cold, and a general feeling of… brittleness, as you put it. All of that is important information. Now, just to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat… when I remember to. It's not like I'm a big eater, never have been. Food just… doesn’t taste very good anymore. Everything’s kinda bland. And sometimes… sometimes I get nauseous. Not often, but enough to make me not want to eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced appetite, bland taste, and occasional nausea… Thank you for sharing all of that, Hedy. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history? Ugh. Let me think. My husband… he passed away a few years back. Heart problems. I don’t have… I haven’t really been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups, you know? Nothing serious. I don't remember anything specific being wrong with me. I'm not a sickly person.
DOCTOR: I understand. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds like you've been quite healthy for the most part. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never been in the hospital. No surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. Just a simple break. They put it in a cast, and that was it. I'm really not one for doctors and hospitals, if you couldn’t tell.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Hedy. It sounds like you've been very fortunate. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions… Hmm. My mother had… arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands. And my father… he had high blood pressure. That’s all I can really remember. I don't really keep up with my family much. They live far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. That’s helpful. And, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't think so. I eat pretty much anything. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, ever. I don’t take any medications regularly either.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It sounds like you haven't had many medical issues in the past. However, the fatigue and the craving for clay, along with the headaches, aching hands, and feeling cold, are concerning. I would like to do a brief physical exam, and then order some blood tests to check for any nutritional deficiencies, anemia, and other possible causes of your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, tests. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I know what's wrong, the sooner I can get back to my life. Don’t keep me waiting all day, though. I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Hedy. I’ll try to be as quick as possible. First, let's just listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take your blood pressure. Then I’ll check your hands and look at your skin. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let me examine your hands. I notice some redness and slight swelling in your knuckles. Do you experience pain in your hands when you grip things?
PATIENT: Yes! That's what I've been trying to tell you! It hurts to dig, it hurts to hold things… everything. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And it's worse in the morning. I just figured it was arthritis, like my mother had.
DOCTOR: Okay, morning stiffness and a dull ache in your hands. It's possible it could be arthritis, but we need to rule out other causes. Now, let me just check your skin for any signs of pallor or other abnormalities. Your skin appears a little pale. This, along with the fatigue and craving for clay, is concerning for a possible iron deficiency. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a thyroid panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Thyroid? What's that got to do with anything? Look, just do the tests. I don't understand all that medical mumbo jumbo. Just tell me what's wrong, and how to fix it. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Hedy. I understand. The thyroid tests are just to rule out any potential issues with your thyroid gland, as it can sometimes cause fatigue and other symptoms. It's just a precaution. I'll write the orders for the lab tests now. The lab technician will draw a small amount of blood, and the results should be back within a few days. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results and plan the next steps. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and I would advise against eating any clay until we have the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Rest? Easy for you to say. Fine, no clay. But if I feel really bad, I’m eating it. Don't tell me what to do. Just get this over with, and let me go home. I got a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Hedy. I understand. Here’s the requisition form for the lab tests. You can take this to the lab at your convenience. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment. I’ll be here if you have any questions before then. Thank you for coming in today, Hedy. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
