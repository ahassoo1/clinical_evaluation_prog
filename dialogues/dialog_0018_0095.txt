DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day. It's my ear. Can't hear out of one side, and my face feels… droopy. It started yesterday morning, just woke up like that. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I appreciate you sharing that information. While I respect your time, it’s important to gather a bit more detail to ensure I can provide you with the best possible care. “Yesterday morning” is helpful, but could you describe the onset a little more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? Fine. I woke up, went to make tea, and when I called out to the housekeeper, she didn’t respond. I thought she was ignoring me, then I realized I couldn't hear out of my left ear. And the left side of my face… it just felt weak. Like when you try to smile and only half your mouth moves. Is that specific enough for you? I really don’t see what more there is to say. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: That is more specific, thank you. And it’s important information. The sudden onset you describe is concerning. Just to clarify – when you say “weak,” do you experience any difficulty closing your left eye completely?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, it doesn’t feel quite… shut. Like there’s a little gap. It's annoying, honestly. Makes my eye dry. I haven't been sleeping well either, could be that. I told you, I don’t have time for a long list of questions. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Ms. Nissenbaum, but your symptoms – the sudden hearing loss, facial weakness, and difficulty closing your eye – are quite suggestive of a condition called Bell’s Palsy. However, it's critical to rule out other possibilities. Before we proceed with a potential diagnosis, I need to ask a few more questions, and then I will need to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Bell’s… Palsy? Never heard of it. Look, I’m a radiologist, I read scans, I don’t need to be lectured on rare conditions. And “brief physical examination” sounds ominous. Are you going to poke me with needles? Because I really don't have the patience for that. I need to get back to work. My colleagues are relying on me. Just tell me if it's something serious and what I need to do, and let’s be done with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and apologize if I caused any alarm. Bell's Palsy is a condition affecting a nerve that controls facial muscles – it’s not inherently serious, but it does require evaluation and, often, treatment to prevent complications. And no, Ms. Nissenbaum, I will not be poking you with needles. The examination will involve a simple neurological assessment - checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. It’s a necessary step to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes. It will take only a few minutes. Before we proceed, may I quickly review your medical history in the EHR?
PATIENT: Fine. But if it takes more than five minutes, I’m leaving. And honestly, you shouldn’t need to “review my medical history.” If I had a history of anything significant, wouldn’t I have mentioned it? Radiologists are very observant. Just get on with it. And, for the record, I am not insured, so don’t try to sell me anything expensive.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Ms. Nissenbaum. I assure you, I simply want to have a complete picture of your health. According to the record, you have no prior significant medical history, no reported surgeries, and no listed allergies. Medications are also listed as none. It also indicates you’ve had a tetanus booster within the last ten years. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to examine your ears, test your facial muscle strength, and briefly assess your neurological function. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. And don’t expect me to hold still if it’s uncomfortable. I’ve dealt with difficult patients for years, I assure you. Now, what exactly are you going to do? I like to know these things beforehand.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, I will use this instrument, called an otoscope, to look inside your ears to assess the ear canal and eardrum. This doesn't usually cause any discomfort. Then, I'll ask you to perform a few simple tasks – such as closing your eyes tightly, raising your eyebrows, smiling, and puffing out your cheeks – so I can evaluate the strength of your facial muscles. I will also test your sensation on your face. If you experience any discomfort during any of these steps, please let me know immediately. May I begin with the ear examination?
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry. My housekeeper is expecting me back to oversee the afternoon cleaning. And if it involves touching my hair, you’ll have to be very gentle. I just had it styled. Get on with it, doctor. Honestly, the longer this takes, the more annoyed I’m going to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm examining your ears now. On the left side, the ear canal appears clear, but the eardrum is slightly…erythematous – meaning it appears a bit red and inflamed. There is also diminished light reflex. On the right side, the ear canal is clear, and the eardrum appears normal in color and reflects light appropriately. Now, I’d like to test the strength of your facial muscles. Could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It doesn’t close properly on that side, as you can clearly see. Honestly, this is all rather obvious. Don't you radiologists look for these things all the time? I’m wasting valuable time here. Get to the point, doctor. What does it mean? And how long will it take to fix it?
DOCTOR: You are correct, Ms. Nissenbaum, your left eye does not close completely. And your forehead movement is also somewhat diminished on that side when attempting to raise your eyebrows. Your smile appears slightly asymmetrical as well. Based on your symptoms – the sudden onset of hearing loss, the difficulty closing your left eye, and the weakness observed in your facial muscles – it is highly suggestive of Bell’s Palsy. However, to rule out other possibilities such as stroke or a tumor, an MRI would be ideal. Given your lack of insurance, an MRI may not be immediately feasible. In that case, we can proceed with symptomatic treatment and close monitoring. Do you have any questions about Bell’s Palsy before I explain the treatment options?
PATIENT: Treatment options? What are the treatment options? And what exactly is this “Bell’s Palsy”? Some sort of nerve issue? I’m a radiologist, not a neurologist. And if it's a nerve issue, why haven't I had any symptoms before? Honestly, this all sounds rather vague. And if you think I'm going to pay for an MRI out of pocket, you're sorely mistaken. Just tell me what I need to do to get back to work. Is it contagious? Will it spread? My colleagues are relying on me, you know. I can't just disappear for weeks.
DOCTOR: Of course. Bell’s Palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It's thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which controls facial muscles. It is not contagious and will not spread. The cause is often unknown, but it’s sometimes linked to viral infections. As for treatment, the most common approach is corticosteroids, like prednisone, to reduce inflammation. These are typically prescribed for five to ten days. I would also recommend eye drops and ointment to keep your left eye moist and prevent corneal damage, as it’s not closing completely. I can prescribe a course of corticosteroids and the eye drops and ointment. The cost should be relatively minimal. Regarding your concern about returning to work, most people with Bell’s Palsy experience significant improvement within a few weeks to months. However, complete recovery is not always guaranteed. It's important to monitor your symptoms closely and report any changes. Would you be amenable to a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress?
PATIENT: Fine. Corticosteroids and eye drops. As long as it doesn't interfere with my work. I can't afford to be laid up for weeks. And one week. I suppose I can schedule a follow-up appointment. But if I’m not feeling any better, I’m not wasting my time with further tests. Honestly, this whole situation is rather inconvenient. So, just to be clear, I take these pills, put drops in my eye, and see you again in a week? What are the side effects of these pills? I don’t want to gain weight. Radiologists need to maintain a certain image, you know. And if my vision gets worse, I’m blaming you. Is there anything else I need to know? Get it over with. Let’s write the prescription, and I can finally go home.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm prescribing prednisone, 60mg daily for five days, then 30mg daily for the next five days. The most common side effects include increased appetite and temporary fluid retention, but these are generally mild and resolve after you stop taking the medication. It's also important to avoid close contact with individuals who have active infections while taking corticosteroids. I’m also prescribing artificial tears and a lubricating ointment for your left eye, to be used frequently throughout the day and night. Here are your prescriptions. Please inform the pharmacy if you have any allergies or are currently taking any other medications. To recap: Take the prednisone as prescribed, use the eye drops and ointment frequently, and schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe pain, fever, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here today. Hopefully, these pills will do the trick. And if they don’t, I’ll just deal with it. Radiologists are resourceful people. Thank you. I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nissenbaum. I wish you a speedy recovery. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. .
