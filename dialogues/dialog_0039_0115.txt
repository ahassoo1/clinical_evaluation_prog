DOCTOR: Hello Annelle, welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… hello Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, I suppose. It’s become… yellow. Rather noticeable, my daughter tells me. She insisted I come. I don’t… I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been a few weeks, at least. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, yellow coloring… a few weeks. That’s good information to start with. It sounds like we're talking about jaundice, which can have a lot of causes. Now, when my daughter says "noticeable," can you describe where she noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. It was… everywhere, I think. Her eyes… yes, she said my eyes were very white, but… not in a good way. And my skin, of course. It’s hard to say precisely. I don’t… I don’t look at myself much anymore. Is that important? I apologize, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Annelle, don't apologize at all. It's very common. Yellowing of the eyes and skin... that does point us in a certain direction. Okay. And have you noticed any other changes along with this coloring?
PATIENT: Changes… well, I’ve been rather tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… my stomach hasn't been right. A little uncomfortable, mostly. Not… not pain, exactly. Just… off. And I've lost my appetite, I believe. My daughter has been bringing me soup. I don’t always finish it. Is that… is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, stomach discomfort, and loss of appetite along with the yellowing... And has there been any change in your bowel movements, Annelle?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh dear. That’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? Well… they’ve been… pale. Very pale, my daughter said. And… less frequent, I suppose. I… I don’t like talking about these things. Is that… is that relevant? I apologize. I didn’t mean to be… difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Annelle, you’re not being difficult at all. These things are personal, and it’s important for me to understand what's going on, so please, don’t hesitate to tell me anything that feels relevant. Pale bowel movements along with the other symptoms… Now, have you had any itching lately, anywhere on your body?
PATIENT: Itching… yes, now that you mention it, a little. Just a general… discomfort. Not… terrible. I put it down to the weather, mostly. It's been quite warm. But… yes, I suppose I have been a bit itchy. Is that… significant? I truly am sorry if I'm not being very helpful. It feels as though my head is in a cloud.
DOCTOR: No, you're being very helpful, Annelle. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An exam… yes, I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… and if it’s not… unpleasant? I haven’t had a proper exam in years. Please, be gentle. I am… a bit frail.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… very good. Now I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any particular spot that is tender or uncomfortable when I press?
PATIENT: Ooh… there. Yes, a little tender right… there. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Just… right under my ribs, on the right side. And… perhaps a little bit here too. Please be careful. It's...sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the upper right abdomen… I'm also noticing some mild swelling in your abdomen, Annelle. And as we discussed, your skin does appear somewhat yellowed, and your eyes have a yellowish tint to them as well. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… startling. It’s been a long time since anyone’s done that. Are you finding something… wrong, Doctor? I can feel my heart racing a bit now. Is it something serious? I… I would like to know. I don’t like being kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle, take a deep breath. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not necessarily alarming in someone your age. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam, the yellowing of your skin and eyes, the tenderness in your abdomen, the fatigue, loss of appetite, pale bowel movements, and the diminished reflexes... it points towards a problem with your liver or gallbladder. We need to do some blood tests to get a clearer picture. It could be something relatively minor, like a gallstone blocking your bile duct, or it could be something more serious. We don't know yet, and that's what the tests will help us determine. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests… blood tests. Oh dear. I… I don’t like needles. But… yes. Yes, if it will tell us what’s wrong. I want to know. I just… I don’t want anything… drastic. And please, be quick. And gentle. I… I don’t know if I can handle much more right now. I really would appreciate it if you could hurry. Is it possible to get the results quickly?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. I understand your anxiety, and we will do everything to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it should be over before you know it. I'll also ask them to be as gentle as possible. These tests will give us a good starting point. The results usually come back within a few hours. While we're waiting, is there anyone I can call for you?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That is very kind of you. My daughter, perhaps? Her name is… Layla. Yes, call Layla. She worries about me. I… I think I’ll just sit here for a moment. It’s been a long morning. And… perhaps a glass of water would be nice, if that's not too much trouble? .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. I'll have Layla paged right away and a nurse will bring you a glass of water.
