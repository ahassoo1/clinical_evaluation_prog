DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I don't have all day. Just…tired. Real tired. And…I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. It’s stupid, I know. My husband… he always said it was a bad habit. But he’s gone now, so what do I know? Just… help me with the tired part. It’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: "Dirt," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, dirt. Clay, mostly. Red clay. Don't look at me like that, it just…feels good in my mouth. And I know it’s weird! But I can't seem to stop. It started small, just a little bit when I was gardening, but now… now I find myself thinking about it all the time. It doesn't make me sick, exactly, but I feel…weak. And tired. Is that all you need to know, or do you want a whole life story?
DOCTOR: No, no life story... yet. But this craving… how long has it been happening, consistently?
PATIENT: Consistently…? Oh, goodness. Honestly? I don’t keep track of things like that anymore. Maybe… a few months? After… well, after everything. It comes and goes, but lately it’s been bad. Like, I wake up thinking about it. I try not to, but… it’s there. Is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few months. I'm accessing your records now… Hedy Cantoran, age 57. Okay. This craving for dirt, this is what we call pica. It can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. And the fatigue… that’s certainly concerning. We're going to need to do some blood work to check your iron levels, your zinc, and a few other things. It’s a standard set of tests. Do you have any allergies to anything I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I used to get hives as a kid, but that was ages ago. And I don’t take any… medicines. Except for that cough syrup when I get a cold, but that's it. Blood work? Fine. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And please, don’t ask me about the dirt again. It’s embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Very well. No further questions about the…clay. Let’s proceed with the blood work. I'll need to draw a few vials. It will take about ten minutes, and then we’ll send them to the lab. We should have results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’d like to do a basic physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… routine stuff. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. My blood pressure is probably high, honestly. Worrying about dirt and being tired all the time will do that to a person. And just hurry, okay? I have a garden to tend to, you know. Though…it's getting harder and harder to even do that these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit here, arm relaxed. Rural clinic... sometimes you get the strangest cases. 140 over 90. A little elevated, as you suspected. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Lungs are clear, heartbeat is regular, but a bit fast. Any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No! Don't poke so much! It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it's annoying. Look, I’m a strong woman, always have been. Worked hard my whole life. I don’t need you poking around. Just tell me what's wrong, if anything, and let me go. Is it the dirt? Is that what this is about? Honestly, I just want a pill to make me less tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I'm just trying to rule things out. It's standard procedure. Abdomen feels…slightly tender, but nothing alarming. The fatigue could be related to many things—stress, diet, a vitamin deficiency, or something else entirely. It's unlikely the dirt is the primary cause, but it's certainly not helping. We’ll need those blood tests to be certain. While we wait for those results, let’s talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Honestly? It’s not great. I don’t have much appetite these days. Mostly toast in the morning. Maybe a sandwich for lunch, if I remember. And sometimes…soup for dinner. My husband used to cook, you know. Real proper meals. But that was…a long time ago. I don't bother much anymore. It’s just me now. And I eat the dirt when I’m… feeling low. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It counts. So, predominantly carbohydrates—toast, sandwich—limited protein and vegetables. And infrequent, perhaps inadequate, nutritional intake. That, combined with the pica…it's not surprising you're feeling fatigued. You mentioned your husband used to cook. Have you experienced any significant life changes or losses recently, aside from your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: Significant? Significant? He died, Doc! What’s more significant than that?! It’s been…a few years now, but it doesn't get easier, you know? I try not to dwell on it, but… everything reminds me of him. The garden…the kitchen…everything. And now I'm tired all the time, and I crave dirt, and nobody understands. Is that what you wanted to hear?
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss is…difficult. And it can manifest in unexpected ways. Your fatigue, combined with the pica, could be related to underlying depression or nutritional deficiencies stemming from changes in your eating habits following your husband's passing. We need to rule out any medical causes first, which is why those blood tests are crucial. In the meantime, I'm going to order a vitamin D supplement, and I'll write you a referral to a counselor. It’s okay to seek help, Ms. Cantoran. We'll take this one step at a time. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Counselor? Oh, goodness no. I don’t need someone telling me how to feel. I’m a strong woman, remember? I just need a pill. Something to give me energy. Is that too much to ask? And don't bother with the vitamins either. I just want to know if there's something wrong with me. Something physical. Because if it’s just…in my head, I don’t want to hear it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I can't offer a definitive answer without the blood test results. Dismissing potential emotional contributors before completing a thorough medical evaluation is…unwise. However, given your history, fatigue, and atypical dietary habits, I suspect a combination of factors may be at play. I am ordering the bloodwork and will contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, I strongly recommend reconsidering the counseling referral. I'm prescribing a low-dose iron supplement, but it is unlikely to resolve the issue completely without addressing the underlying causes. Here are the lab orders and the prescription. Do you have any questions about those?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just…let me go. I have things to do. I don't need lectures, I just need energy. And don't call me again unless there's a pill. A real pill. That's all. Here.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cantoran. I'll contact you with the results. I'd appreciate it if you would consider the counseling referral, but ultimately the decision is yours. If the fatigue worsens significantly or you experience any new symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Have a good day. .
