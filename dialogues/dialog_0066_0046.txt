DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having… well, a lot of pressure in my bladder. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to become quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. That sounds uncomfortable. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. It’s… a constant feeling, really. Like I always need to go, even when I just went. And sometimes, when I do go, it doesn’t feel like everything comes out, if that makes sense? It’s not painful, exactly, just… incomplete and unsettling. It’s been happening consistently for about three weeks, I would say.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, okay. And you said it feels incomplete… is that happening with every urination, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: It's not every time, thankfully. Maybe… three or four times a day, I’d estimate. The rest of the time it feels normal, or at least as normal as it usually does. It’s just… unpredictable. Some days it’s worse than others, and it makes me a little anxious, to be honest, about being far from a restroom.
DOCTOR: I understand. That anxiety is definitely valid. Okay, so constant pressure, feeling of incomplete emptying several times a day, lasting about three weeks… Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t had any pain, like you asked before. No fever, no blood in my urine, nothing like that. I have been feeling a little more tired lately, but I attributed that to work, honestly. I’ve been working quite a lot on a new design project. I suppose I could be drinking more water, now that you mention it, I haven't been prioritizing that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, fever, or blood in the urine, increased fatigue, and possibly not enough water intake. Good to know. Now, let's talk a bit more about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, just in case, but I haven’t really needed to use it much. My husband and I are both pretty active, we try to eat well… I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No surgeries or anything like that. I am married, and I don’t smoke or drink alcohol.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. No significant medical history, no surgeries, healthy lifestyle. And you're married, non-smoker, non-drinker. Do you have any family history of medical conditions – anything like bladder problems, kidney issues, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had a few urinary tract infections when she was younger, I remember her mentioning that, but nothing serious. My father was generally very healthy, no real issues to speak of. And my siblings are both healthy as well, to my knowledge. No one has ever been diagnosed with kidney problems, or anything specifically related to the bladder. I do know my grandmother on my father’s side had diabetes, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of UTIs in your mother, otherwise a generally healthy family. Diabetes in your grandmother. That's helpful to know. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking any medications at all. Not even vitamins, usually. I try to get everything I need from my diet. Occasionally I’ll take something for a headache, like ibuprofen, but that’s very infrequent. Nothing regular, I promise. Just the occasional pain reliever.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It'll just involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick external examination. Nothing invasive, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything beforehand. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, and I want to figure out what’s causing this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to the touch. Bowel sounds are normal. External pelvic exam… no palpable masses. I'm not feeling anything immediately concerning. Let's get a urine sample to rule out infection and check for other potential issues. I'll give you a cup, and just try to collect a mid-stream sample – meaning, start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds straightforward enough. Mid-stream sample, I understand. I think I can manage that without any problems. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. Where should I leave the sample when I’m done?
DOCTOR: Great. There's a little counter over there by the sink. Just leave it there, and I'll send it off to the lab. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, let's try to increase your water intake – aim for at least eight glasses a day. And I'll also ask you to keep a bladder diary for the next three days. Just write down when you urinate, how much you drink, and how you feel each time. That’ll give us some more information to work with when the lab results come back. Does that sound doable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Eight glasses of water, and a bladder diary. I can definitely do that. It sounds like a good plan, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. I’m hoping we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. For now, avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Also, try to avoid holding your urine for too long – try to go when you feel the urge. Other than that, just continue with your normal activities. While we wait for the results, a few possibilities could be contributing to your symptoms. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, even though you don't have a fever or blood in your urine. Sometimes they can present with subtle symptoms. It could also be overactive bladder, or simply a sensitivity of the bladder. Less commonly, it could be something else, which is why we're doing the tests. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, no caffeine or alcohol, and don’t hold it. That makes sense. And I understand about the possibilities, Doctor – it’s good to know you’re considering everything. I think I’m alright for now, actually. You’ve answered all my questions, and I feel much more reassured knowing we’re taking a systematic approach. I’ll be sure to start the bladder diary and increase my water intake. Thank you very much for your time and your thoroughness. I’ll wait to hear back from you regarding the lab results. Is there a particular way you prefer I contact you if I have any urgent concerns before then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could reassure you. The clinic number is 555-1212, and you can ask to speak to the nurse, who will get a message to me. If it's a true emergency – severe pain, high fever, inability to urinate – please go to the nearest emergency room. Otherwise, we’ll touch base once the lab results are back in a couple of days. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll make a note in your chart to follow up with you then. Have a good day, Marialena. And try to stay hydrated!
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. I will. You have a good day as well. And thank you again for everything.
