DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sachar. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, I received a letter about…home health services, I think? And something about being checked to see if I qualify for hospice. To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what it all means, but I wanted to find out more.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's… understandable. It can be confusing. Let me pull up your information here… Alright, Calin Sachar, age 28. The referral indicates some concerns about your overall health, and they wanted to do a comprehensive assessment. Before we get into that, can you tell me a little bit about why you think you're healthy, or why you're not feeling well?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s a bit of a long story. Things haven't been easy lately. I work as a presser, you know, in a garment factory. It’s… physically demanding work, and I've been feeling more tired than usual. And my back… it’s been giving me trouble for months now. It just… aches all the time. I’ve been trying to manage it, but it’s getting harder. I also… well, I got divorced recently, so that’s been stressful too. I suppose that adds to everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is a lot to deal with – the physical demands of your job, chronic back pain, and a recent divorce. It's no wonder you're feeling tired. Let's focus on the back pain first. How long exactly has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about six or seven months ago? It was just a little ache at first, you know? I thought it would go away with some rest. But it just kept getting worse. Now, it's pretty much constant. Some days are better than others, but it’s always there, even when I’m just sitting. It shoots down my leg sometimes too, that’s new.
DOCTOR: Okay, shooting pain down your leg is important to know. And when you say “worse,” can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well… it's hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like… a deep, burning ache. And it makes it hard to move. Like, bending over is really difficult, and sometimes I struggle to even stand up straight. It feels…stiff, you know? And when I've been sitting for a while, getting up is the worst part. It’s like my back is locked up. I’ve been trying to take over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don’t seem to help much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Burning pain, stiffness, difficulty bending and standing, and limited relief with over-the-counter medications. That gives us a better picture. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Honestly, not much really helps. Lying down sometimes takes the edge off, but I can’t just lie down all day, can I? And… warm baths feel good for a little while, but the relief doesn’t last. I've tried stretching a few times, but it usually makes it worse. I’m not sure I’m doing it right, though. I haven’t really been to a doctor about it before. I just hoped it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, limited relief with rest and warm baths, and stretching doesn’t seem to help. No prior medical attention for this. Okay. Now, let’s back up a bit. Aside from the back pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… well, yes, actually. I have been feeling very tired all the time, like I said. But also… I've been losing weight without trying. Not a lot, but I’ve noticed my clothes are a little looser than they used to be. And… sometimes I get short of breath, even when I’m just walking around. I just thought it was because I was out of shape, but now that I think about it… it’s been happening more and more. I haven't been eating much, either. Everything just feels… tasteless.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sachar. That’s… a significant amount of information. Weight loss, shortness of breath, and loss of appetite, along with the fatigue and back pain. I’m going to need to do a physical exam. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please. I just want to know what's going on. I'm a little worried now, to be honest. I’m happy to do whatever you need to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. If you’ll just follow me. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and range of motion, and of course, I’ll carefully examine your back. Please let me know if anything feels painful during the exam.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sachar. Your blood pressure is a little low, and your heart rate is slightly elevated. Your lungs sound clear, but I do detect some tenderness along your spine, particularly in the lower back. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is generally good, but you do experience some discomfort when I ask you to bend forward. I also noticed some mild swelling in your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. We need to rule out some more serious conditions.
PATIENT: Oh… that doesn’t sound good. What kind of conditions, Doctor? I’m a little scared now. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's important not to jump to conclusions, Ms. Sachar. It could be something relatively minor, but given the combination of symptoms – the back pain, weight loss, fatigue, shortness of breath, and ankle swelling – we need to investigate further. I want to order some blood tests to check for inflammation, anemia, and kidney function. I also want to get a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems, and possibly a CT scan of your spine to get a better look at the vertebrae. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. Those tests… will they tell us what’s wrong? I just want to know what’s going on and what we can do about it. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. The blood tests should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The X-ray results are usually available within a few hours, but the CT scan might take a day or two to schedule and interpret. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes. And… no, I don’t think I’ve ever had contrast dye before. Avoiding strenuous activity… that’s going to be hard. My job is pretty physical. But I will try.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. I'll write you a note for work explaining that you need to limit your physical activity. Here's the requisition for the blood tests and the X-ray. You can take this to the lab and radiology department at [Clinic address]. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for us next week, just to review the results and discuss a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what's going on. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sachar. It's my job. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or a high fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you next week. Here's the number for the clinic if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, and try to rest.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor, I will. Thank you again. Have a good day too.
