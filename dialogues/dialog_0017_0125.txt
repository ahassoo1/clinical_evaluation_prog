DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I am Dr. Blim. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well, my wife thought it would be… sensible. She wants me to get checked for, uh, HIV. I don’t really see the point, honestly, but she worries. She’s a good woman.
DOCTOR: Sensible, you say. While I appreciate a concerned spouse, we don't operate on conjecture, Mr. Belan. May I ask what specifically is causing her concern?
PATIENT: Concern? Well, she just… reads things. Online, mostly. About… people. And risks. She saw something about… well, I travelled a bit for work last year. Different cities, you know? Mostly just hotels, though. Business hotels. Perfectly respectable. But she keeps going on about it. Honestly, I think she watches too much television.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly respectable” hotels do not preclude risk, Mr. Belan. While I understand your… skepticism, we must approach this methodically. Have you had any… intimate contact with anyone other than your wife?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? And frankly, quite insulting. I’m happily married. She's right here in the waiting room. I'm here because she wanted me to be, not because I have some… questionable lifestyle. I think we can skip the interrogation, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, my questions are not intended as an interrogation, but as a necessary part of a thorough medical evaluation. We are establishing risk factors, nothing more. However, if you are unwilling to provide a complete history, it makes an accurate assessment… difficult, shall we say. We can certainly note "patient uncooperative with history taking" in the chart, but it won't be particularly helpful. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Look, I understand you have a job to do. But I find this line of questioning… unnecessary and, frankly, a little rude. I told you, my wife is worried. That's why I’m here. I'm a law-abiding citizen. I have a respectable job. I don't need to be treated like… like this. Just get on with the test, alright? I’ll humour her, but I’m not going to sit here and be questioned like a criminal.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the blood draw for the HIV antibody test. However, I must document your refusal to provide a comprehensive medical history. It’s crucial for proper interpretation of results. And understand, a negative test today does not necessarily preclude future risk if certain behaviors continue. Now, if you’ll please roll up your sleeve. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, the bureaucracy of this is ridiculous. My time is valuable, you know. And tell your nurse to be gentle. I don't appreciate needles.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Mr. Belan. Nurse Patel is quite proficient. This will only take a moment. And while we are at it, I'll order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It’s standard practice. We should have results within three to five business days. Now, hold still.
PATIENT: Three to five business days? Really? Can’t you just… speed things up a bit? My wife will be wanting to know the moment I step out of here. It’s always something with her, always wanting things now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, laboratory processing times are dictated by established protocols and quality control measures, not by personal preference. I can assure you, we will expedite the results as much as possible. But rushing the process compromises accuracy, and that is simply unacceptable. I suggest you manage your wife’s expectations. Now, if there is nothing further, you are free to go. The results will be sent to your primary care physician, and a copy will be available through the patient portal. Good day.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. Honestly, the whole thing is a waste of time. Tell her to stop reading those websites, alright? That's all I ask. Good day to you, Doctor.
