DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It's… well, my chest. It’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels… tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. I understand that's concerning. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… it started maybe a week ago? A little more than a week. It doesn’t hurt when I’m resting, usually. But if I walk… even just up the stairs, it gets worse. And… and sometimes when I'm doing things around the house, bending over… it feels funny. Not exactly pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a heavy weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s related to exertion – walking, stairs, bending over. And it’s been happening for a little over a week. Does the pain radiate anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. My left arm, a little bit. Not bad, just… a dull ache. And… now that I think about it, maybe my jaw too? It’s hard to say for sure. It's just… everything feels a bit off when my chest hurts. It doesn’t go all the way down my arm, it’s more… in my shoulder, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating to the left shoulder and potentially the jaw – and it’s a dull ache rather than a sharp pain. How would you rate the pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever experienced?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. When it's really bad… maybe a 6? Not awful, like a broken bone awful, but enough to make me stop what I'm doing. Most of the time it’s more like a 3 or 4. Just… uncomfortable and worrying. It makes me feel scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion. A 6 is significant enough that we need to investigate this. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the chest pain?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I get a little short of breath when I'm walking and the chest hurts. Not really bad, but I have to stop and catch my breath. And… I’ve been feeling a little tired lately, more tired than usual. Just… worn out. Maybe that’s just getting old, though!
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion and increased fatigue. We’ll take all of that into consideration. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me about five years ago. I take a pill every morning for it. And… my husband says my cholesterol is a little high, but I haven’t really been to the doctor much since the blood pressure. Other than that, I think I’m pretty healthy. I try to eat good, you know? Lots of fruits and vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication. And elevated cholesterol that hasn't been formally addressed recently. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… I have it at home in a little pill box. It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. I take one every morning with my breakfast. And I haven’t missed a dose, I try to be very good about it. My husband helps me remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, one pill daily. Excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Maybe 20 years ago? And… when I broke my wrist a few years back, I had to stay in the hospital for a couple of days. But that was just for the wrist, nothing serious. Other than that… no, I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about 20 years ago and hospitalization for a broken wrist. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, I have to take the Lisinopril, but no bad reactions to anything, thank goodness. My husband is allergic to peanuts, but not me!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, a few questions about your family history. Does anyone in your family have a history of heart disease, stroke, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. And my brother, he had a stroke a few years back. So, yes, it runs in the family, I think. It worries me a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure. That's important information. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never smoked a day in my life! And… a little bit of wine sometimes, with dinner. Maybe a glass or two, a couple of times a week. No drugs, never have. I like my little bit of wine, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drugs. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Sherion. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your overall health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on with my chest. It’s been making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150 over 90. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. I hear slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs, and a regular heart rhythm with no murmurs. Your heart sounds are normal, but I am noting the diminished breath sounds. I'm also going to palpate your chest to check for any tenderness. There is no acute tenderness. Now, I'd like to order an EKG and a chest x-ray to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An EKG and a chest x-ray… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to know what’s wrong. Will it be painful? And… how long will it take? I have to go home and make dinner for my husband, you know.
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. The chest x-ray is also painless, but you will need to stand or sit still for a short moment while the technician takes the picture. It will only take a few minutes as well. The technician will be in shortly to perform those tests. Once the results are back, I'll review them and discuss them with you. It might take about an hour or two for the results to be available. In the meantime, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better look at your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. An hour or two, okay. I can wait. And… the blood tests too. That’s a lot, but… if it helps, I’m happy to do it. Just… let me know what you find, Doctor. I’m a little scared, you know? It’s just… my father…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion, especially with your family history. It’s good that you’re being proactive about this. I’ll explain everything to you clearly once I have the results. Okay, I've ordered the EKG, chest x-ray, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel. The technician will be in shortly to start the tests. While we wait, is there anything else you'd like to tell me, or any questions you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you listening to me. It’s just… it’s been on my mind a lot. And I worry about my husband, you know. He gets worried when I'm not feeling well.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. It’s my job to listen and help you get to the bottom of this. And I understand your concern for your husband – it's natural to want to take care of those we love. The technician should be in shortly. I'll be right with you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please try to relax. Is there anything I can get for you before I step out to allow the technician to come in?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I’m alright for now. Just… I’ll wait here. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll be right back with you as soon as the results are available.
