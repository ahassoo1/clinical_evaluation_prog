DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I requested a general wellness lab panel, if you recall. Just wanted to get a good look at how things are holding up, you understand. At my age, one likes to be... proactive.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do recall, Mr. Mombrun. A good idea to be proactive, absolutely. And thank you for choosing our clinic. Before we get to the lab panel itself, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I’m seventy-four years young, as you know. I’ve been a construction laborer most of my life – still am, though I take it a bit easier now, naturally. My wife, Elena, and I have been married for fifty years this coming November. We’ve been very fortunate. I’ve always been a fairly active man, though the knees aren’t what they used to be. I have private insurance, thankfully. And I’d say, generally speaking, I feel quite good. No major complaints, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. Fifty years is a beautiful milestone – congratulations to you and Elena! And it's good you're still active. Now, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Fifty years is a blessing. As for illnesses… let me see. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was perhaps thirty, but recovered fully. And I broke my collarbone when I was a young man, working on a job site. Elena insisted I see a specialist in Caracas, which was a good thing. No other surgeries, no. Nothing chronic, like diabetes or heart trouble. Just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia and a broken collarbone, no chronic conditions. And no major surgeries. That’s good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family. A good question, Doctor. My mother lived a long life, into her nineties. She passed away peacefully in Venezuela. My father, sadly, died much younger, from complications after a construction accident. He was a hard worker, like myself. I have two daughters, both married with children of their own. They live in Maracaibo, so I don’t see them as often as I’d like, but we speak regularly on the phone. They are both healthy, thankfully. No major family history of illness that I’m aware of, though my aunt on my mother's side had some trouble with her blood pressure in her later years.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had any reactions to any medications, and Elena is a wonderful cook, so I’ve tried a good many foods in my lifetime. No issues with pollen, animals, nothing like that. I’ve always been fairly robust in that regard. I’ve even handled some rather… exotic fruits during my travels, and no trouble there either.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at the moment. I take a multivitamin, of course, just to keep things topped up. And occasionally, I’ll take an ibuprofen for a sore muscle or a headache. But nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I prefer to avoid medications if I can, if you understand. Elena makes a lovely chamomile tea that usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Mombrun. That's a sensible approach. Now, before we proceed with the lab panel, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam is always a good idea. I have no objections whatsoever. I trust your judgment entirely. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'm not in any particular hurry.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just step over here and lie down, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then we’ll listen to your lungs and do a quick check of your reflexes. First, let's take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here you are. Please, don't hesitate to tell me if I need to adjust my position. I’m quite comfortable, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart rate is 72, regular. Lungs sound clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are 2+ throughout, normal. Good strength in all extremities. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Mr. Mombrun. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: That’s reassuring to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you taking your time. My heart… well, it’s beaten a good many times in my life, I suppose. Go ahead, Doctor. Let me know if you hear anything unusual. I trust your ear.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs auscultated. Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Everything sounds good. Based on the physical exam, you appear to be in good overall health. Now, we’ll just need a blood sample for the lab panel. It’s a standard wellness check – cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, liver function, complete blood count, and a few other things. It will give us a more detailed picture of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. A blood sample is no trouble at all. I’ve had plenty taken over the years. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do, like relax my arm or anything. I’m ready when you are. I understand it’s all part of being thorough, and I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax your arm completely. We'll use a standard venipuncture technique. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just a little pinch now… Alright, that’s all done. Please keep pressure on this gauze pad for a few minutes to prevent bruising. Now, the lab results usually take about three to five business days to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That was hardly a pinch at all, really. Three to five business days is fine. I have no major questions at the moment. Perhaps just… what would you be particularly looking for in these results, given my age and my profession? I don’t want to be overly anxious, but it’s good to know what to anticipate, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Mombrun. Given your age, we’re particularly interested in your cholesterol levels – to assess your risk of heart disease. We’ll also look at your blood sugar to screen for diabetes. Kidney function is important as we age, and we’ll check that as well. And, of course, the complete blood count will give us a picture of your overall health and rule out any signs of infection or anemia. Given your history as a construction laborer, we’ll also pay attention to any signs of inflammation or wear and tear on your body. But remember, these are just routine checks. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything to worry about. We’re just being proactive, as you said. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. Cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, inflammation… all very sensible things to look at, given the circumstances. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. And you're right, being proactive is the key. It’s better to know, as they say. I believe that’s all my questions for the moment. When would be a good time to schedule that follow-up appointment? Perhaps next week?
DOCTOR: Next week works perfectly. How about Tuesday at 2:00 PM?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM sounds excellent, Doctor. Please consider that confirmed. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with my many questions. You’ve put my mind at ease. .
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Mr. Mombrun. I’m glad I could help. Remember to keep that gauze pad on for a little while longer to prevent any bruising. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.
