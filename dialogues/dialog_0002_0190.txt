DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, truthfully, I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet. It’s been… concerning. I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. It just feels as if I might fall, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling unsteady is definitely concerning. Let's try to get a better idea of what's going on. You said you don't recall exactly when it started – roughly, would you say it’s been days, weeks, or months?
PATIENT: Months, I believe. Yes… months. Though it’s difficult to be certain. Time… slips away. It feels as if it's been a good few months, at least. Perhaps six? I truly cannot say with any degree of accuracy, I'm afraid. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That's okay, six months gives us a starting point. And it’s perfectly normal to not remember exact dates. Now, can you describe what this unsteadiness feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… not a dizziness, precisely. More like… my feet don't feel firmly connected to the ground. As though I'm walking on a ship, perhaps? A gentle rocking, even when I’m standing still. It comes and goes. And… sometimes it’s worse than others. It hasn’t caused a fall yet, but it frightens me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful – feeling like you're on a ship is a good way to describe it. And it’s good that you haven’t fallen yet, but definitely concerning that you're feeling unsteady. Does anything specific seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. I work… out in the oil fields, as a drill operator. It's… demanding work. Perhaps when I’m very tired? Or after a long shift? But even on my days off, it occurs sometimes. I don't believe there's a clear pattern. Oh… and standing for long periods, I think. That tends to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be aggravated by fatigue and prolonged standing, and it happens even on your days off. That gives us some clues. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: My vision… now that you mention it… perhaps a little blurry, occasionally? It’s not significant. I attributed it to… strain, from looking at screens and equipment all day. I haven’t really paid it much attention, to be truthful. I suppose I should have. Is blurry vision… a concern, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. It’s good you mentioned it. And any ringing in your ears, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, no ringing. And my ears feel… normal, I think. No fullness, no pain. Nothing of that nature. Just… the unsteadiness and, occasionally, a little blurriness in my vision. It’s a strange combination, isn't it? It’s making me anxious, to be quite honest. I lost my husband a year ago, and I’m trying to manage everything on my own.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. That must be incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that you're feeling anxious. We'll get to the bottom of what's going on. Just trying to gather as much information as possible. Have you noticed any headaches along with the unsteadiness and blurry vision?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you ask… a dull ache, at the back of my head. It comes and goes, like the other symptoms. Not severe, but… persistent. It’s easily dismissed, I suppose, as stress. But… perhaps it is related? It tends to be worse after a long shift, I think. Similar to the blurry vision and the unsteadiness.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A dull headache, worse after a long shift, along with the unsteadiness, blurry vision, and fatigue. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... I believe I was told my blood pressure was slightly elevated, a few years ago, during a routine checkup. But nothing significant, Doctor. No diabetes, no… major illnesses. I've always been relatively healthy, despite the demanding nature of my work. I did have a rather nasty fall as a child, broke my arm, but that was… a long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, and a broken arm as a child. The broken arm isn’t likely relevant now, but the blood pressure is good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any, thankfully. Just the usual… vaccinations, as a child. No operations, no… anything of that nature. I always avoid hospitals if I can, to be honest. They… aren’t my favorite place. Does that… make things more difficult? I suppose I should have kept better records.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t make things more difficult. It’s perfectly okay not to have had surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I believe. Not diagnosed, exactly, but she suffered from chest pains and shortness of breath. And my grandfather… he had a stroke, many years ago. Beyond that… I don't believe so. My family… wasn’t particularly forthcoming with medical details, if I’m honest. They weren’t ones for discussing such things. Is that… helpful, Doctor? It feels as though I'm not providing very useful information.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother and a stroke in your grandfather. That is helpful. It gives us some potential areas to look into. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke. I rarely drink alcohol—perhaps a glass of wine at a special occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. My work demands clarity and focus. And frankly, I have no interest in such things. It’s always been about… responsibility, and taking care of myself. Is that… sufficient, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, to my knowledge. No food allergies, either. I’m generally… quite resilient, I believe. Though… I do get a bit of a rash sometimes, if I use a certain brand of soap. But that's more of an irritation, than an actual allergy. Is that… all the questions, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed, if I’m honest. It's a lot to recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a skin irritation with a certain soap. And you're right, that is a lot to recall, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s alright. Though… please be gentle. I haven’t been feeling very steady on my feet, as you know. I just want to understand what’s happening, and… hopefully find a solution. I trust your judgement, Doctor. But… please, go easy on me. It makes me a little nervous, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/90. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Pulses are a little weak. Now, I’m going to check your ears, nose, and throat. Ears look normal. Throat is clear. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can… though it’s a little difficult to be perfectly steady. It feels as though my eyes are… drifting, slightly. I’m trying my best, Doctor. Is that… acceptable? I just want to cooperate, and find out what’s going on. It’s unnerving, to feel so… unstable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. A little bit of nystagmus – involuntary eye movements. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Though… it’s not as strong as it normally is, I believe. My grip feels… a little shaky. And my hands… they’re starting to feel a bit numb, actually. Just a slight tingling sensation, but it’s definitely there. Is that… normal, Doctor? It’s worrying me, to be honest. It feels as though something is… amiss.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that as well. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished. And finally, I'm going to have you walk a few steps for me. Your gait is a little unsteady, and you have a slightly wide-based stance. Okay, thank you for that. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam – the elevated blood pressure, murmur, diminished reflexes, unsteady gait, nystagmus, and reduced grip strength – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be related to your blood pressure, but the other findings suggest something more going on. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing. Would you be willing to get some blood work and an MRI of your brain?
PATIENT: An MRI…? Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious. And blood work… well, I suppose that’s relatively straightforward. But an MRI… Is it… painful, Doctor? And what exactly are you looking for? I must confess, I’m terribly frightened. What’s the worst-case scenario? I lost my husband last year, and I’m quite alone. I just want to understand what’s happening, and… find a way to get better. But an MRI… It sounds so… daunting. Perhaps there's another way? I just… need a little reassurance, Doctor. It’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely. An MRI is non-invasive, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It is not painful, though some people find it uncomfortable to lie still for an extended period of time, and it can be quite loud. You will be able to communicate with the technician during the scan. We're looking for any signs of stroke, tumors, or other neurological issues that could be causing your symptoms. It's important to rule these things out, especially given your family history and the findings from the exam. I want to be upfront – the worst-case scenario would be a significant neurological issue requiring intervention, but that is not what I expect. The vast majority of the time, we find something manageable, or rule out anything serious altogether. We can start with the blood work, which will give us more information about your overall health and rule out other potential causes. If the blood work is concerning, or doesn't provide enough answers, we can then discuss the MRI in more detail. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds… reasonable. Blood work first. That’s… less frightening. And… I suppose I trust your judgement, Doctor. If you believe it’s necessary, I will… comply. Just please, keep me informed. I don’t like surprises. And… if anything is found, please… be gentle. I’m not a strong woman, Doctor. I’ve been through a great deal, lately. Thank you for… explaining everything so clearly. It helps, a little. Just… please, take care of me.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will absolutely keep you informed every step of the way, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. You are strong, Lilyanna. It takes strength to come in and seek help, and to share your concerns with me. I’m going to write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. These tests will give us a good baseline of your health. I'll also write you a referral for an MRI, but we don't have to schedule that right away. Let's see what the blood work tells us first. The lab is just down the hall. They will draw your blood, and the results should be available in a few days. I will call you as soon as they are in. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity, and please let someone know if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Just… thank you. For your patience, and your kindness. And… please, remember to call me. I’m quite alone, and… I rely on your guidance. I suppose I will just… go and get the blood work done. Thank you again, Doctor Ranjan. I… appreciate your help more than words can say.
