DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello. Yes, well, honestly? I just want to make sure everything down there is still good. You know, I’m… not getting any younger. And I’d like to, well, have a baby if that’s possible. Before it’s too late. My husband… he’s gone now, but I always wanted more than one. Is that… can you check that? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. That’s a very reasonable concern, and a good reason to come in. We can definitely assess your reproductive health and see what’s going on. It’s good you're thinking about this. To start, could you tell me a little more about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Honestly? They're just… there. They come and go. I don't really keep track. It’s not like I need to anymore, is it? They're… regular-ish, I suppose. Not like clockwork, but not wildly off. Look, I’m not one for details. Is that good enough? I just… I don't want to struggle, you know? I don't want any… problems.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Carmaleta. “Regular-ish” is a good starting point. We can work with that. And it’s completely understandable not wanting to struggle. Just to clarify, when was your last menstrual period?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you are asking for details! Um… honestly, I have no idea. A few weeks ago? Maybe a month? It all blurs together, honestly. I really don't keep track of those things. Why does it even matter? Is something wrong? See, this is what I was afraid of.
DOCTOR: It's okay, no need to worry! It matters because knowing your last period helps us estimate where you are in your cycle, and that helps us decide what tests, if any, might be useful. It doesn’t automatically mean something is wrong. Okay. Let's try a different approach. Have you noticed any changes in your cycles recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… now that you mention it, I think they’ve been a little… lighter. Maybe? I don’t know. It’s hard to say. Like I said, I don’t pay attention. And… they seem to come a bit further apart, maybe? Honestly, I’m not sure. I just want a baby, and I don't want to be running around to a million specialists if I can avoid it. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to get a clear picture without a lot of unnecessary fuss. Lighter periods and cycles further apart can be normal variations, but it’s good you noticed them, and it’s definitely worth investigating, especially since you’re thinking about trying to conceive. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve a general check-up and a pelvic exam. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A… a pelvic exam? Oh, goodness. Is that really necessary? I mean, I’m not sick. I just want to know if everything is still… working. Couldn’t you just, I don’t know, take some blood? I hate those exams. They’re just… invasive. And frankly, a bit embarrassing. I really don't like the idea of that at all. Can’t we start with the blood tests? Please?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask, and I completely understand your hesitation, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel uncomfortable with a pelvic exam, and we can definitely start with blood tests. They can give us a lot of information about your hormone levels and overall health. We can check your FSH, LH, estrogen, and AMH levels, which will give us a good starting point in assessing your ovarian reserve. We can also check a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to ensure you’re generally healthy. Would that feel more comfortable to you as a first step?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Blood tests are fine. As long as you’re not poking around… You know, I’ve always been a bit… sensitive, down there. I’m glad you’re willing to do that first. Just… please don’t keep me waiting too long. I have things to do. And make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. We’ll get those blood tests ordered right away. I'll make a note to request a gentle phlebotomist for you. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not really. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just normal, isn’t it? Oh! And I can’t have shellfish. Makes me terribly sick. But that’s it. Nothing serious. Honestly, I’m pretty healthy, considering.
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish allergy noted. And seasonal allergies are good to know. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just this. Multivitamin. My sister told me to start taking it. She said it’s good for… everything. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take a little chamomile tea. But that's it. Really. I don’t like taking pills. They always make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and chamomile tea noted. That's good to know. Now, just to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history? That’s a long story. My mother… she had high blood pressure. And my aunt… she had something with her… stomach, I think. Cancer, maybe? Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to all that. It just makes me anxious. It's all doom and gloom, you know? Are you sure you need to know all this?
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. It's perfectly alright if you don't know all the details. Knowing about some family history can help us assess your risk factors, but it's not a requirement. If you happen to remember anything specific about your mother’s high blood pressure, or your aunt’s condition, that would be helpful, but if not, that’s perfectly fine. We can proceed without it. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I eat. I sleep. It’s not exactly a complicated life. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I find these questions a bit intrusive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Carmaleta. I just want to get a complete picture of your health. Knowing about your habits can help us understand any potential risks and make the best recommendations for you. So, you don’t smoke, you enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, and you generally try to eat healthy. That’s all very helpful to know. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise? Not really. I walk around at work, does that count? I used to go to the gym, but I just don’t have the time anymore. Honestly, I'm too busy. And it's just… exhausting. I prefer to relax with a good book. Is that so wrong? I’m not an athlete, you know.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not wrong at all, Carmaleta. Everyone has different priorities, and relaxing with a good book is a perfectly healthy way to spend your time. Okay, I think I have all the information I need for now. We’ll get those blood tests ordered, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and figure out the best plan moving forward. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I just… I hope this doesn’t take too long. And I really hope it’s not going to be expensive. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do our best to get the results back as quickly as possible. The lab will provide information about costs, and we can discuss any concerns you have. Here’s the lab order. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: Right. Thank you. Goodbye.
