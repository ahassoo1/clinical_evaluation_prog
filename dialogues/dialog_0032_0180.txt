DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 57 years old. Please, tell me what brings you in to see me today. Try to be concise; my schedule is rather full.
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have time for this. I’m just… tired. Really tired. And I… well, it's embarrassing, okay? I keep wanting to eat dirt. Like, actual earth. Don't ask me why. It just… happens. And it's getting worse. Can we just figure out what's wrong and get it over with?
DOCTOR: “Dirt,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Clay, mostly. From the garden. It sounds crazy, I know. My husband… he used to laugh about it. Said I was part coyote or something. But he’s… gone now. And I'm just… craving it. More and more. It makes me feel… weak, though. That's why I'm here. Is that good enough detail for you? Honestly, I don’t remember everything perfectly. It's been a rough few years.
DOCTOR: “Rough few years” and a craving for…geophagy. Interesting. It is rather unusual. And potentially indicative of several things, none of them particularly pleasant. We’ll need to explore this further. First, let’s clarify. How long have you been experiencing this craving?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… See, that's hard. It wasn’t always this bad. Maybe… six months? A year? It started small, just a little taste when I was gardening. Now… now it’s almost daily. I try not to, but… it helps, okay? It’s… hard to explain. It’s a feeling, a need. Don't make me list every single day, I really don't remember specifics.
DOCTOR: Very well. We don't need a precise timeline if it's causing you distress to recall. Let's move on. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings alongside this… desire for clay?
PATIENT: Unusual cravings? Hmm… Not really. Just… normal things, I guess. Sweets. Sometimes salty stuff. Nothing like dirt, okay? That’s just… different. Why does it matter, anyway? Is this going to take all day? I have appointments, you know. And frankly, it's a little insulting to have to explain all this. It's not like I choose to eat dirt!
DOCTOR: It matters, Ms. Cantoran, because certain cravings can indicate deficiencies, or underlying medical conditions. We are simply gathering information to determine the cause. Now, regarding your other medical history, have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Ugh, conditions… Let me think. My husband handled all that stuff, mostly. He took me to all the doctors. I… I had high blood pressure, I think. Years ago. And… something with my stomach? Ulcers, maybe? I honestly don't recall. It was a long time ago, and I haven't been to a doctor since… well, since he passed. I’m not insured, you know. Makes it hard to keep track of these things. Is this important? It feels like you’re just… interrogating me.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Cantoran. Past medical history provides context. High blood pressure and a history of stomach issues are relevant. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I stopped taking everything when… when he died. Didn't see the point. He always managed it all. Pills, appointments… everything. I tried a little something for my sleep, a few years back, but it didn't help and made me feel… fuzzy. So I stopped that too. Honestly, I prefer just dealing with it. Makes things simpler.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and the… cravings?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Oh, goodness. Let me think. I’m tired, like I said. Really, really tired. And… my stomach hurts sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah. Sort of a dull ache. And I get… dizzy, I guess. Especially when I stand up too fast. But who doesn’t get dizzy sometimes? It's old age, okay? I'm not a spring chicken anymore. Is that what you want to hear? Is this going to lead to a million tests? Because I really don’t have the money.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, abdominal pain, and dizziness are not simply signs of “old age,” Ms. Cantoran. They require investigation. We need to determine the underlying cause. I’m going to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. This will help us rule out some of the more serious possibilities.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don’t take too long, okay? And be gentle. I bruise easily. Honestly, this is all a waste of time. It's probably just a vitamin deficiency or something. A little iron, maybe? Can't you just give me a shot or something? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie down, Ms. Cantoran. A simple vitamin deficiency is possible, but we must rule out other conditions first. Now, if you'll please take a deep breath. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is slightly elevated. Breathing is a bit labored, but clear. And your abdomen is tender in the lower quadrants. Do you feel any particular pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there! That hurts. Sort of a… dull ache, but sharp when you push. It's been like that for a while, on and off. Not constant, but… yeah, that hurts. See? It's probably just indigestion or something. I ate something bad, maybe? Honestly, this is just making me anxious. And anxious makes everything worse. Can we just… stop? I don’t like being poked and prodded. Is this going to involve blood tests? Because I really can't afford that.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower quadrants, coupled with fatigue, dizziness, and the… unusual craving, warrants further investigation. I am going to order some basic blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and iron studies. These will help us assess your overall health and identify any deficiencies or underlying issues. I understand your concerns about cost. Let me speak with the clinic administrator to see if we can arrange a payment plan or explore any available assistance programs. However, we need to rule out potentially serious conditions, and blood work is a necessary step. Would you be willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But only if you promise to keep the cost as low as possible. And no surprises, okay? I don't want to get a huge bill in the mail later. Payment plan sounds good, I guess. Anything to avoid a mountain of debt. Just… hurry up, okay? And don’t poke me too much when you take the blood. I hate needles. Honestly, this is ridiculous. It’s probably just a vitamin deficiency. I bet it is.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will arrange for the blood work and discuss payment options with you afterward. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. Ms. Cantoran, I understand your anxieties and your concerns about cost. We will proceed as efficiently as possible, and I assure you we will do everything we can to minimize your financial burden. However, it is essential to address these symptoms comprehensively to ensure your health and well-being. Please remain here, and I will return shortly with the paperwork for the blood work.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. .
