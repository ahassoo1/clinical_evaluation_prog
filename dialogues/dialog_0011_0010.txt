DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I wanted to get it checked out. I don’t… quite recall when it started, exactly. It feels like it’s been a little while, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you're unsure of the exact timing. We’ll figure it out together. Can you tell me more about the swelling?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s mostly… here, on my neck. It’s not painful, not exactly. More… uncomfortable, and it feels… full. Sometimes it feels a little tight, like something is pressing. It doesn’t really… change much throughout the day, as far as I can tell. I suppose it's just… there. I apologize for not being more precise. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Jahaad. Don’t apologize at all. It's helpful to know it’s not painful, and that it feels more uncomfortable and full. And it's good you've noticed it doesn't fluctuate much. To help me understand better, could you describe the location of the swelling more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's… mostly on the front of my neck, I think. Not on the sides, and not in the back. It seems to be… centered, a little below my Adam’s apple, if that makes sense. It's… fairly symmetrical, I believe. Both sides feel… about the same. Though, again, it’s difficult for me to be certain. It just feels… generalized. Is that a useful description?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite useful, thank you. Centered, below your Adam’s apple, and fairly symmetrical. Generalized is a good way to put it. Now, have you noticed any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Changes in my voice… that's a good question. I haven't specifically noticed any changes, but… I suppose it's possible. I do a fair amount of speaking in my profession, naturally. Perhaps it sounds a little different. It’s hard to tell, truly. I wouldn’t say it’s worse, or noticeably altered, but I wouldn’t confidently say it’s remained exactly the same, either. I apologize for being so vague again. It’s frustrating to not be able to recall specifics.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Jahaad. It’s perfectly reasonable to be unsure when it comes to subtle changes. Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I haven’t had any trouble swallowing. And my appetite… no changes there either. I’ve been eating normally, I believe. Everything feels… the same, in that regard. I do sometimes feel a little… fatigued, but I attribute that to the general stresses of work. It’s nothing… particularly concerning, I wouldn't think. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No difficulty swallowing, appetite unchanged, and fatigue attributed to work stress. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit difficult. I’ve seen doctors over the years, naturally, but I don’t recall any… major diagnoses. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing… chronic. I’ve always been relatively healthy, or at least, that’s my understanding. I did have a minor injury a few years ago – a sprained ankle – but that was treated and resolved. I apologize again for my lack of clarity. My medical records might be more helpful, if you have access to them? I’m simply not sure what, if anything, I’ve been officially diagnosed with.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Jahaad. It’s perfectly alright. We do have access to your records, and I’ll review them. While I do that, could you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. That's the only surgery I can confidently recall. It was… quite a long time ago. I don't remember much about it, truthfully. Just… a recovery period, and then everything was fine. No other surgeries, to my knowledge. I really wish I could be more precise with these details, Doctor. It's frustrating, both for you and for me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jahaad. Tonsillectomy as a child is a common surgery. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's another difficult one, truthfully. My parents… they both lived long lives, but I don’t recall them having any… particularly serious illnesses. My mother had some… mild arthritis, I believe, in her later years. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing… dramatic. I have a brother, and as far as I know, he’s perfectly healthy as well. It’s not a family that’s… prone to illness, generally. But, again, my recollection is… hazy. I apologize for the vagueness. I wish I could provide more concrete information. It's frustrating to be so unsure.
DOCTOR: You’re doing fine, Jahaad. It’s helpful to know about your parents' arthritis and high blood pressure. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. I find the habit… quite unpleasant. I’ve always been quite health-conscious, generally. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I apologize for stating the obvious.
DOCTOR: Not at all. It’s good to know. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. I might have a glass of wine with dinner now and then, perhaps. Or a beer if I’m socializing. But I don’t drink… regularly, or to excess. It’s not a habit I indulge in frequently. I wouldn’t describe myself as a drinker, certainly. Is that… a sufficient answer? I apologize if it's too vague. It's just... difficult to quantify.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly sufficient, Jahaad. Occasional social drinking. And finally, do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. No. Never have, and never will. I find the very idea… distasteful. I prioritize my health and wellbeing, and I would never jeopardize that in any way. I apologize if that seems… strong, but it's simply the truth. I hope that answers your question definitively.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jahaad. I appreciate your honesty. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly. I apologize for not being more… forthcoming with details, but I truly am doing my best to recall everything accurately. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jahaad. Let's begin. I'm palpating your neck now. I notice some mild enlargement of the thyroid gland, which appears symmetrical. The lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but they are soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any discrete nodules or masses. I'm listening to your neck now. No bruits are audible. Your throat appears clear. No signs of inflammation or infection. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute and your blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Based on the exam and your history, the swelling you're experiencing appears to be a mild goiter – an enlargement of the thyroid gland. The slightly enlarged lymph nodes could be a reactive response to inflammation or infection, although they don’t appear concerning at this time. To rule out any underlying causes and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, specifically a thyroid function panel to assess your thyroid hormone levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A goiter… I see. Blood tests… yes, that sounds… prudent. If that’s what you recommend, then certainly. I trust your professional judgment, Doctor. Anything that can help determine the cause of this swelling… I’m agreeable to. I apologize for any inconvenience. I understand these things are… necessary. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease, somewhat.
DOCTOR: You’re not an inconvenience at all, Jahaad. It’s my job to investigate these things thoroughly. And I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. I’m ordering a complete blood count , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, a free T4 test, and a thyroid antibody test. The lab results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive iodine intake, as this can sometimes exacerbate thyroid problems. I’d also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A complete blood count… TSH and free T4… and thyroid antibody… yes. Avoiding excessive iodine… understood. I’ll certainly be mindful of that. One week… yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. A follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results… I can certainly make that work. I apologize again for my lack of… medical expertise. I’m grateful for your guidance, Doctor. And for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It’s… a relief to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to apologize, Jahaad. You’re doing everything right by seeking medical attention and following my recommendations. Here is the lab requisition form. You can take this to any lab that accepts our insurance. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve covered everything quite comprehensively. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. As I mentioned before, my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I sometimes struggle to recall details. You’ve been incredibly accommodating. And I feel… much more reassured now, having a plan in place. Thank you. I suppose… there’s nothing further. Unless you have any specific instructions I’ve overlooked? Or any warning signs I should be particularly attentive to before my follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I understand completely. Before your follow-up appointment, please contact us immediately if you experience any difficulty breathing, significant swelling of your face or neck, or any changes in your voice that worsen. Those would be rare, but it’s always best to err on the side of caution. Otherwise, just continue with your normal routine, avoid excessive iodine, and we’ll discuss the lab results next week. Here is a written summary of our consultation and instructions for the blood tests. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… significant swelling… worsening voice changes… understood. No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. You’ve been exceptionally thorough and reassuring. I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. And thank you again for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I think… that will be all. I look forward to our follow-up appointment next week. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get well soon, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment. Have a good day.
