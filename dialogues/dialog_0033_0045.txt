DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Withycombe, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Enrique Withycombe. But everyone calls me Enrique. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… uh… what was your name again? Sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be for names. But I remember everything else!
DOCTOR: Dechêne. Doctor Dechêne. And it’s quite alright, memory lapses are… common. Let’s not dwell on introductions. What brings you in today, Enrique?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this flushing. It happens… not all the time, but often enough it worries me. My face gets very red, and sometimes my neck too. And it feels… warm. Not a fever warm, but like I’ve been sitting in the sun too long. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s after I eat, sometimes just… happens. It’s been going on a few months now, maybe longer. I just thought it would go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Flushing… several months duration. Associated with eating sometimes, but not always. And you say it feels warm, not a fever. Do you notice anything with the flushing?
PATIENT: Hmm… with the flushing? Let me think… Sometimes my heart feels like it’s beating a little faster, but I don’t know if that’s because of the flushing, or just… me. And sometimes, just a little bit, I feel dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And maybe… a little bit sweaty. But not a lot. Mostly just my face gets red and warm. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Right. Palpitations and mild dizziness accompanying the flushing. And some diaphoresis. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Di… what? Sorry, Doctor, you’re using big words. You mean… sweating? Yes, a little bit. But not much. Other symptoms… not really. I sleep okay. I eat okay. I’m… well, I’m a counselor, so I listen to people’s problems all day. That’s a little tiring, but that’s my job. My wife… she passed away last year. That’s been hard, of course. But I’m managing. I don’t think that's making me sick, if that makes sense. Just… sad sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Loss of spouse last year. We'll note that. And you're saying the symptoms aren't impacting your daily activities significantly?
PATIENT: No, not really impacting. I can still work, still cook, still… do everything. It’s just… worrying. It feels like something’s wrong, even if it’s not stopping me from doing things. And sometimes it’s embarrassing, you know? If I’m talking to someone, and my face just goes red… it’s not a good look.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it could be a number of things. Given your age and… general health, we should rule out the more common possibilities. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not that I know of. I haven't taken much medicine in my life. Just… over-the-counter things for a headache, maybe. Nothing regular. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. What sort of possibilities are you thinking about, Doctor? Is it serious? I worry a little bit, I admit.
DOCTOR: It could be anything from rosacea to… something more systemic. We'll need to do a basic physical exam and some blood work to get a better picture. Have you noticed if certain foods trigger it?
PATIENT: Certain foods… hmm. That’s a good question. I don't think so, but I haven't really tried to figure it out. I eat a lot of Indian food, of course. Spicy things. But I’ve been eating that my whole life. It doesn’t seem to be the spices, because I've eaten really spicy food and not flushed. And other times I eat something plain, and it happens anyway. I really haven’t paid attention, to be honest. I just know it’s annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's proceed with the exam then. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll draw some blood for routine labs. It’s just to be thorough. Please, sit back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Thorough is good. I always liked doctors who were thorough. My wife always said I worried too much, but better safe than sorry, right? Is it going to be a lot of blood? I don’t like needles, not one bit.
DOCTOR: Just a standard amount, Mr. Withycombe. A few vials. We'll start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically. Heart rate is 88, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear, heart sounds regular. No murmurs or irregularities detected.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So far, so good. It didn’t hurt. You said my blood pressure was a little high? Is that… bad? I try to stay calm, but it’s hard when you’re worried about something. My wife used to make me herbal tea when I was stressed. It helped a little.
DOCTOR: It’s mildly elevated, Mr. Withycombe. We’ll monitor it. It could be a temporary increase due to anxiety. Now, let’s move on to the blood work. It’s standard procedure. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw a few vials. Please, remain seated. She’ll be right with you.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Blood work… right. I guess I should just… relax. Easier said than done, I suppose. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Like, should I not eat anything else today? Or drink lots of water? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Just fast for eight hours beforehand. You've already eaten, so it won’t matter for this round. The nurse will give you instructions for future testing. Just try to remain calm. We'll get to the bottom of this. Nurse, could you please come to room three?
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours. I can manage that. I hope it’s not anything serious. My wife… she always took care of these things. I feel a bit lost without her, if I’m honest. But I’m managing. I have to. It's just... these little things, like this flushing, they make me worry.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s focus on getting the blood work done first. Once we have the results, we can discuss further steps. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to rule out any underlying causes. The nurse should be here any moment. Try not to dwell on it, Mr. Withycombe. It will only raise your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. You're right. Dwelling doesn't help. Easier said than done, but I’ll try. So, what exactly are you looking for in the blood work? What kind of things would it show if something was wrong? I always liked knowing what was happening, even if it wasn’t good news. It helped me feel in control.
DOCTOR: We'll be checking your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels. It’s a standard panel to rule out infection, anemia, hormonal imbalances… things of that nature. I don’t want to go through a full lecture on the possibilities, Mr. Withycombe. Let’s just get the tests done and go from there. It's best if we don't get ahead of ourselves.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You're right. No need to worry before we have results. Thank you, Doctor. I'm ready whenever you are. Though I don’t like needles… at all. But I'll be brave. I always try to be. It's what my wife would have wanted.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will take care of you now. I’ll review the results once they come back. .
PATIENT: .
