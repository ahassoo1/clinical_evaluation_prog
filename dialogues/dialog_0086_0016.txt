DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my… well, about the bruising. It’s been happening more lately. I’m on that medicine, you know, to thin the blood. And frankly, I don’t think it’s working quite right, if you understand my meaning. A little too thin, perhaps? I bump into things, normal things, and end up looking like I’ve been in a fight. It’s… embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Bruising, you say. And you're concerned about your blood thinner… I see you are on warfarin. And “normal things,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, warfarin. That’s the one. And yes, normal things! Like, I brushed against the corner of the coffee table the other day. Just a little nudge! And now I’ve got a mark the size of my palm on my shin. It’s ridiculous. I used to be able to… well, I used to be more robust, let’s put it that way. Are you sure this medicine isn’t too strong? My wife – God rest her soul – she always said I had a good constitution.
DOCTOR: "Robust," right. Well, constitutions change over time, Mr. Farson. But a bruise from a coffee table is… noteworthy. Let's try to pinpoint this a bit better. When did you first notice this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe a month ago? No, maybe six weeks. It’s hard to say exactly. It wasn’t instant. It just gradually got worse. At first, it was just little things, you know? A tiny speck here and there. Now… well, you’ve seen the shin. It’s concerning. I haven't fallen or anything, mind you. Just… existing, really. It’s making me hesitant to do anything, frankly. And I like to be active.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, gradual onset, about six weeks ago. No trauma, just… appearing. We do need to check your INR levels, of course. That’s how we measure the effectiveness of the warfarin. Do you know the last time your INR was checked?
PATIENT: INR… honestly, no. I leave all that to you doctors. Numbers just swim in front of my eyes. I know they check it regularly, but I don't pay attention to the when. I just show up when they tell me to. Is something wrong? Is it a big number? My wife always said I worried too much about these things. She handled everything. It’s… difficult, doing this on my own now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. It's perfectly alright that you don't keep track of the numbers. That’s what I’m here for. We'll check it now. Could we get an INR drawn on Mr. Farson, please?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The sooner the better, frankly. It's just… unsettling, seeing myself covered in these marks. It makes me feel… fragile. And I don't do fragile. I used to build things, you know? Solid things. Houses, furniture… Now I worry about bumping into a doorframe. It’s ridiculous. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Should I be avoiding… everything?
DOCTOR: Avoiding everything isn't practical, Mr. Farson. And frankly, a little bit of caution is always advisable. But we need to know what we're dealing with before we make any drastic changes. For now, try to be mindful of your surroundings. And let's get this INR result. It will give us a much clearer picture. If you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to this. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, alright. Though I can't imagine what you'll find. It’s just the bruising, you see. It’s very… visible. I’m not prone to exaggeration, you know. I was always a practical man. A sensible man. But these marks… they're quite alarming. Very well, go ahead. But I assure you, it’s just the bruising. I haven’t fallen. I haven’t had any injuries. Just… existing. It’s the blood thinner, I’m certain of it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's just confirm that. I'm going to gently examine your arms and legs, and look for any other signs. Please let me know if anything is painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness there. A little firm, perhaps, but not painful. I suppose my muscles aren't what they used to be. I haven't been doing as much… manual labor lately. It’s hard to motivate oneself, you know? After… after my wife passed. Still, I keep myself active. A little gardening, a little walking. Nothing strenuous. And I eat a balanced diet. I assure you, I take care of myself. This isn't some sort of… negligence. It’s the medicine. It has to be the medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And the bruising itself… are they all relatively new?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly new. The one on my shin is the worst, of course. But there are smaller ones appearing all the time. Just little spots, really. Mostly on my legs, a few on my arms. They come and go, you know? It's… unsettling to wake up and find a new one. It’s like my skin is made of glass. And honestly, it’s embarrassing. I don’t want people staring at me. I used to be a respected member of the community. A man of… substance. Now I feel like I should be wearing long sleeves and trousers all the time. It’s… undignified.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Farson, the exam doesn't reveal any other obvious causes for the bruising. There's no tenderness to suggest any underlying injuries, and your skin otherwise appears normal. Your vital signs are stable. We’ll need to wait for the INR result to determine if the warfarin dosage needs adjusting. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid activities that could cause trauma, even minor bumps. And, frankly, I would recommend avoiding alcohol, as it can also interfere with warfarin. Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I assure you, I’m not a… a heavy drinker. My wife… she didn't approve. But a little wine with dinner, for digestion, you know? Is that really going to make a difference? It’s hardly a vice. And frankly, it’s one of the few pleasures I have left. It’s… a small comfort. I shouldn’t have to give that up, should I? Over a few bruises? It seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, while one glass of wine may seem insignificant, it can absolutely affect your INR levels and exacerbate the bruising. It's not about depriving you of pleasure, it's about ensuring your safety and properly managing your medication. We need a stable INR to prevent more serious complications. For the next few days, I recommend eliminating alcohol completely until we get the results and can reassess. It's a small sacrifice for peace of mind, don't you agree?
PATIENT: Peace of mind? You want peace of mind? My peace of mind is being eroded by constantly worrying about every little bump and bruise! And now you’re telling me I can’t even have a glass of wine with dinner? This is… ridiculous. I’ve lived a long and sensible life, and I’m quite capable of making my own decisions. I understand the risks, I assure you. A little wine won’t kill me. It’s a small pleasure, a small comfort. You doctors… you always want to control everything. It’s… suffocating. No. I think I’ll take my chances with the wine. It’s my life, after all. And frankly, I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Farson. You are, of course, free to make your own decisions. However, I must document that you have been advised to abstain from alcohol and have chosen not to follow that advice. We will proceed with the INR results, and I strongly urge you to monitor yourself closely for any signs of bleeding. Any unexplained bruising, nosebleeds, or blood in your stool should be reported immediately. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. I just… I just want this whole thing sorted out. I want to be able to live my life without constantly worrying about every little thing. And frankly, I’m starting to think this medicine is doing more harm than good. Perhaps it's time to consider other options. I’ll be waiting for the results. And I’ll decide for myself whether or not to have a glass of wine with dinner. Good day.
