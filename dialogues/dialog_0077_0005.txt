DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here because I am looking to move into one of those… senior living places. They asked me to get a checkup first, to make sure I am… suitable, I suppose is the word. I believe they call it clearing me for residency.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, a pre-admission physical. Quite sensible. We want to ensure you’re in the best possible health for this transition. Alright, Mr. Tkac. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I reckon I’ve been… fortunate. I’ve always been a baker, you see. Lots of standing, lots of kneading. Keeps a man moving. I’ve never had any major illnesses, not as far as I recall. A few colds, of course, and a touch of the flu now and then, but nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a young man, climbing a tree, but it healed up just fine. I still have full use of it. Is there anything in particular you are wanting to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Tkac. Being active is certainly beneficial. Just trying to get a complete picture. You mentioned the broken arm…was that recent, or a long time ago?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, a long time ago. When I was barely more than a boy, I'd wager. Sixty years, maybe more. It healed up straight as an arrow, though. Never bothered me much after the cast came off. I’ve always been able to do everything I needed to do. Baking requires strong arms, you know. I'd not be much of a baker if I couldn't lift a sack of flour.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And currently, are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. My knees sometimes ache a bit when the weather turns cold, but that’s just… old age, I suspect. Nothing that keeps me from working. And my back gets a little stiff if I’ve been standing for too long, but a good stretch usually sorts that out. I wouldn’t say it's pain, precisely. Just… reminders that I’m not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: That's quite common, Mr. Tkac. Wear and tear. Let's talk about other things then. Do you have any trouble with your breathing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My lungs are sound, I believe. I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I've always lived out in the open air. Plenty of fresh air while I'm baking, if you open the windows. I can walk a good distance without getting winded, though I don't do much long distance walking these days. I prefer a slower pace.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I reckon I've lost a little weight in the last few months. Not much, but enough that my trousers are a bit looser than they used to be. I haven’t been eating quite as much, I suppose. Not because I don’t want to, but… well, I find myself less hungry these days. Still enjoy a good slice of pie, mind you. Just don't eat as much of it as I once did. Do you think that is a problem?
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of that change, Mr. Tkac. We should investigate that a little further. Do you have any trouble with your digestion?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything… passes through as it should, if you'll pardon my bluntness. I haven’t had any… blockages, or discomfort, or anything of that nature. I eat a fairly plain diet, mostly. Bread, of course, and some vegetables. And a bit of meat now and then. I’ve always been blessed with a strong stomach. Even as a boy, I could eat just about anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. For my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. Said it was getting a bit high. It's a small white pill, I take it every morning with my breakfast. I believe it’s called… Lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Thank you for telling me. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not as far as I recall. I eat all sorts of things, and I've never had any trouble. I used to help my mother gather wild berries when I was a boy, and I never had any trouble with those either. I have a strong constitution, as I mentioned. It's a blessing, really. Though, I suppose, one can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, Mr. Tkac, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a bit of a long story, Doctor. My mother lived to be a very old woman, well into her nineties. She was a strong woman, like me. My father… he passed away when I was a young man, from a sickness. I don’t recall what it was, exactly. And I have a sister, but we haven't spoken in many years. She moved away a long time ago. As for illnesses… my mother had some trouble with her joints in her later years, arthritis I believe it was. And my father… well, he was a healthy man for most of his life. I don't recall any serious illnesses in the family, to be honest. We are Lakota Sioux, you see, and we tend to be a hardy people. It’s in our blood, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never have. My mother always said alcohol was a curse, and I've always heeded her advice. And tobacco… well, I've never had the taste for it. It smells foul, in my opinion. I prefer the smell of baking bread, or the fresh air. A clean life, that’s what I’ve always believed in. Keeps a man strong, I reckon. And I've always tried to be a good man, too. Do you think that matters?
DOCTOR: It certainly does, Mr. Tkac. Now, before we proceed, do you have any concerns you'd like to share with me?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I sometimes get a little… forgetful. Not about important things, mind you, but little details. I might forget where I put my spectacles, or what I was just saying. Nothing serious, just… a bit of a lapse in memory now and then. It comes with age, I suppose. But it worries me sometimes, that I might not remember everything I need to remember. Especially if I were to move into one of those places. I wouldn’t want to be a bother to anyone. Is that something you think would be a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s good you brought that up, Mr. Tkac. Forgetfulness can be common with age, and we can certainly assess that. Now, would you say this forgetfulness is getting worse, or has it been fairly consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I reckon. It's always been a bit of a struggle, remembering small details. It hasn’t gotten significantly worse in recent months, not that I’ve noticed. It’s just… always been there. Like a little cloud hanging over my head. I can recall things from sixty years ago perfectly, mind you! But ask me what I had for breakfast, and I might struggle. It's a strange thing, really. I suppose it doesn't affect my baking. I can follow a recipe without any trouble. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily concerning, Mr. Tkac. It's good that it isn’t impacting your daily activities. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. I always believed in being thorough. Lead the way, as they say.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step onto the scale for me, please. Alright, 183 pounds. Good. And your height is 5'11", correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. Five feet eleven inches. I haven’t shrunk any, not yet anyway. It’s good to know I’m still holding my height. My father was a tall man, as well. It seems to run in the family.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not significantly. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Throat looks good, no signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Alright, Mr. Tkac. Everything seems within normal limits, physically. Now, I’d like to order some bloodwork, just to get a more detailed picture of your health. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. And perhaps a Vitamin D level. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I am happy to undergo. I trust your judgement completely. I always believed in being proactive when it came to my health. Bloodwork, you say? When will I need to come back for the results? And will I need to fast beforehand? I do enjoy a good breakfast, you see. I’d like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. So, no food or drink after midnight tonight. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning, say 8:00 AM?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM sounds perfect, Doctor. I can easily skip breakfast for one morning. Eight hours, you say? I can manage that. It’s good to know we are making progress. Will the results be available quickly? I am eager to hear what you find. And will you explain everything to me thoroughly? I do appreciate a clear explanation.
DOCTOR: Yes, the results should be available within a few days. I’ll review them thoroughly and explain everything to you in detail. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, say Tuesday at 10:00 AM?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM sounds excellent, Doctor. That gives me plenty of time to prepare any questions I might have. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease. I believe we have covered everything for now, haven’t we? Is there anything else I should be aware of, or anything else you require from me?
DOCTOR: I believe we have, Mr. Tkac. Just remember to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw tomorrow morning. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here’s a lab requisition form and some information about preparing for your bloodwork. I will see you next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. In the meantime, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to call. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have answered all of my questions. You have been most thorough and kind. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I feel much better knowing that we are taking these steps. I think that is all for now. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday.
