DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, it’s my breath. It smells. Bad. I need something for it, quickly. I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about bad breath. It's good you’re addressing it. "Bad breath," or halitosis, can have several causes. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: What do you mean what do I mean? It smells awful! Like…old food, probably. It’s just…always there. And it’s embarrassing. Look, I brush, okay? Sometimes I floss. Is that what you need to know? Honestly, I don't have time for a twenty-question game. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Zelina. I’m not trying to be difficult, I just want to make sure I understand the situation fully so I can help you best. When did you first notice this bad breath?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t know. A while ago. Probably after…things ended with my ex. Look, does it matter? It smells bad now. I don't remember specifics from six months ago. Just…a long time. Can we just skip to the solution?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's helpful to know it’s been ongoing for some time. Now, besides brushing and occasional flossing, do you use any other products for your mouth – mouthwash, tongue scraper, anything like that?
PATIENT: Mouthwash? Please. That stuff tastes like chemicals. No, just the toothpaste. Sometimes. Look, I work on the highway, okay? It's not like I have time for fancy oral hygiene routines. Dust, dirt, exhaust fumes...that's my life. It's probably that. Just fix the smell.
DOCTOR: Highway work, that does expose you to a lot of irritants. And that could certainly be a factor. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the bad breath?
PATIENT: Like what? I don't have a sore throat or anything. My gums…sometimes they bleed a little when I brush, but that’s it. It's probably just from not being gentle enough. I don't know. Look, am I getting anywhere with this or are you just going to keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: You’re getting somewhere, Zelina, definitely. The bleeding gums are good to know. It could indicate some gum inflammation, which can contribute to bad breath. Would you mind if I take a quick look inside your mouth?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. And be quick about it. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m seeing a little redness of your gums, which, as we discussed, suggests some inflammation. Your tongue also has a bit of a coating. Gums: Erythematous, slight bleeding upon gentle probing. Tongue: Moderate coating present. No obvious lesions or abnormalities. This supports the possibility that gum inflammation is contributing to the bad breath. We’ll also need to rule out other causes. Do you have any allergies to medications or any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Conditions? I got divorced last year, if that counts. Look, I’m perfectly healthy, okay? I just need something to make my breath not smell. Can we please just skip to the fix? I don’t have time for a full medical history. I work on the highway, remember? Dust, dirt, fumes…I'm probably just breathing in something bad all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your time is valuable, Zelina. While I suspect the highway work and possible gum inflammation are playing a role, it's important to be thorough. To start, I recommend improving your oral hygiene. That means brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, flossing daily, and using a tongue scraper to remove bacteria from your tongue. We can discuss proper technique if you'd like. Also, a simple salt water rinse several times a day can help reduce inflammation and freshen your breath. Would you like me to demonstrate that?
PATIENT: Salt water? Really? I thought doctors had actual solutions. Look, I do brush sometimes, okay? And I guess I can try the salt water. But if it doesn’t work, I’m not coming back. I don't have time for this. Just…tell me if there's anything stronger. Anything that actually works.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Zelina. Salt water is a good first step, and often surprisingly effective. However, if it doesn’t provide enough relief, we have other options. In some cases, bad breath can be caused by underlying issues like sinus infections or even digestive problems. Since you’re not experiencing any other symptoms currently, I don’t believe those are likely, but it’s good to keep in mind. There are also therapeutic mouthwashes available, containing ingredients like chlorhexidine, which are stronger antibacterial agents. However, these should be used with caution and are generally not recommended for long-term use. Let's try the improved oral hygiene and salt water rinse for a week. If you don't see improvement, we can discuss a referral to a dentist for a more thorough evaluation and possible treatment of any gum disease. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Fine. A week. But if it doesn't work, I'm getting a second opinion. And a dentist? Seriously? Look, I work on the highway, okay? I don't have time for appointments and procedures. A week. That's it. Just…write down the salt water thing and I'll go. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. One teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water, rinse several times a day. I understand your concerns about time, Zelina. I hope this helps. If you don’t see improvement in a week, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up, or see a dentist. Take care and be safe out on the highway. .
