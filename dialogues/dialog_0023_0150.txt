DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to even be here, but… I want to have a baby. And I want it to be… easy. I’m 51, not decrepit, and I’d like to avoid any… complications. I’ve heard good things about you, Doctor, so let’s just get right to it, shall we?
DOCTOR: “Easy” is rarely a word associated with pregnancy, Ms. Shteynberg, but I understand your desire for a smooth process. It’s good you're proactive. At your age, there are… considerations. First, let’s get a thorough history. Have you been trying for a while now, or is this a recent decision?
PATIENT: Recent decision. Very recent. I… haven’t exactly been trying. I just… decided I want one. And I don’t want to spend years going through tests and… procedures. My sister went through years with IVF, and frankly, it looked exhausting. So, no, I haven’t been “trying.” Is that a problem? Because if it is, I’d like to know upfront. I don’t have time for a long process.
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal, Ms. Shteynberg. While it’s admirable you're decisive, conception isn't always immediate, regardless of age. We need to assess your baseline fertility to determine the likelihood of success and what, if any, interventions might be necessary. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that was… 1976, I believe. And a rather nasty bout of pneumonia in 2010. Nothing major. I’ve always been… robust. Mostly, I just get annoyed with colds. No chronic conditions, no… anything like that. And I don't take any medications regularly. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, if needed. Are we getting somewhere? I’d really like to know if this is even… feasible before we spend any more time on this.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chronic conditions or regular medications is good. And you said no allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. Dust bothers me, naturally, but that's not an allergy, that's just… dust. I’ve always been able to eat anything, drink anything. I was rather fond of spicy peppers when I lived in Budapest, which, I assure you, are quite potent. I am not a delicate flower, Doctor. I just want to know what the chances are. And quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any instances of early menopause, infertility, or pregnancy complications in your mother or sisters?
PATIENT: My mother… well, she had two children, myself and my brother, without any… fuss, as far as I know. She lived to be 88, perfectly healthy. My sister, as I mentioned, had trouble conceiving, but she eventually had twins with IVF, so it is possible. And honestly, I don’t recall any… complications. They didn't discuss such things openly. It was the 1950s, Doctor, not everything was… aired out. Does that suffice? I’m not sure I have much more family medical history to offer.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful, thank you. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Disgusting habit. And alcohol… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I’m not a… party animal, if that's what you’re implying. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, frankly. I’m a practical woman, Doctor, I don’t engage in activities that would be… detrimental to my health. I eat a sensible diet, I get enough sleep, I’m not about to start chain-smoking now. Is this all necessary? It feels rather… invasive.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Shteynberg. It allows me to get a complete picture of your health. Now, regarding activity levels… do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise? I… walk. I live in a rather hilly neighborhood. And I do a fair amount of gardening. Does that count? I’m not one for gyms or… competitive sports. I prefer functional activity, if you understand what I mean. I'm not about to run a marathon, but I'm certainly not sedentary. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… condescending. Are you implying I’m somehow unfit to be a mother? Because that’s… rather rude.
DOCTOR: Please don’t misunderstand, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m not implying anything of the sort. I'm simply gathering information. It’s my job to assess risk factors, and your activity level is one of those factors. Now, before we proceed further, I need to perform a physical exam. It’s essential to evaluate your overall health and assess for any underlying conditions. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam. Of course. Fine. Get it over with. Though I must say, I find the entire process rather… undignified. I’m a perfectly healthy woman, Doctor, this all seems rather excessive. But… if you insist. Let’s just make it quick, shall we? I have errands to run. And frankly, I’m not thrilled about having strangers poke and prod. Do you have a clean gown?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The examination room is private and professional. Please undress from the waist down, and I’ll be right back with the gown. We’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, then proceed with a general physical exam and a pelvic exam. It will take approximately 20-30 minutes. Please, when you are ready, lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. But do hurry. I have a rather important appointment later. This… whole thing is rather inconvenient, you know. And if you could be… gentle, that would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Pulse is normal. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No palpable masses. Now, I’ll need to perform a pelvic exam. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly. And please, no unnecessary conversation. I find it… unnerving. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is… not a pleasant experience. Do you always make patients feel this… exposed?
DOCTOR: Uterus is normal size and position. No adnexal masses palpated. Cervix is closed and appears normal. Slight vaginal dryness noted. I’ve collected a sample for a Pap smear. We’ll send that to the lab for analysis. It’s a routine screening to check for any abnormal cells. Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. You can get dressed now. Once you're ready, we can discuss the next steps. We will need to perform some blood tests to assess your hormone levels, ovarian reserve, and overall health.
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More tests. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. Do you have any idea how long this is going to take? And what if everything comes back… unfavorable? I'm 51, Doctor, not 25. Just tell me, straight, is this even worth pursuing? Before I waste any more of my time – and money – on this… charade.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Ms. Shteynberg. At 51, the likelihood of natural conception is reduced, but not impossible. However, it’s essential to have a realistic expectation. The blood tests will provide valuable information about your ovarian reserve and hormone levels, which will help us determine your chances of success. If the results are unfavorable, we can discuss other options, such as donor eggs or adoption. I won't sugarcoat it - it may not be a straightforward process. But we won't know until we have the results. The lab work will take approximately 5-7 business days. I will have my assistant contact you when the results are available. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the tests done. Quickly. And contact me when you have the results. I don't have time for endless speculation. I have a life, you know. And frankly, I’m starting to regret even mentioning this to anyone. I suppose that's all. Let's just… be done with this. Thank you.
