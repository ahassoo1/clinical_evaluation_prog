DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Coby’s the name. Look, it’s this heat, right? Just… unbearable. I’ve been a painter my whole life, construction work too, you know, outdoors. Always have been. But this summer… it's different. I just can't handle it like I used to. Sweating like a… well, you wouldn't believe. And not just a bit of sweat, proper drenched. It's ridiculous. Never had this problem before.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby. This heat is quite oppressive, and it certainly can exacerbate things. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. So, you’re experiencing excessive sweating, and this is a new development for you, specifically this summer?
PATIENT: New development is putting it mildly. It’s… humiliating, frankly. And it’s not just the sweating. I feel… weak, you know? Like all the energy’s been drained out of me. It's a bit hard to explain. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now, I'm done by lunchtime. And dizzy, sometimes. Not falling-down dizzy, but… lightheaded. Makes concentrating difficult. I’ve tried drinking more water, of course. Makes no difference, really. I suppose I’m just getting old. But I’m telling you, this isn't normal old.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of that with me, Mr. Coby. It sounds quite concerning, and you are right to seek medical attention. It’s not simply a matter of “getting old,” and we need to investigate what's going on. You mentioned weakness, dizziness, and excessive sweating—all new this summer, despite increasing your water intake. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a bit more about the sweating?
PATIENT: Well, it’s all over, to be honest. Not just my armpits, you know? Face, back, everywhere. And it’s not like a normal sweat either. It’s… clammy. Sticky. Even when it's not particularly hot, I'm damp. And it’s constant. Like a film over my skin. I wake up like it. It's… unpleasant. I've always been a… robust man, never bothered by a bit of heat. But now? I'm constantly changing clothes. It's a waste of time, really. And water doesn’t help. I drink gallons and it’s still happening. Honestly, I’m starting to think I’m losing my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby. That certainly sounds distressing, and the fact that it's happening even when you're not actively overheating is significant. "Constant" and "clammy" are important descriptors. Now, let's go back a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite... hmm. Not really, I suppose. Still eat the same amount. Big breakfasts, you know, fuel for the day. Lunch, maybe a sandwich. Dinner with whatever my sister makes. I haven’t noticed any difference. As for weight… probably lost a bit, now that you mention it. But I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. Working hard, you know? Didn’t have time for that nonsense. Probably just muscle loss. It wouldn't surprise me. But I wouldn’t say a significant amount. It's not like I’m wasting away or anything. Though, I do feel weaker, if that makes sense. Weak, but not skinny.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Coby. So, appetite is stable, some possible weight loss, but not dramatic, and you are experiencing noticeable weakness. Have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Stomach’s been fine, actually. Bit of indigestion sometimes, but that's just old age again, probably. I eat pretty heavy food, you know? Big portions. No… nothing coming out the other end that's unusual. Regular as clockwork, if you want to know. Honestly, Doctor, it's just this… heat and the sweating. Makes me feel awful, weak, tired. Like I've got no energy left. And the dampness… it’s just embarrassing, frankly. Makes it hard to concentrate on the job, you know? A good painter needs a steady hand. This… makes it difficult.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so forthcoming, Mr. Coby. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot. So, no changes in bowel habits or nausea. Just the excessive sweating, weakness, and fatigue. Now, let’s move on to some other areas. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats in addition to the sweating you've already described?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. Not that I've noticed, anyway. I haven't been taking my temperature, you know? Don't bother with that nonsense. And no chills either. I mean, it gets cool at night, of course. It's August, not the tropics. But no shivering or anything like that. Just… damp. Always damp. The night sweats… hmm. I suppose I wake up a bit sticky sometimes. But I put that down to the heat, you know? It’s a hot summer. But not shivering, not feeling cold. Just… warm. And damp. This is all so… frustrating. A man's got work to do, and this is stopping me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. So, no fever or chills, and you've noticed some dampness at night, which you’ve attributed to the heat. To get a clearer picture, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. High blood pressure... the doctor mentioned it a few years back, said I was borderline. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn't feel like they were doing anything. Besides, I felt fine. Heart problems? No, never had any trouble with my heart. Always been a strong man, good constitution. Sister worries, always does. Says I overwork myself. But I've been doing this all my life. Painting, construction, you name it. Never had any problems… until this summer. Honestly, Doctor, I think it’s just the heat. But you're the doctor, you tell me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Coby. It's good to know about the previous blood pressure concerns, even if you've been off medication. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That's about it. And a broken arm once, fell off a ladder. But that was years ago, healed up fine. Never been properly hospitalized. A bit of time in the emergency room after the broken arm, but nothing serious. I've always been a healthy man, Doctor. That’s why I’m so frustrated with all this. A man's got work to do. And I can't do it when I'm weak and sweating like… well, you get the picture. This isn't normal for me. I need to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Coby. And we will try to figure out what's going on. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… my father, he had a heart attack when he was an old man. Lived a good life, though. My mother… she had arthritis, bad hands. That's about it, really. Sister's fine, touch wood. No diabetes that I know of. No cancer. A pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. We're Nepalese, you know? We tend to be… sturdy people. But this… this is different. This feels… wrong. I'm not getting any younger, of course. But this isn't just old age. Something's not right, Doctor. I can feel it in my bones.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Mr. Coby. It gives me a clearer picture. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn't like it. Alcohol… I have a beer with dinner sometimes. Just one. Nothing more. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I'm a working man, Doctor. I need a clear head. I don't have time for that nonsense. Besides, it's a waste of money. And it's bad for you. I take care of myself, mostly. Good food, hard work, that's my lifestyle. Not much more to it than that. And I'm telling you, this isn't normal. Something’s going on, and I need you to figure it out.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. And I assure you, we will investigate this thoroughly. One final question regarding your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional painkiller for my back, Doctor. Nothing regular. Ibuprofen, that sort of thing. And I take a multivitamin, keeps my sister happy. That's it. No allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with food or anything like that. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. I don't take a lot of pills. I eat good food and work hard. And I'm telling you, this isn't getting any better. I need to know what’s wrong, so I can get back to work. This is stopping me from earning a living, and that's not acceptable.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Coby. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I'll do whatever you need. Just… get to the bottom of this, alright? This is driving me crazy. A man's got work to do, and I can’t do it feeling like this. I’m ready when you are. Just… hurry up, if you could. The sooner I know what’s wrong, the sooner I can get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Coby. We’ll get started right away. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Not drastically so, but something we’ll need to keep an eye on. I'm listening to your heart now. I hear a slight murmur, which isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but warrants further investigation. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen feels soft and there's no tenderness. Everything feels normal there. Your pulse is strong and regular. Your skin is slightly dry, but otherwise looks normal. However, as you mentioned, it does feel clammy. Your mouth and throat seem a little dry. Based on this preliminary examination, I think we need to run some blood tests and a urine analysis to get a clearer picture. I also want to check your electrolytes and kidney function. We'll also want to rule out any underlying infection. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever it takes. I told you, something’s not right. Blood tests, urine analysis, whatever you need. I just want to know what’s going on, so I can get back to work. This is ridiculous. A man's got bills to pay. Just… get it done quickly, alright? And tell me what it means, when you get the results. I don’t want to be left in the dark. I need answers, and I need them soon. This waiting is… frustrating, to say the least.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely, Mr. Coby. I’ll order the blood tests and urine analysis right away. The lab should be able to get the results back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you stay well-hydrated, and avoid strenuous activity until we have a better idea of what's going on. Given your symptoms, especially the excessive sweating, weakness, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I also want to rule out a couple of other possibilities. It’s unlikely, but we should consider a possible thyroid issue or early-stage adrenal insufficiency. These are rare, but important to rule out. I will also order a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a cortisol level. We will discuss the results thoroughly when they become available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Cortisol level? Thyroid? What are you saying, Doctor? Is it something serious? I just feel weak and sweaty. I thought it was the heat. Are you saying it's something… worse? I don’t like the sound of any of this. I just want to get back to work. Is this going to keep me from earning a living? I've got bills to pay, you know. I don’t have time for… complicated illnesses. Tell me straight, Doctor. Is this something serious? And will these tests tell me what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that I’m not trying to alarm you. These are just precautionary tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. It's highly likely that it's something relatively minor, but we need to be thorough to ensure we’re providing you with the best possible care. The cortisol level test will help rule out adrenal insufficiency, which can cause weakness, fatigue, and low blood pressure. The thyroid test will help determine if your thyroid gland is functioning properly, as thyroid issues can also cause similar symptoms. These tests are relatively simple blood draws and will provide us with valuable information to determine the cause of your symptoms. We're not jumping to any conclusions yet, and it's important not to worry until we have the results. I will explain the results to you in detail when they come back, and we’ll discuss the best course of action at that time. It’s possible these tests will show nothing of concern, in which case we can explore other potential causes. However, it’s crucial to rule out these more serious possibilities first. Do you have any further questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: So… I just have to wait? A few days? And you don't know what's wrong yet? That's… frustrating. And what if it is something serious? What if I can’t work? I've got bills to pay, you know. I can’t afford to be sick. Will these tests tell me if I need to… stop working? That's what I'm worried about. I'm a painter, Doctor. That's all I do. I can't do anything else. And if I can’t work… well, I don’t even want to think about it. Just… tell me straight, Doctor. What's the worst-case scenario? And how long will I have to wait for these results? A few days? A week? I need to know. This is driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Coby. It's natural to feel anxious when you're facing uncertainty, especially when your livelihood is involved. Let’s address your concerns one at a time. The worst-case scenario, though unlikely, would be a diagnosis of a condition like adrenal insufficiency or a significant thyroid disorder that requires ongoing medical management. However, I want to emphasize again that these are rare possibilities. If either of these conditions were diagnosed, we would develop a treatment plan to manage your symptoms and help you return to as normal a level of function as possible. As for your ability to work, that would depend on the diagnosis and the severity of your symptoms. If it’s something minor, you likely won’t need to stop working at all. If it’s more serious, we would discuss potential modifications to your work schedule or temporary limitations to allow you to recover. I anticipate the lab results should be back within 3-5 business days. I will call you as soon as they are available, and we’ll schedule an appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend you rest as much as possible and avoid strenuous activity. Try to stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: 3-5 business days… that’s… a long time. A week, maybe? And I have to rest? That's not going to pay the bills. I have jobs lined up, Doctor. I can't just cancel them. This is ridiculous. Look, can’t you just… give me something for the sweating? Something to help me get through the day? An injection, a pill, anything? I can't work if I'm drenched in sweat all the time. And I can’t afford to be resting. Just something to help me cope, until we get these results. Is that too much to ask? I need to work, Doctor. I have to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your need to work, Mr. Coby, and I wish I could simply provide you with something to alleviate your symptoms immediately. However, it's important to understand that masking the symptoms without knowing the underlying cause could potentially delay an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. There are medications that can reduce sweating, such as anticholinergics, but they can have side effects, including dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision. Furthermore, they wouldn't address the underlying cause of your symptoms, and could even make it more difficult to interpret the results of the tests. What I can recommend, as a temporary measure, is to wear breathable clothing, stay well-hydrated, and avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can worsen sweating. I can also provide you with a referral to a dermatologist who specializes in hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating. They may have additional options for symptom management. However, I strongly advise against taking any medication to mask your symptoms until we have the results of the tests. It’s crucial to get an accurate diagnosis before starting any treatment. I understand this is frustrating, but it’s important for your long-term health. In the meantime, I will document your concerns and ensure the lab prioritizes your tests. I will call you as soon as they are available, and we’ll discuss the best course of action at that time. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Breathable clothing… I already wear breathable clothing. It's hot, Doctor! Nothing helps. And a dermatologist? That's just going to take more time and money. This is ridiculous. Look, I’m just a painter, you know? I’m not a doctor. I don’t understand all this medical jargon. I just want to feel normal again. I want to be able to work without feeling weak and sweaty all the time. Is that too much to ask? Fine. No medication. But you promise you’ll get those results back as quickly as possible? And you’ll call me as soon as they’re available? I need to know what’s going on, Doctor. I really do. And I need to get back to work. Bills don’t pay themselves, you know. Just… call me as soon as you have something. Anything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Coby. You're right; you’re a painter, not a doctor, and you shouldn’t have to worry about medical jargon. My priority is to get you back to feeling normal and able to work as quickly as possible. I promise you I will do everything I can to expedite the results. I will personally follow up with the lab to ensure they are processed as quickly as possible. And I will call you immediately as soon as they are available, regardless of the time. I will also make a note in your chart to prioritize this and ensure you receive a prompt call. In the meantime, please try to rest as much as possible and stay hydrated. I understand this is difficult, but it’s important to take care of yourself. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s it. Just… call me. That’s all I ask. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll go now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. You take care of yourself. I will be in touch as soon as I have the results. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. .
