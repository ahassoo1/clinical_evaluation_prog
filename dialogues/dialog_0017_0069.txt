DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguió. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about getting some vaccinations, if that’s alright. I think I'm due for a few, and I wanted to make sure I was all set before… well, before anything happens, you know? I just want to be protected.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations. Yes, alright. A sensible precaution, I suppose, though many make unnecessary fuss over them. Now, let’s not waste time. Have you had a recent vaccination history compiled, or are we starting from scratch?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Starting from scratch, I think. I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. It’s been… a long time since I thought about it. I know I had the usual ones as a kid, but after that… nothing comes to mind specifically. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: A problem is a rather strong word, Mr. Paguió. Inefficient is more accurate. We will have to determine what you haven’t had, which requires…effort. Do you have any records at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m afraid not. I've moved around a bit over the years, and honestly, paperwork wasn’t always my strong suit. It just… got lost, I suppose. I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there a way you can tell what I’ve had, even without records? Maybe some kind of test?
DOCTOR: A test?
PATIENT: Well, I wasn’t sure! I just thought… some kind of blood work, perhaps? I don't know much about it, you see. I'm really just trusting your expertise, Doctor. I just want to be sure I’m covered for everything. Whatever is recommended, I’m happy to do it.
DOCTOR: Blood work can sometimes indicate previous exposure to certain illnesses, Mr. Paguió, but it is not a comprehensive solution. It’s hardly a perfect system, and truthfully, relying on it exclusively is…rather foolish. We will proceed based on your age and general health, and administer the standard vaccinations recommended for someone of your demographic. Now, let’s begin with a brief medical history. Any significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. And a bad flu once or twice, but nothing that required a hospital stay. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, playing football. But other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Do you need to know about allergies? I don’t think I have any, but I’ve never really paid much attention.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses… acceptable. A broken wrist is…irrelevant. Allergies. That is something we must ascertain. Have you ever experienced any unusual reactions to medication?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. I don’t take a lot of medication, usually just over-the-counter things for headaches or colds. And I haven't had any… swelling, or rashes, or anything like that after taking them. I think if I had, I’d remember, wouldn’t I? It sounds silly to even ask, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It is not "silly," Mr. Paguió, it is necessary. Let’s move on. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked. Never been interested, to be honest. My mother always warned me about it, and… well, it just never appealed to me. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s about it. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: One glass of wine. Minimal. Now. Family history. Are there any… significant illnesses prevalent in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... My father had high blood pressure, I believe, and my mother had some trouble with arthritis when she got older. Nothing major, as far as I know. No heart disease, no cancer… at least, not that anyone talked about. They both lived to a pretty good age, actually, so I suppose they weren't too bad off. Does that help? I'm not very good at remembering these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Acceptable. Now, Mr. Paguió, I need to ask a few personal questions. This is for your medical record, of course. What is your current occupation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I’m a Production, Planning, and Expediting Clerk. It’s… mostly paperwork, really. Making sure things get where they need to go, on time. It’s not glamorous, but it keeps me busy. Is that relevant to the vaccinations? I suppose being around people could be… something? I don't really get sick often, though.
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Mr. Paguió. Now, do you engage in any… recreational activities that may put you at increased risk of exposure to illness?
PATIENT: Well… I enjoy gardening, if that counts. And I go for walks in the park sometimes. Nothing too strenuous. I used to play football, but that was a long time ago. I mostly just like to relax at home with a good book, to be honest. I wouldn't say I'm very adventurous. Does that sound… insufficient? I'm not sure what you're looking for.
DOCTOR: Insufficient is...an accurate assessment. Alright. Before proceeding with the vaccinations, I will need to perform a brief physical examination. Please disrobe from the waist up and have a seat on the examination table. We must ensure there are no…contraindications. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh! A physical examination... right. No, no objections at all, Doctor. That's perfectly alright. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I should do. I'll just… excuse me for a moment. I hope I'm not being too much trouble. It's just... I haven't had one of these in a while.
DOCTOR: Proceed. And do try to relax, Mr. Paguió. Now, deep breath. Let’s begin. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, though slightly diminished capacity. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses detected. Reflexes are within normal limits. Overall, physical condition is… adequate. Now, roll over.
PATIENT: Oh... alright. Is everything okay, Doctor? That blood pressure… is that bad? I do sometimes feel a little stressed, you know, with work and everything. Is there anything I should be doing about it? I'm ready whenever you are, though. I just… don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is marginally elevated, Mr. Paguió. Stress is a contributing factor, yes, but… insufficient exercise and a poor diet are more likely culprits. We will address that later. Now, this will sting briefly. Try not to flinch. There. That is the influenza vaccine. And now, the tetanus booster. Do attempt to relax, Mr. Paguió. This is for your own good. There. Now, remain seated for fifteen minutes to monitor for any adverse reactions. Do inform me immediately if you experience any dizziness or shortness of breath. Vaccinations administered. Monitor for reaction. Discuss lifestyle modifications. Schedule follow-up appointment. We will re-evaluate in six months. Do attempt to improve your physical condition in the interim.
PATIENT: Oh... alright. Thank you, Doctor. That did sting a bit, but… it’s alright. I’ll try to relax more, and maybe walk a little bit further each day. And I suppose I could eat a few more vegetables. Is there anything else I should be doing? And… when would you like to see me again? Six months sounds good, I think. I'll put it in my calendar right away. I appreciate your help, Doctor. It's good to know I'm protected, even if it meant a few needles.
DOCTOR: Six months, as previously stated. And do consider a comprehensive diet plan. We have pamphlets available at the reception desk. Schedule a check-up, Mr. Paguió. And attempt to manage your stress levels. That is all. Next.
