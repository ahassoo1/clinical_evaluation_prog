DOCTOR: Right. Keoni MacVittie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Todoro…vich, is it? Yes. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, definitely. It’s just… frequent. I’m not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Frequent… okay. And when you say “a lot,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Details… That’s difficult. It’s not like I’m keeping a log, you see. It feels like… every couple of hours, at least. Sometimes more often if I’ve had something to drink, even just water. It’s been going on for… a few weeks, I think? It’s hard to say exactly. Everything feels a little… blurry, lately. I apologize for not being more precise.
DOCTOR: A few weeks… and increased frequency, especially with fluids. Alright. And is it just frequency, or are you experiencing any urgency – feeling like you absolutely have to go right away?
PATIENT: Urgency… hmm. Yes, sometimes. Not every time, but… occasionally I’ll get that feeling. Like I need to find a bathroom immediately. It’s unsettling, to be honest. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully, just… inconvenient and a bit worrisome. I hope that explains it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequency and occasional urgency. No pain, which is good. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Oh dear. I haven’t… really been paying attention, I suppose. I feel terrible saying this, but I don’t think so? It looks normal, if that makes sense. The usual color, I mean. I haven’t noticed any blood or anything… concerning. I apologize again for my lack of detail. It's just... not something I normally focus on.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's not your job to be a medical expert. But paying attention to these things is important. No blood, no unusual color... okay. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And no lower abdominal pain, thankfully. Just… the constant trips to the bathroom. It’s been a bit disruptive, to be honest. I haven't felt unwell otherwise, if that helps. Just… tired, perhaps, but I attribute that to… well, life, generally. Is there something I should be worried about? I’m a little anxious, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Well, fatigue is nonspecific. Let's not jump to conclusions. Now, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… yes, I am. Though… not recently. I’ve been divorced for a few years now, and… well, it’s been quiet on that front. I’m not currently in a relationship, if that clarifies anything. Is that relevant, Doctor? I just want to understand what you're asking.
DOCTOR: It's relevant to rule out certain infections. Now, have you had any changes in your vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… rather personal. No, I haven't noticed any changes. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. I really apologize for not being more helpful. I’m not used to discussing these things, and frankly, I’m a little embarrassed. I haven’t been… as attentive to my body as I should be, perhaps. Is this a common problem, Doctor? Could it be something simple?
DOCTOR: It could be a simple urinary tract infection, or it could be something else. Look, it's good you're finally addressing this. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll need to check your abdomen and do a brief pelvic exam to rule things out. It won’t be pleasant, but it's necessary.
PATIENT: A pelvic exam… Oh. I… I hadn't anticipated that. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I understand you need to be thorough, but… it’s been a long time since I’ve had one, and… I’m a little nervous, to be frank. Could we perhaps try something else first? Perhaps a urine sample? Would that be helpful? I apologize for being difficult. It's just... a sensitive subject.
DOCTOR: A urine sample is part of the workup, yes. But it won’t tell us everything. A physical exam is crucial to rule out other potential causes. Look, I understand it’s uncomfortable, but delaying it won’t help. It's a standard procedure. We need to be systematic. Now, if you’ll just follow me, we'll get it over with. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well. If you believe it’s necessary… I suppose I trust your judgment. I just… wish there was another way. Lead the way, please. I apologize for any inconvenience I’m causing. I truly do. Perhaps if you could just explain everything as you go? That might… ease my anxiety a little. .
