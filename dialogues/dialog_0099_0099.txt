DOCTOR: Right, well, Denis Minatra, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Denis Minatra. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Overgaard, wasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Overgaard. Yes. Though, let’s skip the formalities. Pleasure isn’t exactly the word I'd use when someone’s seeking medical attention, is it?
PATIENT: You are quite right, Doctor. A practical outlook is always best. I received a letter regarding…an unusual test result from a GI examination. That is what prompted my visit today. I confess, I was a bit concerned by the wording.
DOCTOR: A GI exam, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a gastrointestinal examination. It was performed about two weeks ago, I believe… on July 18th. A rather thorough procedure, though not particularly comfortable, naturally. The doctor who administered it mentioned some… irregularities, and suggested further discussion with a specialist. That would be you, I presume?
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s pull up those results then. July 18th… yes, here we are. Dr. Alvarez… a competent enough man, though perhaps overly cautious. What exactly did he say the irregularities were, Denis?
PATIENT: He… described a small area of inflammation, I believe. And something about a…texture that wasn’t quite right. He used the phrase “unusual prominence” which, frankly, worried me. I asked him to clarify, but he simply repeated the point about needing a specialist’s opinion. I don’t have a strong medical background, so I wasn’t entirely sure what to make of it.
DOCTOR: “Unusual prominence,” hmm. Yes, that’s vague enough to send anyone running to a specialist. And Dr. Alvarez is…precise in his imprecision. Right. It does indicate a small polyp, approximately 8 millimeters, in the descending colon. And some…minor inflammation. Have you experienced any bleeding?
PATIENT: Bleeding? No, not that I’ve noticed. No blood in my stool, no…rectal bleeding, nothing of that nature. I have felt… a slight discomfort, occasionally, in my lower abdomen. More of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes. I assumed it was simply a bit of indigestion, or perhaps something I ate. It hasn’t been severe enough to warrant any particular attention until this test result arrived.
DOCTOR: Indigestion. Convenient explanation. Alright. And any changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in…bowel habits? Well, not dramatic ones. Perhaps a little…irregularity. Sometimes I feel I need to go more frequently than usual, other times…less so. I haven't kept particularly close track, I must admit. It's been a gradual shift, nothing sudden or alarming. Is that…significant?
DOCTOR: Significant?
PATIENT: It could be, couldn’t it? Doctor Alvarez’s report didn't offer much detail, and I am…anxiously awaiting clarification. Any slight change feels rather important in light of this polyp he discovered. I am perhaps overthinking it, but I do prefer to be well-informed, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Well-informed. Right. The polyp itself isn’t immediately alarming, Denis. 8 millimeters is… small. But it requires investigation. The inflammation…that's the more concerning part. It could be a simple irritation, a bit of diverticulitis perhaps. Or it could be… something else. Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? No, I have not. This was my first… such examination. Only the standard scope, as I understood it. A rather unpleasant experience, though I understand it is necessary. I recall the doctor mentioning the possibility of a follow-up procedure if the results were… inconclusive, but I wasn't prepared for a polyp to be discovered. What does this mean, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Serious?
PATIENT: Doctor, if you wouldn’t mind speaking plainly. I am a pragmatic woman, and I prefer directness. I understand you need more information, but could you give me some indication of the potential concerns? Is this something that requires immediate attention, or is this something we can monitor over time? I am… rather anxious about this, and any reassurance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Denis, a polyp, even a small one, has the potential to become cancerous. That’s why it needs to be investigated. We need to determine what type of polyp it is – is it a hyperplastic polyp, which are generally harmless, or an adenomatous polyp, which has a higher risk of becoming malignant?
PATIENT: I understand. So… it’s not immediately cancerous, but it could become so? And determining the type of polyp will indicate the level of risk? What does “investigating” entail, Doctor? Would I require another scope? Or… is a surgical removal necessary? I confess, the thought of further procedures is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Another scope, yes. A full colonoscopy, this time with biopsies. We need to get a tissue sample to determine the polyp's precise nature. Surgical removal isn’t immediately necessary, but if it is an adenomatous polyp, that would be the next step. And depending on the results, we may need to repeat the colonoscopy regularly to monitor for any changes. I'll schedule you for a colonoscopy with Dr. Ramirez. He's…thorough. We'll get this sorted, Denis. Don’t panic. It’s far more common than you think.
PATIENT: A full colonoscopy with Dr. Ramirez… very well. I appreciate your directness, Doctor. And your reassurance is… helpful. Are there any preparations I should be aware of for this procedure? And… is there a waiting list for Dr. Ramirez? I would like to schedule it as soon as possible, if feasible. I would also like to know the approximate cost, if you wouldn't mind. I am… not currently insured.
DOCTOR: Right. Preparation is…extensive. Clear liquid diet for three days, bowel preparation the night before. Dr. Ramirez… is booked solid, unfortunately. Earliest appointment is August 28th. As for cost… Without insurance, it’ll be approximately $1800. I can have the billing department contact you with a payment plan option, if needed. Honestly, it’s… exorbitant. But it's the price of…thoroughness.
PATIENT: August 28th… a bit of a wait, but acceptable. $1800… a significant sum, to be sure. Yes, please, contact the billing department regarding a payment plan. I will discuss it with my family. Is there anything I can do to prepare for the procedure beyond the clear liquid diet and bowel preparation? Any specific foods I should avoid in the days leading up to it? Or any medications I should discontinue? I prefer to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: Right. Discontinue any iron supplements at least a week prior, as they interfere with the visualization. Avoid red meat and high-fiber foods a few days before – it will make the preparation more difficult. Honestly, Denis, the biggest thing is to follow the instructions for the bowel prep meticulously. It's unpleasant, but it's crucial for a clear examination. Don't skimp on the prep, understand?
PATIENT: No iron supplements, avoid red meat and high-fiber foods, and follow the bowel preparation instructions meticulously. I understand completely, Doctor. I am a disciplined woman, and I assure you, I will not skimp on the preparation. Is there anything else I should be aware of at this time? Or do I simply await contact from the billing department and prepare for the procedure on August 28th?
DOCTOR: Right. That’s it for now. Await contact from billing. Follow the prep instructions. And… try not to dwell on it. It’s a routine procedure, Denis. We'll get it sorted. I’ll see you on the 28th. Next!
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your time and your directness. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I will await contact from the billing department. I will see you on August 28th.
