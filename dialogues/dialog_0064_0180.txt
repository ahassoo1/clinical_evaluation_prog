DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, to get us started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. Just… tired. Really tired. And… I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I just… crave it, you know? It’s stupid. Don't ask me why. It just happens. Is that… is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Hedy. It's good you're being open with me. “Really tired” is a good place to start. Can you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to say? I’m tired! All the time. Doesn't matter if I sleep eight hours, doesn't matter if I only sleep four. I just… drag. Like someone took the batteries out of me. And everything aches. It's… annoying. Look, I program these machines all day, okay? I need to think. This… this makes it hard. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. So, constant fatigue, regardless of sleep, and body aches. Does the aching feel like muscle pain, joint pain, or something else?
PATIENT: Ugh. Both? I don't know. It's just… everything. My back, my legs, even my fingers sometimes. Like I’ve been… working too hard. Which, obviously, I have. But it’s always there, you know? Even when I’m not at the machine. Honestly, it feels like… old age, I guess. And don't tell me to exercise. I barely have the energy to get to the machine.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant aches throughout your body. And it’s not improving with rest. I understand it’s difficult. Now, about the… dirt. How long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… a while. Honestly, I don't even remember when it started. Maybe… a few months? Longer? It just kind of… started. I noticed I was… picking at the garden, then… well, eating it. Like a little kid. It's embarrassing. Don't judge me. I know it's weird. It’s not like I'm going out of my way for it, it just… happens. It tastes… earthy, I guess. Like… dirt. Obviously. .
DOCTOR: No judgment at all, Hedy. It's important to share these things with me, and I appreciate you being honest. “Earthy” is a good description. Does it happen at specific times, or is it random?
