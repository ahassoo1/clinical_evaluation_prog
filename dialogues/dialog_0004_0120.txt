DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s… it’s about having a baby. I want one, and I don’t want any trouble getting pregnant, you know? I lost my husband a few years back, and… well, time’s ticking. I just want it to be easy. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Easy isn’t a medical term, Ms. Villarreal, but I understand your concerns. It’s perfectly reasonable to want a straightforward pregnancy, especially given your circumstances. We’ll do our best to ensure everything goes smoothly. To start, can you tell me a little about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, I don’t really… keep track. They come when they come. Regular-ish, I guess? I mean, I haven’t had any major issues, if that makes sense. It’s not like I’m bleeding for weeks or anything. Why does it even matter? It’s always been… fine.
DOCTOR: It matters because a regular cycle indicates regular ovulation, which is essential for conception. “Regular-ish” isn’t quite specific enough, unfortunately. Can you give me an approximate length of your cycle – from the first day of one period to the first day of the next?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you serious? Look, I told you, I don't keep track. Maybe… twenty-eight days? Thirty? I really don't know! It varies. Is this going to take all day? I have things to do, you know. I’m not a scientist, I don’t measure things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, while I appreciate your… candor, accurate information is crucial for proper assessment. A variable cycle length could indicate hormonal imbalances that might affect fertility. Let’s try a different approach. Have you had any difficulty conceiving – meaning, have you been actively trying for a certain period of time, and haven’t had success?
PATIENT: Actively trying? No. Not yet. I just want to make sure everything is okay before I even bother. I don’t want to waste my time, you know? I’m not getting any younger. I figured that’s what doctors are for - to tell me if there’s a problem before it becomes one. Honestly, all these questions… it feels like I’m already failing, and I haven't even started.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal. It’s prudent to have a baseline assessment before attempting conception. However, without some basic information, I can’t determine if there is a problem. Let’s move on to your medical history, then. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… let me think. I had the flu once, badly. And… I think I broke my wrist when I was a kid. Oh, and high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was just stress. It’s…under control now, I guess. Honestly, I don't go to the doctor much. I just try to stay healthy. Is that going to be a problem too? Everything's a problem with you people.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, even if “under control,” is relevant. We’ll need to review your records to confirm. And “stress” is not a diagnosis, Ms. Villarreal. It’s a cause of symptoms, not the problem itself. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Okay, fine. I take a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, if my head hurts, I take… ibuprofen? Is that a problem? It's just for headaches! And sometimes, a little ginger for my stomach. I don't take anything regularly, if that makes a difference. Are you writing all this down? It’s ridiculous. I’m telling you my entire life story and you're asking about ginger?
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Ms. Villarreal. Even ginger can interact with certain medications, though in your case it’s unlikely to be significant. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any fertility issues?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… that's a long story. My mother… she had some problems with her stomach. And my aunt… she had cancer, a long time ago. I don’t really know much else. My family doesn’t really talk about this stuff, you know? It's just… awkward. Honestly, I don't think any of them had trouble getting pregnant. Everyone had kids. Is this going to be on a test or something?
DOCTOR: It’s not about a test, Ms. Villarreal. Family history helps us identify potential genetic predispositions. The fact that your mother had stomach problems is noted. Cancer history is also relevant. Now, I need to ask some potentially sensitive questions. Have you ever been sexually active?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you serious? Is this really necessary? Look, I’m here because I want a baby, not to have my personal life dissected! I don't understand why you need to know these things. It’s… invasive. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. This is a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, these questions are standard medical protocol when evaluating fertility. Sexual history is crucial for assessing risk factors for infections that could affect conception. I understand your discomfort, but I need this information to provide you with adequate care. However, if you are unwilling to provide this information, we can stop here. But I must inform you that without it, I will be unable to offer a comprehensive assessment or formulate a proper plan. Do you wish to continue?
