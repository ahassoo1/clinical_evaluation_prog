DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmmph. They send me here for check-up. No need, really. Workin' fine, been workin' since… well, a long time. They say somethin' 'bout the dust down the mine? Everything alright. Just paperwork, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. Paperwork. Yes. Well, even if you feel fine, Mr. Bigger, these check-ups are important. Especially considering your… occupation. “Dust down the mine,” you say?
PATIENT: Occupation? It’s work! Good, hard work. Been movin' rocks, coal, whatever, underground for… too many years to count. Dust is just… dust. Everyone gets dust on their clothes. What’s this about, exactly? They didn’t tell me why they sendin' an old man for dust. Wasting my time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bigger, it’s not just dust. Prolonged exposure to certain kinds of dust, particularly silica dust – common in mining – can lead to serious lung conditions. That's why your insurance is covering this visit. We need to assess your lung function, understand if there's been any damage. Now, have you ever had any trouble breathing, a persistent cough, or wheezing?
PATIENT: Wheezing? No. Cough? Sometimes, when I got a cold. Like anyone else. Lung function... what does that mean? You checkin' to see if I can still… blow air? I been climbin' stairs my whole life! I don't need a machine to tell me I can breathe. Is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: It's not just about whether you can climb stairs, Mr. Bigger. It’s about potential microscopic damage to your lungs that you wouldn’t be able to feel. We need to do a simple test – a spirometry – to measure how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can exhale. It takes about ten minutes. And frankly, it’s better to catch anything early, if there is anything. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema?
PATIENT: Emphy… what now? Never. Just… strong lungs. My mama always said so. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you, but I’m a practical man. If I was sick, I'd know. I'd be coughin' up a storm, or somethin'. Ten minutes, you say? Humph. Alright, ten minutes. But if it involves puffin' into somethin', I'm warnin' you, I don't trust them newfangled machines. They always break.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. A simple breath test, that’s all. No puffing, exactly. You just breathe normally into a tube. We’ll have a technician come in to explain it. Now, before we do that, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Once. Long, long ago. When I was a boy. Broke my arm fallin’ out of a mango tree. That was in… Nigeria. They fixed it. That’s all. Never been back since. Mostly been healthy. Strong constitution, you see. Don't go to doctors for nothin’. Waste of money, mostly. This dust thing is a waste of time. You hearin’ me?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bigger, I hear you. Broken arm as a child, that’s good to know. Any other injuries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Injuries? A few scrapes, bumps. Workin’ underground, you get a few. Nothing serious. Cut myself once with a piece of metal, needed a stitch. But it healed. They didn't need to write it down in no big book. I’m a tough man, Doctor. Always been tough. What is this, a list of every scratch I ever had?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Bigger. We need a complete picture of your medical background. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never took nothin’. A little bit of… ginger tea when my joints ache sometimes. That’s all. Natural stuff. No pills. No syrups. No nothin’. Just good, strong ginger. And hard work keeps me movin’. Don't need no doctor’s potions. Is this makin' it to that big book, too? This ginger tea?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bigger, the ginger tea won’t be going in the chart. I’m trying to establish if you have any pre-existing conditions or medications that might affect the test results. Alright. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I lived in the bush, Doctor. Eaten all sorts of things. Didn't die. Bees sting, sure. Hurts for a bit. But I don't break out in rashes or nothin’. Tough skin. Like I said. You askin’ me about every little thing now? It’s a waste of my time. I tell ya, this is really... unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Let’s move on to your family history, then. Do you know if any of your parents or siblings had any lung problems – like asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmmph. My papa, he worked the land. Strong man. My mama, she made things, sold things. Neither of 'em ever went to a doctor. Too busy livin'. I had… lots of siblings. Most of 'em gone now. No one ever talked about lung problems. If they had a cough, they drank some tea. That’s what they did. Back then, you just… carried on. No fuss. You makin' a long story out of nothin', Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Always said it was foolish. Bad for your lungs, obviously. Waste of money, too. Always been sensible. What kind of question is that? Lookin' at me like I'm the one who needs fixin'. I came here because they told me to come. Not because I thought I was sick. Now, can we just get this over with? This is… tiring.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. Let’s get started with the spirometry then. I’ll have the technician, Maria, come in and explain the procedure. It will involve you breathing into a mouthpiece for a few minutes. Please follow her instructions carefully. Maria?
PATIENT: Fine. Mouthpiece. A few minutes. As long as it doesn’t involve runnin’ or… puffin’ like a balloon. I’m ready, I suppose. Get it over with. Don’t want to be here all day. This whole thing is… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Maria will take it from here. I’ll be just next door reviewing some charts. Please let Maria know if you feel uncomfortable at any point.
