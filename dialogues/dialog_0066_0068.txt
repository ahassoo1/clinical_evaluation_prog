DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, good morning. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my leg, mostly. It’s been swelling up since… since the treatments. The cancer treatments, you know? It's not painful, not really, just… big.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Swelling in your leg since your cancer treatments. That’s good information to start with. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about those treatments?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… They gave me… pills, mostly. And then some times, I had to go and sit for a long time while things went into my arm through a little tube. It was… a lot of visits. I don't remember exactly what they were for, to be honest. It was all a bit of a blur, you know? They said it would help the cancer, and it did, I think. But now this swelling. It started a few weeks after everything finished.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – treatments can be overwhelming, and it's perfectly normal to not remember every detail. A few weeks after finishing treatment, you noticed swelling in your leg. Okay. And where exactly is the swelling located?
PATIENT: Right here, mostly. It's not all the leg, just… this part. Sometimes it feels a bit tight, like my shoe is too small, even though it's not. And it gets worse if I stand for too long. It's my left leg, for sure. The right one is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily in your left leg, above the ankle. Worse with standing, and feels tight. Have you noticed any changes in the skin there?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… It’s a little bit red, maybe? Not very much. And… it feels a little bit warm to the touch, I think. Not hot, just… not as cool as my other leg. That’s all I can think of, really. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful information, Sasha. Redness and warmth can be important clues. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any pain in your calf with walking, or any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no pain in the calf. And no, no trouble breathing, or any pain in my chest. Definitely not. Just the swelling, and the tightness. It's not bad, you know? I just want to make sure it doesn’t get worse. It’s a worry, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No calf pain, no chest pain or shortness of breath. That's reassuring. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of both of your legs, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to move anything. I’m not very flexible, you know!
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. Let's take a look. I'm going to feel your pulses in both legs, check the temperature, and measure the circumference of both calves to see if there's a significant difference in size. I’ll also gently press on the skin to see if there’s any tenderness. First, let's check your pulses. Can you point to where you feel your pulse in your ankle?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… I think… here? I always find it hard to find. My daughter used to check it for me, but she lives far away now. It’s… somewhere around here. Is that right? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Sasha. It can be tricky to find. Yes, you’re pointing to the right spot. I’m feeling a slightly weaker pulse on your left foot compared to your right, but it’s still present. Now, let’s check the temperature. There is a slight warmth in your left leg compared to your right. And finally, let me measure the circumference of both calves. Okay, your left calf measures 38 centimeters, and your right calf measures 36 centimeters. So, there's a 2-centimeter difference in size. I'm also noting some mild redness and slight warmth in your left leg. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing some post-thrombotic syndrome, which can occur after cancer treatments, especially if there was any blood clot formation. But we need to rule out an active blood clot first. I’d like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg to check for any blockages. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh my. A… a Doppler ultra… sound? Is that… is that serious? A blood clot? I thought the treatments were supposed to stop things like that! Post-throm… what was it? It sounds very complicated. I… I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. But is it painful? Will it take long? And will my Medicare cover it?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Sasha. Let's take things one step at a time. A Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive test – it doesn't involve any needles or pain. It uses sound waves to create an image of the blood flow in your leg. It's a very common test to rule out a blood clot. Post-thrombotic syndrome means that you might have some lingering effects after a blood clot, even if it has already dissolved. It can cause swelling, pain, and changes in the skin, which is what we're seeing with your leg. We're not saying you definitely have a blood clot, but we need to rule it out to be sure. The ultrasound will give us a clear picture. And yes, Medicare should cover it, but let me double-check with the billing department to confirm for you. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes, and we can schedule it for tomorrow morning at the imaging center across the street. They’re very good over there. While we wait for the ultrasound results, I recommend elevating your left leg as much as possible, wearing compression stockings, and staying hydrated. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better, I think. No needles, that’s good. Thirty minutes… I can manage that. And compression stockings… I think I used to have some. Elevating my leg… yes, I can do that. It’s just a little bit of a worry, you know? If you could double-check the Medicare thing, that would be lovely. And… thank you, Doctor. You explained it very well. I just want to get this sorted, if you know what I mean. So I can… get back to things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I completely understand wanting to get this sorted. It’s good you’re taking it seriously. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, double-check your Medicare coverage and schedule the ultrasound for you before you leave. She’s very efficient. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… I take… this one for my blood pressure, and this one for my cholesterol. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take this one. As for allergies… I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. I used to be allergic to cats, but I haven’t been near one in years! Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re taking amlodipine for blood pressure, atorvastatin for cholesterol, and naproxen as needed for arthritis. That’s good to know. And no known allergies, that’s helpful. It’s good you’re managing these conditions. Just to confirm, are you experiencing any pain or discomfort anywhere else besides your leg?
PATIENT: No, no. Just my leg, really. My hands get a little bit stiff sometimes, but that’s just the arthritis. It’s not… terrible. And my back aches a bit in the mornings, but everyone gets that, don’t they? Nothing major, you understand. Just… my leg. That's the worry. Is it serious, Doctor? Honestly?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Sasha. We’re taking the necessary steps to figure out what’s going on with your leg. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it's not necessarily an emergency, but it does require further investigation to rule out a blood clot. The ultrasound will give us a definitive answer. We’ll know more tomorrow after the ultrasound. In the meantime, elevating your leg, wearing compression stockings, and staying hydrated are good steps to take. Maria will schedule the ultrasound, confirm your Medicare coverage, and answer any other questions you might have. She’s excellent, and will make sure everything is taken care of. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think you’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. Just… thank you. For listening. And for not making me feel silly for worrying. I think I’ll just wait for the ultrasound now. And hope for the best. I suppose Maria will come and find me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I'm glad I could help. And you’re not silly for worrying at all – it’s always better to be cautious. Maria will be with you shortly to schedule the ultrasound and answer any further questions. Please don’t hesitate to let us know if anything changes before your appointment tomorrow. Have a good day, and we’ll see you tomorrow. .
