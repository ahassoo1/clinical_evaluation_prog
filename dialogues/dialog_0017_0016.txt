DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this… bruising. It’s getting worse, frankly. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and I keep getting these marks… just appearing. It’s rather inconvenient, and I’d like to know what’s going on. It wasn’t this bad before.
DOCTOR: Blood thinner, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Warfarin, I believe. The cardiologist put me on it after… well, after my wife passed. Something about clots. I don’t pretend to understand all the details, truthfully. It’s just… I bump into things normally, like anyone, but these bruises… they’re lasting too long and spreading. It’s becoming quite noticeable.
DOCTOR: Right. Warfarin. And how long have you been on it, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It's been… nearly two years now. Two years in October, I suppose. It was shortly after… everything. It's hard to keep track of these things, honestly. It feels like a lifetime ago, and yet… just yesterday, all at once. But definitely over a year, and closer to two.
DOCTOR: Very good. And has the dosage of the Warfarin been changed at all in the past two years?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, it hasn’t. At least, not that I’m aware of. The nurse just sends the prescription to the pharmacy every month, same amount each time. I don’t see the cardiologist often, just for the check-ups. He’s a good man, but… well, these specialists, they don’t explain things very well, do they? They just tell you what to do.
DOCTOR: Specialists. Yes, quite. Now, Mr. Farson, let’s be precise. You said the bruising is “spreading.” Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well, it started with just my arms, you see. Little bumps and scrapes, but nothing unusual for someone my age. Now, it’s on my legs, my back… I even noticed a bit on my stomach yesterday. And they’re not small, Doctor. These are proper bruises, dark and… unsightly. It’s quite worrying, frankly. I don’t go around banging myself against walls.
DOCTOR: And are these bruises associated with any specific injury, even a minor one?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no. That's the frustrating part. I may lightly knock my elbow on something, but it’s nothing that would normally cause a bruise like this. Sometimes, I don’t even remember bumping into anything at all. It’s as if my skin is just… fragile. It's rather undignified, if you ask me. A man shouldn't be covered in bruises for no reason.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination, Mr. Farson. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with a visual inspection of the bruising, and then I’ll palpate the areas to assess for any underlying issues. It’s a standard procedure, don’t be alarmed.
PATIENT: Palpate? Doctor, are you going to… poke me? Look, I'm not overly fond of being prodded. Is there really any need for all of this? Can't you just… prescribe something? I’m a busy man, you know. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, with all due respect, a diagnosis cannot be made without a proper examination. It’s medical protocol. Prodding, as you so eloquently put it, is necessary to rule out more serious conditions. Now, please, if you would be so kind, lie down. This will not take long, but it is essential. We need to determine the extent of the issue before considering any course of action. We are not simply handing out medications based on conjecture.
PATIENT: Fine, Doctor. But if this takes too long, I’m going to have to reschedule my golf game. And it’s a very important game. Honestly, the inconvenience of all this… It’s just remarkable. Get on with it, then. But be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, the bruising is quite extensive, as you mentioned. And it does appear to be subcutaneous – beneath the skin. No signs of immediate trauma, no raised areas, no warmth… Palpating the legs now… Tenderness is minimal, but there’s a slight fullness to the tissue. Your skin is indeed quite thin. I’m also noting some age spots, which is not uncommon. And here… a few smaller bruises, as you described. No palpable masses. Let's check your vital signs.
PATIENT: Vital signs? Honestly, Doctor, what are you looking for? I haven’t felt unwell, haven’t had a fever, haven’t fainted… I’m perfectly alright, apart from the unsightly bruising. Is this really necessary? I mean, I’m a perfectly rational man, I can tell you what’s wrong with me. It’s the blood thinner, obviously. It’s too strong, or something. Can’t you just adjust the dosage? This is becoming quite ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I understand your frustration, but a comprehensive assessment is paramount. Vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate – provide crucial information about your overall health and can help rule out other potential causes for the bruising. It’s a standard procedure, and frankly, it's rather insulting that you question my professional judgment. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 72, regular. Respiration rate is normal, 16. Now, let's review your medical history. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor. None. I’ve always been a robust fellow, never needed much in the way of medication. Just the blood thinner, as we’ve established. And a bit of ibuprofen for aches and pains, occasionally. But no allergies. Honestly, I’m a very straightforward case. It’s the blood thinner, I keep telling you. Too much, too strong… something. I don’t understand why we’re going through all this. It’s a waste of both our time. Is there anything I can do to speed this along? Perhaps a blood test? Just to confirm it’s the blood thinner?
DOCTOR: A blood test will be ordered, Mr. Farson, but it is not a substitute for a thorough examination. We need to rule out other potential causes for your bruising before jumping to conclusions. Now, have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Recent surgeries? No, Doctor. Not for decades. A tonsillectomy when I was a boy, and… well, nothing since. And no hospitalizations, either. I keep myself healthy, as I said. I play golf, I eat well… I’m not a sickly man. This is all rather unsettling, frankly. I’ve never had to spend this much time in a doctor’s office in my life. It’s a complete waste of a perfectly good afternoon. Is there anything else you need to know? Perhaps a family history? My wife… she was perfectly healthy, too, until… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, family history is relevant, Mr. Farson. Were there any instances of excessive bleeding or clotting disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Well… my mother, now that I think about it… she bruised rather easily. Not like this, mind you, but she always had a mark or two. The doctor said it was just… delicate skin. She was a small woman, you see. And my grandfather… he had something with his blood, I vaguely recall. Something about it not… thickening properly. But it was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it. It wasn’t a serious condition, I don’t think. Just… a bit of a nuisance. Is that relevant, Doctor? Honestly, I’m not a medical expert. I just know I have this bruising, and it’s likely due to this blood thinner. Can we please focus on that?
DOCTOR: Right. A history of easy bruising in your mother and a clotting issue in your grandfather. Noted. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying something? I am a perfectly respectable man. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that is all. A good Cabernet Sauvignon. Nothing excessive. I don’t go around getting drunk, if that’s what you’re asking. I have always been a moderate drinker. It’s good for the heart, you know. And it helps me relax. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather intrusive. I came here to discuss my bruising, not my social habits.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I am obligated to ask these questions as part of a comprehensive medical evaluation. Alcohol consumption can interfere with blood clotting and exacerbate bleeding. Now, do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, really! Do I look like a smoker? I haven’t touched a cigarette in decades. It’s terrible for your health, you know. Absolutely dreadful. I’ve always been very careful about my health. I exercise, I eat a balanced diet… I’m not one of those people who ruins their body with harmful substances. Honestly, I’m starting to question the thoroughness of your evaluation. You’re asking me irrelevant questions while ignoring the obvious problem – this blood thinner! Can we please get back to that? I have a golf game to get to, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Farson. Let’s discuss your current medications. Aside from the Warfarin, are you taking any other prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I take a multivitamin, you know, to keep things topped up. And sometimes, when my knees act up, I take some ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. Nothing fancy. And… oh, yes! The fish oil capsules. Doctor recommended them for my heart. That's it, I think. Nothing else. Honestly, I’m a very simple case. I keep telling you, it’s the Warfarin. It’s either too strong, or I’m allergic to it, or something. Can we please order a blood test to confirm this? I’m starting to feel quite unwell just thinking about all of this.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, ibuprofen, fish oil. Noted. Alright, Mr. Farson, we will order a complete blood count, a PT/INR to assess your Warfarin levels, and a metabolic panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. However, I must stress that the blood test results will take some time to come back. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and report any new or worsening bleeding to the clinic immediately. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a topical cream to help with the bruising, although I don't expect it to be a miracle cure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Topical cream? Honestly, Doctor, I was hoping for something a bit more… definitive. But fine, topical cream. And avoid strenuous activity? That means no golf, doesn’t it? This is just dreadful. And waiting for blood test results? How long will that take? I have a life, you know. Very well. I understand. But if this doesn’t resolve quickly, I’m going to have to seek a second opinion. I’ve always trusted my own judgment when it comes to my health. So, yes, I understand. Can I at least get a note excusing me from my golf game? I’m sure my partners will understand… eventually.
DOCTOR: Here is a prescription for the topical cream, and here is a note excusing you from physical activity for a few days. The lab results should be available in approximately 48 hours. We will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are back. In the meantime, if you experience any signs of excessive bleeding – such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your stool, or severe bruising – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… please contact me as soon as the results are in. And I sincerely hope this resolves quickly. I have a golf game to get back to, you know. Thank you for your time… I suppose. .
