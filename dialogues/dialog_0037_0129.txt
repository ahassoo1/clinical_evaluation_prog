DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It's August 2nd. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Look, I told the nurse all this already. It's my… stool. It’s black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. It's probably that, isn't it? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard, I understand you're concerned about the black stool, and you've been taking pain medication for your arthritis. I apologize for any repetition, I just want to make sure I have a complete picture. It’s good you mentioned the pain pills. To clarify, when did you first notice the black stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t know exactly. A couple of days, maybe? I don’t sit around inspecting everything that goes down the toilet, Doctor. It just… was black. And like I said, I take those pills every day. What kind of question is that? It's not like it was a surprise party.
DOCTOR: No, of course not, Ms. Hatchard. It wasn’t meant to be a surprise question. It's just helpful to know the timeline to understand what might be going on. A couple of days is good to know. Have you noticed any changes in the amount of stool you’re passing?
PATIENT: Goodness. Now you want me to measure it? Doctor, are you serious? It's… normal, I suppose. Look, it's not like I'm blocked up or anything. It comes out fine. It’s just…darker. Honestly, I’m starting to think I shouldn’t have bothered coming. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize if my questions feel overly detailed. It’s not about measuring, just getting a sense if there's been a significant change. You said it comes out fine – does that mean no straining, no pain with bowel movements, and no feeling of incomplete evacuation?
PATIENT: No straining. No pain. And it all goes. Perfectly fine, like I said! You’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I’ve had arthritis for twenty years, I take pills, and now my stool is a different color. It's the pills, obviously. Can we just… confirm that and be done with it? I have a bingo game to get to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. I hear you, and I appreciate your patience. Black stool can have a number of causes, and while your pain medication is a possibility, we need to rule out other things just to be safe. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go. Other symptoms? Like what other symptoms? I haven’t got a fever or anything. My arthritis is acting up a bit, as usual, but that’s always happening. No blood, no… I don't know, no dramatic changes, Doctor. Just the black stool. And frankly, I'm starting to feel like you're accusing me of something.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I've given that impression, Ms. Hatchard. Absolutely not. I just need to gather all the information. Arthritis acting up is good to know. Have you experienced any fatigue, weakness, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Well, I’m 73! I always feel a bit tired, Doctor. And weakness? Of course, my hands ache. What do you think arthritis does, builds strength? Honestly, you're asking ridiculous questions. Look, I just want you to tell me it's the pills and send me on my way. I’ve got better things to do. Really. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your frustration. Let's proceed with a quick physical exam to assess your overall condition, and I will explain the potential causes and what we need to do next. It won’t take long. First, I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your abdomen. Is that alright?
