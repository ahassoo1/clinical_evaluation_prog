DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. So, you're here today... tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just... this patch of skin. It’s rather unsightly, honestly. On my left forearm. It’s… well, it’s not quite a color a person should be, is it? I noticed it about, oh, three weeks ago, I’d say. Right after we got back from the lake.
DOCTOR: "Not quite a color a person should be," you say. Hmm. And it started after a trip to the lake, three weeks ago. Okay. Can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not red, not exactly. More… sort of a bruised purple-grey? And it’s flat. Not raised or anything. It doesn’t hurt, per se, but if I rub against it… it feels a bit… rough. Like old leather, almost. And it’s spreading, I think. Just a little, but it is getting bigger. Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like it. And I certainly don’t want anything like it.
DOCTOR: Bruised purple-grey, flat, rough to the touch… spreading. And it started after your time at the lake. Alright. Have you noticed any itching, blistering, or changes in the skin around it?
PATIENT: No, no blistering. And it doesn’t itch, thankfully. The skin around it… well, it’s a bit dry, I suppose. But I always have dry skin, to be honest. It’s just… there. It’s the color that’s concerning. Really, it’s quite… uncouth looking. I do try to keep up appearances, you know. My husband… he has standards.
DOCTOR: Right. No itching, no blistering, just some general dryness. And you’re concerned about the appearance, understandable. Let's have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. It's rather… unpleasant to discuss without someone actually looking at it. I’ve been trying to cover it with sleeves, but it’s August! You can’t very well wear long sleeves in this heat.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. It does appear somewhat atypical. No warmth to the touch, no swelling. Have you been exposed to any new chemicals, plants, or insects recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not that I know of. We did walk through some rather overgrown areas around the lake, but I always make sure to stay on the paths. And I certainly wouldn't touch anything. My mother always warned me about… everything. Plants, insects, strangers… It's probably just some… lake thing. But it really is unsightly. I haven't worn my good bracelets in weeks.
DOCTOR: "Some lake thing." Right. Well, it’s difficult to say definitively without some further investigation. It could be a contact dermatitis, even if you didn't directly touch anything – sometimes it's airborne. However, the roughness and the color are… less typical. I’m going to order a skin biopsy, just to be safe. It will allow us to determine exactly what we're dealing with. It’s a simple procedure. We’ll numb the area first, of course. Do you have any history of skin cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Skin cancer? Good heavens, no! My family is very… robust. We have excellent genes, you know. My grandmother lived to be ninety-seven, and she never even looked her age. A biopsy… that sounds rather… drastic. Is it absolutely necessary? It seems a bit much for a patch of… discoloration. I do try to avoid unnecessary medical procedures, if you understand. All those germs… and the waiting!
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your family’s robustness, Ms. Bartock, it's important to rule out anything serious. A biopsy is the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. It's a quick procedure, and the risk is minimal. It's far better to be safe than sorry, especially when dealing with changes in the skin. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and it usually takes about a week to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend keeping the area clean and dry, and avoiding any potential irritants. Do you have any allergies to local anesthetics?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose if you insist. A week… that is a long time to be worrying. And I do hate waiting. As for allergies… my mother always said I was terribly sensitive. I remember once, when I was a child, we had a rather unfortunate incident with a perfume. I broke out in hives, terribly itchy. It was lilac, I believe. Or maybe it was hyacinth. Something floral, anyway. I’ve been very cautious with scents ever since.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll use a lidocaine anesthetic, but we can avoid anything with a floral scent, just to be cautious. Before we proceed with the biopsy, I want to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any other unusual skin changes anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just this… this unfortunate patch. Honestly, it’s the only thing. I take very good care of myself, you know. Moisturize daily, avoid the sun… I really don’t understand where this could have come from. Perhaps it's the lake water? Though it was a very reputable lake.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s proceed with the biopsy. I’ll need you to sign this consent form. It outlines the procedure, potential risks, and benefits. Once that’s done, we can get started. After the procedure, I’ll give you instructions on how to care for the area. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A consent form… always so many things to sign. Risks… benefits… Well, I suppose the benefit is getting rid of this unsightly patch. I don't see any mention of germs, do I? And will it leave a scar? I really must look presentable for the garden club meeting next month.
DOCTOR: "Minimal scarring is possible," it states here. We take every precaution to minimize any cosmetic impact. And while there is a small risk of infection, we will provide you with detailed instructions on wound care to prevent that. We’ll clean the area thoroughly before and after the procedure, and apply a sterile bandage. Now, if you’re ready, we can proceed. Do you have any further questions before I begin?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Though I still think it’s all rather excessive for a bit of discoloration. But if you insist… very well. Let’s get it over with. I trust you’re very careful? My mother always said a good doctor is worth their weight in gold.
DOCTOR: Alright, we're all finished. I've applied a bandage to the area. Keep it clean and dry for the next 24 hours. Avoid any strenuous activity that might irritate the wound. You may experience some mild discomfort or swelling, but that should subside within a few days. If you notice any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus, please contact the office immediately. The lab results should be back in about a week, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, I believe you’ve covered everything. Though I do wish this hadn’t been necessary. It’s just… all so unpleasant. I suppose I’ll go home now and try to forget about it. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Bartock. .
