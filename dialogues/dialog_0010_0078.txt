DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a little…reset, I suppose. A jumpstart to feeling like myself again. I’m not quite sure how to explain it beyond that.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Stuck” and needing a “reset” are perfectly valid ways to describe how you’re feeling. It sounds like you’re experiencing some general malaise, perhaps?
PATIENT: Malaise…yes, that feels right. It’s not any one thing, you see. I don’t have a terrible pain, or a cough, or anything specific like that. Just…low energy, not sleeping well, and generally feeling…blah. It’s been going on for a few months now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to feel…brighter, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Pitzel. Several months of low energy and disrupted sleep – that’s certainly enough to warrant a closer look. To help me understand what might be going on, let’s start with a bit more detail. Could you tell me a little about your sleep?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I usually go to bed around ten, ten-thirty. But I find myself waking up several times during the night. Not always for a specific reason – sometimes I just…am awake. And then it’s hard to get back to sleep. I’ve tried warm milk, reading…nothing seems to really help consistently. And when I do sleep, I don’t feel very rested in the morning. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Interrupted sleep is incredibly disruptive. And the lack of feeling rested afterwards makes everything harder. Now, regarding your energy levels…can you describe what “low energy” feels like for you?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t do things, Doctor. I still go to work, I keep up with the house. But everything feels…heavier. It takes more effort to motivate myself, even for things I usually enjoy. And by the end of the day, I’m just…exhausted. Not physically, necessarily, but mentally drained. It’s like I’m running on empty, even after a full night’s…attempted sleep. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly well, Ms. Pitzel. It sounds like you’re experiencing significant fatigue, and it’s impacting your daily life, even if you’re still managing to get things done. Let’s broaden the picture a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My appetite…hasn’t been great, I suppose. I’m not really hungry, not like I used to be. I still eat, because I know I need to, but I don’t really enjoy food the way I once did. And yes, I think I’ve lost a little weight. Nothing drastic, maybe five or ten pounds, but enough that my clothes feel a little looser. I hadn't really connected that to everything else, actually. It's been gradual.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I've been generally healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, as I'm retired, and I go for my yearly check-ups. They haven't flagged anything significant in the past few years. My husband, Ricardo, has some high blood pressure, but I don't. I'm not on any regular medications, either. Just an occasional ibuprofen for a headache, if needed.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see your Medicare information and recent check-up history here. No significant findings noted, as you said. And you mentioned your husband Ricardo has high blood pressure. Is there any family history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question. My mother…she was always a bit…melancholy, I suppose. Not a formal diagnosis or anything, but she did struggle with sadness a lot. And my aunt, on my father’s side, was in a hospital for a while when I was a child, but we didn’t really talk about what was wrong. So, there might be something, yes, but it wasn't openly discussed. It's… a bit of a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Pitzel. It’s often difficult to discuss family history, especially when it involves sensitive topics. Knowing this information is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I've always been very careful about my health. I believe in moderation, and taking care of myself. I enjoy gardening, and walking in the park, when the weather permits. Those are my simple pleasures.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully I don’t have any allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. That's one thing I can say with certainty! I'm quite lucky in that regard, I suppose. So, no allergies to report.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Pitzel, thank you for providing me with all of this information. Based on what you've told me – the prolonged fatigue, disrupted sleep, decreased appetite, and a family history of melancholy – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes first. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. This will help us determine if there’s a physical explanation for how you’re feeling. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need to rule out anything physical. Blood work is fine with me. I'd rather be thorough. I want to get to the bottom of this, and feel like myself again. So, yes, please, let's do the blood work. Where do we go from there?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a lab order now. The phlebotomy department is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of drawing the samples. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you’re feeling overwhelmed or having any thoughts of harming yourself, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a crisis hotline or mental health professional. I can provide you with some resources if you’d like. Once we have the bloodwork results, we can revisit this conversation. I might recommend a questionnaire designed to screen for depression, if the bloodwork is normal. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough, and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you offering the resources, that’s very kind. I don’t anticipate needing them, but it’s good to know they are available. A questionnaire sounds perfectly reasonable as well. I’ll go down to the phlebotomy department now. And I will be sure to contact the clinic once the results are back. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and I hope you feel a little more at ease knowing we’re working towards a solution.
