DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Heat, mostly. Can't take it like I used to. It’s ridiculous, really. Always been able to work in the sun, you know? Painting, construction… all outdoors. Now? Forget about it. Feel like I’m gonna melt. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Right. The heat. Well, that is quite…common this time of year. Though I suppose it’s affecting everyone differently. But feeling unwell simply because of the heat is… rather vague, isn't it?
PATIENT: Vague? I’m the one sitting here, Doc, not you. I know how I feel. It's not vague to me. And it’s not just a little warm, it’s… oppressive. Makes my head spin, makes me tired. Used to be able to go all day, now I'm beat after a couple hours. And frankly, a man my age shouldn't be feeling this way.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. However, simply stating you “feel unwell” doesn’t give me much to work with. We need to be precise. When did this start?
PATIENT: Precise? Alright, alright. Let's see… it really started last summer, I reckon. Noticed it getting harder, a little slower. Thought it was just… getting older, you know? But this year it’s worse. Much worse. Like, I had to stop working on Mrs. Henderson’s fence just last week. Couldn’t even finish a single panel. Kept getting dizzy, had to sit down. That was July 18th, I believe. Yes, July 18th. Good memory, I’ve always had a good memory.
DOCTOR: July 18th… dizziness. And you’ve experienced this consistently since last summer, worsening this year. Are there any other symptoms accompanying the dizziness?
PATIENT: Accompanying? Hmm… well, yeah, actually. Thirsty, always thirsty. More than usual, anyway. And… kinda weak. Like my legs are heavy, you know? Not cramping, just… heavy. And I've been a bit… off, I suppose. Not myself. More irritable. My niece keeps telling me to slow down, says I’m snapping at everyone. Which is… probably true, now that I think about it. Don't usually lose my temper like that.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst, weakness in the legs, irritability… all noted. And are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Definitely not. And my appetite’s… normal, I guess. Still eat a good breakfast, always have. Big man needs his fuel, you know? Though, thinking about it, maybe not as much lunch lately. Just don’t feel like it when it’s so hot. But no, definitely not sick to my stomach or anything. I’m a practical man, Doc, I’d know if I was getting sick.
DOCTOR: Right. No nausea or vomiting, normal breakfast, decreased lunch. Let's move on to your medical history, Mr. Coby. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, never. Strong heart, always been active. Never had any trouble with that. Diabetes… the doctor mentioned pre-diabetes a couple years back, told me to watch my sugar. I tried, a bit. Cut back on sweets, mostly. But I didn't really… follow through. I figured a little sugar wasn't gonna hurt. And honestly, Doc, I’ve always been a bit skeptical of doctors. Always telling you to do this and don’t do that.
DOCTOR: Pre-diabetes, non-compliant with dietary recommendations… I see. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed 'em, thank goodness. Hospitalizations… only once. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Silly thing to do, really. That was… oh, must've been sixty years ago. Nothing since. I’m a tough man, Doc. Don't break easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, one childhood arm fracture. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. The arthritis is acting up sometimes. It's an over-the-counter thing, you can get it at any drugstore. Aleve, I think it's called. And occasionally, if I get a bad headache, I'll take some ibuprofen. That's about it. Nothing fancy. I prefer to keep things natural, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Aleve for arthritis, ibuprofen PRN for headaches. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with penicillin or anything like that. My wife—she was allergic to bees, poor woman. But me? Never had a problem. I'm a pretty sturdy guy, Doc. Don't react to much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. Just some basic vitals, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examination? Fine, fine. Get it over with. Don't see the point, honestly, but if you gotta poke and prod… go ahead. Just don’t take too long, I’ve got things to do. And be gentle, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please remain still. 158 over 92. Elevated. 88 and regular. 98.6 Fahrenheit. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds normal, but slightly rapid. No edema. Slight redness to knuckles, consistent with arthritis. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Coby. Your vitals indicate elevated blood pressure. The examination reveals no acute findings, beyond the expected signs of arthritis. Given your history and symptoms, along with the elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a hemoglobin A1c test. This will help us assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and check for elevated blood sugar. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding… Honestly, Doc, you’re making a big deal out of nothing. I just need a little rest, that’s all. But… alright. If you insist. Just… get it over with quickly. And tell me what all this means, alright? I don't want a lot of medical jargon, just plain English. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: The blood work will help rule out several possibilities. Primarily, we're looking to see if your blood sugar levels are elevated, which would indicate diabetes. We also want to assess your kidney function, as dehydration can affect that, and rule out any electrolyte imbalances. And, of course, to get a baseline assessment of your overall health, given your elevated blood pressure. The lab is just down the hall. Once you’ve had your blood drawn, you can come back and we'll discuss the results. It should take about a week to come back. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding strenuous activity. If you experience any dizziness, nausea, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you proceed?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Now you’re just trying to scare me. I just need a little rest, I tell ya. Alright, alright, fluids and rest. I can manage that. A week, huh? Seems like a long time. “Comprehensive Metabolic Panel…” Honestly, Doc, why can’t you just say “check my blood”? All this fancy talk… Never mind. I’ll go do it. Just… don’t expect miracles. I’m a tough man, remember?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. I will review the results as soon as they are available. I expect you to follow up with me once they are. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to monitor your symptoms and avoid any strenuous activity. If your condition worsens, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. I trust you'll take care of yourself. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Assist me with? No, I think that’s enough poking and prodding for one day. Just… try not to make a mountain out of a molehill, alright? I’ve lived a long life, Doc, and I’ve survived worse than a little heat. I’ll follow your instructions… I suppose. No, that’s all. I’ll be going now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. Please feel free to contact the office if any questions or concerns arise. Have a good day.
