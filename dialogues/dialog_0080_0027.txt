DOCTOR: Hi Josie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Look, it's this… stuff. Coming up. Bad heartburn, I guess. Been happening for a while now, honestly. Don't have time for this, you know? Busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Stuff coming up,” and heartburn… that gives me a starting point. When you say “a while now,” could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Months, probably. Six, maybe? Hard to say. I don't keep a calendar of my stomach problems, Doctor. It comes and goes. Worse when I lie down, usually. And after I eat, of course. Though, what doesn't bother it after I eat? Honestly.
DOCTOR: Right, months, worse lying down and after eating. That’s helpful. Does it feel like a burning sensation, or is it more like… indigestion?
PATIENT: Burning, yeah. Definitely burning. Right here, in my chest. Feels like fire, sometimes. And then… well, then it comes back up. Not pleasant. Look, I eat, I work, I sleep. I don't need a detailed description of my insides, alright? Just tell me how to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a burning sensation in your chest, coming up… sounds like classic heartburn. And I appreciate you wanting to get straight to a solution. Before we jump to that, just to be thorough, have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No. I eat a perfectly good dinner every night, don’t I? Weight loss? Absolutely not. I'm a thin man, always have been. It's genetics, Doctor. And a fast metabolism. I haven't shrunk, if that's what you're getting at. Honestly, this is taking too long. Are you going to give me something or what?
DOCTOR: Alright, no difficulty swallowing, no weight loss. Good. And I understand your frustration – I want to get you feeling better as quickly as possible. To help me figure out the best course of action, could you tell me a little about what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Ugh. What do I eat? I eat food, Doctor! Steak, mostly. Potatoes. Sometimes sausage. I’m a Polish man, what do you expect, salads? I don’t need a lecture on healthy eating, alright? I like what I like. And it’s not causing me any serious problems. Just a bit of… discomfort. Is that what you want to know? A detailed menu? Because I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, steak, potatoes, sausage… a fairly rich diet. And you feel it's just discomfort. Do you ever take anything for it now - antacids, anything like that?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Those little chalky things. Tums, I think they’re called? They help a bit, but not always. And you have to take, like, a million of them. It's just a temporary fix, though, isn't it? That’s why I’m here. I want something that actually works. Not something I have to pop all day long. Look, I have a business to run, Doctor. I can't be swallowing pills every hour.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tums help some, but not consistently, and you’re looking for a more long-term solution. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Disgusting habit. And alcohol… maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. A good Polish beer, of course. Nothing fancy. It doesn't seem to make it worse, though. Honestly, I don’t think that’s the problem. It’s the food. It’s always the food. Can we just get to the medicine now? I have a meeting at three.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional beer. Okay. Let's do a quick exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It'll only take a minute. Then we can talk about options. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. Just… be quick about it. And don't poke too hard. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness when I press here, just below your breastbone. It doesn't seem to be anything alarming, but it's consistent with heartburn. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it sounds like you're dealing with classic gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD.
PATIENT: GERD? Another fancy name for a stomach ache? Look, I don’t need a diagnosis, I need a solution. Pills? Diet? What am I looking at here? And don't tell me to eat salads. I’m warning you. Just get to the point, Doctor. I haven't got time for a lecture.
DOCTOR: Okay, no lecture, I promise. For GERD, we have a few options. We could start with a medication called a proton pump inhibitor – PPI for short. It reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes. That often helps a lot. We could also talk about lifestyle changes, besides salads, like eating smaller meals, not lying down right after eating, and elevating the head of your bed. Would you be open to trying a PPI?
PATIENT: Pills… fine. If it gets rid of this… stuff. What kind? Do they have side effects? I don’t want to be running to the bathroom all day. And how long do I have to take them? I'm not looking for a life sentence, Doctor. Just something to get me through a few meetings.
DOCTOR: Okay, a common one is Omeprazole. Side effects are usually mild – maybe a headache or diarrhea in some people, but serious side effects are rare. We usually start with a course of 20mg once a day for 4-8 weeks, and see how you respond. If that helps, we can talk about continuing it long-term, or trying a lower dose. I’ll write you a prescription for Omeprazole 20mg, to be taken once daily, in the morning. I also want you to try and eat smaller meals, and avoid lying down for at least 3 hours after eating. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… alright, alright. I can try. Three hours… that's a long time. But I need to be functional, alright? Meetings, business… I can’t be waiting around for three hours after every bite. Write the prescription. Let's get this over with. And if it doesn't work, I'm coming back, and we're having a serious conversation. Don't waste my time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Here you go. Omeprazole 20mg, once daily. I’ll also give you a handout with information about GERD and lifestyle modifications. If you don't see improvement within a couple of weeks, or if your symptoms worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We may need to consider further testing, like an endoscopy, to rule out any other issues. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… let’s hope this works. I have things to do. Thank you, Doctor. I’m leaving now. .
