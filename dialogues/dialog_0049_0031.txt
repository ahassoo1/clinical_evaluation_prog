DOCTOR: Good morning. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, Ms. Kreckel, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. And I have… a funny heartbeat sometimes, you see. The doctor back home said it was… atrial fibrillation, I think that’s what he called it. It’s been happening on and off for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation… yes. And this leg swelling – when did you first notice that, and is it just the left leg?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. The swelling… it started maybe a week ago, give or take a few days. And yes, it’s only the left leg. It’s not… painful exactly, more just… big. And sort of warm, if that makes sense. It feels different than just a normal ache.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just the left leg, started about a week ago, warm to the touch, not particularly painful. And this…funny heartbeat, how often would you say it happens?
PATIENT: Oh, the heartbeat… it’s hard to say. Some days I don’t notice it at all. Other days… maybe a couple of times a day it feels like it’s fluttering. It doesn't last long, thankfully. Just a few seconds, usually. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. I don't know if it’s related to the leg, though.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It could be related, it could not. We’ll have to investigate. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside either of these issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I've been a little… tired lately, now that you mention it. But I just thought that was because I’ve been busy with work. I haven't really had much energy. And I've been a bit breathless going up the stairs, but… that could be the weight of the leg, I suppose. It's hard to tell. I don't know if that’s normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and shortness of breath... Right. And you said you’ve been busy with work. What kind of work do you do, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: I'm a computer science teacher, Doctor. Postsecondary. So I teach at the college. It's a lot of grading and making sure the students understand everything. It keeps me on my feet, certainly. I enjoy it, when I have the energy for it.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. A sedentary job can certainly contribute to some of these issues. Now, let’s have a look at your leg. Could you please sit on the examination table and elevate your left leg for me?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Yes, of course. A sedentary job... well, I wouldn’t say sedentary exactly, but… I understand. Is this alright? It feels a little stiff.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Yes, there's definite edema present. And it is warmer than your right leg. No obvious signs of injury. Skin looks normal, no redness or lesions. Pulses are present, but slightly weaker on the left side. It appears we have some venous insufficiency, potentially complicated by a deep vein thrombosis. We need to rule that out immediately.
PATIENT: Deep vein… what now? That sounds… serious. Venous insufficiency… is that just the swelling? I’m not sure I understand. And what does ‘rule it out’ mean? Is it something bad? I’m a little worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A deep vein thrombosis – DVT, for short – is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. It can be quite dangerous if it travels to the lungs. Venous insufficiency means the valves in your veins aren’t working properly, causing blood to pool in your legs and resulting in swelling. “Ruling it out” means we need to do some tests to see if you have a clot. We'll start with a Doppler ultrasound. It’s non-invasive. It could be nothing, but we need to be certain. We’re going to get the technician in to do that right away.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot… that does sound very bad. I’ve heard about those. So, the ultrasound will show if there's one? Is it… painful? And will it take long? I have a class this afternoon, so I hope it won’t keep me too long.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound shouldn’t be painful, Ms. Kreckel. It's just a probe on your leg. It might be a little cold. As for how long… it shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes. I’ll have the technician come in shortly. In the meantime, I’m going to order some blood work to check for other potential causes of your symptoms. It’s standard procedure. Don’t worry too much. We're just being thorough.
PATIENT: Okay… 30-45 minutes. And blood work, too. Alright. It’s just… a lot. Is there anything I should… do in the meantime? Like, should I be moving my foot, or… not moving it? I don't want to make it worse. I suppose I should just wait for the technician?
DOCTOR: For now, avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Gentle ankle pumps – point your toes up and down – can help with circulation. But do not massage your leg. We don't want to risk dislodging anything if there is a clot present. The technician will be in shortly to start the ultrasound. Try to relax. We’ll know more once we have the results.
PATIENT: Alright. No massage, gentle ankle pumps. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I will try to relax. It's just… difficult. I hope everything is alright. I’ll just… wait here then. .
