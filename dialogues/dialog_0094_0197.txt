DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be blunt, I need a card so I can keep driving. A ride-share, taxi, commercial driver… whatever it’s called these days. I just want to make sure I'm still allowed to, you know? I’ve been doing this a long time, and I’d like to continue if I can. I'm San, by the way.
DOCTOR: Of course, San. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to ensure you’re safe and able to continue driving. We can certainly assess that for you. So, to start, are you experiencing any health issues at all that might affect your ability to drive safely?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really. My knees ache a bit, getting in and out of the truck, but that's just old age. And sometimes my hands get a little stiff in the cold, but nothing I can’t manage. I had a bit of the flu last winter, but I recovered fully. Honestly, I feel pretty good for seventy. I keep busy, you know? Just want to get this card sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, San. It’s excellent that you’re staying active. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about past illnesses, surgeries, medications, and family history?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Ask away. I have a pretty good memory, so I should be able to answer. Though, it was a long time ago when I had some of those things… my first husband always said I remembered everything except where I put my keys.
DOCTOR: That’s a helpful trait, remembering details! Let’s start with past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes, many years ago. I was put on medication for it, but I haven’t taken anything in… oh, goodness, maybe fifteen years? The doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. I really watch what I eat, and I walk every day. No diabetes, no heart problems… I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, but that was it. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out when I was in my thirties. Is that significant?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, San. Yes, the gallbladder removal is good to know, but it doesn't necessarily impact your driving ability. The history of controlled hypertension is also important. We'll want to check your blood pressure today to confirm it’s still well-managed. Any past surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. I broke my wrist once when I was a child, climbing a tree, but that healed just fine. Nothing else. I’ve been pretty lucky, really. Mostly just bumps and bruises over the years. I used to work in the logging business, and that… well, that had its share of scrapes. But nothing major requiring surgery. Oh! Wait... I had a hysterectomy when I was forty. That's right. A long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for thinking so hard, San. It’s good to have a complete picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, if they’re really bothering me. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. My mother always said they were the devil's work. She wasn't a fan of doctors, either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get hay fever in the spring, but that's just a nuisance. Nothing serious. I've never had a bad reaction to any medication, as far as I can remember. I used to work around a lot of different chemicals in the logging business, but nothing ever bothered me. I think I'm pretty resilient. Maybe I'm just lucky.
DOCTOR: You certainly seem to be, San. Now, if you don’t mind me asking, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, but she had… let me think… arthritis, mostly. And she had some heart trouble towards the end. My father died young, in his sixties, from a stroke. I have a brother, he's still alive, and he’s got high cholesterol, but he’s doing okay. No history of anything really serious on either side, as far as I know. Everyone in my family was pretty stubborn, if that counts.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, San. And finally, a few quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had a drink in… oh, maybe ten years? I just didn't enjoy it anymore. And recreational drugs? Heavens no. Not my cup of tea. I need a clear head for my driving, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, San. That gives me a good overview of your medical background. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I don't mind at all. The sooner we get this done, the better. I have a few fares lined up this afternoon, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. After that, I’ll take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. It won’t take long. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. I used to be able to hold my breath for a very long time when I was younger, underwater logging, you know. Though, not anymore.
DOCTOR: “Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, meaning I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling sounds.” “Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you cross your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead. Though, my knees might protest a little. They aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: “Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Could you touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Is that alright? I hope I'm not too shaky.
DOCTOR: “Very good, San. No tremors detected. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you stand up and try to balance on one leg for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh dear. That's harder than it looks! My knees are really complaining now.
DOCTOR: “You did very well, San. A little wobble is perfectly normal at your age. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat.” “Okay, San. That completes the physical exam. Everything looks good overall. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerning given your age and activity level. The neurological exam was normal, and your ears, eyes, and throat are clear.” “I’d like to order some blood work just to get a baseline and check your cholesterol levels. It’s a routine precaution.”
PATIENT: That sounds sensible. Blood work is fine. Anything to get this card sorted. So, do I need to come back for that? And when will I be able to… you know… drive again? I have a few appointments I need to keep.
DOCTOR: “Yes, you’ll need to come back to the lab for the blood work. The order will be sent electronically, and you can go to any lab that accepts your Medicare insurance. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. It should be fairly quick.” “As for driving… based on my exam today, there are no immediate restrictions. You are safe to continue driving as usual while we await the blood work results. However, once the results come back, we may need to discuss further steps, such as a more comprehensive cardiac evaluation, if your cholesterol is significantly elevated.” “Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. So, I can keep driving for now, but they might want to check my heart later if the blood work isn't good? That sounds fair. And the lab will call me… okay. I'll keep an eye out for that. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very thorough. I appreciate it. Is there any paperwork I need to fill out? Or am I all set?
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, San. Yes, you’re all set for now. The lab will contact you directly to schedule the appointment. There’s no additional paperwork needed from my end. I’ll also send a summary of our visit to your primary care physician.” “Thank you for coming in today. If you have any questions or concerns before the blood work results come back, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Drive safely, San!”
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Doctor Gegan. Thank you again for everything. I will! And I appreciate your patience. .
