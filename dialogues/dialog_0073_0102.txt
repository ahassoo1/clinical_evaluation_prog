DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what brings me in? It’s… well, it’s hard to say exactly. I just feel… a lot of… heavy breathing, I suppose. Lots of sighs. My daughter, she was the one who really told me to come. She said I was doing it all the time. I don’t really notice it, you see?
DOCTOR: Heavy breathing… and sighs. Right. And your daughter noticed this happening frequently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She says… oh, goodness, what was it? Something about worrying. She worries a lot, that one. Always has. I think… I think it's been happening for a little while now, but like I said, I don't pay much attention. It just… happens. It doesn’t hurt, you understand? Just… feels heavy.
DOCTOR: No pain, just a feeling of heaviness. And has this been interfering with anything?
PATIENT: Interfering…? Hmm. Not really, I don’t think so. Maybe… maybe I get a little tired easier. But I’m eighty years old! I get tired easy these days, whether I’m sighing or not. It’s just… well, my daughter gets upset when she sees me doing it. She thinks it means something serious.
DOCTOR: I see. So, primarily your daughter’s concern has prompted this visit. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms accompanying this… heavy breathing?
PATIENT: No, no other symptoms. Nothing I can think of. I sleep alright, eat alright… sometimes my stomach gets a little upset, but that happens. Old age, you know? I'm not sure what else I’d even notice, to be honest. My mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination, just to get a baseline. I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. It's a simple procedure, Mr. Vantine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My lungs, you say? Haven't thought about my lungs in years.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just take a deep breath in for me… and out… good. Now another one. Okay… and now your heart. Hmm. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern. Your lungs sound… a bit diminished, but again, not alarming. Oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s… acceptable, but on the lower end.
PATIENT: Lower end? Oh dear. Is that bad? I don’t… I don’t really understand all this doctor talk. My wife, she used to know all about these things. She was a nurse, you see. A very good one.
DOCTOR: It's not bad necessarily, Mr. Vantine, but it's not optimal. It simply means your body isn't getting quite as much oxygen as it could. It could be a number of things. Given your age and… diminished lung sounds, it could be some mild age-related changes in your lungs. It’s not uncommon. Do you have any history of smoking, or exposure to environmental irritants like dust or fumes?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she didn’t approve. As for dust and fumes… well, I worked with the police for a long time. Lots of time outdoors. Sometimes… sometimes we’d be near fires. Or… or in dusty areas. But that was a long time ago. Before my retirement. It doesn’t seem to matter much, does it? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, but as you say, it was a long time ago. I'd like to order a chest X-ray, just to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. And a basic blood test to rule out any underlying issues. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh… an X-ray? I don’t like… I don’t like those machines. All the… the radiation. Is it safe, Doctor? My daughter… she worries about things like that. She reads a lot of things on the internet. But blood test… that’s alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal, Mr. Vantine. It's a very standard procedure, and the benefits of getting a proper diagnosis far outweigh the risks. However, if you are truly averse to it, we can proceed without it, but it will make it more difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. As for the blood test, it shouldn't take long at all. We'll just need a small sample. Let's do the blood test now, and then we can discuss the X-ray further. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Do the blood test. And… and if you think the X-ray is important, then… then I’ll do it. But… maybe not today. Give me a chance to… think about it. My daughter… I need to talk to her first. She always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll get the blood test done now. The lab technician will be in shortly. I'll have the results sent to me, and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and if your breathing becomes significantly worse, please go to the nearest emergency room. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. It’s just… getting old is hard, you know? My wife… she would have known what to do. But she's… she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. That will be all for today, Mr. Vantine. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Have a good day. .
