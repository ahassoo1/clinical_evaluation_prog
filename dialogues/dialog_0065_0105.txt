DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery, that is. My wife and I… we talked it over, and this is the first step, right? For the check-up before? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I don't remember all the details they explained on the phone.
DOCTOR: Surgery, yes. Right. Well, we certainly need to establish if you’re a suitable candidate first. And clarify everything, of course. It’s… prudent to be informed. Let's start with the basics. How long have you been considering weight loss surgery, and what led you to this decision?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. A while, I guess. A few months, maybe? Longer? It's hard to say exactly. It wasn't one big thing, Doctor. Just… things getting harder. You know? Walking, getting around… even just playing with my kids. It’s just… tiring. My wife, she was really worried about my health, and she started looking into options. That got me thinking, and then we talked to a specialist… and here I am. I don't really remember which specialist, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. “Things getting harder.” I understand. It’s… common. And the specialist… that is important. Do you recall the name of the clinic or hospital where you saw them?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. It was… a drive. Not too far, but not local, either. Everything feels a bit mixed up, to be honest. It was a bigger place, I think? Lots of people. I just… I mostly remember the forms I had to fill out, and then the initial talk with the doctor. I’m really sorry I can’t be more helpful. I just wasn’t expecting to be asked so specifically about it.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. We’ll try to piece things together. Let’s move on, then. Regardless of who you saw initially, we need to assess your current health status. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yeah. The doctor told me a while back. I take pills for it, usually. But… I forget sometimes. My wife reminds me. Other than that… not that I know of. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time, honestly. Just for check-ups, mostly. Nothing serious, usually. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things. High blood pressure… and inconsistent medication adherence. We’ll need to get a current reading, of course. And what medications are you currently taking, even if sporadically, for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. It’s a white pill. Small, round. I think it’s… Lisinopril? Or something like that. It starts with an L. I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street. Honestly, I just take whatever they give me. My wife handles most of that stuff. I'm terrible with names, even for pills. Is that okay? I’m really trying to remember, but it's just… a blur.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril is a good start. We’ll verify that with the pharmacy records. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks when we go to new restaurants, but I always tell her no. She's very careful. She worries a lot, which is good, I guess. I've eaten pretty much everything, and never had a problem. Sorry I can't be more helpful again, Doctor. It feels like my memory's just… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. We’ll proceed with a physical examination to get a better baseline assessment. It's standard procedure. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and measure your vital signs. Please lie back on the examination table. And… try to recall anything relevant about your medical history if you can. It’s helpful, even if it seems insignificant.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Examination table, right. I'll try to think. I think… I had chickenpox as a kid? And I broke my arm once, playing football. That was a long time ago, though. Does that count? I'll just… lie down.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Please remove your shirt and lie flat. We’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure is 150/90. Elevated, as expected given your history. Heart rate is 82, regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Mildly obese, but no significant findings. We’ll need some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. Specifically, a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… thorough. Blood work, right. That’s… fine. Is that a lot of needles? My wife said something about needles… and I don’t really like them. Not that I’m scared, exactly… just… uncomfortable. And… what does all that mean? Complete metabolic… and lipid… and… I just want to make sure I'm healthy enough for the surgery, that's all. I don't need to know everything, do I?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard blood draw, Mr. Kochubey. A few vials. Necessary to assess your suitability for surgery, as you stated. And yes, knowing the results is necessary. It’s not about wanting to know, it’s about informed medical decision-making. We need to understand your baseline health status. The complete metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. The lipid panel assesses your cholesterol levels. The thyroid test… well, it rules out thyroid issues that can affect your weight. It’s not complicated. I'll write the order for the lab work now. You can go to the lab just down the hall. They'll take care of it. Once you have those results, schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss them.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I understand. It's just… a lot of information. A few vials, right? And down the hall. I can do that. So… that’s it for now? Just the blood work and then come back? I'll try to remember everything you said. And… I'll tell my wife. She'll probably have questions. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it for now. Blood work, then a follow-up appointment. And I suggest she accompany you. It’s always helpful to have another perspective. Here’s the order. The lab technician will explain the process. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. .
