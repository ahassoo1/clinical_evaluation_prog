DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to know more about my family… way back. I hear you can do tests with… with spit? To see where my people come from. I am Marshallese, but… I want to know more about before that, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. You're interested in exploring your ancestry – getting a deeper look at your family history beyond your Marshallese heritage. And you’ve heard about ancestry testing through saliva samples, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My niece, she did one. Showed me the paper. Lots of names and places I never heard of. She said it was easy. Just a little spit in a tube. I want to know… where did my family come from, before the islands? It’s okay if you can’t, but I thought I would ask.
DOCTOR: It’s a good question, Mr. Scobie, and a very valid one. Those ancestry tests can be quite informative. However, it’s important to understand what they tell us, and what they don't. They analyze your DNA, looking for patterns that are common in different populations. It can give you a broad overview of your ethnic origins, but it’s not a perfect science. It won’t tell you exactly where your specific ancestors lived, or their stories. Before we proceed with ordering a test, let’s talk a bit about your family history as you know it. You mentioned being Marshallese. Do you know anything about your parents’ or grandparents’ origins within the Marshall Islands?
PATIENT: Well… my mama, she came from Arno Atoll. Papa, from Jaluit. That’s all I really know. They didn’t talk much about before them. They just… were. We didn’t have much… books or anything. Everything was stories, and I forget so much now, you see. Old man’s memory. But they were good people. Fishermen, mostly. And church. Lots of church. Is the test… expensive? I have Medicare, does it pay?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Scobie. Arno and Jaluit—those are good starting points. And it's completely understandable that family stories fade with time. We work with several reputable ancestry testing companies, and the cost varies. Let me check what Medicare covers for these types of genetic tests. It’s unlikely to cover it solely for ancestry purposes, as it’s generally considered an elective test. However, sometimes if there’s a medical reason—for example, if there’s a family history of a specific genetic condition—Medicare might contribute. Just one moment… Okay, it appears that Medicare does not typically cover ancestry testing. The cost of the tests themselves range from around $99 to several hundred dollars, depending on the company and the level of detail they provide. Would you like me to show you some options and what they offer?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a lot. I didn’t think it would be that much. Maybe I should just forget it then. It’s a nice thought, knowing… but not worth maybe two hundred dollars, you know? I’m a simple man. I make little boats. Wood boats. That’s enough family for me, I think. Thank you for looking though, Doctor. You were very kind.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Scobie. It’s perfectly reasonable to prioritize your resources, and it sounds like you have a rich and fulfilling life already. And making wooden boats is a wonderful family tradition. Now, even though we won’t be pursuing the ancestry test today, are you here for any other health concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No. Just the family thing. I thought I'd ask. I'm… getting old. Thought maybe I'd learn something before it’s too late. But it's alright. Thank you for your time. You were very helpful. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you do think of any other health concerns, or have questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. And enjoy making your boats – they sound beautiful. Have a good day. .
