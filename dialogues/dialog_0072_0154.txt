DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s… the waterworks, really. They bother me. A lot. It keeps happening, and it’s… unpleasant. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been… a while now. Is that enough information? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: "The waterworks," alright. And you say this has been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. Months, I think. Maybe longer? It’s… hard to say. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More… a burning. And I have to go… frequently. Especially at night. It's very disruptive. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I truly do.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, particularly at night… and a burning sensation. Do you experience any pain during urination, or is it solely the burning you described?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Let me think… There is a little discomfort when I go, yes. Not a sharp pain, like a cut, but… a sort of ache, maybe? It’s hard to separate it from the burning, honestly. They both happen at the same time, usually. Is that helpful? I hope I'm not confusing things.
DOCTOR: No, it's… adequate. And is there any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. I… I don't recall seeing any blood. No, I don't think so. Not that I noticed, anyway. I don't… inspect it closely, you understand. It’s… a private matter. I just know it doesn't feel right, and it keeps happening. I hope that answers your question. Is there anything else you need to know? I have a luncheon appointment later, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine's color or smell?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Smell? I… I don’t usually pay attention to the smell, Doctor. It smells like… well, like urine, I suppose. As for color… it's usually a pale yellow. Sometimes it's a bit darker, but I thought that was just from not drinking enough water. I try to drink plenty, but… sometimes I forget. It's all very confusing, isn't it? I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh my. Medical history… That was a long time ago. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, but I think it was sorted out. The doctor gave me some pills, and I took them for a while. As for diabetes or kidney problems… I don’t recall being told I had either of those. I was divorced, you know, and my ex-husband handled all the paperwork. I'm afraid I don’t have those records anymore. Does that help? I really don't like thinking about the past. It's… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And… I think I had something done on my knee, but it was a long time ago, and I was quite young. It doesn't hurt anymore, so I don't think it's important. I’m not sure what else. I really don’t keep track of these things. Is that enough? I’m starting to feel a bit dizzy, Doctor. Perhaps I should have had something to eat before coming.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh dear. That's a difficult question. My mother… she passed away a long time ago. She had a bit of trouble with her… digestion, I think. My father… he wasn't around much. I don’t recall either of them having any problems with their waterworks, but I wasn’t very close to them, you see. I’m an only child, so there aren't any siblings to ask. I apologize for not being more helpful. It’s all very… distant. Can we please wrap this up soon? I'm feeling quite weak.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to take aspirin for headaches, but I stopped because I heard it wasn't good for you. I don’t take many pills these days. My stomach doesn’t agree with them. I’m very careful about what I put in my body. Is that sufficient? I really need to get going. Thank you for your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Wease, based on what you've told me—and frankly, it’s been difficult to get a complete picture—it sounds like you may be experiencing a urinary tract infection, or perhaps some degree of overactive bladder. However, without more information, it’s impossible to say for certain. I’m going to need to perform a physical exam and order a urinalysis to confirm. Do you consent to that?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? And… a what-now? A urinalysis? Goodness. Well… I suppose so. If it will help. But please be quick, Doctor. I really don't like being poked and prodded. And I’m not very flexible anymore, you see. And… is it going to be expensive? I’m on a fixed income. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get started then. Please follow me. And we'll discuss the costs with the billing department afterward. It is standard procedure, Ms. Wease. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll need a urine sample.
