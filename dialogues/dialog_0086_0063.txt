DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really bad. Hurts to move, hurts to sit… pretty much hurts all the time now. It started maybe… a week ago? No, more than a week. Maybe ten days? It just got worse and worse. It’s the same back, where they… you know… where I had things done before.
DOCTOR: “Things done before,” you say. Right. So, you've had prior procedures on your back. Could you be a little more specific about what was done, when it was done, and by whom?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, sorry. It was… about five years ago now. At the big hospital in Tamuning. Dr. Flores did it. He’s a good doctor. They took out… a piece of something. I don’t remember the name. Cancer. They said it was cancer. And then… radiation. Lots of radiation. It felt like sunburn, but all over. It helped for a while, but now… this pain. It's different than before, though. Before was more… burning. This is like… a sharp ache. All down my back.
DOCTOR: Okay. A piece of something… cancer, removed five years ago with radiation at Tamuning Hospital, performed by Dr. Flores. And now you're experiencing a different type of pain – a sharp ache, all down your back, as opposed to the burning sensation from the radiation. And how would you rate this pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. Today? It's… an eight, I think. Maybe even nine when I try to stand up. It really takes my breath away. It's hard to do anything. Even getting out of bed is… a struggle. And it hasn’t gotten better, even with the pills my other doctor gave me.
DOCTOR: Alright. An eight to nine, that's significant. And you mentioned other pills from another doctor… Do you remember what those pills were for, and what the dosage was?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Dr. Atal gave them to me. She’s my regular doctor. They're… white pills. Small, round ones. I think they were for the pain… and maybe to help me sleep? I take two of them, two times a day. I don't know the name, sorry. I just take what she tells me. The bottle is at home, with my daughter. She helps me keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll need to get the name of those pills. It's important we know exactly what you’re taking. Let’s move on to a quick examination. I’m going to need you to lie down on the examination table so I can assess your back. Could you tell me if there’s anything specific that makes the pain worse – bending, twisting, lifting, sitting, standing?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, I can lie down. Everything makes it worse, really. But… sitting is the worst. And bending. Trying to pick things up… forget it. My daughter has to do all the heavy stuff now. Even just… reaching for something on a high shelf. It’s like a knife in my back. And if I stand for too long, it starts to feel numb, down my legs.
DOCTOR: Alright. Numbness down the legs is concerning. Let's take a look. Please lie on your side, with your knees bent. I’m going to gently palpate your back to see where the pain is most intense, and then we'll check your range of motion and reflexes. This will help me narrow down the potential causes. Try to let me know exactly when I touch a spot that’s particularly painful, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. I can do that. Gentle is good, please. It’s very sensitive. And it hurts to move, so… go slow? I’ll tell you when it hurts, I promise. Just… please be careful. It really, really hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Just breathe normally. I'm starting on the sides here. Tell me when you feel any tenderness. Okay… and how about here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! Right there. That’s it. That’s the spot. It feels… like a hot needle. And if you press harder… oh! It shoots pain down my leg! Please, not so hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I'm sorry. That's helpful to know. It appears there’s significant tenderness over the lower lumbar spine, with radicular pain – meaning the pain is radiating down your leg – upon palpation. Now, I'm going to gently bend you forward. Just as far as you comfortably can. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain.
PATIENT: Oh… it’s hard. It feels like something is blocking me. And it hurts… right in the middle of my back. Not sharp, but… a deep ache. And it makes my legs feel… wobbly. I can’t go much further, Doctor. It’s too painful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, that's enough for now. You’re doing great. Let’s get you sitting up. Based on your history and the initial examination, the pain you're experiencing could be related to a number of issues, potentially a re-exacerbation of the cancer, nerve compression, or even a musculoskeletal problem. However, given your history of cancer and radiation, we need to rule out any recurrence or complications. I'm going to order some imaging – an MRI of your lumbar spine – and some blood work. The MRI will give us a detailed look at the bones and nerves in your back, and the blood work will help us assess for any inflammation or other abnormalities. Would you be able to schedule that right away?
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… scary. MRI… lots of machines. But… if it helps find out what’s wrong, then yes. Yes, please. I want to know. And yes, I can schedule it. My daughter helps me with all that. She’s good on the phone. Will it… will it take long? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s not scary, Ms. Meigs, just a bit noisy. The MRI machine uses magnets and radio waves to create images, it doesn't hurt at all. You’ll lie very still on a table and a technician will operate the machine from another room. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the blood work, that's just a simple draw, takes only a few minutes. I’m sending the orders to Tamuning Hospital now. They should contact you to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a stronger pain medication than what you're currently taking, and a muscle relaxant to help ease the spasms. We’ll need to see the results of the imaging and blood work before we can determine the best course of treatment, but this should help manage your pain in the meantime. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can take most pills. My daughter always checks, though. She's very careful. And… thank you, Doctor. For the stronger pills. It’s been really hard to sleep. And if… if it is the cancer again… what happens then?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Meigs, let's not jump to conclusions. We haven’t even seen the results of the tests yet. But if it were to be a recurrence, we would discuss all of your treatment options – which could include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, or a combination of those. There have been advancements in cancer treatment over the last five years, and we would explore all possibilities. We would also involve an oncologist – a cancer specialist – in your care. But for now, let’s focus on getting those tests done and getting you some relief from the pain. I’m going to write out the prescriptions now, and I'll also provide a referral to physical therapy, which can help you strengthen your back muscles and improve your range of motion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds good. Physical therapy… I haven’t done that before. But anything to help. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. I appreciate you not just… telling me bad news right away. I think that’s all the questions I have right now. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get you started on the road to recovery. I'll have the nurse bring in the prescriptions and the referral information. Please follow up with your primary care physician, Dr. Atal, for ongoing care, and schedule the MRI as soon as possible. If you experience any worsening pain, numbness, or weakness in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again. I'll let my daughter handle the scheduling. She’s very good at all this. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you when we have the test results. .
