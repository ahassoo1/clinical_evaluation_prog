DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My daughter, she wants… a baby. And she thought I should come talk to someone first. About… things. I’m not sure what things, exactly. It's a bit fuzzy, to be honest. She just said it was important to get checked out. Before… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your daughter is proactively thinking about family planning, and wants to make sure you’re healthy enough for…grandparenthood, potentially?
PATIENT: Grandparenthood… yes, that’s it. That’s a nice way to put it. I haven’t thought about that in a long time. I'm… not a young man anymore, you know? I just want to be sure I'm… okay. Whatever “okay” means. Is this about my health, mostly? Things I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Verrall, it is about your health, mostly. And it’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this now. There are some things we’ll want to review, just to make sure everything is in good working order, and to discuss any potential risks given your age. It’s good you’re asking these questions. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor, and do you have any current medical problems, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart issues?
PATIENT: A regular doctor… hmm. Not really. Not for years, anyway. I usually just… ignore things until they really bother me. And… oh, dear. Now you mention it… the doctor did say something about my blood pressure a while back. It was a bit high, I think. But I don’t remember exactly what he said. And… diabetes? I don't think so. No, never been told that. My heart… feels alright, usually. Gets a bit fast when I climb stairs, maybe. But alright. I think. It's hard to remember all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It’s not uncommon for things to be a little fuzzy, especially if it’s been a while since a check-up. We can certainly look into the blood pressure and check your heart. Do you recall when the doctor mentioned your blood pressure being high?
PATIENT: When… oh, that was… before the pandemic, I think. Yes, definitely before. I had a bad cold, and went to the… a walk-in clinic, I believe. A small one, not my usual place. It was… maybe 2019? Or 2020, at the start of everything. A lot of things happened then, makes it hard to remember details. He just said to watch my salt intake, I think. And maybe get it checked again. I never did, though. Too busy.
DOCTOR: Alright, 2019 or 2020, walk-in clinic, elevated blood pressure with a recommendation to follow up. Good to know. Let's move on to any surgeries or hospital stays you’ve had in the past. Have you ever been operated on, or been in the hospital for anything significant?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing football, but that was… a long time ago. A cast, that's all. And… oh! I had my appendix out when I was young, I think. Maybe. My mother kept telling me, but I barely remember it. It was just… a blur. Hospital… probably for that, and the broken arm. Nothing else comes to mind. I don’t go to the hospital if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, possible appendectomy, but you don't recall specifics. We can look into records if you’d like, but for now, we'll assume no major surgeries. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… that’s a tricky one. My father… he had some trouble with his heart, I think. Towards the end. But he didn't go to the doctor much either. My mother… she was healthy as a horse, always working in the garden. No real problems. And… my brother, he had cancer, I believe. Lung cancer. But he smoked a lot. It was… a long time ago. I don’t know about anything else. My family… we weren't ones for talking about these things. It was always… best not to worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families to not discuss medical history openly. It's helpful to know about your father’s heart trouble and your brother’s lung cancer, though. So, we have heart disease and lung cancer in the family history. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. Always hated it. Smells awful. My brother… he tried to get me to try it when I was young, but I wouldn't have it. Always thought it was a silly habit. No, I don’t smoke. And I don’t drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that’s all. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear – no smoking, very limited alcohol intake. Now, about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. Not regularly, anyway. Sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re acting up. Some sort of pain reliever. The kind you can get at the shop. Ibuprofen, I think? And… sometimes a vitamin D supplement in the winter. My daughter keeps telling me I should take more, but I forget. That's about it. Nothing serious, I don't think. Just bits and pieces.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, vitamin D occasionally. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… that’s another one I don't really know about. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. Sometimes my eyes get a bit itchy in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, I think. Nothing serious. I don't have any of those… life-threatening allergy things, like with peanuts. I don't think. It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Verrall, that gives us a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better idea of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, alright? My knees aren’t what they used to be. And… I don't like surprises. If anything hurts, I’ll tell you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And please, tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. A little high, but not alarmingly so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Reflexes are normal. Strength is good in all extremities, though you do have some mild discomfort in your knees as you mentioned. Let’s take a look at those knees… Some mild swelling and tenderness in both knees, consistent with some osteoarthritis. Not severe, but could be contributing to your discomfort. Finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a bit sore there, Doctor. Just a bit. Yes, my knees have been bothering me for a while now, especially when it’s cold. But I’ve always just… ignored it. It’s just old age, I suppose. Alright, alright, whatever you need to do. It's just… all a bit overwhelming, you know? I haven't had a proper check-up in years. I hope nothing’s seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verrall, neurological exam is normal. Overall, your exam is largely within normal limits, with some mild osteoarthritis in your knees and slightly elevated blood pressure. I’d like to order some blood work to get a better picture of your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. This will help us assess your overall health and identify any potential issues. It will also include a CBC just as a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Cholesterol… isn't that something you get when you eat too much fat? I do like my chips sometimes. But… alright, if you think it's necessary. Yes, do the blood work. And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles very much. Can you make it quick?
DOCTOR: It’s a very common test, Mr. Verrall. It will be a quick prick, and then a small amount of blood will be taken. We'll use a small needle and it's over very quickly. And yes, cholesterol is found in some foods, but it’s more complex than just that. The test will tell us your levels and if any intervention is needed. We’ll send the blood sample to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. We'll also get you scheduled for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and make a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: A few days… yes, that’s alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And a follow-up appointment… yes, I suppose that’s necessary. Alright. Yes, let’s do it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… patient with me. I know I haven’t been very helpful with all the details. It's just… a lot to take in. And… what about my knees? Is there anything I can do for them? While we’re waiting for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You’ve been perfectly helpful, Mr. Verrall. It's common for people to not remember every detail, especially after a long time. And yes, we can certainly address your knee discomfort. I recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as you've already been doing, and regular gentle exercise to strengthen the muscles around your knees. Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or cycling are good options. We can also discuss physical therapy if your pain persists or worsens. And to reiterate, losing even a small amount of weight can significantly reduce the stress on your knees. For now, let’s focus on getting those blood tests done. The lab is just down the hall. I'll have the nurse take you over there and explain the process. Once you’re done, come back and we'll schedule that follow-up appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. The nurse, alright. Down the hall… yes. Thank you, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease. And I will try to walk more. And maybe cut back on the chips. Just a little. Thank you again. Here's hoping everything's alright.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I'm glad I could help. And don’t worry too much; we'll take things one step at a time. Let me have the nurse come get you, and we’ll get you set up. Nurse, could you please assist Mr. Verrall with the blood work?
