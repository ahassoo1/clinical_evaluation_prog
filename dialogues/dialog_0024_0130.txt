DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's my family. Lots of… trouble with hearts, you see. My mother, she had a bad heart. And my brother… he passed last year, same thing. I just want to make sure I’m okay. I don’t want any surprises, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Family history, naturally. A common concern, though preventative medicine is frequently…misunderstood. Let's begin with your history, Mr. Schwer. Specifically, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm… dizziness, sometimes. Not often, though. Mostly when I stand up too fast. And… I get a little breathless walking uphill. But I’m not a young man anymore, Doctor! Is that… normal? I don’t know what’s normal and what isn’t. That’s why I’m here. Chest pain… no, not really. Nothing bad, anyway. Just… a little tightness sometimes, maybe. Hard to say.
DOCTOR: “Tightness” is a remarkably vague symptom, Mr. Schwer. We need specifics. Where, precisely, is this tightness located?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… here. Not a sharp pain, you understand. More like… a squeezing. It comes and goes. Happens when I’m walking, usually. Or when I get… excited, maybe? I don’t know. It doesn’t last long. Maybe a minute or two. Then it’s gone. Does that make… sense?
DOCTOR: It's…information. Let us move on. Do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the doctor said a few years back. I take a little pill for it, every day. A white one. Can't remember the name, sorry. And… I think my cholesterol was a little high, but I don't really pay attention to those numbers. The doctor said to watch my diet, you know. Less red meat, more vegetables. I try to, but… it’s hard. Does that matter? The pills, I mean.
DOCTOR: The medication is…relevant. We must document everything. Do you recall the dosage of this blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Dosage… I have no idea. Little white pill, once a day. I get it from the pharmacy, you know? They put it in a little bottle. I just take one every morning with my breakfast. I don't… measure it or anything. Sorry, Doctor. I'm not good with those numbers. I just want to be sure I won't… end up like my brother.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, a precise medical history is critical. “A little white pill” is insufficient information. Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good, Doctor. As long as you think it will help. I just… I worry, you see. My brother, he didn't seem sick. Then… one day, he was gone. I don't want that. Is it cold in here?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, Mr. Schwer, but within an acceptable range for your age. Murmur present, grade II/VI, systolic ejection at the apex. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148/92. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, normal bowel sounds. Your weight is also… concerningly low for your height. 53 kilograms at 1.85 meters is indicative of… possible malnutrition. Do you have a good appetite, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Malnutrition? I eat… okay, I guess. Not a big eater, never have been. More of a… nibbler. My wife, she always worried about me, said I needed to eat more. She did all the cooking. Now… I mostly have sandwiches, soup. Things like that. Easy things. I don’t really bother with big meals anymore. Is that bad? I thought I was just getting old.
DOCTOR: “Easy things” are rarely conducive to optimal health, Mr. Schwer. Given your family history, your slightly elevated blood pressure, the murmur, and your…suboptimal weight, I recommend an electrocardiogram to assess your cardiac rhythm and rule out any underlying arrhythmias. Additionally, we will order a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a basic metabolic panel to evaluate your overall health. We’ll also need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Electro… what-now? And a… what-was-it? All these tests… Is it serious, Doctor? Is something wrong? I just wanted to make sure I was okay, not… get a whole bunch of tests! I don't understand all this. I just want to know if my heart is good or bad. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, it is precisely because you want to know if your heart is “good or bad” that these tests are necessary. An electrocardiogram – an ECG – is a simple, non-invasive procedure that measures the electrical activity of your heart. The blood tests will provide a comprehensive overview of your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and overall health. It's preventative medicine, Mr. Schwer. Not a declaration of imminent doom. I will have the nurse draw the blood now. And schedule you for the ECG later this week. Do not attempt to self-diagnose based on internet searches. Any further questions can be addressed at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Blood tests and… the other thing. Fine. If you think it’s best. I just… I don't want to be a bother. And I don’t want to worry my daughter. She’s already got enough on her plate. Just… tell the nurse I get nervous, okay? With needles. I guess… I'll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. Try to remain calm. And please, avoid unnecessary anxiety. It elevates the blood pressure. .
