DOCTOR: Hi Jamill, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Polczynski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been experiencing a rather peculiar sensation in my back. It’s a… well, a popping or clicking sound, and sometimes I can feel it, you know? It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sound in your back… and you can feel it too. Hmm. And how long has this "little while" been exactly, if you can recall?
PATIENT: If I were to put a timeframe on it… approximately three months, Doctor. It began subtly, perhaps after I was lifting some heavier equipment for work – wiring harnesses, mostly – but it wasn’t immediately concerning. It’s gradually become more noticeable since then, and I’m starting to feel a bit of stiffness alongside it now. I do recall the exact date being March 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Right, March 2nd… okay, good detail. Lifting wiring harnesses, that's helpful. And you said stiffness… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. The stiffness is primarily in my lower back, Doctor. It’s most pronounced in the mornings, or after I’ve been sitting for an extended period. It eases up a bit with movement, but it doesn’t entirely disappear. It isn’t a sharp pain, more of a… restriction, if that makes sense? Like it takes a little extra effort to bend or twist. I would describe it as a 3 out of 10 on a pain scale, if that’s useful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very useful, thank you. A 3 out of 10, mostly in the mornings and after sitting… restriction, needing a bit more effort to bend or twist. Okay. And does anything specifically make it worse, besides sitting?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. I've noticed it's exacerbated when I'm bending forward to reach something low to the ground – for instance, working on the electrical panels in the vehicles. Also, prolonged standing without shifting my weight can aggravate it. It isn’t immediate, but after a good hour or so, it becomes quite noticeable. I don't believe any particular movement relieves it completely, just general movement helps a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, bending forward, prolonged standing… okay. Let's talk a bit about your work. You mentioned electrical panels and wiring harnesses. Is that pretty much all you do, or are there other physical demands involved in your job?
PATIENT: It's primarily those tasks, Doctor. However, there is some crawling under vehicles to access wiring, and occasionally lifting heavier components – not excessively heavy, usually around 30-40 pounds – to install or repair them. There's also a fair amount of reaching, twisting, and kneeling involved in accessing the various systems within the vehicles. It’s not consistently strenuous, but it does require a good deal of varied physical positioning throughout the day. I do make an effort to lift properly, but it's not always ideal given the confined spaces I often work in.
DOCTOR: Okay, varied positioning, confined spaces… that gives me a better picture. And before we go further, have you had any injuries to your back in the past?
PATIENT: That's a pertinent question, Doctor. I did strain my back approximately fifteen years ago – 2010, to be precise – while helping a friend move furniture. It required a few weeks of physical therapy, and I fully recovered, as far as I know. There haven’t been any other significant incidents since then. It was a sharp pain at the time, but it resolved completely with treatment. I always make an effort to be mindful of my posture now, as a result.
DOCTOR: Okay, a strain in 2010, fully recovered with physical therapy… good to know. And just to get a complete picture, any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I maintain a generally healthy lifestyle. I do have slightly elevated cholesterol, which I manage with diet and occasional exercise – walking and swimming mostly – as advised by my primary care physician. Otherwise, I’m a non-smoker, moderate alcohol consumption, and no known allergies. My wife assures me I’m quite healthy for my age, though she does worry about me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated cholesterol managed with diet and exercise, non-smoker, moderate alcohol, no allergies… that’s all good information. Alright, Jamill, it looks like you've had regular check-ups. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed at your convenience. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this sensation. I trust your professional judgment.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on your stomach for me, please. I’m going to start by palpating your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Then I’ll have you do a few simple movements to assess your range of motion. Let me know if anything causes you pain. Alright… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: There's a slight discomfort, Doctor, when you press on the lower portion of my lumbar spine – around the L4-L5 vertebrae, if that helps. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It’s exacerbated slightly when you apply pressure, but it subsides quickly when you release it. Everything else feels… normal, as far as I can tell. I’m not a medical professional, of course, but that’s my assessment.
DOCTOR: Okay, L4-L5, dull ache with palpation. Alright, can you bend forward and touch your toes, if you’re able?
PATIENT: I can reach my shins, Doctor, but I feel a noticeable stretch in my lower back when I do so. It isn't painful, but it's certainly present. It feels a bit restricted, if that makes sense. I don't believe I can go much further without causing discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, touching your shins, some restriction, and a stretching sensation. Alright, now can you gently bend backward?
PATIENT: I can arch my back a moderate amount, Doctor, but it feels a bit stiff and restricted. I wouldn’t describe it as painful, but it’s certainly not as fluid as it used to be. I feel a mild discomfort in my lower back during the movement. I am stopping before I feel any significant pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate arch, some stiffness. And finally, can you gently twist to your left, and then to your right?
PATIENT: The twisting feels restricted, Doctor, and I feel a mild discomfort in my lower back on both sides. It's not a sharp pain, but more of a dull ache. It feels a bit tight, especially when twisting to the left. I’m stopping before it becomes any more uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, restricted twisting, mild discomfort. Alright, Jamill. Based on the exam, and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you likely have some muscle strain and inflammation in your lower back, possibly aggravated by your work. It doesn't appear to be anything serious, but it's definitely causing you discomfort. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not take any medications regularly. I prefer to avoid them if possible, and I manage my cholesterol through diet and exercise as advised by my primary care physician. I occasionally take over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – for minor aches and pains, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, occasional ibuprofen or naproxen. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no known allergies to any medications. I’ve never experienced an adverse reaction to any drug that I’m aware of. I double-checked with my wife just to be certain, and she confirms that I have no known allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Alright, Jamill. Based on everything we’ve discussed, I believe this is likely a musculoskeletal issue – a strain or inflammation of the muscles and ligaments in your lower back. It's common with your line of work, and the exam doesn’t reveal any red flags that would suggest a more serious problem. I recommend a course of conservative treatment. That includes over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen as you’ve used before – ice or heat packs as needed, and gentle stretching exercises. It's important to avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. I’m going to give you a handout with some specific stretching exercises you can try. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate your thorough assessment. A handout with specific exercises would be very helpful. I do have one question, if I may. Is there anything I should be doing at work to prevent this from recurring? Any specific posture or lifting technique I should be mindful of, given the confined spaces I often work in?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Absolutely. Given the nature of your job, it's important to be proactive. First, whenever possible, try to maintain good posture – keep your back straight and avoid bending over for extended periods. When lifting, bend your knees and keep your back straight, and avoid twisting. If you’re working in a confined space, try to position yourself so you don’t have to reach or twist excessively. Take frequent breaks to stretch and move around. I know it's not always easy in those tight spaces, but even small adjustments can make a big difference. And if you find yourself in a position where you're straining, ask for help or modify the task. We can also discuss a referral to a physical therapist who can provide more specific guidance on proper lifting techniques and exercises tailored to your job. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: That is very helpful advice, Doctor. I will certainly make a conscious effort to implement those suggestions at work. A referral to a physical therapist sounds like a good idea, yes. I believe that would be beneficial in the long run, to ensure I’m using proper techniques and preventing future issues. I would be grateful if you could arrange that for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll go ahead and get a referral sent to a physical therapist specializing in work-related musculoskeletal injuries. They’ll schedule an appointment with you directly. In the meantime, I’ll give you this handout with some basic stretching exercises you can start doing at home. If your pain doesn't improve within a couple of weeks, or if it gets worse, please give us a call. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I truly appreciate your thorough examination, helpful advice, and the referral to the physical therapist. I feel much more confident now in managing this issue and preventing it from recurring. Thank you for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jamill. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon! .
