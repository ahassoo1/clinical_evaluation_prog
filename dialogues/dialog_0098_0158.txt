DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. I’m Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit of a…fuss. My landlord, you see, he’s being difficult. Wants some kind of letter. About a pet, I think? Something about proving I have one. It’s really quite silly, if you ask me. People should just trust each other, shouldn’t they? Anyway, he sent me here, said you had to write it. I barely remember what he said, to be honest. Old man rambles.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes. A letter verifying pet ownership… that is a bit different. I see. So, to be clear, your landlord needs a note from a medical professional stating you own a pet?
PATIENT: Well, that’s what he said. He mumbled something about needing proof for…some reason. Honestly, I stopped listening after “proof.” I mean, everyone knows I have Princess. She’s a very…noticeable cat. Big, fluffy, judges everyone. It’s really quite insulting he’s making me do this. I suppose he thinks I'm making it up or something? A perfectly good, well-behaved feline!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try to get this sorted for you. Just to be sure I have everything correct… Princess is a cat, and your landlord, for some reason, requires written verification of her existence. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A perfectly obvious cat! Honestly, the man…He’s always been a bit…particular. Likes things “just so.” It’s really quite exhausting, if I'm being honest. And she’s not just any cat, you know. She’s…a therapeutic animal. Helps with my nerves. Though, I can't quite recall which nerves he was talking about. It was the doctor before, I believe. It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: <stage>I make another note, “Possible ESA?
PATIENT: Therapeutic animal…right. So, do you happen to know the breed of Princess? Or maybe when you got her? Any details would be helpful for the letter, you see. He didn't say anything about specifics, just "proof of pet ownership." Though, knowing him, he'll want a pedigree chart and a DNA analysis, the fussy old man.
DOCTOR: <stage>I frown slightly, flipping through the digital chart again. Nothing about Princess. This is… unusual. I look up at Deloris, trying to gauge her demeanor. Is she being entirely serious?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, breed? I haven’t the faintest! She just…appeared, really. A lovely little thing, abandoned in a box near the market. I took one look at her judgmental face and knew I had to take her in. It must have been…oh, goodness, years ago now? Four? Five? Time flies, you know. She's a long-haired one, though. Very fluffy. And orange. A beautiful shade of orange, really. Like a sunset. Or a very ripe pumpkin. I don’t think she has a pedigree. She’s far too independent for that, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a long-haired, orange cat, approximately 4-5 years old, found near the market. And you mentioned something about this being for…therapeutic reasons?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right! The doctor before – Dr. Abernathy, I think it was – he said something about needing a letter for…well, honestly, I barely listened. I was more concerned with getting Princess her vaccinations. She’s a very…sensitive cat, you see. Doesn’t travel well. He said it was something about…easing my…anxieties, I believe? Or maybe my…stress levels? It was something like that. He was a very…official-sounding man. Lots of medical jargon. I just nodded and signed whatever papers he put in front of me. Honestly, I’m not good with all that doctor stuff. It just makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let me see if I can find Dr. Abernathy’s records. Sometimes we can access notes from previous physicians. Just to be sure, do you remember approximately when you saw Dr. Abernathy?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that was…a while ago. Before the divorce, definitely. So, before…2023, I think? Maybe 2022? I really couldn't say for certain. It was during a particularly…stressful period, if I recall correctly. Lots of paperwork. Lots of…arguments. He had a very nice office, though. Lots of plants. And a very comfortable waiting room. Princess would have liked it. She’s very discerning, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve found a note from Dr. Abernathy from June 2022. It mentions increased anxiety following marital difficulties and a recommendation for an emotional support animal. There’s a brief mention of a possible letter for housing…but it doesn’t seem like much detail was discussed. So, it appears Princess is considered an emotional support animal, and you were previously discussing a letter for housing with Dr. Abernathy. Would you like me to write a letter stating that Princess is your emotional support animal?
PATIENT: Oh! Housing, yes! That’s right, that’s what it was! He said something about needing it for…the new apartment. Before everything…settled. Well, if it’ll satisfy that fussy old landlord, then yes, please! That would be wonderful. Just…make sure it says she’s a very discerning cat. And…perhaps mention her judgmental stare? It’s rather…intimidating, you know. Might encourage him to leave me alone.
DOCTOR: Alright. I can certainly include that Princess is a discerning cat with a rather…intimidating stare. I'll draft a letter stating that Princess is your emotional support animal, recommended for your well-being, and possessing a notable level of discernment. It will also mention her calming presence. Would you like me to print it out for you now?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfect! Calming presence, yes, she is! Though, she’s only calming for me, of course. Everyone else seems rather…intimidated. Yes, please print it out! The sooner I get it to that landlord, the better. Honestly, the man…he’s a menace. Thank you so much, Doctor! You’re a lifesaver. A real lifesaver.
DOCTOR: Here you are. I’ve included everything we discussed. Hopefully, this will satisfy your landlord. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you, Doctor, thank you so much! Yes, that’s perfect! The judgmental stare is in there, excellent! Honestly, I think he’ll be terrified. No, I think that’s all for today. Unless…do you have any recommendations for calming sprays? For…the landlord, of course. Just in case. No, no, just kidding! Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been a real help.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I can provide you with some information on calming sprays, though I’m not sure how effective they’d be on a…determined landlord. You're very welcome, Deloris. It was a pleasure assisting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything else in the future. Have a good day!
