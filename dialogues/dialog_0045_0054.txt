DOCTOR: Alright, Rayshon, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi doctor. Cough... I cough a lot. Been coughing for… a long time now, I think. And I feel tired all the time. And my nose… always stuffy. Like sinus, you know? Gets bad. I don't remember exactly when it started, just... always feels like something.
DOCTOR: Okay, “cough a lot… tired… stuffy nose.” A long time now… right. Well, “a long time” isn't terribly helpful, but we’ll get there. Is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Um... sometimes a little bit of… mucus? White, I think. Not much, though. Mostly just feels like it’s deep in my chest. It hurts a little when I cough hard. I don’t really… pay attention to the color, sorry. Just glad to get it out, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. And this pain… where exactly in your chest are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Right here… …and sometimes… over here too. It’s not bad bad, like… can’t breathe bad. Just… achey. When I cough a lot it gets worse. And when I… when I bend over. I think. It's hard to remember exactly. I work a lot with tires, you know? Lifting and stuff.
DOCTOR: Tires… lifting. Okay. And how long have you been doing this tire work?
PATIENT: Uh... a long time. Maybe… ten years? Or more? I don't really keep track. I started right after… after I got married. Yeah, after I got married. It's good money. Hard work, but good money. Does that matter? The tires?
DOCTOR: It could. Dust, fumes… those can irritate things. Alright. Let’s try this: when you’re not coughing, or bending over, is this ache constant?
PATIENT: No, no. Not constant. It’s mostly when I move. Like… when I lift something heavy, or when I… I don’t know, walk up the stairs. Sometimes when I lie down. It's… it's not there all the time. I don’t think. It’s hard to say, really. I just feel tired all the time. Everything feels… slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue. We'll get to that. Now, have you had a fever at all with this cough and tiredness?
PATIENT: Fever… um… I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit warm sometimes, but not like… shivering and sweating warm. Just… a little warm. My wife checks sometimes, but she hasn't said anything about a fever. I don’t really get sick often. Just this cough. It’s annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… … not really. I get tired, yeah, but… not like I can't breathe. Maybe after I lift a lot of tires, I breathe a little faster, but that's just… from the work. It’s hard work, you know? Is that normal? For being tired?
DOCTOR: Look, Rayshon, being tired after hard work is normal. But you also said this cough has been going on for a long time, and you’re feeling fatigued even when you're not working. So we need to figure out why. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Could you sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, deep breaths. Like this? Is this good? I try to breathe deep, but sometimes… it hurts a little in my chest.
DOCTOR: Alright. I hear some wheezing. And yes, I can hear you're a little uncomfortable. Your chest is clear but... restricted. I'm also going to check your temperature and pulse quickly. 99.1… pulse is elevated at 88. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… um… not that I know of. My wife gives me medicine sometimes for the cough, like… cough syrup. It helps a little, but not much. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Never had a reaction. Never told her about any allergies. She just gives me what she uses. Is that… okay? Should I tell her what I'm allergic to?
DOCTOR: It’s better to know, yes. Alright, and are you currently taking any other medications, beyond the cough syrup?
PATIENT: No, no other medicines. Just the cough syrup. Sometimes… when my back hurts from lifting the tires, my wife gives me… a cream. For the muscles. That’s it. Maybe vitamins? She tells me to take vitamins. I forget. I don’t really remember the names. Lots of little pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and what I've heard, it sounds like you've got a chronic cough with some possible underlying respiratory issues. The wheezing suggests some airway restriction. The fatigue could be related to the cough, or something else entirely. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And I'd like to do some blood work to rule out any infections or other underlying conditions. We need to see what’s actually going on here. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… and blood work? Is it… is it bad? Will it hurt? How much will it cost? I don’t have insurance, you know… my wife… she works very hard… I just want to feel better. The cough… it’s just so tiring. I just want to be able to work and… and not feel so sick all the time.
DOCTOR: Look, Rayshon. The X-ray won’t hurt, it's just a picture. The blood work is a little poke. I understand you don't have insurance, and I'll see what we can do about getting you a discounted rate at the lab. But we need to figure out what’s causing this cough. Just guessing isn’t going to help. It could be something minor, or it could be something more serious. We need information, and that means tests. I’m going to write you an order for both. The lab should be able to tell you the cost upfront. I also want you to follow up with me once you have the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. Tests… and then come back. I’ll… I’ll ask my wife about the money. And the lab… I’ll go to the lab. Just… please… can you tell me if it’s something bad? Before… before I worry too much? I just… I just want to know. It’s hard to work when you’re scared.
DOCTOR: Look, I can't tell you if it's "something bad" right now. That's why we're doing the tests. I'll review the results with you as soon as they come in, and then we can discuss your options. I'll also give you a prescription for a stronger cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. But I need you to understand that's just a temporary fix. We need to find the root of the problem. Now, here are the orders. The lab is on Elm Street. Get those done as soon as you can. Anything else?
PATIENT: No… no, that’s all. Thank you, doctor. Thank you… I’ll go to the lab.
