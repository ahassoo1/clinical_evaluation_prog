DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... well, it's my waterworks, I think. They're not working so good anymore. It's hard to... you know... go. It takes a long time, and sometimes it just... stops. I don't remember when it started, really. A little while ago, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, "waterworks not working so good," and difficulty with urination… and it's been happening for a while. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about how difficult?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's like... pushing. I have to push a lot more than I used to. And it's not a strong stream, you know? Just… dribbles. It feels like it’s not all coming out, even when I think I’m finished. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. Pushing to start, weak stream, feeling of incomplete emptying… all right. And does this happen every time you try to urinate, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Inter… what? Sorry, Doctor. You use big words. Does it happen all the time? Yes, I think so. Every time I try… it’s hard. Not easy like it used to be. Sometimes I have to get up a couple of times in the night too, but I always thought that was just old age. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Intermittent" means sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. No, getting up frequently at night isn't necessarily normal, even with age. It could be related. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. Sometimes a little uncomfortable, but not pain. And no burning, no. Just… difficult. Like trying to push water through a small pipe, maybe? That's the best way I can explain it. My husband usually helps me get dressed, he might notice something I don't. He’s good at noticing things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no burning, just difficulty and a weak stream… and your husband might notice things. Alright. Ms. Stoffregen, I’m going to need to ask you a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’s just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is there anything in your medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Okay. That’s alright, I suppose. As for my history… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago. And my hip replaced, maybe ten years ago? I take a little pill for my blood pressure, a tiny white one. And… oh, I forget. I used to go to a doctor in town, Dr. Henderson, but he retired. I've been with my husband, Thomas, for 60 years. Is that… helpful? I can’t remember much else, I’m afraid. I just want to be able to sleep through the night again.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, hip replacement ten years ago, blood pressure medication… and long-term relationship with Thomas. Good. Any allergies to medications, or any other medical problems Dr. Henderson treated you for?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Dr. Henderson… hmm. He always checked my heart, I remember that. And my knees were bothering me for a while, so he gave me some cream. Oh, and I used to get terrible headaches, but they stopped a long time ago. I really can’t remember much else, Doctor. It feels like my brain is full of cotton sometimes. Thomas might know more, he always took notes at the appointments. Is it okay if I call him? He’s right at home.
DOCTOR: It's… alright if you want to call your husband, Ms. Stoffregen, but let's see if we can get through this first. It’s just that a lot of what you’re describing could be a number of things. We’ll need to do a quick exam to narrow it down. It won’t be unpleasant, I promise. Just a listening to your abdomen, and I may need to check a urine sample. Can we start with that?
PATIENT: Oh. A urine sample? Okay, yes. I can do that. I think. Is there a… a special place to go? My bladder feels a little full all the time now, so that shouldn’t be too hard. I’m just worried I'll make a mess. I'm a bit clumsy these days. But yes, I can try. Just tell me where to go, Doctor.
DOCTOR: There’s a restroom right over there. I’ll give you a sterile cup – just a small sample is fine, about two to three ounces. And don’t worry about making a mess. It happens. I'll leave you to it, and I'll be right outside when you're finished. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay. Two or three ounces. A small cup. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I hope I remember how to do this...
