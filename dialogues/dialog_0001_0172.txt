DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I just moved here, you see. New to the area. And one has to… establish things. A social visit, I believe the woman on the telephone called it. Really, I haven't the faintest idea why I'm here, beyond that. It’s all rather… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Right. A… disruptive establishment visit. Okay. Well, we can certainly get that done. Let’s just run through some basic things, alright?
PATIENT: Basic things… Yes, I suppose that’s sensible. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have arrangements, you understand. And frankly, I’m not one for dwelling on… particulars. Do get on with it, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with medications. Are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medications… That's a question. My husband, bless his heart, handles most of that. I… believe I take something for my knees. And perhaps a little something for… well, just general upkeep. Honestly, I couldn't tell you the names. It all feels rather excessive, if you ask me. He insists. Really, just ask him. He has a list. A very long list, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll try to get that list from him. Alright, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness no. I’ve always had a rather robust constitution. Though… I recall a slight rash once, many years ago. From some sort of… fruit, perhaps? Or a fabric? It was fleeting, I assure you. Not worth mentioning, really. I simply avoid brightly colored things, just in case. It's safer that way.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And, just to cover the basics, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That's a rather broad question, isn't it? I've lived a life, young man. There were childhood things, of course. Measles, I believe. And a rather nasty bout of… something when I was traveling in South America. But nothing major. Certainly nothing requiring… cutting. My husband wouldn’t allow it. He's very particular about my health. He would remember, if there was anything truly significant.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my husband, of course. He's the most important one. We've been married… a very long time. And I have a son, somewhere. He doesn’t visit often. Lives a very… busy life, I understand. And grandchildren, I suppose. Though I rarely see them. It’s all rather… distant, frankly. Why is this important? Is it relevant to… whatever this visit is for?
DOCTOR: Just routine, Ms. Engelhaupt. We just want to get a complete picture. Let's talk about your current health. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or any changes in your body lately?
PATIENT: Oh, pain… Well, I'm seventy-nine years old, young man. One expects a certain amount of discomfort. My knees, naturally. And a little stiffness in the mornings. But nothing debilitating. Though my vision isn't what it used to be. And I do tire rather easily. Is that what you mean? Honestly, it all seems perfectly normal for someone my age. Really, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. Perhaps I’m simply not suited to these… examinations. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, alright?
