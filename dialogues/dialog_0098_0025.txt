DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… I want to know more about where my family come from. I hear you can do… tests with spit? To find out? My grandkids, they ask all the time, “Grandpa, where we really from?” And I tell them Marshall Islands, but… I want to show them. Proof, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe you’re referring to genetic ancestry testing. It’s becoming quite popular. We don't directly offer that here at the clinic, but I can certainly discuss the process and perhaps direct you to a reputable company that does. Before we go further, just to be sure I understand completely… you're not experiencing any current health concerns that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: No, no health problems. Just… curious. Old man things, I guess. Want to know before… before I can't ask anymore. My Medicare, will it pay for this… spit test? I don't have much money for things like that. Just the regular doctor stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Let me check on that for you, Mr. Scobie. Unfortunately, ancestry testing is generally not covered by Medicare, as it’s considered elective and not medically necessary. There are some exceptions for tests ordered to investigate specific genetic conditions, but that doesn’t sound like your situation. The cost can vary quite a bit depending on the company and the level of detail they provide. They can be… somewhat expensive. Perhaps we can explore other ways to document your family history if the cost is a concern?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… not good. I figured as much. Expensive, yes. My grandson, he's good with computers, maybe he can find cheaper one. But… I don't know which ones are good, you know? Lots of ads. They all say they are good. You ever hear of any… ones I should look at? Or… not look at? Just spit test, right? Nothing… scary?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Scobie. There are a number of companies that offer these tests now, and it can be overwhelming to sort through them. I’ve heard 23andMe and AncestryDNA are two of the more well-known and reputable ones, though I don’t have personal experience with either. It's important to read their privacy policies carefully, as they do collect genetic information. And you're right, it’s usually just a saliva sample – a spit test – so it’s generally not invasive. However, it's still a good idea to discuss the results with a healthcare professional, even if you’re primarily interested in your ancestry. There can be incidental findings, things you weren’t looking for, that might require further investigation. I'm happy to help interpret any results you receive, if you'd like.
PATIENT: Incidental… what now? Further… investigation? Oh dear. I just want to show my grandkids where we come from, not… get sick. Maybe… maybe this is a bad idea. My grandson, he keeps saying I worry too much. But he doesn’t know old man things, you know? He just… clicks buttons. So… 23 and… and the other one? They won’t… tell anyone my secrets? I don’t have many, but still…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Scobie. It’s perfectly reasonable to be cautious. “Incidental findings” just means they might discover information about your health risks – things like a predisposition to certain conditions – while they’re analyzing your ancestry. It doesn’t mean you would necessarily develop those conditions, just that you might be at a slightly higher risk. And we can absolutely discuss those findings and decide together whether or not any further investigation is necessary. You are in control of the process. Regarding your privacy, both 23andMe and AncestryDNA have privacy policies outlining how they use and protect your data. They generally don't share your information without your explicit consent. However, it's always a good idea to read the fine print carefully and understand their terms of service. They both offer options for controlling how your data is used, and you can often opt-out of data sharing for research purposes. Perhaps we can start by having your grandson help you research both companies' privacy policies?
PATIENT: That… that sounds good. Privacy policies. My grandson, he's good at that. He can read all the tiny words. And I… I can ask him about it. It's just… a lot. I never thought knowing where you come from would be so… complicated. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Maybe… maybe I'll just tell my grandkids stories about the Islands. That's probably enough, huh? They like my stories.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. And you're absolutely right – stories are often the most valuable thing. They connect us to our past in a way that tests simply can’t. Perhaps documenting those stories, even writing them down, would be a wonderful way to share your heritage with your grandchildren. I'm glad I could help, even if it was just to ease your mind. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That's all. Just… old man things. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Scobie. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns down the line. And enjoy sharing those stories with your grandchildren! Have a wonderful day. .
