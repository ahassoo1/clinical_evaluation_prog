DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's Velda Squiers, yes. I’m hoping you can help me with a bit of paperwork. I’m going on a cruise next month – the 15th, to be exact – and the cruise line needs some medical information from me. Just a summary, really. Nothing complicated, I hope.
DOCTOR: Paperwork… Right. Well, I suppose I can assist with that. Though, truthfully, my time is best spent with patients who have actual medical concerns. But, alright. Let's start with the basics then. Do you have any current medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, that’s a bit of a difficult question. I wouldn't say problems, exactly. My knees ache a bit when the weather changes, if that counts. And I get a touch of indigestion now and then, mostly if I eat anything too spicy. My late husband, bless his soul, always said I had a sensitive stomach. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? I try to keep active, though. A bit of gardening, mostly.
DOCTOR: Aching knees and indigestion… I suppose that could be relevant. It’s good you're active, that's always a plus. But to properly document this, let’s try to be a bit more specific. When you say your knees ache, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… Right. Well, it’s not a sharp pain, you understand. It’s more of a dull ache, a sort of stiffness, really. It usually starts in the evenings, after I’ve been on my feet all day. And it’s worse when it’s damp, like we’ve had a lot of rain. It doesn't stop me from doing things, mind you, but it’s… noticeable. It’s been going on for a few years now, gradually getting a bit worse, perhaps. I haven't done anything about it, really. Just try to ignore it and keep moving.
DOCTOR: Right. Gradual onset, worse with damp weather… and doesn’t significantly limit activity. And you mentioned indigestion. How often would you say you experience that?
PATIENT: Oh, the indigestion… not terribly often, thankfully. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. It’s usually after I eat something a bit rich, or spicy, as I said. A bit of heartburn, mostly. A couple of antacid tablets usually sorts it out, though. It's not… debilitating, if that makes sense. It's just a bit uncomfortable. It hasn’t been getting worse recently, either. It’s been pretty consistent, really. I always try to be careful with what I eat, so it doesn't happen too often.
DOCTOR: Consistent, and relieved with antacids… Very well. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones, besides the antacids?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, not regularly, no. Just the antacids when I need them, as I mentioned. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, because of the lack of sunshine. My sister suggested it, she says it’s good for the bones. A small dose, mind you, just one tablet a day. I don’t take anything else. I’ve always been quite careful about taking medication, I prefer to avoid it if I can. Do you need to know the dosage of the vitamin D? I could look it up, it's in the kitchen somewhere.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. Dosage isn’t critical in this instance. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Nothing major, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. But that was many, many years ago now, and it healed perfectly. Aside from that… I’ve been quite lucky, really. I’ve always been fairly healthy. I did have a bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. I just stayed in bed and rested until it passed. Is that the sort of thing you're looking for? Major illnesses, you said? I haven't had any of those, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy as a child, broken wrist, a bout of the flu… And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of, no. I’ve always been able to eat everything, thankfully. And I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can remember. I’ve always been quite cautious with new foods, though. My mother always said it was best to try things slowly, just in case. But I’ve never had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. I see no reason why I shouldn't be able to enjoy all the lovely food on the cruise, hopefully!
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies… Very well. Let me just document this then. And finally, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a bit complicated. My father had high blood pressure, I believe, but he didn’t live to a very old age. And my mother had a bit of arthritis in her hands, but it wasn’t very serious. My sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. And my brother… well, he wasn’t very careful with his health, sadly. He smoked a bit too much, and didn’t eat very well. I don't recall any major illnesses in the family, not that I’m aware of. Does that help? It’s a bit difficult to remember, truthfully. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother… And a somewhat unhealthy lifestyle in your brother. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, not at all! I've never smoked a day in my life. My late husband tried it once, a very long time ago, but he didn't like it. And I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a small glass of sherry at Christmas, if that. I prefer a nice cup of tea, myself. I've always been quite careful about looking after my health, as you can probably tell. I believe in moderation, you see. It's the key to a long and happy life, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption… Very well. Based on this information, and your reported lack of significant medical problems, I can complete the necessary paperwork for your cruise. It doesn’t appear there are any contraindications to your travel. I will have the nurse print it out for you. Nurse, can you please print out the medical summary for Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news! Thank you very much, Doctor. I was rather worried about it, to be honest. It's so good to hear there are no problems. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, despite everything. I do try to keep healthy, you see. I'm so looking forward to the cruise now!
DOCTOR: Very well. Just remember to stay hydrated, and be mindful of food safety while traveling. And if anything changes, or you develop any concerning symptoms while on the cruise, seek medical attention immediately. Here's the summary. The nurse will review it with you before you leave. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Thank you for reminding me about the hydration and food safety, that’s very sensible advice. And I will definitely remember to seek medical attention if anything goes wrong, you can be sure of that. No, I don't think there’s anything else, Doctor. Just this paperwork, really. I’m very grateful for your help. Thank you again for everything. I think that will be all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a pleasant trip, Ms. Squiers. Next! .
PATIENT: .
