DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… Galena, you say? Yes. I… moved here. New place. Doctor said I need to… check in, with someone. Social thing, I think. Medicare, you know? Old bones need looking at, I guess. Not much wrong, usually. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Right, right. New patient check-up. That's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. "Old bones," as you say… that’s a good way to put it. And you said you moved here recently?
PATIENT: Recently… yes. Not long. From… oh, what was it now? Somewhere with… snow. Lots of snow. Not this place, though. Too warm. Don’t remember the name of the town, exactly. Big city, I think. Used to do… faces. Make them pretty. Theater stuff. A long time ago now. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Hmm… faces, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Makeup. For the… actors. Singers. People on the stage. Very important work, you know. Making them look… presentable. Not everyone is beautiful naturally. Not like these days, anyway. Everything is… plastic.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you used to work in theatrical makeup. That’s… interesting. And you’re here today for a general check-up, since you're new to the area and have Medicare. Do you have any specific complaints, anything that’s been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Complaints? Not really. Back… aches a little. Happens when you get old. And… sometimes I forget things. Not important things, usually. Like… what I had for breakfast. Or the name of that town. But nothing serious. I think. Mostly just tired, I suppose. Old tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Back aches and some forgetfulness, along with general fatigue. We can certainly look into those. Now, about your back… where exactly does it ache?
PATIENT: Here. Lower part. All across. Not one spot, you understand. Just… all of it. Hurts when I bend over. Or… sit for too long. Like now, actually. Old chair, too, I think. Not very supportive.
DOCTOR: Alright, lower back pain, generalized, worse with bending and prolonged sitting. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? I don’t like being poked and prodded. I'm an artist, not a… a specimen. Is it necessary? What will you do?
DOCTOR: Nothing too invasive, I promise. Just a quick look at your back, checking your range of motion, feeling for any tenderness. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It's just routine, Mr. Szmyd. Helps me get a better picture of your overall health. It shouldn't take long at all. We can skip anything you're really uncomfortable with, of course. Would you like me to explain each step as I go?
PATIENT: Fine. But no… poking. And tell me what you’re doing before you do it. I don’t like surprises. And be gentle! My back is very… sensitive. Old artist’s back. Easily damaged. And no talking about “specimens,” please. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. No poking, I promise. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, if you could just stand up for me, and I'll take a look at your posture. Then, I’d like you to bend forward slowly, and see how far you can reach. Just stop when you feel any discomfort, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, my… bones. Always creaking. Alright, alright. Here. Posture, you say? What am I, a statue? Just tell me when to bend. Carefully, now. Don't want to pull anything. Go on… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just looking at how you stand. A bit of forward lean, which is common. Now, if you could slowly bend forward from the waist, keeping your knees slightly bent… just go as far as you comfortably can. I'm right here if you need to stop. Okay…stop there. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s enough. Feels… tight. Like something is pulling. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Can I sit down now? This is ridiculous. My back is protesting. Loudly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, slowly now. Yes, let's have you sit down. Okay. I noticed some limited range of motion when you bent forward, and you mentioned tightness. I'm also going to listen to your back with my stethoscope, just to rule out anything else. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Listening? What are you listening for? Bones don't make noise, do they? This is… strange. But fine. Do what you need to do. Just… be quick about it. And don’t expect me to hold still. Old artist's muscles twitch, you know. Very sensitive.
DOCTOR: I'm listening for any unusual sounds, Mr. Szmyd. It's a standard part of the exam. Alright. Sounds are normal, thankfully. No unusual noises. I'm going to gently palpate your back now, just feel for any tenderness or muscle spasms. I'll let you know before I touch you, alright?
PATIENT: Palpate? What does that even mean? Sounds… normal, you say? What does "normal" even feel like? Is it normal to be old and achy? I swear, doctors these days just make up words. Just… get it over with. But be gentle! And tell me what you're doing before you touch me, alright? I don’t like surprises. I really, really don’t.
DOCTOR: Palpate means I’m going to gently feel your back with my hands, Mr. Szmyd. Just to check for any sore spots or tight muscles. “Normal” in this case means I don’t hear any concerning sounds. And yes, it is normal to experience aches and pains as we get older. Now, I’m going to gently press on your back with my fingertips. I'll start here, on the lower left side. Let me know immediately if you feel any pain. Just a simple “ouch” is fine. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine. But be warned, I’m a very sensitive artist. Even a gentle touch can be… upsetting. Just get it over with. But seriously, be careful. And no poking! I mean it. This is… unnerving. Oof. That's… not pleasant. But not painful exactly. Just… sensitive. Very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noticing some tenderness along the lower back, as you mentioned, and some muscle tightness. No lumps or anything concerning. And on this side… similar tenderness and tightness. It sounds like you have some muscle strain, likely from everyday activities. Okay, that's all for the physical exam of your back. Would you like to tell me a little more about your day-to-day activities, and if anything specific seems to trigger the pain?
PATIENT: Muscle strain? From what? I mostly sit around. Or… used to. Before I moved here. Used to do faces, you know? Very precise work. Lots of bending. Very delicate movements. Now… mostly just walking. And… thinking. And… complaining. Walking seems to make it worse. Especially on uneven ground. This city is full of uneven ground. And thinking makes it worse too, if you can believe it. Too much worrying. It all adds up, I suppose. Old bones and old thoughts. A terrible combination.
DOCTOR: Alright. So walking, particularly on uneven surfaces, and potentially stress or worrying seem to aggravate the pain. That gives me a better picture. Now, you also mentioned some forgetfulness. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Forgetfulness… yes. It’s… frustrating. Little things. Like names. Or where I put my… glasses. Not important things, usually. Just… annoying. And… I sometimes have trouble remembering what I was saying, mid-sentence. Like… just now. What was I saying? Oh, right. Forgetfulness. It’s getting worse, I think. Or maybe I’m just getting older. Which is… also annoying. Doesn't anyone take old people seriously anymore?
DOCTOR: I absolutely take you seriously, Mr. Szmyd. Forgetfulness can be concerning, and it’s good you’re bringing it up. It’s common to experience some memory lapses as we age, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or memory?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Sometimes I feel… confused. Like I’m not quite sure where I am. Or what day it is. Not all the time, just… occasionally. And… I sometimes have trouble finding the right words. Like… a word on the tip of my tongue. You know? It's very frustrating. And… my daughter keeps telling me I'm repeating myself. Which is… rude. She thinks I’m losing my mind. It's very insulting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Confusion, difficulty finding words, and your daughter mentioning repetition. Those are all things we need to take seriously. Now, I'd like to ask a few simple questions, just to get a better sense of your cognitive function. It's nothing to worry about, just a quick assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Cognitive… function? What does that even mean? Sounds like something they test robots with. But fine. Ask your questions. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be quick about it. Old artist's brain doesn't work like it used to. And if I get something wrong, don't make a fuss. It's just a temporary lapse. Probably. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… hmm. That's… a good question. August… yes. Definitely August. But what day? Is it the first? No… it must be… the second? The second of August. Yes, I think so. 2025, of course. Is that right? I’m pretty sure it’s August 2nd. But don’t quote me on that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city…? Oh, dear. That’s… embarrassing. I just moved here, remember? Everything is new. I… I really should know this. Is it… New York? No, too crowded. San Francisco? No, too… hilly. Is it… Boston? No. Honestly, I have no idea. I’m terrible with cities. Please, just tell me. I’m starting to feel… foolish.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It’s understandable to be disoriented after a move. We’re in Chicago. Now, let's try one more simple question. Can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? What kind of words? Important words? Difficult words? This is ridiculous. But fine. Go ahead. Ask your three words. But don't expect me to remember them. Old artist's brain is not known for its memory. And please, make them easy. Very easy. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… uh… hmm. It was something small… shiny… Oh, dear. It’s on the tip of my tongue. Apple… table… and… I can’t remember. Was it… chair? No… door? No. I’m terrible at this. Apple… table… and… I just can't remember the third word. It’s right there… just out of reach. It's very frustrating. Honestly, I don’t know. I’m sorry. My brain is not cooperating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief assessment, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive decline, along with back pain and forgetfulness. I want to be upfront with you. These symptoms warrant further investigation. I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation. I can refer you to a neurologist who specializes in memory and cognitive disorders. Additionally, we can get some imaging done of your back to determine the cause of the pain. Would you be open to those steps?
PATIENT: Cognitive… decline? What does that mean? Am I… losing my mind? Imaging? More poking and prodding? This is… overwhelming. And a neurologist? Sounds… serious. Honestly, I just moved here. I wanted a fresh start, not a… a diagnosis. I… I don't know. I need to think about it. It's a lot to take in. Can I… talk to my daughter first? She's… good at these things. And… is it really that bad? Am I really losing my mind?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Mr. Szmyd. And yes, it’s perfectly alright to take some time to think about it and discuss it with your daughter. "Cognitive decline" simply means a decrease in mental abilities. It doesn't necessarily mean you're "losing your mind," as you put it. It could be due to a variety of factors, and we need to determine the cause. The neurological evaluation and imaging will help us do that. It's better to know what we're dealing with so we can explore the best course of action. I will write down the neurologist’s contact information for you, as well as the details for the imaging center. There’s no pressure to make any decisions right away. I will also send a summary of our conversation to your primary care physician, so they are aware of my findings. Before we finish, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions…? So many questions. But… I don’t even know where to start. Will it… hurt? The tests, I mean. And… will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. And… what if it is something serious? What if I… I don’t even want to think about it. Honestly, this whole thing is just… terrifying. Is there… anything I can do right now? Anything at all? Just to… feel a little better?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mr. Szmyd. Let’s address them one by one. The tests themselves shouldn’t be painful. The neurological evaluation will involve some questions and simple tasks, and the imaging is non-invasive—it's like a sophisticated X-ray. As for the cost, we can work with the imaging center and your insurance to understand your coverage and explore any potential financial assistance programs. And you’re right to be concerned about the possibility of a serious diagnosis. But remember, we haven't reached that point yet. We need to gather more information before we can draw any conclusions. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to feel a little better. Gentle exercise, like walking, can help with both your back pain and your overall well-being. Staying socially active and engaging in activities you enjoy can also be beneficial for your cognitive health. And most importantly, don’t hesitate to lean on your daughter for support. I'm going to prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication for your back pain. It should help with the discomfort, but it’s not a long-term solution. We need to address the underlying cause. I’m here to support you every step of the way, Mr. Szmyd. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s the contact information for the neurologist and the imaging center, as well as the prescription for the anti-inflammatory medication. Take your time, and please remember you're not alone. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. It’s just… a lot to process. I’ll… talk to my daughter. And… I’ll try to stay active. But honestly, right now, I just want to go home and lie down. Thank you again. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Goodbye. .
