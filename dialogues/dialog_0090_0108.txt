DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, frankly. But… well, I’ve been, uh, losing blood. Not a little, either. It's coming from… down there. Not pleasant, I can tell you that. And it started a few days ago, just seemed to get worse and worse. Thought it might just be something I ate, but… it hasn’t stopped.
DOCTOR: Losing blood… from your rectum, you mean?
PATIENT: Rectum? Is that what you call it? Yeah, that's the place. Look, I’m not one for fancy words. Just… yeah, blood. And a fair bit of it, if you must know. It’s not a little trickle, alright? It's… concerning. I haven't felt weak exactly, but it’s definitely… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling is a fair way to put it. And how often would you say this is happening, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Happening? Well, it started Tuesday, I think. Now, it's… pretty much every time I go to the bathroom. Not with everything, if you know what I mean. But almost always. And the amount… it's different each time. Some times it’s just… streaks. Other times… well, let’s just say I’m worried about staining the porcelain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a better picture. And is the blood bright red, dark red, or something else?
PATIENT: Bright red, mostly. Sometimes it's a little darker, kind of… maroon-ish, I guess. But mostly bright red. And it’s… not clumpy. Not like when you cut yourself, you know? It’s… loose. Like it’s just… coming. Not a good sign, is it? I haven’t been eating anything weird, I swear. Just the usual stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, while I appreciate you assuring me about your diet, bright red blood generally indicates bleeding closer to the rectum, while darker blood can mean it’s higher up. We'll need to investigate. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort alongside this bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little cramping, maybe, but I get that sometimes anyway. Old age, probably. And… honestly, I've had worse. I’ve dealt with things you wouldn’t believe. This… this is mostly just worrying because of the blood. You know? It's… unsettling. And the cleanup. I don’t have anyone to help with this anymore, see? It's… a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz. And the cleanup is… unfortunate. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean? I go when I need to, same as always. Sometimes it's a little… softer, maybe? But I’ve always been a bit… irregular. Look, I'm not one for talking about this. It's embarrassing. And honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with anything. Just tell me what’s wrong and what you're going to do about it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand this is uncomfortable, but I need information to properly assess your condition. Changes in bowel habits, even if they seem minor, are important. Softer stools, and changes in frequency, can be indicators of several issues. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that you mention it… yeah, a bit, I suppose. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. But I haven't been eating as much, to be fair. Not much of an appetite these days. Lost my wife, see? Makes it hard to bother with things like cooking. It's… just me now. Everything feels… pointless.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, weight loss, changes in appetite, rectal bleeding…Mr. Gentz, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. Specifically, a digital rectal exam. And I'm going to order some blood work to check your hemoglobin and rule out anemia. We'll also need to check for occult blood in your stool. This is standard procedure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Occult… what now? Look, I don’t like the sound of any of that. A digital exam? You mean… sticking your finger…? Honestly, doc, I’m not sure I’m comfortable with all this poking and prodding. Can’t you just… give me something for it? Some pills? I don’t need a whole investigation. It’s probably just… a hemorrhoid or something.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, self-diagnosing is rarely accurate, and assuming it’s “just a hemorrhoid” without a proper examination is… unwise. While it could be a hemorrhoid, it could also be something far more serious. A digital rectal exam is a quick, relatively painless procedure that allows me to assess the rectum for any abnormalities. The blood work is also crucial. I need this information to determine the cause of your bleeding and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. I strongly advise you to allow me to proceed. If you refuse, I can document that, but I cannot provide a diagnosis or treatment plan without it. We are talking about your health, here. Do you understand the implications of refusing a basic examination?
PATIENT: Oh, so now you're lecturing me? Look, I’ve lived a long life, seen things you wouldn’t believe. I'm not some child you can boss around. Fine. Do your… poking. But I'm warning you, if it's uncomfortable, I'm walking out. And don't expect me to be happy about it. It's already been a terrible week. Just… get it over with. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your side, with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will need to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to assess for any abnormalities. Please inform me immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort. I’ll also need a stool sample, there’s a collection kit in the bathroom. This will only take a moment.
PATIENT: A moment, she says… Like it’s no big deal… Fine. Just… hurry up. Don't go digging around in there too much, alright? And try to be gentle. Honestly, I don’t know why I bothered coming in here. This is just… humiliating.
DOCTOR: I detect some tenderness, and what appears to be a small internal hemorrhoid, but there’s also a mass I’m concerned about. It’s firm and doesn’t easily move. It’s not definitive, but it requires further investigation. I will order a colonoscopy as soon as possible to visualize the entire colon and determine the nature of this mass. In the meantime, I am prescribing an iron supplement to address potential anemia from the blood loss. The stool sample will confirm the presence of occult blood. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A… a mass? What do you mean, a mass? Is it… is it cancer? You’re not telling me it’s cancer, are you? I knew it. I knew something was wrong. I should have just stayed home and let it be. A colonoscopy… That sounds… awful. How awful? And what if it is cancer? What do I even do then?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, please. Let's not jump to conclusions. A mass simply means there's an abnormal growth. It could be benign – a polyp, for example. However, it requires investigation to determine its nature. A colonoscopy involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It's not comfortable, admittedly, but it's a necessary diagnostic procedure. You will be sedated, so you won't feel much. If it is cancer, there are treatment options available, ranging from surgical removal to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis depends on the stage and type of cancer. Right now, we need to focus on getting a definitive diagnosis. I'm referring you to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected gastroenterologist. His office will contact you to schedule the colonoscopy. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Chemotherapy… radiation… I’ve seen what that does to people. It’s… not a good way to go. Dr. Ramirez, you say? Alright. I guess I don't have much choice, do I? But… what if I don't want treatment? What if I just want to… let things be? Is that even an option? I'm a widower. I don't have anyone depending on me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, while you are, of course, entitled to make your own decisions regarding your healthcare, I strongly advise against refusing treatment without a proper diagnosis. Choosing to “let things be” when there’s a potential mass in your colon is… irresponsible. It could lead to serious complications, including bowel obstruction and sepsis. While I respect your autonomy, I have a professional obligation to advocate for your well-being. I need you to sign this consent form acknowledging that you understand the risks and benefits of the colonoscopy, and that you are aware of the potential consequences of refusing treatment. Dr. Ramirez will discuss all of your options with you in detail. He will also be able to answer any questions you may have. Please read it carefully before signing.
PATIENT: A death warrant… that’s what it is. All these legal words… I don’t like this. I don’t like any of this. You make it sound like I’m being foolish, like I’m not thinking clearly. But it’s my life. My body. Why can’t you just give me some pills and let me be? I just want some peace. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, your desire for “peace” does not negate the potential severity of your condition. Ignoring a possible mass is not a rational or responsible course of action. I understand you’re grieving and perhaps feeling overwhelmed, but that doesn’t give you license to make impulsive decisions that could jeopardize your health. My job is to provide you with the best possible medical care, and that includes recommending necessary diagnostic procedures and treatment options. I’m not “trying to force” anything on you; I’m simply fulfilling my professional obligation. Please, just read the form. It outlines the risks and benefits in clear language. Dr. Ramirez is an excellent physician; he will discuss your concerns with you and help you make an informed decision. But refusing a colonoscopy without a diagnosis is… frankly, reckless. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Gentz. I’m afraid I don’t have time to debate this further. Do you want me to prepare the referral for Dr. Ramirez, or not?
PATIENT: Reckless… always a judgement. Fine. Prepare the referral. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And if it turns out to be nothing… if it's just a harmless polyp… I'm holding you personally responsible for all the stress and worry this has caused me. There. Done. Now, can I please just go? I need a drink. A strong one.
DOCTOR: Very well. Dr. Ramirez's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. The sheet includes his contact information and directions to his office. I strongly advise you to call them as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Just… leave me alone. And don't bother calling me. I’ll figure it out myself. You doctors… always so quick to jump to conclusions and poke and prod.
DOCTOR:
