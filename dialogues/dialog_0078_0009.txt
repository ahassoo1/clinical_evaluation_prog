DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well, I suppose. Though I must say, these urban clinics…not what I’m accustomed to. But, well, here I am. I’ve been having some trouble with my vision, naturally. It’s…deteriorating. It’s rather inconvenient, to put it mildly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Alcorta. It sounds frustrating to experience changes in your vision. We'll do our best to figure out what's going on. “Deteriorating” is a good starting point, but could you tell me a little more specifically about how it’s changing?
PATIENT: Specifically? Honestly, Doctor, it's just…less clear. Things aren't as sharp as they used to be. And it's not like a sudden thing, it’s been…gradual. It’s difficult to explain to someone who, I presume, still has good eyesight. It’s like looking through a…a slightly smudged window, perhaps. Though I haven’t actually tried looking through a smudged window recently. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, actually, Mr. Alcorta. “Slightly smudged window” paints a very clear picture. Gradual onset is important information, too. So, it’s not blurry all the time, or is it consistent throughout the day?
PATIENT: Consistent, I’d say. It's not like it comes and goes. Though…now that you mention it, perhaps it is a little worse at the end of the day. I do spend a fair amount of time reviewing personnel files. Straining my eyes, naturally. Poor quality paper these days, I suspect. Not like the old days. But generally, it's just…diminished. Consistently diminished.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistently diminished with a slight worsening at the end of the day, especially with close work. That gives us something to work with. Do you notice any difficulty with distance vision as well, or is it mostly with reading and close-up tasks?
PATIENT: Distance is…adequate. I haven't had any trouble driving, for instance. Though I don’t drive as much as I used to. My ex-wife did most of the travelling. No, it’s primarily up close. Reading reports, filling out forms…those sorts of things. Honestly, Doctor, it’s becoming rather…humiliating. I used to be able to spot a typo from across the room. Now…well, it’s just embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. It's definitely concerning when things start to affect your daily activities, and it sounds like it's impacting your work. Let's do a quick eye exam to get a better sense of what's going on. I'd like to check your visual acuity, and then we can take a look at your eyes themselves. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An exam, yes. That's…logical, I suppose. Though I trust you have sanitized equipment? One can’t be too careful these days. And please, no…unnecessary poking and prodding. I have a rather low tolerance for that sort of thing. But yes, proceed. Just…be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. We always use sterilized equipment, and I will be as gentle as possible. No unnecessary poking or prodding, I assure you. Let's start with your visual acuity. Could you please stand about 20 feet away from the chart and cover your left eye with the palm of your hand?
PATIENT: Twenty feet? That is rather far. Very well. Proceed, Doctor. But do try to be quick about it. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Starting with the top line, could you read the letters for me?
PATIENT: …E…P…T…F…V… Okay. Next line…H…K…N…B…X… Honestly, these letters are rather small. Is this standard? They seem…unnecessarily tiny.
DOCTOR: They are standard, Mr. Alcorta, and help us assess your vision accurately. Let’s continue, if you don’t mind. Could you read this line for me, please?
PATIENT: …C… Uh… F… L… P… I… I'm…having some difficulty. It’s rather blurry. Are you certain the lighting is adequate? Perhaps the chart itself is defective. It’s just…not very clear. I’m not accustomed to straining my eyes like this.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. That's helpful to know. It sounds like your vision is reduced. Now, let’s switch eyes. Please cover your right eye with the palm of your hand, and we’ll test your left eye. Again, starting with the top line, could you read the letters for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I suspect the results will be…similar. E…P…T…F…V… Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tedious. Is there a quicker method? Perhaps a machine? I read about those…optical devices…that can diagnose these things instantly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. Unfortunately, a manual exam is the most accurate way to assess your vision at this time. We do have some additional equipment we can use to get a more comprehensive understanding of what's going on, but let’s finish this part first. Could you read this line for me, please?
PATIENT: No. I…I can’t make them out. They’re just…blurs. This is a complete waste of time, Doctor. Honestly. I’m telling you, something is wrong with your equipment. Or the lighting. Or…something. I'm not accustomed to this level of…incompetence. Just…stop. Please. I can’t strain my eyes any further. It’s…unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. I appreciate your patience. Based on this brief exam, your vision is significantly reduced in both eyes. Given your difficulty with both distance and near vision, and the rapid decline you've described, I'd like to perform a more thorough examination, including checking the pressure in your eyes, examining the back of your eyes with a special lens, and assessing your peripheral vision. This will help us determine the cause of your vision loss. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision? Special lenses? It sounds…invasive, Doctor. And frankly, rather alarming. I haven't got a history of eye problems, you know. This is all rather sudden. Are you suggesting…something serious? I must say, I'm beginning to regret coming here. Though I suppose, at this point, I might as well see it through. But I insist, minimal poking and prodding. And explain everything before you do it. I do not appreciate surprises. And if it involves any…dilation…I want to know beforehand. Absolutely beforehand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Alcorta. I assure you, we'll proceed with the utmost care and respect. Checking the pressure in your eyes is a very quick and painless procedure, similar to gently touching your eye. Examining the back of your eyes with a special lens allows us to see the optic nerve and blood vessels, which can reveal clues about the cause of your vision loss. And yes, to answer your question, one part of the exam does involve dilating your pupils. This makes it easier to see the back of your eyes clearly, but it will temporarily blur your vision for a few hours afterward, and you may be sensitive to light. We can discuss alternatives if you are strongly opposed to dilation, but it will significantly limit our ability to assess your condition accurately. Would you like me to explain the potential causes of your vision loss that we'll be looking for?
PATIENT: Potential causes? Oh, lovely. As if this isn’t distressing enough. Very well, Doctor. Explain. But keep it brief, and avoid any…graphic details. I haven’t the stomach for it. And no medical jargon, please. I want to understand, not be subjected to a lecture in ophthalmology. Just…the basics. And if it involves anything…contagious…I want to know immediately. I have…a compromised immune system. It’s a long story. Just…proceed. But slowly. And gently. As you promised.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will keep it brief and avoid any unnecessary details. There are several potential causes for gradual vision loss. Some of the most common include age-related macular degeneration, which affects the central part of your vision; cataracts, which cause clouding of the lens; glaucoma, which damages the optic nerve; and diabetic retinopathy, if you have diabetes. Less common causes include problems with blood flow to the eye, inflammation, and certain medications. We'll be checking for these possibilities during the examination. I understand your concern about a compromised immune system, and I assure you we take strict infection control precautions. The instruments we use are thoroughly sterilized, and we'll follow all necessary guidelines to protect your health. Before we proceed, do you have any questions about these potential causes, or anything else we've discussed so far?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Never had it. As for the…others. Macular degeneration…cataracts…sounds unpleasant. And glaucoma…is that…contagious? I distinctly remember my ex-wife mentioning something about that…a colleague of hers…very nasty business. And if it is contagious, I need to know immediately. Before you…poke and prod. And what about the…sterilization? What exactly does that entail? Do you use…new instruments for each patient? Or are they merely…wiped down? Because frankly, that wouldn’t be acceptable. I have…standards, you know. I’m very particular about hygiene. This is all rather unsettling, Doctor. Quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Alcorta. It’s important to feel confident in the care you receive. Glaucoma is not contagious. It's caused by a buildup of fluid pressure inside the eye, and it's not spread through contact with others. As for sterilization, we use a process called autoclaving, which uses high-pressure steam to kill all bacteria and viruses on our instruments. It's the same method used in hospitals and surgical centers. We do use new, single-use disposable instruments whenever possible, especially for procedures that involve direct contact with your eyes. For instruments that cannot be disposable, they are thoroughly sterilized after each patient, and we follow strict infection control protocols to prevent any cross-contamination. I understand your concern about hygiene, and I want to assure you that we take it very seriously. We follow all guidelines set forth by the CDC and other regulatory agencies to ensure the safety of our patients. Does that address your concerns about sterilization and infection control?
PATIENT: Autoclaving…yes, that sounds…adequate. Though I still prefer disposable instruments whenever possible. And I trust you have a rigorous quality control system in place to ensure the autoclaving process is effective? One cannot be too careful. And what about…your staff? Are they properly trained in infection control procedures? Because frankly, I’ve seen some rather…questionable hygiene practices in medical settings. Alright. Very well. Proceed. But slowly. And gently. As you promised. And if I feel any…discomfort…stop immediately. I have a low tolerance for pain. And I expect a full explanation of everything you do, before you do it. No surprises. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I completely understand your concerns, and I assure you we take them very seriously. We do have a rigorous quality control system in place to ensure the autoclaving process is effective, and our staff is thoroughly trained in infection control procedures. We also adhere to strict hand hygiene protocols and wear appropriate personal protective equipment. I promise to proceed slowly and gently, and I will explain everything I do before I do it. If you feel any discomfort at any point, please let me know immediately, and I will stop. Your comfort and safety are my top priorities. If you’re ready, please have a seat in the examination chair, and we can begin the examination. We’ll start by checking your visual fields, which helps us assess your peripheral vision. It involves looking straight ahead while I present targets in your side vision. It doesn’t involve any poking or prodding, and it shouldn’t cause any discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Visual fields…yes, that sounds…relatively harmless. Though I trust you won’t be waving anything too close to my eyes. I have sensitive corneas. And please, no sudden movements. I dislike surprises. Proceed. But slowly. And gently. As you promised. And explain what you're doing as you go. Don’t just…start waving things around. I expect a full briefing. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I will proceed slowly and gently, and I will explain everything I’m doing as I go. No sudden movements, and I will keep everything well away from your eyes. Okay, so what I’m going to do is have you look straight ahead at this point on the wall. I’ll be presenting small lights in your peripheral vision – to the sides of where you’re looking. Whenever you see a light, please say “yes.” If you don’t see a light, please say “no.” I’ll be moving the lights around in different areas of your peripheral vision to get a complete picture. It might take a few minutes, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Are you ready to begin?
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed. But do try to be precise. I don't want any false positives. And if I detect any…irregularities…I expect you to stop immediately. I have a keen sense of perception. Begin. But slowly. And gently. As you promised. And no…distracting noises. I require complete silence.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Looking straight ahead… do you see the light?
PATIENT: …No. Though I thought I detected a…flicker. Barely perceptible. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to perceive a slight flicker occasionally, Mr. Alcorta. We’re just checking to see if you notice any areas where you consistently don't see the lights. Okay, looking straight ahead… do you see the light now?
PATIENT: …Yes. Definitely yes. A clear, distinct light. Though it’s rather small. Is that intentional? Are you testing my visual acuity as well as my peripheral vision? Because frankly, I find this rather…inconvenient. It feels like two tests for the price of one. Proceed. But slowly. And gently. As you promised. And do try to be more precise.
DOCTOR: It is a small light, Mr. Alcorta, but we are primarily focusing on peripheral vision at this time. We’ll address your visual acuity more comprehensively later in the exam. Okay, looking straight ahead… do you see the light now?
PATIENT: …No. Not a flicker. Not a glimmer. Nothing. Though I thought I detected a…shadow. Just to the left. Is that significant? Are you testing my depth perception as well? Because frankly, I find this rather…confusing. It feels like three tests for the price of one. Proceed. But slowly. And gently. As you promised. And do try to be more…organized. This is becoming quite chaotic.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Alcorta. We are only testing your peripheral vision at this time, and I will be more organized in my approach. Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Looking straight ahead…do you see the light now?
PATIENT: …Yes. A faint, but discernible light. Though it seems…dimmer than the previous one. Is that intentional? Are you adjusting the intensity to test my sensitivity? Because frankly, this is becoming rather…tedious. It feels like four tests for the price of one. Proceed. But slowly. And gently. As you promised. And do try to maintain a consistent intensity. This is crucial for accurate results. And please, no sudden movements. It’s…distracting.
DOCTOR: You are correct to notice the intensity, Mr. Alcorta. We are testing your sensitivity to light, and I apologize for the inconsistency earlier. I will ensure a consistent intensity moving forward. Okay, looking straight ahead… do you see the light now?
PATIENT: …No. Not a flicker. Not a glimmer. Absolutely nothing. Though I thought I detected a…movement. Just to the right. Is that significant? Are you testing my peripheral reflexes as well? Because frankly, this is becoming rather…exhausting. It feels like five tests for the price of one. Proceed. But slowly. And gently. As you promised. And do try to be more precise. This is crucial for accurate results. And please, no distractions. It’s…unsettling. I require complete silence.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the length of the test, Mr. Alcorta. It's important to get a complete picture of your peripheral vision. We are not testing your reflexes. It seems you're very attuned to subtle changes in your vision, which is helpful. Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Looking straight ahead… do you see the light now?
PATIENT: …Yes. A faint, but discernible light. Though it seems…slightly brighter than the previous one. Are you intentionally varying the intensity to test my ability to differentiate between shades? Because frankly, this is becoming…absurd. It feels like six tests for the price of one. Proceed. But slowly. And gently. As you promised. And do try to maintain consistency. This is crucial for accurate results. And please, no sudden movements. It’s…distracting. And I require complete silence. This is…unsettling. Seriously, Doctor. This is…enough. . I'm not proceeding any further. It's…ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems this test is not providing useful information at this time. We can stop here. Based on your responses, it appears you are very sensitive to subtle changes in light and movement. However, the inconsistency in your responses makes it difficult to assess your peripheral vision accurately. We can move on to another part of the examination, if you’re comfortable. We can check your visual acuity, eye pressure, and the back of your eyes with a special lens. This will provide a more comprehensive picture of your vision and help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Would you like to proceed?
