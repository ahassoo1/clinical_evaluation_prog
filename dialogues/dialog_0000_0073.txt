DOCTOR: Right. Triana Woodring, 37 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? This has been going on way too long. It's… well, it's just the runs. Non-stop. I’ve tried everything the drugstore has, and it’s not helping. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: "The runs," you say. Right. And how long exactly has this “non-stop” situation been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don’t know, like… a couple of weeks, maybe? It feels like forever. I really don’t keep track of these things. It just started and hasn’t let up. I’m losing weight, and it’s embarrassing, okay? I don’t go anywhere without knowing where a bathroom is.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks. Losing weight, you say. Well, that is concerning. Though, frankly, a bit of self-awareness about timing would be helpful. Have you noticed anything specific that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Look, I eat normal food. I haven’t been eating anything… exotic. It just happens. Sometimes it’s after I eat, sometimes it isn’t. There’s no rhyme or reason to it. I really don't pay attention to that level of detail. It's just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: "Normal food." Right. And what is normal food to you, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, come on. You're a doctor, you tell me. Burgers, sandwiches, salad… you know, regular stuff. I'm not one of those people who only eats organic kale and chia seeds. I'm a working woman, I eat to keep going. Are we really doing this? I told you I have diarrhea, can we just figure out how to stop it?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Woodring, I am a doctor, and part of my job is to gather information. Simply saying “normal food” isn’t helpful. Are you lactose intolerant, perhaps?
PATIENT: Lactose...what? No! I drink milk, I eat cheese, I've never had a problem with it. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just want something to make it stop. It’s not like I’m asking for a miracle, just… normal digestion. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's check your EHR. Hmm. No reported lactose intolerance, no recent travel… Any family history of digestive issues, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: My grandmother...she had a sensitive stomach. But everyone in my family has a sensitive stomach, it's Tlingit thing, I think. Lots of fish, lots of… well, you wouldn’t understand. It’s not like it's something we talk about with doctors. It’s just how things are. Look, is there anything you can give me? Something to calm it down? I don't need a lecture about family history.
DOCTOR: "Calm it down." Right. And you expect a quick fix without any information?
PATIENT: Well, yeah! Isn't that what doctors do? I came here for a solution, not an interrogation. I'm a painter, I'm busy, I don’t have time to sit around and analyze my bowel movements. It's been weeks, nothing is working, just... help me! I'm losing work because I can't leave the house. Can we please just try something?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table. And try to relax. Though, frankly, I doubt that will be possible with your… attitude.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. This is ridiculous. Honestly, the whole thing is just… a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bowel sounds are… hyperactive. No tenderness to palpation. Temperature is normal. Weight is… concerningly low, as you stated. 52 kilograms for a height of 164 centimeters. That is a BMI of 19.2. Do you have any nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Just… a lot of running to the bathroom. And no blood, not that I’ve seen. It’s just… watery. Really watery. And it smells awful. I just want it to stop. Is this going to take much longer? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the hyperactive bowel sounds, the weight loss, and the duration of symptoms, I suspect Irritable Bowel Syndrome, possibly with some degree of malabsorption. However, we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order a stool sample to check for parasites and bacteria. And a blood test to assess for inflammation and rule out celiac disease. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Parasites? Seriously? I live in town, not the jungle. But fine, whatever you want. Stool sample, blood test… just tell me what I have to do. And how long is this going to take? I need to know if I can get back to work tomorrow. I can’t afford to be off sick any longer. Honestly, this is a complete disruption.
DOCTOR: You’ll need to collect a stool sample—instructions are on the form—and go to the lab tomorrow morning. The blood test can be done any time. Results will take a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you loperamide—Imodium—to help control the diarrhea. Use it as directed. And try to eat bland foods—rice, toast, bananas. I also recommend a probiotic. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Loperamide… okay, fine. And bland food. I guess. Look, I just… thank you. I appreciate you trying to help. I really just want to get back to normal. One week, though? That feels like a long time. But okay. No, I don’t think so. That’s all. Can I go now? I have to get this done and get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you may go. And please, follow the instructions. .
