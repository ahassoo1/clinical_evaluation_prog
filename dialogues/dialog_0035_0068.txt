DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Sasha. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… the swelling. After the cancer stuff. It’s my leg, mostly. It’s been getting bigger, you know? It’s not… painful, really, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your leg after cancer treatment. I understand. To get a better picture of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? After I finished all the… the radiation. It was small at first, I didn’t even notice it much. Just felt a little tighter in my pants, you know? But it’s definitely bigger now. I don’t… I don’t really know when exactly it started getting worse, just… slowly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Slowly getting worse over the past month. And just to clarify, this is in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, just the left one. My right leg is… normal. It's only the left one that’s puffy. It’s… strange. I haven't bumped it or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, left leg only, no injury. Have you noticed any changes in the color or temperature of your skin on that leg?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. I don’t think so. It looks… pink, I guess? Like my other leg. And… no, not colder or warmer. It feels… normal temperature, really. It's just… bigger. Is that bad? I'm sorry, I don't know all the words for things.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing fine. It's good you're telling me what you're experiencing. We'll figure it out. Have you noticed any changes in your skin texture - is it harder, softer, thicker, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… thicker, maybe? Yes, I think so. It doesn’t… feel like my normal skin. It’s… harder when I press on it. Not painful, just… not soft like my other leg. I hope that makes sense. I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Okay, so swelling in your left leg that started about a month after radiation, no pain, skin color is normal, but feels thicker and harder than your other leg. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Were you treated for cancer recently, and if so, what type of cancer was it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It was… breast cancer. About six months ago, they told me. I had surgery, and then… the radiation. Lots of radiation. And some… pills. I can't remember the names of the pills, sorry. Everything is a bit… fuzzy sometimes. It was at the hospital… downtown. That's all I really remember, I think. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Breast cancer treated with surgery and radiation about six months ago. And you're currently taking some pills, but you don't recall the names. That's alright, we can look that up. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. No, not really. I had high blood pressure once, a long time ago, but they gave me pills for that too, and it went away. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I see my regular doctor, but… he just checks my heart and blood pressure, usually. Nothing special. I’m usually pretty healthy, you know? Except for the… cancer. Is this going to be from the cancer? I’m worried.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Sasha. We'll investigate. The swelling could be related to the cancer treatment, it's common to experience some side effects after radiation. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I take… I take something for my arthritis sometimes, but that's it. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, really. No food allergies, no… nothing. I'm pretty lucky, usually. I hope this swelling isn't serious. It just… feels strange. .
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your leg. Is that alright with you?
