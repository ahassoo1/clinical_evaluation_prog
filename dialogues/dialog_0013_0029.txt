DOCTOR: Hi Norval, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Chriselda. Good to meet you too. It’s this… eating thing. I just don't seem to be able to eat much these days before I feel full. It’s been happening for a little while now, and my wife, bless her heart, she says I'm losing weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing a loss of appetite and feeling full quickly, and your wife has noticed some weight loss. That's definitely something we want to look into. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, when did it start… that’s a good question. It didn’t happen all at once, you see. Maybe… six months ago? It was gradual. I used to be able to put away a good plate of salmon and rice, and now… a few bites and I’m done. It's just not the same. I can’t really pinpoint a specific day, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Gradual changes can be harder to track. Six months is good to know. And has this been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not sick tired, just… sluggish. And maybe a little heartburn now and then, but I get that sometimes anyway. Old age, you know? Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Sluggishness and some occasional heartburn. And you said the heartburn isn't new, just… present sometimes. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any pain when you do eat?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing. Not a bit. And no pain, either. It’s not like that. It just… feels like my stomach is full after only a few mouthfuls. It’s a strange feeling, hard to explain. Like there's not much room in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain or difficulty swallowing, just a feeling of early fullness. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No sickness, no throwing up. Just this… fullness. It’s frustrating, you know? I used to enjoy a good meal. And now… well, now it’s just not the same. My wife makes a lovely roast chicken, but I can barely manage a few pieces.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements… Well, now that you mention it… they haven't been as regular as they used to be. A little constipated, maybe? It's not a big problem, just… not as predictable. I try to drink plenty of water, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some constipation alongside the early fullness and weight loss. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for, or have you been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they put a stent in, and it's been alright ever since. I see Dr. Olsen for that, he’s a good man. Aside from that… not much, really. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendectomy in your youth and a stent placed for a heart condition, managed by Dr. Olsen. That’s helpful to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your heart, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the heart. I take… let me see… I have it right here. I’m on Clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, once a day. And Atorvastatin, 40 milligrams, also once a day. And that’s it, I think. Just those two.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clopidogrel and Atorvastatin. Perfect. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always says I’ll eat anything. She worries about me, that woman. But no, no allergies. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no to all of that. Never been much of a drinker, doesn’t agree with me. And I quit smoking when I was a young man, best thing I ever did. Never touched the other stuff either. Clean living, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. My wife does most of the cooking, and she’s very good at it. Lots of fish, salmon especially, we’re Haida, after all. Rice, vegetables, some chicken. We don’t eat a lot of red meat. She makes a lovely berry pie too, but I’ve been eating less of that lately, with this… problem. I used to enjoy a good roast dinner on Sundays, but I can't manage much of it these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good overview. So, healthy diet, mostly, with fish and vegetables. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not as spry as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. Please just let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. Take a few deep breaths for me, Norval. In… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little slow, which is expected with the medications you're on. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… feels normal, I suppose. Maybe a little soft. Ooh, that's a bit tender, just there, on the right side. Not painful, just… sensitive. But it could just be my imagination.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I noticed some mild tenderness there as well. It's not significant, but we’ll keep that in mind. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight fullness. No masses or any other abnormalities that are immediately concerning. Alright, Norval. Based on what you’ve told me and what I've found during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. The weight loss, early fullness, constipation, and mild tenderness on the right side could be related to a few things. It could be something simple like a change in diet or medication side effects. However, given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out anything more serious. I recommend we do some blood work to check your liver function, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. I'd also like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and other organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment, Chriselda. Blood work and an ultrasound… yes, that’s fine. Just… tell me if anything is seriously wrong, alright? I’m not getting any younger, and I’d like to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Norval. I will be completely upfront with you. We're going to get to the bottom of this and figure out what's going on. I'll order the blood work and ultrasound right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll get you in quickly. The ultrasound will likely be scheduled for tomorrow or the next day. In the meantime, try to continue eating small, frequent meals, even if you don't feel very hungry. And make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids. I’ll call you as soon as the results are back, usually within a couple of days. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Small meals, plenty of fluids… I can do that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Chriselda. It's good to know someone is taking this seriously. I’ll head down to the lab now then. Thank you again.
