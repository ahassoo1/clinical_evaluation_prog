DOCTOR: Right. Enrique Withycombe, 57. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It's… the flushing. I get very red, you see. Especially my face. It comes and goes. Not always, but… often enough it bothers me. It’s been happening for maybe… three months now, I think? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Three months, you say. Vague, but alright. And when you say “flushing,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's like… warm. Very warm feeling. Starts on my face, then maybe my neck, sometimes my chest. And I look red. Very, very red. Like tomato, maybe? My wife… she used to say I looked like a tomato. It doesn’t hurt, no itching, just… warm and red. It comes quickly, and then goes, maybe after a few minutes. Sometimes longer. It's… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing is not a medical term, Mr. Withycombe. Does anything trigger this flushing?
PATIENT: Trigger? You mean… what makes it happen? Hmm. That’s a good question. I don't know. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Sometimes it happens when I’m talking. Not always, but… when I get excited, maybe? Or nervous. And sometimes… just nothing. I'm sitting quietly, and then… warm. Red. I do drink tea, you know. Black tea. Every day. Could that be it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Black tea, hm. And how much tea, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Maybe… three cups a day? Sometimes four. Big cups. My wife… she made strong tea. I kept making it the same way after she… well. I’ve always liked strong tea. Is that… bad? I don't know about how much is too much, Doctor. Never thought about it, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the tea, any other changes in your life lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… well… my wife passed away last year, you see. That was a big change. Still very sad, every day. I try to keep busy, you know? I do some… counseling work. People with… problems. It keeps my mind occupied. Other than that… not much changes. I eat the same food, I sleep about the same… I walk to the shop most days. Just… quiet. That's my life now. Is that important, Doctor? About my wife?
DOCTOR: Grief can certainly manifest in… various ways. But let’s focus on the physical. Any other symptoms at all when this flushing happens?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, sometimes… I get a little bit… shaky. My hands, you know? Not very bad, just a little bit. And my heart… beats faster. Like when you run, maybe. But I am not running! It doesn't last long, though. Just while I am red. And maybe… a little bit dizzy. Just for a moment. It all happens at once, sometimes. Red, shaky, fast heart, little dizzy. But it goes away, you know? Like nothing happened. It’s just… surprising. Is that… something to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had your blood pressure checked, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Oh, um… I don’t think so. Not recently. My wife… she had a machine. But after she… I didn’t really use it. I didn’t… I just didn't bother, you know? I don’t know what my blood pressure is. Is it… important? For the flushing? Maybe that’s what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Withycombe, it is important. Let’s get that checked first. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I hope it’s not… something bad. I just want to feel normal again. Like before. It’s just… this flushing. It’s very unsettling, you know? And I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: 150 over 90. Not ideal, Mr. Withycombe. And you said you experience dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh. 150… is that bad? I don’t know what those numbers mean. And yes, a little dizzy. Sometimes. Not every time, but… when I am red and shaky, maybe. I feel… lightheaded. Like I might fall. It doesn’t last long, though. I never actually fall. But it is… worrying. Is that high blood pressure… causing the flushing, Doctor? And the shaky and dizzy? What should I do?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Withycombe, it's possible your flushing is related to your blood pressure, but we can't say for certain without further investigation. The dizziness and shakiness are certainly concerning. I recommend a full cardiac workup - EKG, echocardiogram, and a 24-hour Holter monitor. Also, we need to rule out any underlying endocrine issues, so I'll order a blood panel to check your thyroid and cortisol levels. And frankly, given your diet and stress level, I suggest immediate lifestyle changes, starting with reducing your tea intake significantly. .
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a lot. Cardiac workup? EKG? Holter monitor? I don’t know what any of those are. And my tea… I like my tea. It’s all I have, really. It’s just… a lot. How much tea is too much? And is this… very serious, Doctor? What if it’s… my heart? I don't have much money, you know. Can I afford all this? And what about the… sadness? Does that have anything to do with it? It’s just… overwhelming. .
