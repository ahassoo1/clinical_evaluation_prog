DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, let me see… it’s a bit hard to explain. It’s about… well, my family, mostly. And… something happening to me, I think. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. She worries so. It’s about… weakness, on one side, I believe. And headaches. Terrible headaches run in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness on one side and headaches… and a family history of headaches. That’s a good place to start. Could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it comes and goes, you see? It’s not… constant. More like… a heaviness. In my arm, mostly. And sometimes… my leg feels a little clumsy. It’s hard to describe. It doesn’t happen often, thankfully. But when it does… it frightens me a bit. It’s just… not right. And my mother… she had something similar, I think. But it was a long time ago. I don’t remember the details very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent weakness, mostly in your arm, sometimes your leg. And a family history of something similar in your mother… I understand it can be difficult to recall details from long ago. Just to clarify, when you say "intermittent," about how often would you say this weakness occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question, Doctor. It’s… not like every day, certainly. Maybe… once or twice a month? Sometimes longer between episodes. It’s very unpredictable. And… it doesn't last long, usually. Just a few minutes, then it fades. But… it worries me because… well, my sister, she had terrible migraines. Really awful ones. And sometimes… I wonder if there’s a connection. Does that make sense? I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Tofani. You're not rambling, and it's good you're sharing all of this with me. It all helps me understand what's going on. So, weakness occurring roughly once or twice a month, lasting a few minutes, and a family history of migraines in your sister. Now, let’s talk about these headaches. Can you describe what they feel like?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… they’re… throbbing, mostly. On one side of my head, usually. And sometimes… I feel a little nauseous with them. Not always, but sometimes. And bright lights… oh, I can’t stand bright lights when I have one. My daughter says I get very quiet and just want to lie down in a dark room. I don’t remember much during the headache, to be honest. It just… is. They’re not constant, thankfully. Not like my sister’s. Hers were… debilitating. She’d have to miss work for days. Mine… I can usually manage, but they’re not pleasant, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, throbbing headaches, usually on one side, sometimes with nausea, and sensitivity to light. You mentioned your sister’s migraines were more severe. And these headaches… would you say they are new, or have you experienced them for a long time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I suppose… I’ve always had headaches, to some degree. But these… the ones that feel like throbbing… those have gotten worse in the last… few years, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. I'm getting older, you see. Things just… change. My memory isn’t what it used to be, either. My daughter says I ask the same questions over and over. But I think the headaches have become more frequent, and maybe a little more intense. It’s just… a feeling. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make perfect sense, Ms. Tofani. It’s common for symptoms to change over time, and memory can certainly be affected as we get older. So, to summarize, you've had headaches for a long time, but they've become more frequent and intense in the last few years, accompanied by intermittent weakness on one side of your body. Before we move on, could you tell me a little about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… other symptoms… Well, sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not often, but it happens. And… I get tired easily, I suppose. But I’m 83 years old, Doctor! I expect to be tired! I don’t know if that counts as a symptom. And… no, I don’t think so. Nothing else comes to mind right now. My daughter will probably think of something, she always does. She’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and fatigue… that’s good to know. And it's perfectly reasonable to experience those things at any age, but it's important to mention them. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. I have… high blood pressure, I believe. The doctor put me on medication for it years ago. And… arthritis, in my hands and knees. It’s not too bad, but it makes things stiff sometimes. And… no, I don’t think so. Nothing else that I can recall. I had a hysterectomy many years ago, but that was… a long time ago. Does that matter? I’m probably forgetting something. It’s just… so much to remember.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not forgetting anything. That’s all very helpful to know. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a hysterectomy in the past. Do you currently take any medications for these conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. For the blood pressure, I take… Lisinopril, I think it is. A little white pill. And… sometimes I take Ibuprofen for the arthritis, when it’s really bothering me. That’s about it. And… oh, a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. That’s all. I try to keep it simple, you see. Too many pills and I get confused!
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a Vitamin D supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I don’t think so. I haven’t had any problems with any medications in the past. I remember being allergic to bee stings as a child, but that was a long, long time ago. And… no, I don’t have any food allergies. I eat just about anything. My daughter always worries about me, but I have a pretty strong stomach. I haven’t had any allergic reactions that I can recall. Does that make sense? I'm trying to remember everything. It's just... difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Tofani. No known medication allergies, a childhood bee sting allergy, but nothing current. Now, let's talk about your family history. You mentioned your mother and sister earlier. Can you tell me a little more about their medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my mother… she had those terrible headaches, like I said. The doctor said it was migraines, but I don’t remember all the details. She also had… high blood pressure, I think. And she had some problems with her heart later in life. And my sister… oh, she had the worst migraines you could imagine. She’d have to miss work for days. She saw a specialist, but… I don’t know what they did. She’s gone now, bless her heart. She passed away a few years ago. And… no, I don’t think anyone else in the family had anything similar. Just my mother and sister with the headaches. It’s just… a worry, you see. I hope that makes sense. I’m probably rambling again.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all. That's very helpful to know. Your mother had migraines, high blood pressure, and heart problems, and your sister had severe migraines. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Lifestyle… well, I’m retired, you see. I used to work in an insurance office, processing claims. But now I mostly just take it easy. I live with my husband, thankfully. He’s a good man. We enjoy watching television and… visiting our grandchildren when we can. I don’t really exercise much, to be honest. My arthritis makes it difficult. And… I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. That’s about it. A pretty simple life, you see. Nothing too exciting. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to know, Ms. Tofani. A simple and peaceful life. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and neurological function. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, so I’m glad you’re taking such good care of me. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I have… sensitive skin, you see. And… I get a little nervous when doctors poke and prod! But I’ll try to be brave.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/85. Not dramatically so, but something we'll keep an eye on. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Just take your time. I'm a little wobbly sometimes, you see. But I'll try my best. My daughter always says I'm a bit clumsy. Follow your finger… right? And check my arms and legs… Alright, let’s do it. Just be gentle, please. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani, everything seems symmetrical so far. Your facial muscles are strong, and your reflexes are normal. However, I am noticing some slight weakness in your right arm compared to your left. It’s subtle, but present. And your grip strength is a little weaker on the right side as well. Let me check your sensation. Sensation seems intact, but we'll keep a close eye on this weakness. Now, I'd like to take a look at your ears, nose, and throat, just to rule out any other potential causes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… weakness, you say? That doesn't sound good. But… alright, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. Check my ears, nose, and throat… I haven’t had a sore throat in years, thankfully. But I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, please. I get a little nervous when you look in my ears. It tickles!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani, everything looks clear in your ears, nose, and throat. No signs of infection or inflammation. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I'm noticing some slight weakness in your right arm and a slightly weaker grip on that side. Everything else appears normal. Now, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of a neurological issue. It could be a number of things, and we need to investigate further. Would you be willing to get a brain scan, such as an MRI or CT scan, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a brain scan? That sounds… serious. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I’m not a fan of hospitals and… all those machines. But… if you think it’s important… alright. If it will help figure out what’s going on… I suppose so. But… will it be painful? And… will it take long? I get anxious in those machines.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. It’s natural to be anxious about a brain scan. It’s not usually painful at all. You’ll lie very still on a table, and the machine will take images of your brain. It’s a bit noisy, but we can provide you with earplugs or headphones. The scan itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on and rule out any serious underlying causes, such as a stroke or tumor. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail if you’d like. In the meantime, I'm going to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any other potential causes. And I’m going to refer you to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nerve disorders, for further evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a neurologist, you say? More doctors… Alright, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. Blood work and a neurologist… It sounds… a bit overwhelming, but I trust your judgment. If it will help figure out what’s going on… I suppose so. But… will it take long to get the results? And… will the neurologist want to do more tests? I’m just a bit worried, you see. It’s just… getting old isn’t easy.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Ms. Tofani. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious when facing a lot of uncertainty. The blood work results usually take about a week to come back. And the neurologist will likely want to do a more thorough neurological exam and may order additional tests, such as an MRI or CT scan if we haven’t already done one, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to guide you through every step of the process. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in about two weeks to discuss the results and the neurologist’s recommendations. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. One step at a time… That sounds… manageable. Two weeks to follow up… and go to the emergency room if things get worse… Alright, I’ll remember that. And… thank you, Doctor. For taking such good care of me. I appreciate it. I just… worry a lot, you see. But… I trust your judgment. So, I suppose that’s all for today?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for today, Ms. Tofani. I’ll have the lab order and referral to the neurologist ready for you before you leave. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: .
