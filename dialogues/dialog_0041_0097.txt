DOCTOR: Hi Marija, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is…Chilla, actually. Marija Chilla. I received a communication regarding…planning for the future, I believe. A friend suggested I inquire about these…documents. An advance directive, was it? I want to ensure everything is…in order, should something unfortunate occur. I prefer to be prepared, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija Chilla, of course. I apologize for the slight mix-up. Advance care planning, absolutely. It’s very responsible of you to think about this now. Essentially, it’s about making your wishes known regarding medical care if you’re unable to speak for yourself. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Well, I maintain a…respectable lifestyle. I eat…appropriately, though I do enjoy a good pastry now and then. I believe my weight is…acceptable. I’ve never had any serious ailments, thankfully. A touch of the flu occasionally, nothing more. My husband handles most of the…practicalities, if you understand. He ensures I attend to my well-being. I am a professor, you see. A very demanding profession. It requires…focus. I don't have the time to be ill.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Marija. Being a professor is demanding. And it sounds like you have good support. Just to clarify a little, do you know approximately what your weight and height are?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find such inquiries…unnecessary. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. My husband could provide you with those…precise measurements if you insist, but I find it rather…vulgar to discuss such personal details with someone I’ve just met. I simply want to ensure these…documents are properly completed, so my wishes are respected. I do not see how my exact weight contributes to that.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija. My apologies. It was unnecessary of me to ask. Let’s focus on your wishes, then. Have you given any thought to who you would want to make medical decisions for you if you were unable to?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My husband, Jean-Pierre. He is…very capable. He understands my preferences implicitly. He’s a retired diplomat, you see. Accustomed to making important decisions under pressure. He’s quite…sensible. A very practical man. Though sometimes a little…overbearing, if I am to be honest. But entirely trustworthy. He would know exactly what I would want, even if I couldn’t express it myself. He’s the logical choice. I trust him completely. Are we getting closer to completing these…forms?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That's very important information. So, we’ll list Jean-Pierre as your healthcare proxy. Now, have you thought about what kind of medical care you would or wouldn’t want in certain situations?
PATIENT: Situations? Such as? I confess, I haven't delved into…specifics. I presume it covers…serious illnesses? Prolonged suffering? I expect…standard care. Whatever is deemed necessary by qualified professionals, of course. I do not wish to be…a burden. But I also do not want to be…ignored. I simply wish to be treated with…respect and dignity. Is there a…questionnaire? Perhaps a list of scenarios? I find it difficult to articulate these…hypothetical situations.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Marija. It is difficult to think about. We do have some forms that outline common scenarios—things like life support, feeding tubes, resuscitation. We can go through them together, and you can tell me your preferences. There's no pressure to answer anything you're not comfortable with. Before we dive into those, are there any specific types of treatment you would definitely not want, regardless of the situation?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider. Well, I have always been… averse to unnecessary interventions. I do not wish to be…prolonged artificially. If my condition is…irreversible, I do not wish to be kept alive by machines. I believe in…a natural progression. And I certainly do not wish to be subjected to…experimental procedures. I want comfort, dignity, and…peace. But I also expect…the best possible care. It is a delicate balance, you understand. Are these…forms quite extensive? I have a luncheon engagement later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Marija. It's a very thoughtful perspective. The forms are somewhat detailed, but we can take it at your pace. We don't need to complete everything today. Perhaps we can focus on a few key areas, and you can review the rest at home. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, thankfully. I have always been…quite robust. Though I do find certain fragrances…overpowering. But that is a preference, not an allergy. And I do occasionally experience…indigestion, but a simple remedy usually suffices. My husband ensures I have a well-stocked…pharmacy, you see. He anticipates these things. No, no serious allergies. Nothing that would require…medical intervention. Are we nearing the end of this…process?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Marija. No known allergies. We’re making good progress. One final question for now: Are you currently taking any medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a mild…tonic, prescribed by my doctor in Marrakech years ago. For…general well-being. And occasionally a multivitamin, when I remember. My husband usually reminds me. It is…a small, pale green pill. Nothing significant. Truly. I do not require a…pharmaceutical arsenal. I believe in…natural remedies whenever possible. Shall we proceed with these…forms now? I am eager to be finished.
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s do that. Just one moment while I pull up the Advance Directive form. It has sections on your healthcare proxy, your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment, and a place to add any specific instructions. We can go through it together section by section. First, let’s confirm your healthcare proxy…We’ve already established it's Jean-Pierre, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Jean-Pierre. My husband. He is…entirely capable. And trustworthy. He understands my preferences…implicitly. He’s very…sensible. Please record his details accurately. And ensure the contact information is…current. He travels occasionally, you see. For…diplomatic engagements. Though he rarely…ventures far these days. But it is best to be…precise. Are there any specific details you require? His date of birth, perhaps? I believe he carries his identification with him at all times.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll need his date of birth and a phone number where he can be reached. If he has an email address, that's helpful too. And just to be clear, is he aware that you've designated him as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Of course he is. We discussed it…extensively. He insisted upon it, actually. He is a very…responsible man. He would be…appalled if I hadn’t. He has all of the…relevant documentation, you see. Insurance details, medical history, everything. He is…meticulous. He would be…quite capable of handling any…eventuality. His date of birth is…November 12th, 1948. And his email address is…jean-pierre.dupont@email.com. He prefers to communicate via email, you see. More…efficient. Are we progressing, Doctor? I do have a luncheon engagement this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are progressing very well, Marija. This is all very helpful. Now, the next section concerns your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. This is where you can tell me what types of medical care you would or would not want if you were unable to communicate your wishes. Would you like me to read through some common scenarios, or would you prefer to simply state your preferences directly?
PATIENT: Please, read through the scenarios. I confess, I find it…difficult to articulate these…hypothetical situations. I require…clarification. And a degree of…reassurance. I do not wish to be…overwhelmed. Begin, Doctor. But please, proceed…slowly. And avoid…technical jargon. I am a professor of literature, not a physician.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Absolutely. I will keep it simple and avoid any jargon. Okay, let's start with this: "Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, or CPR." This is the procedure doctors use to try to restart your heart and breathing if it stops. Would you want CPR performed on you if your heart stopped beating?
PATIENT: Hmm. A difficult question. CPR… It sounds…rather aggressive. And potentially…painful. I confess, I have always been…averse to such…interventions. If my condition is…irreversible, I would prefer…comfort. And peace. I do not wish to be…prolonged artificially. Therefore… no. I do not wish to be subjected to CPR. Unless… unless there is a…reasonable chance of recovery. But if my condition is…terminal…no. Please record that. Is there a…checkbox for that? I prefer…definitive answers.
DOCTOR: Certainly. “Do Not Resuscitate” selected. And noted: only resuscitate if there is a reasonable chance of recovery. We can add that clarification to the notes section. Okay, next scenario: "Mechanical Ventilation." This is when a machine helps you breathe if you’re unable to breathe on your own. Would you want to be placed on a ventilator if you couldn’t breathe?
PATIENT: Another…unpleasant prospect. Being… tethered to a machine. It sounds…rather undignified. And again, I reiterate… if my condition is irreversible, I do not wish to be prolonged artificially. I want to be…comfortable. And… allowed to pass peacefully. Therefore…no. I do not wish to be placed on a ventilator. Unless… unless there is a…temporary condition, with a reasonable chance of recovery. But a…prolonged existence on a machine…absolutely not. Please, Doctor, record that accurately. This is…important. I do not wish to be…misunderstood.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. “Do Not Intubate” selected, and the note detailing your condition-specific wishes has been added. We’re recording everything very carefully. Next scenario: "Artificial Nutrition and Hydration." This is when you receive fluids and nutrients through an IV or feeding tube if you are unable to eat or drink on your own. Would you want to receive artificial nutrition and hydration?
PATIENT: Artificial…sustenance? It sounds…rather unnatural. And again, I find myself…repeating the same sentiment. If my condition is…irreversible, I do not wish to be prolonged artificially. I prefer… a natural progression. And I do not wish to be… a burden. Therefore… no. I do not wish to receive artificial nutrition and hydration. Unless… unless there is a… temporary condition, with a reasonable chance of recovery. But a… prolonged existence sustained by machines…absolutely not. Are we…nearing the end of these…scenarios, Doctor? I confess, I am becoming…quite fatigued. And I have a luncheon engagement, you see. With…very important colleagues.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are almost finished, Marija. Just a few more questions. You’ve been very clear with your wishes, and I appreciate your honesty. This last section is for any specific instructions you might have… anything else you want your healthcare proxy to know. For example, do you have any preferences regarding pain management?
PATIENT: Pain management… yes. That is… paramount. I expect… adequate pain relief. I do not wish to suffer needlessly. And I trust my husband to ensure… my comfort. He is…very attentive. If I am in pain, I expect… swift and effective treatment. Do not hesitate… to administer whatever is necessary. But do not…overmedicate me, either. I wish to remain… lucid, as much as possible. And… I prefer natural remedies whenever feasible. Perhaps aromatherapy… or gentle massage. Please, record that. Is there a…space for additional notes? I wish to be…comfortable, and dignified, at all times. This is…important to me. Is that…sufficient? I believe that…covers everything. Are we…finished? I do have a luncheon engagement, you see. With…prominent literary figures.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we are finished. I have recorded everything you’ve told me. Here is the completed Advance Directive. Please review it carefully, and let me know if you have any questions. I recommend sharing this document with Jean-Pierre and your primary care physician. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe… you have captured everything accurately. And I shall… share this document with my husband, as you suggested. And my primary physician. I am… grateful for your… patience. And your… diligence. You have… alleviated my concerns. No, I believe that is… all. Thank you… very much. Now, if you will… excuse me. I have a luncheon engagement, you see. With… esteemed colleagues.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marija. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your luncheon. And please, don't hesitate to contact the clinic if any questions arise in the future. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Good day. .
