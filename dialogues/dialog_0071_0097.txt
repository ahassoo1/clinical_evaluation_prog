DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Marija. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband, Hassan, suggested I come. He’s been reading about these… forms, for when one can no longer… express oneself. Something about making sure my wishes are known. He says it's very responsible. I must admit, I find the whole topic rather… morbid, but he insisted. He said to ask about an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form. Do you know what those are?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Hassan is a very thoughtful man. Those are excellent things to discuss. An Advance Directive – sometimes called a living will – outlines your wishes for medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. A POLST form, which stands for Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a bit more specific—it’s a medical order based on your current wishes. It sounds like he’s concerned about ensuring your voice is heard, even if you're unable to express it directly. We can absolutely go over both options. Before we dive into the specifics, though, is there anything currently bothering you health-wise?
PATIENT: Currently? No, nothing specific. I feel… quite well, all things considered. A bit of stiffness in the mornings, naturally, at my age, but nothing I haven't dealt with for years. It’s not illness that concerns Hassan, you understand. It’s… the possibility of something happening. He worries excessively, my husband. Always has. He simply wants everything… ordered, I suppose. It's rather… undignified, discussing these things when one is perfectly healthy, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It can feel that way, yes. But it’s actually very responsible of both of you to consider these things proactively. It’s far easier to have these conversations before a crisis. Let me just pull up your record here… Marija Chilla, age 44, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though I assure you, Doctor, I haven't needed a medical record in… well, a very long time. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, for the most part. Lots of fresh vegetables, regular walks… though the Moroccan sun isn’t always conducive to long walks, naturally. Still, I take good care of myself. I simply wish Hassan didn't dwell on… hypothetical misfortunes. It’s quite exhausting, frankly.
DOCTOR: I see. No recent visits noted here, as you said. That’s wonderful! It's good to hear you prioritize your health. Just to get a more complete picture, even though you're feeling well, could you tell me about any past medical issues you have had – even if they were years ago?
PATIENT: Past issues… Hmm. Let me think. When I was a young woman, I had… a rather severe bout of bronchitis, during a particularly cold winter in Marrakech. It took several weeks to recover. And… oh, yes, a broken wrist, when I was about ten. I was climbing a date palm, naturally. A very foolish thing to do, in retrospect. But those were decades ago. Nothing significant. No chronic conditions, no surgeries… I’ve been remarkably fortunate, really. And, I trust, it will remain that way. Perhaps Hassan is simply being overly cautious.
DOCTOR: Good, good. No chronic conditions, that’s excellent. A broken wrist and bronchitis… noted. Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a difficult question. My mother lived to be quite old, though she suffered from… what was it? Something with the joints, I believe. Arthritis, perhaps? It wasn't a pleasant end. My father… he passed away rather suddenly, a heart condition, I think. But neither of them were particularly… diligent about their health. They ate whatever they pleased, smoked… generally indulged in all sorts of… unhealthy habits. I, on the other hand, take much better care of myself. It’s rather frustrating to be asked about their poor choices, frankly. It implies a… predisposition, which I certainly do not share.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's good you've adopted healthier habits. Knowing family history helps us identify potential risks, but it doesn't dictate your future. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I am aware of. I have taken various medications over the years – antibiotics for the bronchitis, pain relievers for the wrist… nothing caused any reaction. I've always been rather… resilient, I suppose. Though Hassan insists on keeping a rather extensive first-aid kit, just in case. Filled with all sorts of… potions and creams. Honestly, it’s a bit excessive. He treats me as if I were a delicate flower, rather than a strong Moroccan woman! Is it truly necessary to inquire about every minor ailment I experienced decades ago? It feels… rather intrusive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels intrusive, Marija. I assure you, I'm only trying to be thorough. Even seemingly minor past issues can be relevant. And it’s good to rule things out. No known allergies… noted. And you're currently not taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I prefer natural remedies, whenever possible. A little mint tea for an upset stomach, a bit of argan oil for the skin… simple things. I have no need for those… synthetic concoctions the pharmaceutical companies peddle. They merely mask the symptoms, rather than addressing the root cause. Besides, Hassan keeps a rather strict watch over my diet and lifestyle. He wouldn't allow me to indulge in anything that might require medication. He’s… very controlling, that man. Though, I suppose, it’s well-intentioned. Now, if you don't mind, could we please move on to these… forms? I find this line of questioning rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. We can certainly move on to the Advance Directives and POLST form. Before we do, just a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline, given you're feeling well. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… routine things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Must we? It seems rather unnecessary, given I’ve explicitly stated I feel perfectly well. But… I suppose, if it will satisfy your… professional obligations. Just please be quick about it. I have a luncheon planned with some friends later this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late. And please, be gentle. My husband will undoubtedly quiz me on every detail afterward, and I’d rather not have to endure a lengthy explanation of any discomfort. Do you have a clean gown somewhere?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. It will only take a few moments. And no gown is necessary – just a light examination of your arms, chest, and back. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm… excellent. 120 over 78. Very good. Your pulse is 72, regular and strong. Now, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds quite healthy, as you said. Just a quick check of your reflexes… and your range of motion… everything appears normal. No tenderness to palpation. All right. Everything appears to be within normal limits, Marija. Now, about these forms…
PATIENT: Finally. I confess, I’m rather relieved that’s over with. It was rather… undignified, being poked and prodded. Now, please, let us discuss these forms. Perhaps you could explain the difference between them, in simple terms. My husband tends to use rather… complicated language, and I find it quite confusing. And please, be concise. I truly haven’t the patience for a lengthy lecture. Do these forms require numerous witnesses? Hassan mentioned something about legal stipulations.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I’ll keep it concise. The Advance Directive – this form – outlines your overall wishes for medical care if you become unable to make decisions yourself. It can cover things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, how much intervention you desire, and who you want to make decisions on your behalf. It’s very broad. The POLST form—Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—is more specific. It’s a medical order, based on your current wishes. It outlines exactly what treatment you want—or don't want—in specific situations, like CPR, intubation, or feeding tubes. It’s typically used for people with serious illnesses or frailty. Regarding witnesses, yes, both forms require signatures from at least two adult witnesses who are not your family members or healthcare providers. It's a legal requirement to ensure the document is valid. I have copies of the forms here, and I’m happy to walk you through each section. We can take our time and answer any questions you have. It’s important to understand everything before you sign. Would you like me to start with the Advance Directive?
PATIENT: It sounds… terribly complicated. All those stipulations and witnesses… it’s rather overwhelming. Honestly, I was rather hoping for a simpler solution. Hassan made it sound as if it were merely a formality, a quick signature on a pre-printed form. Perhaps… the POLST form would be sufficient? If it outlines specific orders, wouldn’t that negate the need for a lengthy, convoluted directive? I’m not ill, Doctor. I simply want to ensure my wishes are respected, should something… unforeseen occur. I don’t wish to delve into hypothetical scenarios or make elaborate declarations about life-sustaining treatment. Is it possible to proceed with the POLST form only? It seems far more… practical. And please, let us try to keep the language simple. I do not require a legal dissertation.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that's perfectly reasonable. If your primary concern is having clear, specific orders in place, the POLST form is a good option. It’s often more practical for someone who is generally healthy and wants to focus on current wishes. We can absolutely proceed with the POLST form only. It outlines your preferences regarding CPR, intubation, mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and other life-sustaining treatments. It’s a relatively straightforward document. The first section asks about your overall goals for care. Do you want to focus on maximizing life extension, or do you prioritize comfort and quality of life?
PATIENT: Quality of life, Doctor. Absolutely quality of life. I have no desire to be kept alive by machines, or subjected to prolonged suffering in a sterile hospital environment. I’ve seen enough of that in my life. A peaceful end, surrounded by loved ones, is far more important than mere existence. I value dignity, Doctor. And I trust my husband to ensure my wishes are respected, should I become unable to express them myself. He’s… rather insistent on these matters, but I believe his intentions are good. Now, let us proceed with the form. I trust it doesn't require a lengthy philosophical debate?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. We'll keep it concise. Alright. The next section asks about CPR—cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Do you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops beating?
PATIENT: CPR… Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t given it much thought. It sounds… rather unpleasant. I understand it involves… forceful chest compressions and… potentially breaking ribs? I’ve always believed in accepting the natural course of events. If my time has come, I would prefer not to be subjected to such… aggressive intervention. I would prefer… no resuscitation, Doctor. Let nature take its course. I trust that is a reasonable request? I’m not a frail, elderly woman clinging to life, I’m simply making sensible provisions for the inevitable. Now, can we please move on to the next section? I’m growing rather impatient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. “Do Not Resuscitate” noted. You are perfectly entitled to make that decision. Alright. The next section asks about intubation and mechanical ventilation. This refers to using a breathing tube and a machine to help you breathe. Do you want to be placed on a ventilator if you're unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: A breathing tube? No, absolutely not! That sounds… utterly terrifying. Confined to a hospital bed, unable to speak, dependent on a machine… It’s a fate worse than death, Doctor. I would prefer… no intubation, no mechanical ventilation. I value my autonomy, Doctor. I have no desire to be kept alive artificially. Now, is there a section concerning feeding tubes? I trust that can be ruled out as well? I have always maintained a healthy appetite and I have no intention of being fed through a tube. Let us move on, please. This is becoming rather… morbid.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija. "Do Not Intubate, Do Not Ventilate" noted. And you are correct, there is a section concerning artificial nutrition and hydration—feeding tubes. Do you want to receive nutrition and hydration through a tube if you are unable to eat or drink?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor! Must we go through this endless litany of unpleasant possibilities? Of course not! I do not wish to be kept alive artificially through any means whatsoever. I trust my body to… follow its natural course. No artificial nutrition, no artificial hydration. Let nature take its course, Doctor. Is there anything else? I truly believe I have made my wishes perfectly clear. And, I trust, this concludes this rather… unpleasant exercise? I have a luncheon to attend, you see. And I’m beginning to lose my appetite.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that concludes the POLST form. Here it is. You've clearly outlined your wishes, and I’ve documented everything. You’ll need to sign it in the presence of two adult witnesses who are not family members or healthcare providers. And then we’ll file it with your medical records. I commend you for taking the time to think about these important issues. It's a responsible thing to do, and it ensures your voice will be heard, even if you are unable to speak for yourself. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have documented my wishes accurately. And I trust my husband will assist with the signatures. I confess, this entire exercise has been rather… draining. But I suppose it’s better to be prepared, as they say. Thank you for your assistance, Doctor Galena. And perhaps we can avoid discussing such… morbid topics in the future? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ve lost my appetite entirely. Good afternoon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. And you have a good afternoon as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future.
