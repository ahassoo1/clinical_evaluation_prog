DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, it's my nails. They just...look funny. Not good funny. I don't really know what's wrong with them, that's why I'm here, I guess. They changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, “changed” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to explain. They're…not like they used to be. Thicker, maybe? And the color...it's not nice. Like…dirty. I don't paint them or anything. Never have. Just regular nails, you know? I don't even know when they started looking like this, honestly. A while ago, I think. Not yesterday, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, thicker and a change in color, you said. And you’ve noticed this gradually over some time. Any pain or discomfort with the nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don't hurt hurt. Just…annoying, you know? Like having something off with them. Maybe a little sensitive when I'm cleaning, but that could be anything. I don't baby my hands. I work with ears all day. Lots of poking around. It's not a gentle job.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, just a change in appearance and some mild sensitivity with cleaning. You mentioned you work with ears…is that an ear-cleaning profession?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm an audiologist. People come to me 'cause they can't hear good, and I look in their ears. Lots of wax, you know? Sometimes have to dig it out. It's... a job. Not the cleanest job, I guess. But it pays the bills. Does that have something to do with my nails? I mean, I wash my hands, but... wax is sticky.
DOCTOR: It could be related, yes. Frequent hand washing and exposure to various substances can sometimes affect nail health. Let's take a closer look at your nails. Would you mind holding out your hands for me?
PATIENT: Sure. There. See? Not pretty, are they? I swear, they used to be normal. Not all…yellow and thick. It's just…gross.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is some thickening and yellowing, and I notice some slight ridging. It does appear there's some onychomycosis – a fungal infection of the nail. It's fairly common, especially with frequent moisture exposure. I’m going to document my findings now. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Never been told I have that. Psoriasis... I think my aunt had something like that? Red, flaky skin, I think. But me? No. Healthy as a horse, mostly. Except for these nails, obviously. And my back hurts sometimes. But that's just getting old, I figure. I don't take any pills or anything. Just... regular stuff. You know, vitamins sometimes. But not even every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diabetes or psoriasis, just some occasional back pain and vitamins. Any family history of nail problems or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, family? That's a long story. My mother…she always had nice nails. Really long, painted bright red. I never got that gene. My father… I don't really remember him. And my brother… he lives far away, and we don't talk much. I doubt he knows what color his nails are. So…no, I don't think so. Not that I know of. They weren't nail people, my family. More…loud people, if that makes sense. Not really focused on stuff like nails.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of nail problems. And you said you're otherwise healthy. Now, about your work – do you use any specific cleaning solutions or have direct contact with anything that might irritate your skin?
PATIENT: Well, we have a special cleaner for the ear tubes. It's kinda strong, smells like chemicals. And the wax…lots of wax. Sometimes it gets under my nails, no matter how hard I try. We have gloves, but they don't always keep everything out. And I'm always touching people's ears, you know? Lots of different people. Could be something from that. I don't know. I just clean ears. I'm not a scientist.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, it sounds like there are several potential contributing factors. To confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to take a small sample from under your nail to send to the lab for testing. It’s a quick, painless procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A sample? Like...scrape my nail? Ugh. Is it gonna hurt? 'Cause I don't do pain. And what if it makes it worse? I need my hands for my job, you know? I can't go around with messed up nails. I look at ears all day! People expect nice hands.
DOCTOR: It’s a very small scraping, Ms. Thut, and shouldn’t cause any pain. It’s similar to filing your nails. We’ll numb the area with a topical anesthetic first. It's more of an inconvenience than anything. And it’s the best way to confirm if it’s a fungal infection and determine the best course of treatment. If it is fungal, treatment usually involves a topical medication, although sometimes oral medication is necessary. We can discuss all your options afterwards. I understand your concern about your hands and your job. We’ll do everything we can to minimize any disruption. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay, fine. But no pain! You said no pain, right? And I don’t want any of those pills. I don’t do pills. Just...the stuff you put on my nails. And it better not mess up my job. I have bills to pay, you know? Explain it to me. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Absolutely no pain. I promise. First, I'm going to apply a small amount of this numbing cream to the area under one of your nails. It will take a few minutes to work. Then, using a small instrument, I will gently scrape a tiny sample of nail debris. It's really just like filing a small portion of your nail. We’ll send that sample to the lab to confirm the diagnosis. Once we have the results, which usually takes about a week or so, we can discuss treatment options. As you requested, we can start with a topical antifungal medication that you apply directly to the nail. We will review application instructions carefully. We’ll only discuss oral medication if the topical treatment isn't effective. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A week? A week? I have people to see! Okay, fine. But it better be fast. And what if it gets infected from all that scraping? I don't need an infected nail on top of everything else. And will it look worse afterwards? Like, really gross? You have to promise me it won't look worse. I need to look professional, you know? People are trusting me with their ears.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. We take every precaution to prevent infection. We'll clean the area thoroughly before and after the scraping, and I will give you instructions on how to care for the nail afterwards. The risk of infection is very low. As for appearance, it might be slightly sensitive for a day or two, and there might be a small indentation where we took the sample, but it shouldn’t be noticeable, and it will heal quickly. We're just taking a tiny sample, it won’t cause any significant disruption. Let’s go ahead and apply the numbing cream, and we can discuss the aftercare instructions while it’s working. It's best to get this done quickly so we can have the lab results and start treatment if needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. But be gentle, okay? And tell me exactly what you’re doing every step of the way. I don't like surprises. And no promises about being happy about it if it hurts. Hurry up. I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I'm applying this numbing cream now. It will take about five to ten minutes to work, so it will feel a little cool. I'll let you know when it’s ready. While we wait, I want to explain the aftercare instructions. After the scraping, it’s important to keep the area clean and dry. Avoid excessive hand washing and exposure to water. I'll also give you an antifungal cream to apply twice a day. And it’s important to avoid nail polish or artificial nails during treatment. This will allow the medication to work effectively. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No nail polish? Ugh. That's just…sad. But okay, fine. But what if I get water on it? I have to wash my hands constantly. It's my job! And will it…smell? Like, really bad? Because I have people close to my face all day. I can't have a weird-smelling hand. That's…unprofessional.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. Avoiding water completely isn't realistic with your profession, but minimizing exposure is key. You can wear gloves when possible to protect the area during hand washing. If the area does get wet, just gently pat it dry. As for the smell, the antifungal cream has a very mild odor that dissipates quickly. It’s not noticeable after a few minutes. We can also discuss a different formulation if you find the smell bothersome. We'll do our best to minimize any disruption to your work. We're just trying to get to the bottom of this and get your nails back to normal. The numbing cream should be working now. Do you feel any sensation?
PATIENT: Ugh, kinda numb, yeah. Still feels…weird. Okay, just get it over with. Don't poke me too much. And be quick about it. I have ears to look at.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. All done. That was very quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Ugh. It felt…weird. Not painful, just…wrong. Is it bleeding? And what now? Do I need a band-aid? I can't go around with a scraped-up nail. People will think I'm dirty!
DOCTOR: No, there's just a very tiny amount of pinpoint bleeding, which is normal. It will stop very quickly. Here, just hold this gently for a few minutes to stop any further bleeding. A band-aid isn’t necessary, it's a very small area. The lab will contact you in about a week with the results. We’ll discuss the treatment options when we have the results. In the meantime, just keep the area clean and dry, and avoid excessive hand washing if possible. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay, fine. A week. Just…don't call me with bad news. And make sure it doesn’t mess up my job. That's all I ask. I have bills to pay, you know? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I understand. We'll do our best to get you a quick and effective treatment plan. We’ll call you with the results, and we can discuss the best course of action. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. .
