DOCTOR: Right, well, hello. Jailia, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Jailia Chakka. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I confess, I’m not usually one for these sorts of visits. I prefer to handle matters efficiently.
DOCTOR: Efficiently, got it. Me too, if we can. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Gorga, it’s rather… bothersome, to be frank. I’ve been losing weight, despite maintaining my usual diet – a very sensible diet, I assure you. And lately, I’ve been experiencing… an excessive amount of perspiration during the night. It’s quite disrupting, and frankly, unseemly. I also find myself… tired. More tired than one should be, considering my lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss despite a normal diet, night sweats, and fatigue. How long have you been noticing these things?
PATIENT: Approximately three months now, Doctor. It began subtly, a slight reduction in appetite, perhaps. But it has become… increasingly pronounced. The night sweats are… quite recent, within the last month, I'd say. And the fatigue… well, it’s a constant companion now. It interferes with my work, naturally. One cannot produce quality graphic designs when one is… depleted.
DOCTOR: Alright. Three months for the weight loss, more recent night sweats—about a month. And this fatigue is impacting your work… graphic design, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Graphic design. It requires a certain… mental acuity, you understand. A sharpness of focus. Something which is becoming… increasingly difficult to maintain. I assure you, Doctor, I take immense pride in my work. I have a reputation to uphold. My husband also expects a certain standard. It’s… stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stress is definitely something to consider. Any fever, chills, or cough along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing of the sort. No fever, no chills, and certainly no cough. I am not… unwell in the typical sense. It is simply… this persistent fatigue, the unwelcome weight loss, and the… nightly discomfort. It’s rather… embarrassing, to be frank. I maintain a very rigorous hygiene regime. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills or cough. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in my… bowel habits? Doctor, I find that question… rather personal. However, if you must know, there has been a… slight irregularity. Not significant, but… present. Shall we say, less… firm than usual? And perhaps… more frequent. But I assure you, I maintain a very balanced diet. High fiber, naturally. I’m not one to indulge in… frivolous snacks.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools, more frequent. Any blood in your stool or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor! Are you implying…? No, there has been no blood. None whatsoever. I assure you, I would be the first to notice. I am a very observant person. And black, tarry stools? That sounds… unpleasant. I maintain a very healthy digestive system. This line of questioning is becoming… increasingly uncomfortable. Are these questions truly necessary?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m causing any discomfort, Jailia. Just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, no blood in the stool. Any unintentional weight loss – and when I say unintentional, I mean without trying to lose weight. How much weight would you say you’ve lost in the last three months?
PATIENT: It’s quite alright, Doctor. I simply prefer a… direct approach. As for the weight loss… approximately six kilograms, I believe. Perhaps a little more. It’s difficult to say precisely; I weigh myself infrequently. It's… rather disheartening, to be frank. And it’s affecting my concentration, which is… unacceptable. I have a reputation to uphold, as I mentioned. My work demands precision.
DOCTOR: Six kilograms in three months. Okay. And, um… any changes in your appetite overall?
PATIENT: A slight diminution, Doctor. Not a complete loss, you understand. I still eat… sensible portions. But the enthusiasm, shall we say, has waned. I find myself… less inclined to indulge in second helpings. It's… perplexing. I assure you, I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle. I always have. My husband is very particular about these things. He expects me to… present well. And I always do. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any night sweats?
PATIENT: Doctor, I've mentioned the night sweats repeatedly. It's… quite frustrating that you continue to ask. It is excessive, disruptive, and… frankly, unseemly. I wake up drenched. It’s not merely a slight perspiration, you understand. It requires changing my nightclothes, and even then… the bedding. It’s… distressing. It's interfering with my sleep, naturally, and exacerbating the fatigue. Do you require a more detailed description?
DOCTOR: Apologies, Jailia. You’re right, I have that noted. Just making sure I haven’t missed anything. Let's move on. Any family history of… tuberculosis, cancer, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Tuberculosis? Doctor, my family is of impeccable lineage! We maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I’ve said repeatedly. We are not… predisposed to such… ailments. My parents were both exceptionally healthy individuals, and my ancestors… well, let us just say they were a robust and resilient people. Cancer… no, no history of cancer. My husband's family is equally healthy. He is a professional engineer, you understand; precision and good health are paramount in his profession. So, no. No family history of those… unfortunate conditions.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I rarely require medications. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as you know. I take a multivitamin occasionally, and sometimes an herbal supplement for… general well-being. But that is all. Nothing prescribed, nothing… substantial. I believe in preventative measures, you understand. A healthy diet and a rigorous exercise regime are far more effective than relying on… artificial interventions. My husband agrees wholeheartedly. He is very particular about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check some reflexes. That will help me get a better sense of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A physical examination… Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I find such procedures… somewhat intrusive. But if you deem it necessary, I suppose I can endure it. Though I trust you will maintain a professional demeanor. And I would appreciate it if you could be… efficient. I have a rather busy schedule. And my husband expects me to be home at a reasonable hour.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Efficient and professional. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your breathing sounds clear. Heart rate is regular. Abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain whatsoever. I assure you, my digestive system is in perfect working order. As I have repeatedly stated, I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle. Though I confess, I am feeling a slight… unease. Being prodded and poked is not particularly… pleasant. I trust you are being meticulous? It is important to be thorough, you understand. One does not wish to overlook anything. I have a reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are normal. Let’s check your lymph nodes. No swelling or tenderness. Everything seems normal physically, which is… not very helpful. Given your symptoms – weight loss, night sweats, fatigue – and the lack of a clear explanation from the exam, I think we should run some blood tests. Just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Honestly, Doctor, I find this rather… excessive. I have repeatedly stated that I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Surely, a simple adjustment to my diet or exercise regime would suffice. However… if you insist it is necessary, I suppose I can endure it. Though I trust you will select a reputable laboratory. And I would appreciate a prompt turnaround time. I do not wish to be subjected to unnecessary delays. And please, ensure the phlebotomist is… gentle. I have a low tolerance for discomfort.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Reputable laboratory, gentle phlebotomist, and prompt turnaround time. We'll send you to the lab down the hall. It will take about an hour, and the results should be back within a few days. I'll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. That will give us a good starting point. In the meantime, if you develop any new symptoms – fever, chills, severe weakness – please contact the office immediately. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. I trust these tests are… comprehensive. And I shall, of course, contact the office if any… unfortunate new symptoms arise. Though I fully expect the results will be… unremarkable. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I have repeatedly stated. Thank you for your time, Doctor Gorga. Though I must confess, I find this entire experience rather… unsettling. .
