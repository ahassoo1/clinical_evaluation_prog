DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's this weakness I've been having. Feels like my muscles just…don't want to cooperate sometimes. It's been going on for a bit now, and it's starting to worry me. I’m Edric, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Edric. The chart says so. “Weakness.” Right. And how long exactly is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…probably around late March, early April. Maybe three, four months now? It comes and goes, but it's definitely more frequent lately. It's hard to pinpoint, you know? Not like a sudden thing, just…gradual. I do auto damage appraisals, so I’m on my feet a lot, walking around looking at cars. Maybe that’s got something to do with it.
DOCTOR: “Gradual.” Of course it is. And this weakness…where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Mostly in my legs, to be honest. Like they get heavy, and just…won’t lift like they used to. Sometimes my arms feel it too, but not as bad. It’s worst after I’ve been doing a lot of walking, like you said – at work, mostly. But it’s happened when I'm just relaxing at home too, which is…concerning. I haven't fallen or anything, just…tired, you know? Like they're filled with lead.
DOCTOR: "Filled with lead," you say. Interesting. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. I mean, I've been a little more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to the heat, honestly. It’s been sweltering lately. And maybe a little bit of…muscle aches, but nothing major. I haven’t been sick, no fever or anything like that. I haven't noticed anything else…really. I do get thirsty a lot more, now that I think about it. But again, heat. I drink a lot of water when I’m working.
DOCTOR: Thirsty a lot more…and how much water would you say is “a lot”?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez, a lot. Like, I used to carry a 20-ounce bottle, and that would last me most of the morning. Now I’m going through two of those easily, sometimes three, before lunchtime. And then another couple in the afternoon. I’m constantly refilling it. It’s…it’s a lot more than usual, definitely. I'm not sure if that's important. It's probably just the heat, right? I’m probably just being a worrywart.
DOCTOR: “Just the heat.” That’s what everyone says. Alright. Now, have you had any changes in your…bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh…well, yeah, actually. Now that you mention it, I’ve been going to the bathroom more often. More…urine, I guess. And sometimes I have to get up in the middle of the night to go. It's not painful, just…frequent. I hadn't really thought much of it, figured it was from all the water I've been drinking. But yeah, it's been happening. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: “Is that bad?
PATIENT: Well, you're the doctor. That's why I'm here, isn't it? I don't know what's bad and what's not. I just feel tired and weak, and I'm going to the bathroom all the time. I’m starting to worry about it, honestly. Is it something serious? I have a job to do, you know? I need to be able to walk and…appraise cars. I don't have time to be sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Let’s not get dramatic. Now, have you had any family history of…anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My dad, he had…diabetes, I think. Type 2, maybe? He was always tired, and he had to watch what he ate. And my aunt on my mom’s side, she had high blood pressure. Other than that, not really. Nobody else that I know of had anything like this weakness or…going to the bathroom a lot. It was a long time ago, though. I wasn't really paying attention to their health back then, to be honest. I just know my dad wasn't feeling so good towards the end. Does that help? I'm not much help with family history, sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before we go any further, Mr. McKinnon, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Maybe some ibuprofen for headaches now and then, but nothing regular. No reactions, no issues. I'm pretty good with most things, thankfully. I haven’t got a long list of prescriptions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. McKinnon, based on what you've told me, we need to do some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’m concerned about a few things, and we need to rule them out. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. Also, let's check your blood sugar level now. We’ll start with that. It's a simple finger prick, don't worry. Nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…good. Tests are good. I just want to know what's going on, you know? Finger prick, fine. Whatever it takes. Hopefully it’s nothing serious. Will the tests tell us what's causing the weakness? And the…bathroom thing?
DOCTOR: They'll give us some answers, Mr. McKinnon. We’ll take it one step at a time. Don’t jump to conclusions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will explain everything to you. .
