DOCTOR: Alright, Jase. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, um... it's my stomach, mostly. It's been... not good. Really runny, you know? Like, diarrhea. It's been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… annoying, honestly. I think it might be something I already have, the doctor mentioned something about… something with how my body handles food? I can't quite remember the name of it.
DOCTOR: “Annoying” doesn’t quite cover it when it comes to your digestive system, believe me. And you’re right to think back to previous conversations. It sounds like we might be revisiting a discussion about possible Irritable Bowel Syndrome – IBS. But we need to rule out other things first. How long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that sounds right, IBS… or something like that. It’s hard to say exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, so sometimes it's better, sometimes it's really bad. It's been worse the last… few days, I think. I haven’t really been keeping track, if I'm honest. Does that make it harder to figure out?
DOCTOR: It does make it a bit more challenging, yes. But not impossible. "Comes and goes" is typical with IBS, but we still need to understand the pattern. So, in the 'bad' periods – like now – can you describe what’s happening?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… well, it’s just… a lot. Like, I have to go to the bathroom a lot. And it’s… watery, obviously. And sometimes I get cramps, really bad ones, in my stomach. It makes it hard to… do things. Like, I had to cancel plans yesterday because I didn't want to be far from a bathroom. And sometimes I feel a bit… tired afterwards, if that makes sense? It’s just… unpleasant. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly well, Jase. Don't apologize. Frequent, watery stools and cramps… that all fits. Fatigue is common when your body is dealing with this kind of distress. Now, tell me about what you’ve been eating and drinking lately?
PATIENT: Oh, um… food. Right. I haven’t really changed anything, I don’t think. Just… normal stuff. I had a chicken curry last night. And rice, with it. I drink a lot of water, usually. And tea. I like tea. Sometimes I have biscuits with my tea. I didn’t eat anything different than usual, not that I remember. Maybe… maybe a bit more fruit this week? I bought some mangoes. But that's about it, I think. I'm really bad at remembering what I eat, to be honest. My husband usually does the cooking, so I don't always know what's in things.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no obvious dietary changes. The mangoes could be a factor – they're high in fructose, which some people struggle with. And it's good you mention your husband does the cooking – we’ll need to consider that. Have you noticed any connection between what you eat and when your symptoms flare up?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. It seems to happen randomly. Like, sometimes I can eat the same thing two days in a row, and one day I’m fine, and the next I’m… not. It doesn’t seem to follow a pattern with the food, I'm sorry. It’s really frustrating, because I don't know what to avoid! I don't want to stop eating everything. My husband makes lovely food.
DOCTOR: I understand. Random flare-ups despite consistent diet… that leans further towards IBS, but we still can't rule out other things. Let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any bloating, gas, nausea, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… bloating, yes, definitely. I feel really puffy sometimes, especially in the afternoon. And gas, yeah, a lot of gas. Sorry, that's… a bit embarrassing. Nausea… not really, no. I don't feel sick, just… uncomfortable. Weight loss… I don’t think so. If anything, I might have gained a bit. My husband keeps telling me I'm eating too many biscuits!
DOCTOR: Biscuits are a common comfort food, I understand. Alright, bloating and gas, no nausea or weight loss…that's helpful. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, I think I mentioned something about my stomach before, to a different doctor. They did some tests, and they said something about… celiac disease, I think? But they didn't say I definitely had it, just that it could be that. I’ve also had… asthma, since I was a kid. I don't have it very bad anymore, I just use an inhaler sometimes when it’s cold. And… that's about it, I think. I'm really bad with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, potential celiac disease and asthma. The potential celiac disease is important; we’ll need to revisit those previous tests. Even if it wasn’t definitive, we need to rule that out definitively before considering other things. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop, honestly. It’s just… annoying, and uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's see what we can find. Okay, I'm listening to your bowel sounds now… they seem fairly normal, a bit active. And……there’s some tenderness in your lower abdomen, on both sides, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. It's mild. I'm also checking for any masses, but I don't feel anything concerning. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal on physical exam, which is good. Now, given your history and symptoms, and to definitively rule out celiac disease and other possibilities, I'm going to order a few blood tests. We’ll check for celiac antibodies, inflammation markers, and a complete blood count. I also want to collect a stool sample to check for infections or parasites. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully get it fixed. Blood tests and… a stool sample. Okay. Yes, that’s fine. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… anything I need to avoid eating before the tests?
DOCTOR: No, there’s no need to change your diet before the tests, but please try to collect the stool sample as soon as possible. The lab instructions are on the form the nurse will give you. They will tell you exactly how to collect it and store it. As for now, continue to hydrate well, and try to avoid anything that you know consistently makes your symptoms worse, if anything. And, I want to rule out lactose intolerance as a possibility. Could you try cutting out dairy for one week and see if it improves your symptoms?
PATIENT: Okay, cutting out dairy for a week. And try to collect the stool sample soon. I can do that. I think. I'll try to remember the instructions. And… what if it is lactose intolerance? What do I do then? Do I have to stop eating ice cream forever?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily stop eating ice cream forever. Many people with lactose intolerance can tolerate small amounts of dairy, or can use lactose-free products. There are plenty of options available now. If it turns out to be lactose intolerance, we can discuss strategies for managing it, including over-the-counter enzyme supplements that help you digest lactose. I'll also give you a handout with information about IBS, just so you have a better understanding of the condition, in case the tests are inconclusive. We can also discuss medications to help manage your symptoms if necessary. The nurse will schedule the blood tests and give you the stool sample kit. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate it. It's just… nice to know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. Hopefully, these tests will give us some answers. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I understand it can be frustrating dealing with digestive issues. I’m hopeful we’ll get some answers soon. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your tests and go over the instructions. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Jase.
