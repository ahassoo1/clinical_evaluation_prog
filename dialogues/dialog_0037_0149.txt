DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. AX, you said? Hmm. Well, frankly, I don't really want to be here. My daughter insisted. Something about...not letting them do things to me. I don't recall exactly what she said. Honestly, doctors these days...always poking and prodding. I've lived a long life, you know. A long life. And I’ve managed just fine without all their fancy interventions.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Wynell. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. I assure you, my goal is to help you maintain your health and quality of life, and we’ll only do what’s necessary. Your daughter sounds like a very caring person, and it’s good she’s looking out for you. Just to get a better understanding, even if you’re not feeling actively sick, is there anything specific she mentioned that concerned her?
PATIENT: Concerned? Oh, she’s always concerned. She worries about everything. Let me see… she went on and on about my feet, I think. Said they were…swollen. And something about circulation? Honestly, it all sounds so dramatic. I’ve had a little puffiness in my ankles for years. It's just old age, Doctor. Nothing to fuss over. I’ve worn sensible shoes my entire life, you know. Never one for those high heels.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you’re right, some ankle swelling can be normal with age. But it’s good your daughter noticed, because significant swelling can sometimes indicate something else going on. Just to clarify, Wynell, has the swelling been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. That's a good question. Honestly, I haven't been paying much attention. Everything feels a bit…sluggish these days, you know? I suppose maybe it is a little more noticeable than it used to be. But I've been spending a lot of time sitting, with the heat and all. And truthfully, I haven't been as diligent about elevating my legs as I should be. My daughter keeps telling me to. It's just... such a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to keep up with those things. So, it sounds like the swelling is potentially worse recently and you’ve been less active and less diligent with leg elevation. Aside from the swelling, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… well, my feet do ache a bit, especially at the end of the day. And sometimes they feel… numb. Not all the time, just occasionally. And my skin… it’s awfully dry. Very dry. I put lotion on, of course, but it doesn't seem to help much anymore. It's just… everything feels a little bit off, you know? Like I'm carrying extra weight, even though I haven't gained any.
DOCTOR: Okay, so aching and occasional numbness in your feet, and very dry skin, despite using lotion. And a general feeling of being “off” or carrying extra weight. Now, to get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in the color of your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Color, you say? Hmm. I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I don't spend a lot of time staring at my feet. They look like… feet, Doctor. What do you expect? Perhaps a little paler than they used to be, now that I think about it. But I've always had rather pale skin. My mother was the same way. It’s probably just… genetics, you know? Is this important?
DOCTOR: It can be important, Wynell. Changes in skin color can sometimes give us clues about circulation, which is why I’m asking. Pale skin, especially if it’s accompanied by swelling, can be a sign of reduced blood flow. Would you mind if I just took a quick look at your feet and ankles?
PATIENT: Oh. Reduced blood flow… that doesn’t sound good. Well, I suppose… if you must. But don't poke too much! Be gentle, now. My feet are rather sensitive. And don't tell me anything terrible. I don’t want to hear about anything terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wynell. I see some swelling, as your daughter mentioned, and your skin is a bit dry. The pulses in your feet are present, but they are a bit weaker than I’d like to see. I’m also noticing some discoloration, a slight pallor, particularly around your ankles. I’m not going to tell you anything terrible, but it does seem like you might be experiencing some peripheral artery disease, or PAD. That means there’s some narrowing of the arteries in your legs and feet, reducing blood flow. It's relatively common with age, especially if you have other risk factors. We'll need to do a few tests to confirm, but I want to be upfront about what I'm seeing. Would you be alright with ordering an ankle-brachial index, or ABI, test?
PATIENT: Peripheral...artery...disease? That sounds… dreadful. Narrowing of the arteries… is that serious? And tests? I don't like tests. My daughter will be thrilled. She always wants tests. I suppose… if you really think it’s necessary. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And what does this mean? Will I have to have surgery? Will they have to… cut things open?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Wynell. PAD can be serious if left untreated, but it’s also very manageable. Many people live full and active lives with PAD. And you’re right to ask about surgery. Surgery is not always necessary. The ABI test is a simple, non-invasive scan that measures the blood flow in your legs and feet. It doesn’t involve any needles or cutting. It’s just like taking a blood pressure reading on your ankles and arms. It will help us determine how severe the narrowing is. Based on the results of that test, we can discuss the best course of action, which could include lifestyle changes, medication, or, in some cases, more advanced interventions. We’ll take it one step at a time. Before we proceed with the ABI, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Diabetes, no. Not that I know of. My daughter always makes me get my blood sugar checked at my yearly physical, but it's always been fine. High blood pressure… well, yes. I’ve had that for years. Doctor Miller put me on medication for it, a little pink pill. I take it every morning, mostly. Sometimes I forget. It starts with a ‘B’, I think… or maybe an ‘M’? Oh dear, I’m terrible with names and pills. It's all a blur these days. And I've had a bit of arthritis in my knees for a while now, if that matters. Honestly, getting old is just one big collection of aches and pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication—likely a pill starting with ‘B’ or ‘M’—and some arthritis in your knees. That’s helpful information. Medication non-compliance can sometimes contribute to high blood pressure, so we’ll definitely discuss that. Before we schedule the ABI, are you currently experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, thankfully not. A bit of indigestion sometimes, after a big meal, but that’s just my appetite getting the better of me. Shortness of breath… well, sometimes, when I climb the stairs. But that’s just because I’m getting older and… less spry, you know? It's just the natural progression of things. Nothing to worry about, I assure you. I just take things slow now, that's all. My daughter keeps telling me to lose weight, but I enjoy my food too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some indigestion and occasional shortness of breath with exertion. Those symptoms, alongside your history of high blood pressure and the swelling in your feet, are all things we need to investigate to ensure we get the best possible care plan for you. Alright, Wynell, I’d like to order an ankle-brachial index, or ABI, test. It’s a quick and painless procedure we can do right here in the clinic. It will help us determine the extent of the blood flow to your legs and feet, and give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow? Oh dear. I had planned to have my hair done tomorrow. Mrs. Gable does such a lovely job, you know. It’s a standing appointment. But… I suppose… if it’s really important. I don't like disrupting my schedule. But I suppose my health is important. Yes, tomorrow morning will have to do. But please be quick! And don’t make me lie down or anything. I don't like lying down for long periods. What time will this test take place?
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. We’ll make sure it doesn’t disrupt your hair appointment too much. It will only take about 20-30 minutes, and you won’t have to lie down at all. You’ll just be sitting comfortably while we take some blood pressure readings on your arms and legs. Let’s schedule it for 9:00 AM tomorrow. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: 9:00 AM… hmm. Yes, that should be alright. It gives me plenty of time to get to Mrs. Gable afterwards. Alright, 9:00 AM it is. But please, be gentle. And don't tell me anything terrible. I'm not a young woman anymore, Doctor. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for this test?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. No need to do anything special to prepare. Just come in wearing comfortable clothing that allows us to access your ankles and calves. And I promise to be gentle. And I'll do my best to explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. I won’t tell you anything terrible, I assure you. We’ll simply gather some information to help us understand what’s going on and decide on the best course of action. Okay, so we have you scheduled for an ABI test tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… please be quick. And gentle. And don't tell me anything terrible. My daughter will be thrilled with all this fuss. She always wants doctors and tests and… well, you know. Alright, I suppose I'll see you tomorrow then. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Wynell. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to make it as comfortable and quick as possible. I’ll see you tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Have a good rest of your day, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before tomorrow.
