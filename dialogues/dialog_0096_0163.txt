DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Vantine, is it?
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor. Jarvis Vantine, at your service. Though, quite frankly, “service” is a rather strong word for a consultation, isn’t it? But yes, that is my name. Do call me Jarvis, if you prefer.
DOCTOR: Jarvis, then. Well, Jarvis, I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, let's get down to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Burlingham, it’s rather… embarrassing, actually. I’ve been attempting a new dietary regime, shall we say, and I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I potentially… dismantle my constitution entirely. It’s one of those… extreme things. A friend recommended it, and frankly, I have far too much time on my hands these days.
DOCTOR: An “extreme” dietary regime, you say. And how long have you been on this… regime, exactly?
PATIENT: Approximately three weeks, Doctor. Three weeks of… well, it involves primarily grapefruit and black coffee. The fellow who suggested it claimed it “resets the system,” whatever that means. And a rather alarming amount of cayenne pepper. It was all very persuasive, I assure you. Though, increasingly, less enjoyable.
DOCTOR: Grapefruit, black coffee and cayenne pepper?
PATIENT: Precisely. A rather austere combination, wouldn’t you agree? Initially, there was a certain… invigorating quality, but now it’s mostly just… unsettling. And I’ve begun to suspect my complexion is taking on a rather alarming orange hue. Not a look I favour, I must confess. It clashes terribly with my tweed.
DOCTOR: Right. And apart from the, shall we say, complexion issue, what other symptoms, if any, have you been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, a multitude, Doctor. A rather persistent feeling of… emptiness. Not necessarily hunger, mind you, but… a lack of substance. Also, my energy levels fluctuate wildly. I’ll have moments of frantic activity followed by a desire to nap for approximately twelve hours. And my digestion… well, let’s just say it's become somewhat… unpredictable. It's rather disruptive to my schedule, frankly. I rather enjoy a quiet afternoon with a good book.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable digestion, fluctuating energy, and… emptiness. Hmmm. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect… I hadn’t anticipated such a direct inquiry. But, yes. Let us say they are… less frequent, and considerably… firmer than usual. It’s a rather unpleasant topic, I assure you, but I believe it’s best to be thorough. Though, I confess, I’m beginning to regret bringing this up at all. It’s quite… undignified.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No vomiting, thankfully. Though there was a rather alarming incident last week with a particularly strong cup of coffee and a particularly bumpy taxi ride. I wouldn't describe it as vomiting, but it was a near thing. As for abdominal pain… a dull ache, primarily. It comes and goes, usually after… well, after breakfast, if one can call it that. It’s not debilitating, but it's definitely… present. I find a warm compress provides some relief. Though, it’s hardly a robust solution, is it?
DOCTOR: And are you taking any other medications?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, Doctor. Nothing drastic. And occasionally, a little something for my arthritis, if the weather is particularly unkind. But that’s it. Mostly just the grapefruit, the coffee, and the… regrettable cayenne. I should probably mention I have a rather sensitive stomach normally. A fondness for pastries, perhaps, was never a wise choice.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any recent changes in your weight, either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Aha! Now there's a positive, Doctor. A rather gratifying one, actually. I believe I've lost approximately seven pounds. Though, given the… restrictive nature of this diet, I suspect a considerable portion of that is simply water weight. And, perhaps, a little bit of hope. It's a rather difficult metric to quantify, isn't it? But yes, seven pounds. Though I feel… curiously unwell despite the reduction in girth. It’s a perplexing situation, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Let’s have a look. Blood pressure first. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, a little faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing. Now, let’s take a look at your abdomen. Hmm. Tender in the lower quadrants. Not a severe tenderness, but present. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit sluggish. And let's check your skin tone. Hmm. Your skin is dry, and yes, there is a slight orange tinge, as you mentioned. Now, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Oh. Goodness. Well, Doctor, if you feel it's absolutely necessary. Though I must confess, the prospect is… less than appealing. But if it aids in the diagnosis, I suppose I can manage. A complete blood count and a metabolic panel I understand. But a stool sample… one hopes it won't be too… involved. I trust the laboratory provides discreet containers? And what, precisely, are we hoping to discover with this rather… intimate investigation? Perhaps you could explain it to me in layman's terms, if you wouldn't mind.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, we need to rule out dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and look for any signs of inflammation or infection in your digestive tract. The stool sample will help us determine if there’s any blood present, which could indicate damage to your colon. And yes, the laboratory provides, shall we say, appropriate containers. It’s a routine test. It’s uncomfortable, yes, but necessary. I’m also concerned about the potential for a vitamin deficiency, given your restricted diet. We’ll get all the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to stop this diet immediately. It's clearly doing more harm than good. I’m going to prescribe you a multivitamin and a stool softener. And I want you to increase your fluid intake. Water, mostly. No more cayenne pepper, and limit the coffee. And, please, start eating something substantial. Something with… nutrients. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Goodness. A rather extensive list of prohibitions, Doctor. No more cayenne pepper… that will be difficult; my friend insists it boosts the metabolism. But I shall endeavour to comply. And a stool softener… well, let us not dwell on that. A multivitamin I understand, and increased fluid intake is sensible. You believe this diet is causing the… sluggish reflexes and the elevated blood pressure? It’s a rather alarming thought. I’d hoped for a simple solution, a quick fix. But it appears I was rather foolish. Very well. I shall cease this… experiment immediately. And I’ll attempt to procure some… substantial nourishment. Perhaps a nice piece of fish. And, with all due respect, are you absolutely certain about the stool sample? Perhaps a urine sample would suffice? No? Very well. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… thorough. And I appreciate your candor. .
DOCTOR: Sometimes, Mr. Vantine, the simplest solutions are rarely the best. And no, a urine sample won’t tell us what we need to know. I'll see you in a week to discuss the results. Please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. Goodbye.
