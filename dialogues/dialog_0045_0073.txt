DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? This has been going on way too long. I just... I keep getting the runs. And nothing seems to help. I've tried everything the drugstore has, and it's still happening. It's embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: “Right. ‘The runs,’ you say. And you've been dealing with this for… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know, a couple of weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, but it’s always there, lurking. It’s not like a one-time thing. And I really don't have time for this, you know? I have work.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks… alright. And when you say it 'comes and goes,' can you describe what that looks like?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t need a detailed explanation of my… bowel movements. It just… happens. Some days it's ten times a day, watery, you know? Other days it's just… frequent. But it's never normal. It’s ruining my life, basically. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get… dramatic. Ten times a day, watery… That is frequent. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Everything makes it worse! Stress, eating… not eating, the weather… honestly, I wouldn’t even know where to begin. It’s just… constant. And I really don't have time to sit here listing everything I eat.
DOCTOR: So, generally exacerbated by most things… okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. I would know if there was blood. That would be… obvious. Look, I just want something to stop it, alright? I don't need a full investigation, I just need a pill or something.
DOCTOR: Well, 'just a pill' isn’t usually how we do things, Ms. Woodring. We need to figure out why this is happening before we start throwing medications at it. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Nausea sometimes, but that's probably just from… well, you know. And I haven't thrown up. Honestly, I just feel weak and tired all the time. Is that enough? Can we just get to the fix? I have a job to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weakness and tiredness along with the… frequent bowel movements. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No. Where would I even have time to travel? I’ve been working. Same place, same town. Look, I told you, I don't have time for this. I really need to get back. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: No recent travel. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Existing conditions? No. I was healthy as a horse until this started. My husband… well, he always said I was. That was before… before everything. Just this. This awful diarrhea.
DOCTOR: No known existing conditions. Okay. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never needed any. I’m a practical person. I avoid doctors as much as possible, frankly. They never fix anything. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Let's talk about your family. Any history of digestive issues - things like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or even just chronic diarrhea - in your family?
PATIENT: Family? No. My mother was healthy, my father… he was a strong man. No one had… stomach trouble. Look, I'm telling you, this came out of nowhere. It's not a family thing. Is this going anywhere? I really need to get back to work. I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Before we prescribe anything, I need to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. It’ll just be listening to your abdomen, feeling it for any tenderness or… abnormalities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't expect to find anything. It’s just… the runs. It's not rocket science. Just hurry up. I have a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back on the examination table. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen. Take a few deep breaths for me. Normal bowel sounds… slightly hyperactive, which is consistent with what you're describing. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! There. Right… there. A little bit tender. Not horrible, but yeah, that’s… uncomfortable. See? Something is wrong. Now can we please get to the solution? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant. That could indicate a number of things, Ms. Woodring. I'm going to order some stool samples to rule out any infection or parasites. And I'm also going to order a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolyte levels, given the frequency of your bowel movements. This is standard procedure.
PATIENT: Stool samples? Seriously? Is this really necessary? Look, I just need something to stop it. I don't need a science experiment. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I have work to do. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the requisition forms for the stool samples and bloodwork. You’ll need to take these to the lab across the hall. They'll tell you how to collect the samples. And I’m going to start you on loperamide – that’s Imodium – to help slow things down in the meantime. But this is just a temporary fix. We need to find out the cause of this. Take this as directed, and follow up with me in a week with the lab results. If things get significantly worse – fever, severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool – go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
