DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ottaviani. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, Doctor, it’s my throat. It… hurts. It’s been hurting for a bit now, I suppose. Not a pleasant sensation, I can assure you. I work with… machines. Big ones. It’s probably… something from there. I haven’t much time for this, you understand.
DOCTOR: "A bit now," is rather vague, Ms. Ottaviani. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t do specific. It’s… since last week, I think. Maybe before. Time blurs when you're dealing with… separations and precipitations. And clarifications! It all runs together. It's just… sore. When I swallow, mostly. And it feels… rough. Is that good enough? I have to get back to work, you see. These machines don't run themselves.
DOCTOR: "Rough," is… unhelpful, Ms. Ottaviani. Do you have any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? I… I don’t know. I haven't checked. Do I look feverish? I don't bother with thermometers. Silly things. I feel… warm, perhaps? But that’s probably the weather. It’s August, isn’t it? A warm month. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for ailments. I get on with things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing, Ms. Ottaviani?
PATIENT: Difficulty… breathing? No. I breathe. Of course I breathe! What a question. I have been a little… winded after lifting things at work, but that’s just the… the separations and the precipitations, you see. Heavy work. Not from… illness. It’s just… exertion. Is that what you’re asking about? Really, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just a sore throat. A nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: And has this sore throat been accompanied by any cough?
PATIENT: A cough… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little. A small one. A tickle, really. Not a proper cough. Just… a clearing of the throat. I do it when the dust is bad at the factory, you see. It’s a dry dust. Not… pleasant. It doesn't happen often. It's probably just the dust, honestly. I need to get back to work, Doctor. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you had any body aches or chills, Ms. Ottaviani?
PATIENT: Aches… chills? No. I don't have time for aches and chills! I am a worker. We don’t have time for such things. Look, Doctor, I run machines all day. Separations, precipitations, clarifications… it's physically demanding work. I'm probably just tired. It’s the work, you understand? Not some… illness. Really, this is all rather unnecessary. Is there anything you can do about a sore throat, or not? Because if not… I shall be going.
DOCTOR: I suppose we can take a quick look. Open, please. Hmm. Mild redness. No visible exudate. Your lymph nodes are not noticeably swollen. I suspect a minor viral irritation.
PATIENT: A viral… what now? Look, Doctor, I don't understand half of what you’re saying. It hurts. That's all I know. So, what does that mean? What do I do? Do I need some sort of… separation or precipitation to fix it? And how long will this… irritation last? I have schedules, you see. Important separations and precipitations. I can't be laid up with a… an irritation.
DOCTOR: It means you likely have a common cold, Ms. Ottaviani. It will resolve on its own. Rest, drink plenty of fluids – water, not… whatever is involved in your “separations and precipitations.” And over-the-counter lozenges may provide some temporary relief. There is no need for any further intervention at this time. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take medications. I work. Hard work keeps me healthy. Honestly, Doctor, I don't have time for… allergies. I suppose… no. No allergies. Can I go now? I really must return to my machines. These separations and precipitations… they won't complete themselves, you know. And I've lost valuable time already. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Avoid strenuous activity until the irritation subsides. And if your condition worsens, then you may seek further medical attention. Good day, Ms. Ottaviani. .
