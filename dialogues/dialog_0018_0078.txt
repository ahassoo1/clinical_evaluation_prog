DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. I see here you are 45 years of age. Can you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Yes, forty-five. It feels…longer some days, if I’m being honest. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping for a bit of a…restart. A jumpstart, perhaps. I feel like I’m running on empty, and it’s been going on for a while now. I just want to feel like myself again, and I haven’t felt like that in…well, it’s hard to say exactly how long.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pitzel. It’s very common to feel that way, and it takes courage to come in and address it. “Running on empty” is a good way to describe it. To help me understand what’s going on, let’s delve a little deeper. Perhaps we can start with the History of Present Illness – or HPI as we call it. Could you tell me when you first started noticing this feeling of being depleted?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. History of…HPI? I’m not very good with medical terms, Doctor. Just…when did I start feeling this way? Let me think… It wasn't a sudden thing, not at all. Probably…around the time my youngest started high school? So, about three years ago, maybe? It started as just being more tired than usual, needing a little extra sleep. But it’s gotten…steadier, and now it’s not really about the sleep anymore. It’s just…a general lack of energy. And, if I’m honest, a bit of…disinterest, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Pitzel. Please, don’t worry about the medical terminology at all. We can always use plain language. Three years ago, around the time your youngest started high school… that's very helpful. It sounds like it developed gradually. And you mentioned a “general lack of energy” and some “disinterest.” Can you elaborate on that disinterest?
PATIENT: Well…things I used to enjoy, I don’t really feel like doing anymore. I used to love gardening, spending hours out in the sun. Now…the thought of it just feels…exhausting. Not physically, necessarily, just…emotionally. And I used to be very involved in the school, volunteering, helping with events. I’ve just…let that slide. I tell myself I'm busy, but truthfully, I just haven’t had the motivation. Even spending time with my husband… I feel guilty saying it, but sometimes I just want to be left alone. It's not him, it's…me. Does that sound awful?
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound awful at all, Ms. Pitzel. It sounds like you’re being very honest with yourself, and that’s important. It’s perfectly normal to experience changes in motivation and enjoyment, especially when you're feeling depleted. It's good you recognize the difference between feeling overwhelmed and any issues with your relationship. Now, let’s move on to the Current Symptoms. Aside from the lack of energy and disinterest, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I’ve been having a bit of trouble sleeping, actually. Not falling asleep, so much as…staying asleep. I wake up several times during the night. And… my appetite hasn’t been great. I’m not not eating, but I don't really feel hungry. And… oh! Sometimes I get these little… waves of anxiety. Not full-blown panic attacks, just… a tightening in my chest and a sort of… restlessness. It’s not constant, but it’s there. I also feel… a little forgetful, if I’m being honest. Small things, mostly. Like where I put my keys, or what I was just about to say. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Those are all very important details, Ms. Pitzel, thank you for sharing. Trouble sleeping, decreased appetite, waves of anxiety, and some forgetfulness… these symptoms can often be related, and it’s helpful to have a complete picture. Regarding the forgetfulness, has it become significant enough to interfere with your daily life, or is it more of a minor annoyance?
PATIENT: It’s…mostly minor, I think. I haven’t missed any appointments or anything like that. But it’s… embarrassing. I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and completely blank on their name. Little things like that. My husband jokes that I’m just getting old, but… it’s a little more than that, I think. It’s not just my memory, it’s… like my brain is foggy sometimes. Hard to explain. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s enough to make me worry. I keep thinking I should be sharper, you know? Especially at my age.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly valid to be concerned, Ms. Pitzel, and it’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. Feeling "foggy" is a good way to describe it, and it’s certainly worth investigating. Now, let's move on to the Review of Systems – or ROS. This is just a quick check to see if you’re experiencing any other symptoms in different parts of your body. Have you noticed any unexplained weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: No, no significant weight changes. I might have lost a pound or two, but nothing drastic. I’ve actually been eating less lately, so if anything, I’d expect to be losing weight. But it hasn’t been noticeable, really. I’m about the same as always. Oh! Actually… my hands have been a little shaky lately. Not all the time, but sometimes when I’m trying to do something delicate, like threading a needle. Is that… related? I hadn’t even thought to mention it before. It’s just… a little tremor, really. Nothing serious, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: That's good information to have, Ms. Pitzel. The tremor is worth noting. It’s always best to be thorough. Have you been experiencing any headaches, vision changes, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. Maybe a little tension headache from time to time, but nothing severe. Vision’s been fine, I think. I had my eyes checked last year, and everything was normal. And dizziness… no, not really. Although… I do feel a little lightheaded sometimes when I stand up quickly. It doesn’t last long, just a brief moment of feeling… off-balance. It’s happened a couple of times recently, but it’s nothing major. I’m probably just getting old. Is that what you’re going to write down?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Pitzel, age is rarely the sole explanation for these things. It’s my job to investigate and rule out any potential underlying causes. We are just gathering information at this point. Now, let’s talk about your Past Medical History. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but that cleared up quickly. And I had a gallbladder removed when I was younger, but that was… well, a long time ago. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no thyroid problems. I do have some arthritis in my hands, but it’s not severe. It just aches a little sometimes, especially in cold weather. Oh! And I had COVID last year, but it was mild. Just a bad cold, really. I recovered pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and a mild case of COVID. Now, have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. Maybe a tonsillectomy when I was a child, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. And I’ve had a few wisdom teeth removed, but that’s hardly a surgery, is it? Otherwise, no. Nothing major. Oh! I did have a C-section with my daughter. That was… well, it was a long time ago, too. But I recovered well. No complications.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy, wisdom teeth removal, and a C-section. Now, let’s move on to Family History. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had heart disease. She passed away when she was in her seventies. And my father had diabetes, but he managed it pretty well for years. My sister has high blood pressure, and she also struggles with anxiety. My grandfather on my mother’s side had… I think it was Alzheimer’s. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember all the details. Otherwise… not really. No major cancers, no other significant mental health issues. It’s a fairly healthy family, all things considered. We all live a long time, if that counts for anything.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful information, Ms. Pitzel. Heart disease, diabetes, anxiety, and Alzheimer’s. Now, let’s talk about your Social History. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’ve never been a smoker. And I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Maybe once or twice a week. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a very boring woman, Doctor. I don’t have any vices, really. Except maybe chocolate. But that doesn’t count, does it?
DOCTOR: Chocolate absolutely doesn't count, Ms. Pitzel. That’s a perfectly acceptable indulgence. Now, what about your occupation?
PATIENT: I am a… well, I work with molds. Shaping and casting things. Not metal, usually. More… decorative items. Plaster, resin, that sort of thing. It’s a small business, I have a little workshop at home. It’s… satisfying work, usually. Although, lately, it’s been hard to find the energy to even go down to the workshop. It’s physically demanding, sometimes, the lifting and bending. But I enjoy the creativity of it. When I have the energy, that is.
DOCTOR: I understand. A creative but physically demanding occupation. And finally, let’s talk about Allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don't have any major allergies. I'm a little sensitive to pollen during the spring, but it's just a mild runny nose and itchy eyes. Nothing serious. And I'm not allergic to any medications, as far as I know. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m a pretty simple woman, Doctor. No allergies, no vices, just… tired.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Pitzel, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much better understanding of what’s going on. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a more complete picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's begin with your vital signs. I'm going to take your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, your temperature is 98.6, and your respiratory rate is 16. All within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Next, I'd like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear. Nasal passages are clear. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Finally, I’d like to palpate your abdomen and check your reflexes. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. There are no obvious signs of any underlying medical condition. However, given your symptoms of fatigue, decreased energy, and some forgetfulness, I would like to order some blood work to rule out any potential deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. I mean, I’m glad there’s nothing obviously wrong, but I’m also glad you’re ordering tests. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? What kind of tests are you thinking about? And will they take long to get the results? I have a few orders I need to fill for my business, and I’m worried about being… out of commission, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pitzel. It’s good that we’re being thorough. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a thyroid stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function, and a vitamin D level. We’ll also check your B12 levels, as deficiency can cause fatigue and memory problems. The tests shouldn’t take long to get the results – usually a few days, maybe up to a week. The lab will contact you directly to schedule an appointment for blood draw. You shouldn't be out of commission for any significant amount of time. Just a little inconvenience, really. In the meantime, I would like to discuss some general lifestyle modifications that may help improve your energy levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Absolutely. Any advice you can give me, I’m happy to hear. I’m willing to try anything at this point. I just want to feel… normal again. Lifestyle modifications sound good. What do you suggest?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let's start with sleep. Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. Establish a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. Create a relaxing bedtime routine – perhaps a warm bath, reading, or listening to calming music. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. Next, let's talk about diet. Eat a healthy, balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks. Regular exercise is also important. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Even a simple walk can make a difference. Finally, and this is very important, manage your stress levels. Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as yoga, meditation, or spending time in nature. Do any of those suggestions seem particularly challenging or unrealistic for you?
PATIENT: Well, the sleep… I try. But I wake up so often during the night, it’s hard to get a solid seven or eight hours. I think the stress is the biggest issue, honestly. Running the business is… demanding. And it’s hard to just switch off at the end of the day. I worry about orders, about finances… it’s always something. The diet… I could probably do better. I tend to grab whatever’s easiest, and that’s usually not very healthy. Exercise… I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t had the energy for that lately. It feels like too much effort. So, I think the stress and the energy levels are the biggest hurdles. It’s easier said than done, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is, Ms. Pitzel. And you’re not alone in feeling that way. It sounds like you’re juggling a lot, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Given the level of stress you’re experiencing, I would like to discuss the possibility of talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your stress and anxiety. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A therapist… I don’t know. I’ve never really thought about it before. It feels… a little extreme, doesn’t it? I mean, I’m not crazy or anything. I just… feel tired. But… I suppose if it could help, it’s worth considering. Do you have any recommendations? And… is it expensive? I have insurance, but I’m not sure what it covers.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel hesitant, Ms. Pitzel. It doesn't mean you're "crazy" at all. Therapy can be incredibly helpful for anyone who's struggling with stress, anxiety, or just feeling overwhelmed. It’s about having a safe space to process your emotions and develop coping mechanisms. I do have a few recommendations. Dr. Emily Carter is a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in stress management and burnout. She accepts Medicare, and her office is located nearby. I can provide you with her contact information. I also recommend checking with your insurance provider to see what your coverage is. They can provide you with a list of in-network therapists. Ultimately, the decision is up to you. But I believe it could be a valuable resource. In the meantime, let's schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your blood work. How does two weeks from today sound?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds good. And… yes, please, give me Dr. Carter’s information. I’ll at least look into it. Maybe just talking to someone would help. I appreciate your suggestions, Doctor. I really do. I’m glad I came in today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad you came in as well. It takes courage to ask for help, and you’ve taken a very important first step. We’ll get those tests ordered, and we’ll see you back in two weeks to discuss the results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything, really. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Pitzel. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
