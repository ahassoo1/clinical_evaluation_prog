DOCTOR: Good morning, Andrew. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… my eyes are dry. Really dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don’t like it. Makes things blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. That is uncomfortable, and blurry vision can be worrying. “A while now” is helpful, but could you tell me roughly how long we’re talking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Maybe… six months? More? Time gets away from me, you know. It's been dry since last winter, for sure. Maybe longer. I mostly just deal with it.
DOCTOR: I do understand, time can slip away. Since last winter is good to know. And just to clarify, is it both eyes, or is it worse in one?
PATIENT: Both. But… …the left one feels a little scratchier, I think. Not a lot, but… yeah, the left one bothers me more. It feels like something’s in it sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes, but the left one is scratchier and feels like something is in it. That gives me a little more to work with. Do you notice anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Wind, for sure. Big wind makes 'em burn. And… being inside with the heater on. Dries 'em right out. That's mostly it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, wind and heater both make it worse. That’s helpful. Do you have any other symptoms with your eyes?
PATIENT: Symptoms? You mean… other than dry and blurry? Not really. They don't hurt, not really painful. Just… uncomfortable. And sometimes I blink a lot, trying to get some moisture in 'em. I guess that's a symptom.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just discomfort and increased blinking. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or crusting in your eyes, especially when you wake up in the morning?
PATIENT: Redness… Sometimes, maybe. It's hard to say. I don’t look at ‘em that close. No… no crusting, I don’t think. Definitely no discharge. Just dry. Mostly just dry.
DOCTOR: Alright, no crusting or discharge, mostly just dryness. Now, let's talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Never really needed to. Just this eye thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you haven't been to a doctor in a long time. That's alright. We’ll get this eye thing sorted out. Do you take any medications at all, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Don't like taking pills if I can help it. Just… when I get a bad cold, maybe some cough syrup. But that's it. I try to stay healthy. Fresh air and good food. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Good for you trying to stay healthy! Now, have you ever had any eye surgeries or injuries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Eyes are good for working with cement, you know? Gotta protect 'em. Had a few close calls with dust, but never anything bad enough for a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no eye surgeries or injuries. Good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I like cats, and they don't bother me. And I work around dust all the time. So... probably not. I don’t sneeze much. I’m pretty tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to take a quick look at your eyes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Get it over with. I got things to do. Hurry it up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick look. I'm going to shine this light in your eyes and ask you to read some letters on this card. It won’t take long. First, could you look straight ahead for me?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just get it done. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your pupils are reacting normally to light, which is good. I am seeing some dryness in both eyes, a little more on the left side as you mentioned. Your corneas look clear, but there is some mild irritation. I'm going to use a small strip to measure how much tear film you're producing. It’s a quick test, won't hurt a bit.
PATIENT: Tear film? What's that? You're gonna poke me in the eye, aren't ya? I told ya, just dry eyes. Don't need fancy tests.
DOCTOR: No poking, I promise! A tear film test just measures how much moisture your eyes are making naturally. It's a tiny strip that we gently place under your lower eyelid for a few seconds to see how quickly it absorbs tears. It doesn't touch the colored part of your eye at all. It helps us understand why your eyes are dry, so we can find the best way to treat them. It’s a really common test, and it will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Would you be willing to try it?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But make it quick. Don't wanna sit here all day. Just… be gentle. And tell me when it's done.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax and blink normally. I’m placing this small strip under your lower eyelid. It will just measure how much tear film you produce over the next few seconds. I’ll let you know when we’re done. Alright, that's the right eye done. Now, let's do the left. It's the same thing, just on this side. Okay, all done! Let me take a look at these strips. Okay, it looks like you’re producing a slightly reduced amount of tear film in both eyes, more significantly in the left. This is consistent with what you’ve been describing. It's likely a case of dry eye syndrome. It’s very common, especially as we get older. It’s often caused by things like wind, heater use, and just a natural decrease in tear production. It’s good news though, it’s usually quite manageable.
PATIENT: Manageable, huh? What does that mean? What do I gotta do? I don’t want no eye drops I gotta put in all the time. And I ain't gonna change my whole life 'cause of dry eyes.
DOCTOR: I understand. You don’t want a complicated routine, and you don’t want to drastically change your life. That’s perfectly reasonable. Luckily, there are several options, and we can start with the simplest ones. The first thing I recommend is using artificial tears as needed. They’re like lubricating drops that help keep your eyes moist. You don’t need to use them constantly, just when your eyes feel dry or irritated. There are many different brands available, some are thicker than others. We can try a few to see which one works best for you. Another helpful thing is to avoid things that dry out your eyes, like wind and heater use as much as possible. When you’re working outside, try wearing sunglasses or goggles to protect your eyes. And if you're indoors with the heater on, try using a humidifier to add moisture to the air. We can also consider a simple eyelid hygiene routine. Gently cleaning your eyelids with a warm compress and a mild cleanser can help remove any debris that might be blocking your tear glands. Do any of those sound manageable to you?
PATIENT: Artificial tears… okay, I guess I can try that. The sunglasses, yeah, I already do that when it's windy. But cleaning my eyelids? Sounds… fussy. You got any of those drops here? Just wanna get this over with. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can definitely start with artificial tears. And that's perfectly fine about the eyelid hygiene; we can always revisit that later if the drops aren't enough. Here, I have a sample of these preservative-free artificial tears. They're generally well-tolerated, and preservative-free is often gentler on the eyes. You can try using one or two drops in each eye as needed, up to four times a day. Let's start with that and see how you feel in a week or so. If you don’t notice any improvement after a week, or if your symptoms get worse, give the office a call and we can discuss other options. We could consider a slightly thicker drop, or even a prescription medication if needed. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, sounds good. Just… don’t want no big fuss. And don't call me. I'll call you if I need somethin'. Now can I go? Got things to do. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No problem at all. Remember, if you don't notice any improvement, or if your symptoms worsen, please give us a call. We’re here to help. Have a good day, Andrew. And please be careful out there.
