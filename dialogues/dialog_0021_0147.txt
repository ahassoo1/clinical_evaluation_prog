DOCTOR: Right, Amy Raghunathan… 31 years old. Hello, Amy. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Havird. Well, for the past few weeks I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I suppose, in my lower abdomen. It doesn’t hurt, not really, but it’s definitely there and it’s a little… worrying me.
DOCTOR: A lump in your lower abdomen…okay. And you said a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four weeks now. At first I thought maybe it was just… bloating, or something I ate. But it hasn’t gone away, and it feels… solid, if that makes sense. Not like gas.
DOCTOR: Solid, not gas… Right. And has it changed at all in size during those three or four weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe a little? It’s hard to say for sure, but I feel like it’s grown slightly. Not a huge amount, but noticeable to me, I suppose. I haven’t been measuring it or anything, if that’s what you mean. Just… feeling it when I lie down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual change in size… Alright. Now, is it located on one particular side, or is it more central?
PATIENT: It’s… more on my right side, I think. Lower right abdomen. Not exactly in line with my hip bone, but… a few inches above it, and a bit towards the middle. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. Lower right quadrant… broadly. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual. It’s not… debilitating, but I’ve been needing more sleep. And, honestly, my appetite hasn’t been great. But I thought that might be the heat, to be honest. We’ve had a very hot summer.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and decreased appetite… Fine. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… no, not really. Everything seems… normal there, thankfully. No pain, no… anything different. Just… the lump and the tiredness. I suppose I’ve been a little constipated, but I usually am when it’s hot. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Constipation is rarely relevant. Have you noticed any weight loss?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I haven’t weighed myself recently, to be honest. I've been avoiding it, if I'm being truthful. But I don't think so. My clothes feel the same, at least. It’s possible I’ve lost a little, but nothing dramatic. I really haven’t been keeping track.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let’s have a feel of your abdomen, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please do. Just… let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. It is firm. Not particularly tender to the touch, but definitely there. About… 3 centimeters in diameter, I’d say. Not freely movable. Hmm. And no significant pain with pressure?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… pressure, naturally, when you press, but no sharp pain, no… wincing or anything like that. It just feels… solid. Like a small, hard ball. It's a little unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it's good that there's no acute pain, but a solid, non-mobile mass in the lower abdomen… We need to investigate further. I'm going to order an ultrasound. That should give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? I… I don't think so. I've never had an ultrasound before, so I wouldn't have been exposed to it. I have no known allergies, generally. Just… a bit sensitive to certain perfumes, but that's it. Is the contrast dye common with an ultrasound?
DOCTOR: It's not always necessary. We'll start without it, see what we see. It's just a precaution. Now, let’s go through your medical history. Any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries. Nothing at all. I’ve been very lucky, health-wise, until… well, until this. I did have tonsillitis when I was a child, but that’s it. No hospital stays, no major illnesses. Just… the usual colds and flu.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any significant family history of… cancer?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a difficult question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, passed away a few years ago. She had some kind of abdominal cancer, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t know many details. My mother didn’t talk about it much. She passed away herself a couple of years ago, sadly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. The ultrasound will help us get a clearer picture. We’ll get the results in a few days. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, or changes in bowel habits, go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Severe pain, fever, changes in bowel habits… Emergency room. I will. Thank you, Dr. Havird. It’s… a relief to have some sort of plan, even if it’s just an ultrasound.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. We’ll see what the ultrasound shows. Don't worry unduly. It could be many things. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you now. And… try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
