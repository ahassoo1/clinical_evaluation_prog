DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Good morning to you too. Clinic, you say? New here, yes. Just…seeing how things are. Doctor things. I moved, you know. From…somewhere. Not important. Just need to make sure everything works. Old man problems, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Doctor things” is a good way to put it. And welcome to the area, Mr. Szmyd. We're glad to have you. So, when you say “everything works,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? You want specific? Doctors always want specific. Look, I do faces. Make people pretty. Stage, mostly. That’s what I do. But…old man things. Aches, maybe? Can’t remember. It’s just…a check-up. Like when you take car for oil change. You look things over.
DOCTOR: Right, a general check-up. That makes sense. You're a stage makeup artist, so you need to be in good shape to do your work. Okay. And you said some aches?
PATIENT: Aches… yes. Back mostly. And knees. Old knees. Used to be good knees. Now…not so good. Not bad bad. Just…old. Like a rusty door. Need oil, maybe? You got oil here?
DOCTOR: No, unfortunately, we don't have oil for rusty doors here! But we can definitely look at your back and knees. When did you start noticing these aches, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Noticing? Oh, a long time. Years, probably. Hard to say. I don’t keep track of years. They all blend together when you paint faces all day. It’s just…gradual. Like…snow falling. You don't notice it at first, then suddenly everything is white. Doesn’t matter. It’s just old.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset of back and knee aches. And it hasn't been getting significantly worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse? No, not really. Maybe a little. But…it’s August. Humid. Everything aches in the humid. Makes the bones…sticky. More annoying than bad. More…a nuisance. Like a fly buzzing around your head. You swat it, but it just comes back.
DOCTOR: Okay, humidity seems to aggravate the aches. Do you have any pain now, at this moment?
PATIENT: Now? Hmm… A little in the back. If I bend over. Not a sharp pain. Just…a reminder. Like…a gentle scolding. Telling me I’m getting old. It’s a constant conversation, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, so some discomfort with bending. And what about your knees?
PATIENT: Knees... They talk too. Mostly when I go up stairs. Or down. A little creaky. Like…an old wooden house. You know, the kind that settles at night? That’s my knees. Not terrible. Just…present. Is this what you wanted to hear? All the old-man noises?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, this is exactly what I wanted to hear! It helps me understand what’s going on. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any swelling in your knees, or any redness or warmth?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… No. Not really. They’re…legs. Normal leg size. Maybe a little thicker than they used to be, but that’s probably just…life. Redness? No. Warmth? No. They're not hot knees. Just…old. And creaky. Like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, no swelling, redness, or warmth. Good. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your back or knees?
PATIENT: Injuries? Oh, a few. When I was younger. Stage work, you know? Falling off things. Twisting ankles. Nothing serious. Just…bumps and bruises. Once, I think, I pulled something in my back lifting a very large…prop. A tree, maybe? It was a long time ago. Doesn’t matter now. Healed, mostly. Forgotten, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, some past minor injuries to both back and knees, but nothing significant. And do you have any other medical conditions - things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. High…pressure? No. Heart? No. I smoke, yes. A few cigarettes. But nothing serious. My mother, she had…something with her heart. But I am not my mother. Are we getting to the bad things now? I don’t like bad things.
DOCTOR: We're just gathering information, Mr. Szmyd. It helps me to understand your overall health. Smoking can affect your heart and lungs, so it's good to know. And it’s good you know your family history. Now, do you take any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm… No. Not really. Sometimes a little something for the…headache. But not regularly. Just when it really bothers me. And…a vitamin, maybe? My neighbor gave me some. Something orange. I don't remember the name. I mostly just drink tea. And paint faces.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional headache medication and a vitamin supplement. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I’m Russian, you know? We eat pickles with everything. And sometimes…something with fish. Don't think I'm allergic to anything. Maybe dust? Makes me sneeze sometimes. But everyone sneezes. Is that it? Are we done with the questions?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, I think that covers the important questions for now. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh, alright. Exam. Fine. But be gentle, doctor. Old bones, you know? And no poking. I don’t like poking.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. Very gentle. No poking, I promise. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Deep breath… Like this? Too much? I used to smoke on stage, you know. It was part of the character. Makes the lungs…complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mr. Szmyd. Thank you. I hear some mild wheezing, which isn’t uncommon with a history of smoking. Now, I'm going to feel around your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Abdomen…tender? What does that even mean? Everything feels tender when you poke it! It’s my stomach! It’s…sensitive. And old. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to worry. It's normal for the abdomen to be a little sensitive. Now, let’s take a look at your back. Could you bend forward for me, please?
PATIENT: Bend forward? Oh, dear. This is not good. This is very not good. I told you, old bones! It’s creaking! See? This is what happens when you ask an old man to bend!
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. You have some limited range of motion and mild discomfort with bending, as you mentioned. Now, let's check your knees. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Lie down? On the…table? It looks cold and…clinical. And I’m not a young man anymore, doctor. It's not easy getting up and down. Fine. But be careful. And no poking. I repeat, no poking!
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. No poking. I’m just going to gently feel around your knees and check their range of motion. Now, can you bend your right knee for me?
PATIENT: Bend my knee…? Oof. There it is. The creak. Like an old ship. A very, very old ship. And a little bit of…pain. Not a lot. Just…a reminder. Like my knees are talking to me. Is that enough creaking for you, doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mr. Szmyd. I feel some mild crepitus – that’s the creaking sound – and slight tenderness along the joint line. No significant swelling. Now, let’s check your left knee…
PATIENT: Left knee… Same thing. Creak, pain, reminder. It's a whole conversation down there! They're very chatty knees, you know? Always complaining. They miss the good old days, I think. When they were young and springy.
DOCTOR: Okay, similar findings on your left knee – mild crepitus and tenderness. It sounds like you have some osteoarthritis in both knees, which is very common with age and previous use. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes…? What for? My reflexes are probably…old too. Slow. Like everything else. I'm not a young athlete anymore, you know. I paint faces!
DOCTOR: It’s just a quick check, Mr. Szmyd. Just to see how your nervous system is functioning. And you’re right, reflexes can change with age, that’s perfectly normal. Okay, that’s it for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. I’m going to review my findings and discuss some possible treatment options with you. Just give me a moment.
PATIENT: Treatment options…? Oh, dear. This is getting serious. I knew it. I should have just stayed home and drank tea. What kind of treatment? Surgery? Injections? I don’t like needles, you know. And I definitely don’t want to be cut open.
DOCTOR: No, nothing that drastic right away, Mr. Szmyd. Based on my exam, it sounds like you have mild osteoarthritis in both knees and some age-related changes in your back. The good news is, we can manage this with conservative treatments. That means things like physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees and back, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed, and possibly some gentle stretching exercises. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications, like losing weight if you’re overweight, which can take some pressure off your joints. Would you be interested in learning more about those options?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications…? Weight loss…? Losing weight? Doctor, I am a small man! There is not much to lose! And physical therapy? That sounds…painful. I already have aches and creaks. I don’t need more! Maybe just a little something for the aches? A pill, perhaps? Something small. I just want to keep painting faces, you know? I don’t need to run marathons.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. You don’t need any drastic changes. We can definitely start with something simple for the aches. I can prescribe a low-dose anti-inflammatory medication, like meloxicam, to help with the pain and inflammation. And we can also talk about some gentle stretching exercises you can do at home to keep your joints flexible. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Stretching… hm. Gentle stretching, you say? Not too much bending? No twisting? Alright. Fine. Gentle stretching and a pill. But if it gets too painful, I'm blaming you, doctor. And I want a written list of these stretches. I don’t want to do anything wrong. And…is that all? Can I go now and drink my tea?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. Here’s a handout with some gentle stretching exercises for your knees and back. They’re designed to be very low-impact. I’m also sending the prescription for meloxicam to your pharmacy. And yes, you are free to go now and enjoy your tea! Just a couple of final points. If your pain worsens or doesn’t improve after a couple of weeks, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can reassess. Also, if you develop any new symptoms, like fever or swelling, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Fever? Swelling? Oh, dear. You're making me nervous again, doctor. This looks…complicated. All these pictures. No, I think that’s enough questions for now. I just want to go home and paint some faces. And drink my tea. Thank you, doctor. I hope these pills work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I hope they do too. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care and enjoy your painting!
PATIENT: .
