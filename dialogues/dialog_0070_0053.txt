DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it's my waterworks, really. I'm having a bit of trouble, you see. Going to the toilet isn't as easy as it used to be. It takes me a while, and sometimes… sometimes it just doesn’t want to go.
DOCTOR: I see. So, difficulty with urination. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it started maybe a month ago, just feeling like I didn’t empty my bladder completely. Then it got to where I’d have to… push a bit. Not painful, exactly, just… effort. And now, sometimes I try and… nothing happens for a little while. I have to try again, maybe two or three times before anything comes out. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. And I worry a little, you know? It feels different than when I was younger.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Yadao, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a bit worried when things change. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. You mentioned it started about a month ago and has gradually worsened. Are you experiencing any pain while you’re urinating, or any pain in your lower abdomen, back, or sides?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. That's the odd thing. It’s not painful during, and my tummy is fine. My back… well, I get a little ache sometimes, but I’ve always had that. Old age, you know? I think it’s just my back. It's not related, I don't think. It’s more… a weakness, I suppose, when I try to go. Like something isn’t working quite right. And… it makes me go more often, just in case, you see? I don’t want to have an accident.
DOCTOR: So, no pain with urination, some pre-existing back discomfort, and you're finding yourself needing to urinate more frequently, almost as a preventative measure. That’s helpful information, Ms. Yadao. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… the color or smell, you mean? Hmm. I haven't really paid attention, to be honest. I go, and I flush, and that's usually it. I suppose it looks… normal. Yellow, like it always is. No blood, no funny smell… not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I drink plenty of water, Doctor. Always have. I don't know if that makes a difference. It's just... everything is a bit slow and weak now. Like an old pump that needs priming, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very helpful way to describe it. No noticeable changes in the urine itself, you drink plenty of water… excellent. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I’m on Medicare, so I see doctors regularly enough. I had a little bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on a pill, and it’s been fine ever since. I haven’t been told about anything else. No diabetes, no heart trouble… just the usual aches and pains of getting old, really. And I've never had any surgeries, if that matters. Just the usual check-ups and the odd cold.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Yadao. And what medications are you currently taking, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Just the one pill for the blood pressure, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A little white one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my arthritis is bad, I take a little bit of ibuprofen, but not very often. It’s not every day, maybe once a week or less. I try to get by without it, if I can. It doesn't do much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I used to help my mother in the kitchen, and I've eaten all sorts of things over the years. Never had a reaction to anything. No trouble with penicillin or any of those, either. I’m a pretty simple person, really. I don’t have a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Ms. Yadao. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief neurological check, and a gentle exam of your lower abdomen. I may also want to do a urine sample to check for infection or other issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. A urine sample, certainly. And I don't mind the listening and poking, if that's what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would, please. My bones aren’t what they used to be. Where would I go to give the sample?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I will be as gentle as possible. There's a restroom just down the hall. I’ll give you a specimen cup and instructions. Please collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a small amount mid-stream into the cup. Once you’ve collected the sample, please bring it back to me and we can proceed with the exam. I'll just step outside to give you some privacy.
PATIENT: Right, a midstream sample. I remember those from… well, a long time ago. I’ll go and do that now. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you get back.
