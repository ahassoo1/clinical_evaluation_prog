DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye too, Doctor. Nice to meet ye as well. Well, it’s this nausea, see. Been gettin' it most mornings now, for… oh, maybe a month or so. It's not terrible, but it’s enough to ruin me appetite, and that's a problem when ye're tryin' to keep yer strength up, ye ken? I have a bit of trouble with me heart, and the nurses told me to come in if this started.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of morning nausea, and you mentioned some heart trouble… that’s good you came in to get it checked out. Just to clarify, when you say “heart trouble,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Aye, certainly. Well, it's nothin' sudden, it's been buildin' for a while now. About five years ago, the doctor told me I have… well, he said somethin' about it not pumpin' as well as it should. Heart failure, I think he called it. I take a couple o' pills every day for it, and I try to watch me salt intake. I get a wee bit short o' breath now and then, but mostly I manage. The nurses at the clinic keep a close eye on me, bless 'em. They’re the ones who suggested I come in about this sickness in the mornin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart failure for about five years, managed with medication and diet. And shortness of breath occasionally. That’s helpful. Just to be thorough, can you tell me the names of the medications you’re taking for your heart?
PATIENT: Right, aye, let me think… I have a wee pill box, thankfully. Just a moment… Right, here we are. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, every mornin'. And then there's… Carvedilol, 25 milligrams, twice a day. And sometimes, if me legs get a bit swollen, the nurse gives me Furosemide, 40 milligrams. But I don't take that every day, only when needed, ye see?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, Carvedilol 25mg twice daily, and Furosemide 40mg as needed for swelling. Good, that’s very helpful. Now, about this nausea… is it with all mornings, or just some?
PATIENT: It's most mornings, aye. Not every single one, but maybe six out of seven, if that makes sense. It usually starts right after I get up, before I've even had a bite o' breakfast. And it's not violent or anythin', just… queasy, ye ken? Like I'm gonna be sick, but usually I'm not. It just ruins me appetite for the rest o' the day, and I need to eat to keep me strength up. Sometimes, it lingers a bit even after I've had somethin' to eat. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Benic. So, nausea most mornings upon waking, sometimes lingering, and affecting your appetite. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse – certain foods, smells, or activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that ye mention it, I think it's a bit worse if I lie flat for too long. If I try to get up too quickly, it's definitely worse. And strong smells… well, I’ve always been sensitive to smells, but they seem to bother me a bit more with this. Especially strong perfumes or cookin' smells. Not sure if that’s just me bein’ old though! I haven’t noticed it bein’ much worse after certain foods, no. Just… generally queasy in the mornin', ye see?
DOCTOR: Okay, worsening with lying flat and strong smells. That’s good to know. And no specific foods seem to trigger it. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye ask… I've been feelin' a wee bit more tired than usual, to be honest. It’s not like I’m completely exhausted, but I'm definitely sleepier in the afternoons than I used to be. And I’ve noticed me ankles have been a bit swollen lately, even more than usual. I usually put me feet up when that happens, but it’s takin' longer for the swellin' to go down. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest, but now that ye ask about other symptoms… aye, tiredness and the ankles.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased tiredness and worsening ankle swelling. Let's do a quick physical exam to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, of course, Doctor. Whatever ye think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m not afraid of a wee examination. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds a little… diminished, but no new murmurs or irregular rhythms that I can hear right now. Lungs are clear, but there is a slight crackling sound on both sides, lower lobes. That can be consistent with some fluid buildup. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72. Let's take a look at your ankles. Yes, there is some definite pitting edema in both ankles, about 2+ pitting. And your skin feels a little cool to the touch. Finally, I'll just do a quick neurological check. Follow my finger with your eyes. Everything looks good there. Okay, that gives me a bit more information. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like your heart failure may be a bit more aggravated at the moment. The nausea, tiredness, and ankle swelling could all be signs of that. The crackling in your lungs also suggests some fluid retention.
PATIENT: Aye, well, that doesn't sound too good, does it? I was worryin' it was somethin' serious, to be honest. I try to take care o' meself, but ye get older and things start to… well, go wrong. So, what does this mean, Doctor? Is there somethin' ye can do to help? I’m not wantin' to end up in the hospital, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Mr. Benic, but it's good you came in when you did. We’ve caught it relatively early, and we can likely manage this without a hospital stay, if we make some adjustments. To confirm what I suspect, I'd like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a BNP level, which measures a hormone released when the heart is stretched, and is a good indicator of heart failure. We should also get an EKG to check your heart rhythm again. In the meantime, I want you to strictly limit your sodium intake – less than 2000 milligrams per day. Avoid processed foods, canned soups, and fast food. And I want you to weigh yourself every morning, first thing, and let the nurse know if you gain more than two pounds in a day or five pounds in a week. That can be a sign of fluid buildup. Are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Aye, well, that sounds sensible enough. Blood tests and watchin’ me salt intake… I can manage that. I’m not keen on goin' to the hospital, so I’ll do whatever ye suggest. And as for over-the-counter medications… not really. Just a wee bit of ibuprofen now and then for me aches and pains, but not every day. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I’ve been forgettin’ to lately, to be honest. I don't take anythin' else. I try to avoid pills if I can, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally, multivitamin sometimes. That’s good to know. Ibuprofen can sometimes worsen heart failure, so it's best to avoid it if possible. If you need something for pain, acetaminophen would be a better choice. So, to recap, we're getting blood tests and an EKG. We'll strictly limit your sodium intake, monitor your weight, and avoid ibuprofen. I'll also have the nurse call you with the results of the tests as soon as they come back, likely within a day or two. Depending on those results, we may need to adjust your current medications or add a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Aye, I think I understand all that. Sodium, weight, no ibuprofen… I can remember that. A diuretic… is that one of them water pills I’ve heard about? And if ye do need to adjust me medication… will that make me feel different? Sometimes when they change me pills I get a bit dizzy or tired. I just want to be able to get on with me day, ye ken? I don’t want to be stuck in bed all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, a diuretic is a water pill. It helps your body get rid of extra fluid, which can relieve some of the swelling and make it easier to breathe. And you're right to be concerned about side effects when we adjust your medication. Sometimes changing doses or adding new pills can cause dizziness, tiredness, or other side effects. That's why we'll start slowly and monitor you closely. If you do experience any side effects, let the nurse or me know right away, and we can adjust the dose or try a different medication. We'll do our best to find a regimen that helps you feel better without making you feel worse. The goal is to get you back to doing the things you enjoy. Before you leave, I’m going to give you a handout with information about a low-sodium diet and heart failure management. And, if you're up for it, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the test results and how you're feeling. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Aye, a handout and a follow-up appointment sounds grand. I'm happy to have somethin' to refer to, and it’s good to know ye’ll be keepin' an eye on me. A week is fine, that gives me time to sort meself out a bit. I appreciate ye takin' the time to explain everything so clearly, Doctor. It puts me mind at ease. I suppose there’s nothin' else for me to do but get on with it then, eh? Thank ye again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. Remember, we’re a team, and we’ll work through this together. The nurse will be right in to give you the handout and schedule your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
