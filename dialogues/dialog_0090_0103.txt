DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Kur. Well, my back. It’s been hurting. Lower back, mostly. It’s…not good. Feels old, you know? Like something’s gonna snap. Been going on for a while now, not just today.
DOCTOR: "Old," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, old. Like…I’m 77, you see? Bones aren't what they used to be. My ex-wife always said I carried too much weight on my shoulders, but that was… different kind of weight. This is in my back. It aches all the time, but gets worse when I bend over. Even just reaching for things is hard now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Vankampen, although "old" isn’t a medical term, of course. And while I appreciate the… colorful description, let's try to be a bit more specific. When did you first notice this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific…right. Let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? No, longer. More like eight, maybe nine months. It was just a little twinge at first, when I was helping my daughter move some boxes. She's got a strong boy, that one. But it didn't go away. Just got…steadier. It's been bad for the last three months, I'd say. Really bothering me. I try to ignore it, but it's hard.
DOCTOR: Ignoring pain is rarely a good strategy, Mr. Vankampen. So, this started when you were helping your daughter move boxes… and it’s been consistently worsening for the past three months. Does anything relieve the pain at all?
PATIENT: Not much, to be honest. Laying down helps a little, but I can’t spend all day in bed. Warm baths sometimes, for a little while. And…this is gonna sound silly…but sometimes if I just sit very still, and breathe slow, it eases up a tiny bit. But it always comes back. I’ve tried some of those creams you see on TV, the ones for aches and pains, but they didn’t do much good. Mostly just smelled nice.
DOCTOR: Smelling nice isn't a bad side effect, I suppose. Alright. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A scale… Okay. Right now? Hmm… It’s not terrible, because I’m sitting. But if I try to stand up… or bend… I’d say… a six. Maybe a seven on a bad day. Right now, it’s a solid six. It’s a constant ache, you see? Not sharp, just… there. Always there. It makes it hard to do things, even just walking around the house.
DOCTOR: Do you have any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No tingling, no numbness, and my legs still work fine! I walk okay, I think. Maybe a little slower than I used to, but that’s just getting old, right? No, nothing like that. It's just… the ache. And sometimes, if I stand for too long, it feels like my back is gonna give out. That’s the scary part.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Injuries… Well, when I was a young man, working construction, I lifted something too heavy. Pulled a muscle, I think. Doctor gave me some pills, told me to rest. It healed up okay, but it always felt a little weak after that. That was… oh, maybe fifty years ago? And I slipped on some ice a few years back, but didn’t fall too hard. Mostly just bruised my pride. Nothing serious, I don't think. It's just this ache that's the problem now. It's different than anything I've felt before.
DOCTOR: And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm…Well, my blood pressure is a little high, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that. And my cholesterol, too. Another pill. Nothing too serious. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago. But that was… a long time ago. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for an old man! I try to eat right, mostly. And I walk when I can. Just this back… it's making everything harder. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. Just figured it was old age. But it's not going away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at your back. If you don't mind, I'm going to need you to stand up and bend forward a bit. And then I’ll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Bend forward… alright. I can do that, I think. Just take it easy, Doctor, okay? I don’t want to snap anything! Here goes… slowly, slowly…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vankampen, easy now. I see you're guarding a bit there… That's not unexpected. I note some mild tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, specifically L4-L5. There's also some muscle spasm in the lower back. Range of motion is limited, particularly with forward flexion. No obvious neurological deficits noted at this time. Now, can you try to walk on your heels and then your toes for me?
PATIENT: Walking on my heels and toes… okay. This is a little tricky, Doctor. Haven't done this in a while! It's okay, but… it's not easy. Feels a little unsteady. There. Done. Hopefully, I didn’t fall! Is that what you wanted to see?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mr. Vankampen. Your gait appears somewhat stable, but there is some mild weakness in dorsiflexion. It’s subtle, but present. Based on what you've told me and my examination, it sounds like you have a lower back strain, likely aggravated by some underlying arthritis. It's common for people your age. We’ll need some imaging to confirm. I'm going to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine. In the meantime, I recommend some over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen, and gentle stretching. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies to medications, Doctor. None that I know of. Ibuprofen… alright, I can try that. Stretching… gentle stretching, you said? I’m a little worried about making it worse, to be honest. But I’ll try. X-ray… alright. That sounds good. It’s good to know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. So, ibuprofen and gentle stretching… and an X-ray. What happens after the X-ray? Do I come back?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll come back. We’ll review the X-ray results together. If the X-ray confirms arthritis, we can discuss some other options like physical therapy, or potentially some injections. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First, let's get the X-ray done. I’ll write you a referral slip to the imaging center down the street. They take walk-ins, so you shouldn't have to wait too long. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: An X-ray… then maybe physical therapy or injections… Okay, that sounds… like a plan. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just a little worried about all of it, to be honest. But you seem to know what you’re doing, Doctor. So, I’ll trust you. Thank you for listening to me. And for not making me feel like I’m just an old man complaining. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I’ll have the nurse print out some instructions for you regarding the ibuprofen dosage and some gentle stretches. If you experience any worsening pain, or develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, please don’t hesitate to call the office. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. .
