DOCTOR: Hi Odell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Just… travel. I need… something for travel. My wife… she liked to travel. Now I travel. For her. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Travel is important to you, especially now. To make sure I can help you best, could you tell me a little more about what you need for travel?
PATIENT: What do you mean? Like… what kind of things? I don't know… pills? Shots? I just need… what people need when they go places. I go to… Nepal, mostly. And… before, we went to Thailand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nepal and Thailand – good to know. It sounds like you're asking about travel vaccinations and medications to stay healthy while you're abroad. Are you thinking about things like preventing traveler's diarrhea, malaria, or other illnesses common in those areas?
PATIENT: Malaria? Is that… bad? My wife… she took something for that. Little white pills. I think. Everything is… fuzzy now. I just want to be safe. Like she was. I don’t know what diarrhea has to do with anything. Just… safe.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, and it's wonderful that you're thinking ahead to stay safe. Malaria can be very serious, and it's good your wife was taking preventative medication. It sounds like she was prepared, and we want to make sure you are too. To get a better idea of what you might need, could you tell me roughly when you're planning to travel?
PATIENT: Soon. Very soon. Maybe… next month? I don’t have… set dates. Just… when I can get away. It doesn't matter much to me. I just need to… go. Before it gets too cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, next month, before it gets cold. That gives us some time to prepare. Since you're travelling to Nepal and Thailand, and you’re going soon, we should consider a few things. Beyond malaria, there are vaccines we may want to update – like typhoid, hepatitis A, and possibly others. Also, it's good to be prepared for things like traveler’s diarrhea, just in case. To start, have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… hmm. I think… yes? A long time ago. When… before. For work, maybe? I do… airplane stuff. Building things. It was… a requirement, I think. I don’t remember which ones. They just… poked me. I don’t keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, some vaccinations for work, a while ago. That's helpful to know. Since it's been a while, and we don't know exactly what you've had, we might want to do a quick check and update anything that's needed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I know of. I take… nothing usually. Just… sometimes something for my head. When it aches. But that’s… not an allergy. Just… a headache. My wife… she was allergic to… bees, I think. But I am not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies for you, and your wife had a bee allergy. That's good to know. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? I… I get tired, sometimes. And my head hurts. But everyone gets tired, right? And headaches… Nothing… serious. I was… strong. Before. Now… I just do my work. Airplane stuff. It's… quiet work.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional headaches. It's understandable that things feel different now. It’s good to mention these things, even if they seem minor. To help me understand what's going on, and to make sure you’re healthy enough for travel, could I ask a few questions about your health history?
PATIENT: Health… history? Like… what did I eat yesterday? I don’t really… keep track. I eat. I sleep. I work. It’s… simple. Is this… important? For the travel? I just want to go.
DOCTOR: It is important, and I apologize if I'm asking a lot of questions. It helps me make sure you're as healthy and safe as possible during your trip. Perhaps we can approach it this way: have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical problems, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High… what? Diabetes? No. Never. I… I just build things. Airplanes. Quiet things. My wife… she went to the doctor a lot. But I… I was always healthy. I don't get sick. Not usually. Just… tired. And the head. Sometimes. Is this getting us anywhere? I just want the pills. For travel.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've been generally healthy, no previous diagnoses. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the many questions. It's just that travel can sometimes bring unexpected challenges, and I want to be sure we cover all bases. Since you mentioned fatigue and headaches, do you have any family history of medical conditions – things like heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she was old. She died. When I was young. My father… he worked hard. He died… working. I don't… remember much about their health. They just… were. Old. And tired. We didn’t… talk about things like that. Just… lived. Is this… important for the pills? I just want to go to Nepal. For her.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited information about your parents' health. That's alright. To get a better understanding of your current health, and to make sure travel is safe, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? You want to… poke me? I don't… like being poked. I just want the pills. For travel. Can’t you just give me the pills? For Nepal? For her? I… I just want to go.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Odell. I wouldn't poke you unnecessarily. A quick exam – just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic look – will help me make sure you're healthy enough for travel, and to determine the safest medications for you. It will also help me understand your fatigue and headaches. It won’t take long, and it’s important for your safety. We can skip it if you absolutely insist, but I strongly recommend it. Would you be willing to let me take a quick look?
PATIENT: …Fine. But quick. Very quick. And no poking. Just… listening. And… I want to know what the pills do. Before you give them to me. What if they make me… sick? Just quick. And explain the pills. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Very quick, and I'll explain everything beforehand. No unnecessary poking, I promise. I’ll explain each medication, what it does, and any potential side effects. First, let’s just check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, tell me again when you are planning to travel?
PATIENT: Next month, I think. When it gets… colder. I don’t… have a date. I just want to go. Before the snow. For her… she loved the mountains. The pills… what are they for, exactly? What do they do to me?
DOCTOR: Okay, next month, before the snow. Given your travel to Nepal, and a slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend a few things. First, to prevent traveler’s diarrhea, I suggest Loperamide. It helps to slow down your gut if you get sick, reducing the number of trips to the bathroom. It’s generally safe, but can cause constipation if you use too much. Second, to prevent malaria, I recommend Atovaquone-Proguanil. This is taken daily, starting a few days before travel, throughout your trip, and for a week after you return. It can cause nausea in some people, but is generally well-tolerated. Finally, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I suggest bringing a small supply of Amlodipine, a medication to help lower your blood pressure if needed. We won’t start it now, but it’s good to have on hand in case you experience any symptoms like dizziness or headaches. Do those sound alright to you?
PATIENT: …So many pills. Loperamide… for the… gut? What if I just… don't eat anything bad? And Atovaquone… that sounds… complicated. And a pill for the blood pressure… I don’t feel sick. I just… get tired. What if they… don’t work? What if I get… really sick? In Nepal? I just want to go. For her. I don't want to be sick. Can’t I just… take something simple? Just one pill?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Odell. It does sound like a lot, and I’m happy to explain everything in more detail. You’re right, prevention is key, and eating carefully is important. However, even with precautions, traveler’s diarrhea can happen, and it can quickly ruin a trip. Loperamide can help manage the symptoms if it does occur. Atovaquone-Proguanil is very effective at preventing malaria, and while it sounds complicated, it's just one pill taken daily. As for getting sick, that’s always a possibility when travelling, but these medications significantly reduce your risk. And we can discuss strategies for managing any potential symptoms. Perhaps we could start with the Loperamide and Atovaquone-Proguanil. We can hold off on the Amlodipine for now, and you can bring it with you as a precaution. If you develop any symptoms like dizziness or headaches, you can consult a local doctor or call me. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: …Just… tell me what they look like. And what they do. Exactly. No medical words. Just… simple. I want to know what I’m putting in my body. Before I take it. For her. I need to know. Just… explain it. Simply.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with these. The white, small, capsule-shaped pill is the Loperamide. It slows down your gut, like putting on the brakes. If you get a bad stomach and need to go to the bathroom a lot, it helps calm things down and makes it easier to travel. This yellow, oval-shaped pill is the Atovaquone-Proguanil. This one protects you from getting malaria, which is a serious illness spread by mosquitoes. You take it every day, even before you go, and continue taking it while you're there and for a week after you come back. It's like building a shield around your body. We won't start the Amlodipine yet. That's a small, pink pill that helps lower your blood pressure if you feel dizzy or unwell. It's good to have on hand, just in case. Do those explanations make sense?
PATIENT: …Shields and brakes. So, just one of the yellow ones every day? Before, during, and after? And the white one… if my stomach is bad? What if I forget? What if I get… sick despite the shield? Will I… die? I just want to go. For her. But I don't want to be sick. Or… die.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. One yellow pill every day, before, during, and after your trip. It's important to take it consistently to build that shield. And yes, the white one only if your stomach is bad. As for forgetting, that’s a valid concern. Setting an alarm on your phone can help, or you can try associating it with a daily activity, like brushing your teeth. And if you do miss a dose, don’t panic. Just take it as soon as you remember. And as for getting sick despite the shield… it’s unlikely, but not impossible. These medications significantly reduce your risk, but they aren’t foolproof. If you do get sick, it’s important to see a doctor right away. We can discuss strategies for finding a local doctor in Nepal. And you won’t die. I promise. These medications are very safe and effective. If you do get sick, we can provide appropriate treatment. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: …Okay. Alarms. And… local doctors. And… no dying. What about… the mountains? Will the pills work at high altitudes? My wife… she loved the mountains. She got sick once, very high up. I just want to go. For her. But I don't want to get sick like she did. Or… die. Will the pills protect me from the mountains too?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Odell. The pills themselves won’t directly protect you from altitude sickness. Altitude sickness is caused by the lower oxygen levels at high altitudes, and it's different from getting sick with a virus or bacteria. However, it’s important to ascend gradually to allow your body to acclimatize to the altitude. And staying well-hydrated is crucial. If you experience symptoms like headache, nausea, or fatigue, it’s important to descend to a lower altitude right away. The pills can help keep you healthy overall, which can make you more resilient to the challenges of high altitude. But they aren't a substitute for proper acclimatization and hydration. We can discuss strategies for preventing altitude sickness, such as avoiding strenuous activity at high altitudes and taking breaks to rest. We can also talk about recognizing the symptoms and knowing when to seek medical attention. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: …Acclimatize. And… hydrate. My wife… she didn't acclimatize. She went too high, too fast. She… got very sick. I had to… carry her down. I don’t want to carry anyone. I just want to go. For her. But I don’t want to get sick. Or… carry anyone. Just… the pills. How many do I take? And when? Just… tell me simply.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’m so sorry to hear about that experience. It's completely understandable that you're worried about getting sick. Okay, let’s focus on the pills. You'll take one yellow pill every day. Start taking it one day before you travel, continue taking it every day during your trip, and continue for one week after you return. Take it with food to help with absorption. And remember, ascend gradually, stay well-hydrated, and listen to your body. If you experience any symptoms of altitude sickness, descend to a lower altitude right away. I’m also going to write down a list of instructions for you, including information about the pills, strategies for preventing altitude sickness, and contact information for local doctors in Nepal. And I’m happy to answer any further questions you may have. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: …A list. Yes. A list is good. With the pills. And the… mountains. And doctors. What if… I forget the list? What if I lose it? I just want to go. For her. But I don't want to forget. Or lose anything. Can you… put it on my phone? Can you put the pills, the mountains, and the doctors… on my phone?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can definitely put the list on your phone. I’m also going to add a reminder to take the yellow pill every day. I can also save the contact information for local doctors in Nepal to your contacts, and add a link to a website with information about altitude sickness. And don’t worry about forgetting or losing anything. We can review the instructions one more time before you leave, and I’m happy to answer any further questions you may have. Here you go. Now you have all the information you need right at your fingertips. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: …Yes. Better. Pills, mountains, doctors… it's all there. Thank you. For… everything. For the list. For the pills. For… not letting me forget. I just want to go. For her. I think… that’s all. For now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Odell. I'm happy I could help. It sounds like you're well-prepared for your trip. Remember, if you experience any concerns while travelling, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. And enjoy your trip. I hope you have a wonderful time, and I send my best to your wife. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. I think… I’m ready now. To go. For her. Thank you again. For everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Odell. Have a safe and meaningful trip. And if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to reach out.
