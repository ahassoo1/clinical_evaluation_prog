DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet ye too. Well, it's this nausea, see? Been happenin' most mornings now. It's not a terrible thing, mind ye, but it's enough to ruin a good cup o' tea, and it's worryin' me a wee bit, given me heart... they said it wasn't gettin' any stronger.
DOCTOR: I see. Nausea, primarily in the mornings, and you're understandably concerned given your heart condition. To clarify, when you say your heart condition, could you elaborate on what was discussed with you previously?
PATIENT: Aye, right ye are. It was... let's see, it was Dr. MacLeod who told me, a few years back now. Said I had somethin' called... congestive heart failure. Or somethin' like that. It means it doesn't pump as well as it should, and I hold onto a bit o' water. He put me on some tablets for it, to get rid o' the water, and told me to watch me salt intake. I've been takin' them regular as clockwork, but... well, this nausea's got me wonderin' if somethin's changed. I can tell ye exactly what they are, if ye'd like - I keep a list.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Benic, thank you. Knowing the specific medication is indeed useful. Yes, please, if you could share the names of the medications you’re taking, that would be excellent. And to return to the nausea, could you describe it in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem at all. Let's see... I've got Furosemide, 40 milligrams every mornin', and Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, also every mornin'. And then there's Digoxin, 0.125 milligrams, once a day. As for the nausea... it's not like a proper sick feelin', ye ken? It's more of a queasiness, right in me stomach. It builds slowly, usually after I've had a few sips o' tea, and it lasts for... maybe an hour, hour and a half? It doesn't usually come with anythin' else, mind ye – no dizziness, no actual vomitin', just a general unwellness. It's enough to take me appetite away for a bit, that's for sure. And it is mostly in the mornin', but I had a bit o' it after lunch yesterday, so that's what’s got me worried.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed information, Mr. Benic. That's very helpful. Furosemide, Lisinopril, and Digoxin. And the description of the nausea – a gradual queasiness, primarily in the morning, but with an episode yesterday after lunch. Do you notice any specific foods or drinks that seem to worsen or improve the nausea, besides the tea?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I hadn't really paid that much attention, to be honest. Now that ye mention it... it seems to be worse if I have somethin' heavy for breakfast, like a full Scottish breakfast, ye ken? Bacon, eggs, sausage, all that. But toast and a bit o' jam seems to be alright, most days. As for makin' it better... not really, no. A bit o' fresh air sometimes helps, but that might just be me gettin' away from the smell o' the kitchen. I usually just try to ride it out, drink a bit o' water, and hope it passes.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a heavier breakfast seems to exacerbate it, and lighter fare is better tolerated. And fresh air provides some relief, perhaps due to olfactory stimulation. Now, let's move on to some general questions. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Aye, I have, actually. I weigh myself every week, religiously. It's part o' keepin' an eye on the water retention, see? I’ve put on about 3 pounds in the last couple o' weeks. Not a huge amount, but enough to notice. It's usually around me ankles and feet, mostly. I've been tryin' to cut down on me salt, like Dr. MacLeod said, but it's not always easy, I'll admit. A wee bit o' salt makes everything taste so much better.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Benic. It’s good that you are monitoring your weight. A 3-pound increase over two weeks, with swelling in the ankles and feet, is a relevant detail. We will need to consider that in relation to your heart failure. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath recently, or any increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it... I have been feelin' a bit more tired than usual. Not like exhausted, mind ye, but just... worn out quicker. I used to be able to walk a good mile to the shops without any bother, but lately I've been findin' it a bit of a struggle. I've been havin' to stop and rest a couple o' times. And... I've been a bit more breathless, too. Not at rest, but when I'm walkin' uphill, or climbin' the stairs. It’s not terrible, but it's definitely more than it used to be. I thought it was just age, to be honest. I am 63, after all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion are important symptoms, Mr. Benic. While age can certainly contribute, these could also be related to your heart failure. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles for swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've nothin' to hide, and I trust yer judgement. I've been gettin' checked over for years, so I'm used to it. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin'. I'll sit here nice and still.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart with the stethoscope. Okay. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a faint murmur. Your lungs have some mild crackles at the bases, bilaterally, which is consistent with some fluid retention. And as you mentioned, there is some swelling in your ankles. I'm noting 2+ pitting edema on both sides. Based on your history and this examination, it appears your heart failure may be somewhat decompensated. The nausea could be related to several factors, including medication side effects, fluid retention, or reduced blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract. However, it is important to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Decompensated? That sounds… serious. I'm not a doctor, ye ken, so I don't know what all that means. Is that somethin' I need to be worried about? And fluid retention… is that the same as the swellin' in me ankles? And ye say the nausea could be a side effect o' the tablets? I’ve been takin’ them for years, so why now? I’m a wee bit flustered, to be honest. What do ye think we should do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic, and I apologize if I used medical terminology that was unclear. "Decompensated" simply means your heart is having more difficulty pumping blood effectively, leading to a buildup of fluid in your body. That’s what the swelling in your ankles represents – fluid retention. The nausea could be a side effect of the Digoxin, Furosemide or Lisinopril, but it’s not uncommon for side effects to develop or worsen over time, even with medications you’ve been taking for years. Changes in kidney function, other medications, or even diet can contribute. Given your symptoms – the nausea, weight gain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and examination findings – I want to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your kidney function, electrolyte levels , and a Digoxin level to ensure it’s within the therapeutic range. We'll also check your BNP, which is a marker of heart failure. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests are nothin' to be afraid of. I'll happily get them done if it helps figure out what's goin' on. I just want to get back to feelin' myself again, and enjoyin' a cup o' tea in peace. When do we need to get them done? And will ye explain the results to me when they come back? I trust yer judgement, but I like to understand what's happenin' in me body, if ye don't mind.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Benic. I'm glad you're agreeable to the tests. We can get those drawn today at the lab just down the hall. They should only take a few minutes. And absolutely, I will explain the results to you in detail when they come back. I want you to be fully informed and understand what's happening. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. In the meantime, I recommend you continue taking your medications as prescribed, and try to limit your salt intake as much as possible. Also, I’d advise you to monitor your weight daily and let me know if you notice any further increases. If your shortness of breath worsens significantly, or you develop chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think ye’ve covered everything, Doctor. That all makes sense. Limit the salt, keep an eye on me weight, and call if things get worse. Aye, I can do that. Thank ye for takin’ the time to listen to me, and for explainin' things so clearly. It puts me mind at ease, knowin’ ye’re on the case. I'll go down to the lab now and get them tests done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. I'll be in touch once the results are available. Take care, and have a good day. .
