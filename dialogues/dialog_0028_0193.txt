DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Goodstein. So, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Memmolo. It is… a little embarrassing, to be honest. I have been… passing a lot of gas. More than usual. It started, I think, maybe a week ago? It’s not painful, just… frequent. And sometimes… loud. I am hoping you can help me understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Frequent flatulence, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Frequent. It is… disruptive. I work at the burger place, you see, and it is… not good to have this happen while taking orders. It makes me a little nervous, to be truthful. I eat normal things, I think. Nothing too strange.
DOCTOR: A burger place, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. “Burger Bliss.” It is… a fast food restaurant. Many fries, many burgers. I mostly take the money at the counter. It is… not a fancy place. But it pays the bills. Do you think… the food there could be causing this? I have not changed what I eat otherwise.
DOCTOR: Well, a fast food restaurant… hardly a bastion of digestive health, is it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not, Doctor. But it is where I work. And I do enjoy a burger sometimes, if I may say so. Is there something… something in the food that is commonly a problem? Or is it perhaps something else entirely? I am really not sure what to think.
DOCTOR: Let's not dwell on the culinary choices, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. I just thought… perhaps it was a starting point. What would you like me to tell you about? My diet besides the burgers? Any other… habits? I do drink a lot of water, if that is helpful. And I try to walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Let’s get down to business. Have you experienced any abdominal pain with this… increased gas?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly… pain. It is more of a… discomfort, sometimes. A little bloating, mostly. And a rumbling. But not sharp pain, no. It is… manageable. It does not keep me up at night or anything. Just… annoying. Is that helpful, Doctor? I am trying to be as precise as possible.
DOCTOR: And any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes… yes. Perhaps a little more frequent, if I am honest. And… looser. Not diarrhea, exactly. Just… not as firm as usual. It started around the same time as the gas, I think. It is… unpleasant to discuss, but I want to give you all the information.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We’re getting somewhere. Any nausea, vomiting, or fever?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of those. No nausea, no vomiting, no fever at all. I feel… otherwise healthy. Just this gas and the… changes. It’s just… worrying me, because it is new. And I do not like things to be… different. It makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Any family history of… digestive issues?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she sometimes complained of… stomach upset. But nothing serious, I think. Just… indigestion, mostly. And my grandfather… he had trouble with his… bowels, when he was older. But I do not know the specifics. It was a long time ago, and we did not talk about such things much. I am not sure if that is helpful, Doctor. It was… not a very open family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your medications or diet besides the burger place?
PATIENT: Medications? No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I only take a vitamin, sometimes. A multivitamin, for general health. And… no other changes in my diet. I eat mostly the same things I always have. Except, of course, when I am at work. Just the burgers and fries. I have not tried any new foods, or anything like that. I promise. Is it possible it is… stress, perhaps? I do worry about things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Stress. Always stress. Alright. Let me have a listen. Lie back, please.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you need. I hope it is not too… embarrassing. I am a little nervous, to be honest. It is not often I am in this position. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Normal bowel sounds...slightly hyperactive, but not alarming. No tenderness to palpation. Bloating is present, as you mentioned. No masses palpated. It sounds like you likely have some mild Irritable Bowel Syndrome, possibly exacerbated by your… dietary choices at work.
PATIENT: Irritable… what, Doctor? And exacerbated… does that mean… the burgers are making it worse? Is it… serious? Will I need… tests? I am a little frightened, to be honest. I just want to feel normal again. And can I still eat at Burger Bliss? It is my job, you see.
DOCTOR: Irritable Bowel Syndrome. It's very common. A bit of a sensitive stomach. And yes, the… fast food is likely contributing. Not serious, no. But certainly unpleasant. We can try a low-FODMAP diet. I’ll print out some information for you. As for Burger Bliss… moderation is key. And perhaps some over-the-counter gas relief medication. This should help. Follow the diet guidelines, and see if it improves your symptoms. If not, come back and we'll consider further investigation. But I suspect it's just a bit of digestive upset.
PATIENT: Low… FODMAP? I have never heard of that. And moderation… that will be difficult, you see. It is hard to resist a good burger. But I will try, Doctor. I promise. Thank you for… explaining everything. And for not… laughing at me. Is there anything else I should know? Or any foods I should absolutely avoid? It is a little overwhelming, to be honest. I just hope I can still… function.
DOCTOR: The handout lists common trigger foods. Generally, avoid excessive onions, garlic, dairy, and high-fructose corn syrup. Limit carbonated beverages. And, frankly, try to reduce your intake of… fried food. If your symptoms persist despite these changes, we'll consider a stool sample to rule out any underlying infection. But I'm fairly certain it's just IBS. Any further questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all, Doctor. No more questions. Thank you for your time. And for your… patience. I will try my best to follow the diet. And I will… limit the fried food. It is just… difficult. But I appreciate your help. Thank you again. Good day, Doctor Memmolo.
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day. .
