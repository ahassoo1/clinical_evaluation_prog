DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to you too, Dr. Soodeen. Well, it's this nausea, see? Been happening most mornings now for... oh, maybe a couple of weeks, I’d say. It's not terrible, but it’s enough to ruin a good breakfast, and you know a man needs his breakfast! The doctor told me a while back about my heart… something not working right. I think this might be connected to that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. Nausea for about two weeks, worse in the mornings, and you're concerned it might be related to your heart condition. I understand. Just to clarify, can you describe the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, you've got it right. Describe it… well, it's not like a proper sickness, if you know what I mean. Not like food poisoning or anything. It’s more of a queasy feeling, right in my stomach. Like I've had too much to eat, even though I haven't. And it just… builds until I need to sit down for a bit. No… nothing actually comes up, thankfully. It just makes me feel awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasy feeling, not associated with vomiting, and it seems to build. And you said it's worse in the mornings?
PATIENT: Aye, mostly mornings. Sometimes it'll linger a bit into the early afternoon, but it's always worst when I first wake up. Before I've had anything to eat, usually. Although, even the thought of food sometimes makes it worse, which is a right bother, to be honest. I used to love a good fried breakfast… but now, not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nausea predominantly in the mornings, worsened before eating, and even the thought of food can exacerbate it. Have you noticed anything else associated with the nausea?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not exhausted, mind you, just… a bit more sluggish. And sometimes my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day, but I’ve always put that down to the weather. We had a lot of rain last week. Oh, and I've been a wee bit short of breath going up the stairs, but I thought that was just getting old, if you catch my drift!
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath with exertion. Let’s talk about your heart condition for a moment. Do you recall what was diagnosed, and are you currently taking any medications for it?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it was a few years back now. Dr. MacIntyre, a good man, he told me it was… congestive heart failure, I think that was it. Something about the heart not pumpin' as strong as it should. I am taking medication, yes. A couple of white pills in the morning, and a wee pink one at night. I can’t rightly recall the names of them, I'm terrible with names, both people and pills! I keep them in a little pill box, though, so I don’t mix them up.
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure, and you’re taking two white pills in the morning and a pink one at night. Do you have the pill bottles with you today, or could you bring them to your next appointment?
PATIENT: No, I didn't bring them with me today, no. I just came as I was, to be honest. I can certainly bring them to my next appointment, though, aye. No trouble at all. I usually keep them at home, in the kitchen cupboard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your history of congestive heart failure and the symptoms you’re describing – nausea, fatigue, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath – it’s possible the nausea is related. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Aye, sounds sensible enough to me. Rule things out, that's a good plan. Alright then, I’ll get up on that table for you. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Deep breaths, please. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and some mild crackling sounds in your lungs, particularly on the lower right side. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or swelling. Let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Aye, deep breaths… easy enough. Crackling sounds, you say? Not good, is it? Ooh, a wee bit tender there, aye. Right around… here. Not sharp pain, mind you, more like a dull ache. It comes and goes, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache in the lower right abdomen. That could be a number of things. Now, I’m going to check your ankles for edema, or swelling. Could you point to where you've noticed the swelling before?
PATIENT: Aye, it's usually around here. Mostly on the insides, like. Not terribly bad, mind you, but noticeable, especially at the end of the day. Like I said, I usually just put it down to the weather, but maybe you're right, maybe it is something else.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do see some swelling, as you mentioned. Given your symptoms – the nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath, irregular heart rhythm, crackling in your lungs, and edema – I suspect your heart failure may be worsening. However, the abdominal pain warrants further investigation, as it could be unrelated. I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. We'll need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a BNP level , and a chest X-ray. Given the abdominal pain, I'd also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, which is sometimes used in CT scans?
PATIENT: Aye, contrast dye, you say? Hmm… Let me think. I don’t think so, no. I’ve had a few scans in the past, a few years back, and I don't recall any trouble with them. But I haven’t had one in a good while now. It's just… I can't rightly remember. It was Dr. MacIntyre who did them, back then. Is it something I should be particularly worried about?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking. There's always a small risk of an allergic reaction to contrast dye, but it's usually mild. We'll have you sign a consent form acknowledging the risks, and we'll have emergency medication on hand just in case. The important thing is to let the radiology technician know if you experience any itching, rash, or difficulty breathing during the scan. Okay. Let's proceed with the blood work, chest X-ray, and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. I’ll write the orders now. After the results are back, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… sensible. A wee bit worrying, maybe, but sensible. Just… how long will it be before I get the results back? And… will I need to change anything with my medication while we're waiting? Should I still take my white pills and my pink one as usual?
DOCTOR: Good questions, Mr. Benic. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back, depending on the lab. In the meantime, please continue taking your medications as you normally would – both the white pills and the pink one. Do not change anything unless I specifically tell you to. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased shortness of breath, chest pain, significant swelling in your ankles, or any new symptoms – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now, Dr. Soodeen. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me and explain things so clearly. I feel a bit better knowing we're gettin' it checked out. I’ll just keep takin’ my pills and keep an eye on things, like you said. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if anything worsens, please go to the emergency room. Here's the order for your tests. The receptionist will help schedule them for you. Have a good day, and take care.
