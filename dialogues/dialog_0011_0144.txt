DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Neppl, is it? Yes, well... Honestly? Curiosity, mostly. My daughter, bless her heart, she worries something fierce. Said I should get a check-up, just to be sure. I feel alright, you know? A little creaky, maybe, but what 64-year-old doesn't creak? I just... wanted to see what all the fuss was about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Calvery. It's always wise to be proactive about your health, and it's good of you to come in, even if it's primarily at your daughter's suggestion. We can certainly do a thorough check-up to address her concerns and ensure everything is as it should be. To start, could you tell me a bit more about this “creakiness”?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a bad creak, Doctor. More like... well, when I stand up, sometimes my knees pop. And my back… sometimes aches after I’ve been gardening for too long. I do love my garden, you see. Roses, mostly. But it’s not debilitating, not at all. I just take things slow. Though, honestly, I can’t remember the last time I really did anything fast. Is that what you mean? It’s just…old age, I presume.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that, Ms. Calvery. It's helpful to understand the nature of your discomfort. While it may indeed be a normal part of aging, we should still investigate to rule out any underlying issues. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain in your back a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Oh, dear. That's a tricky one. It's not... sharp. More of a dull ache, really. Like a weight. And it tends to be worse in the evening, after I've been on my feet all day. Sometimes it radiates down my leg a little, but not always. It's just… uncomfortable. Honestly, I’ve had it for so long, I barely notice it anymore. But my daughter… she makes such a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache that radiates down the leg, worse in the evening after being on your feet… that gives me a little more information to work with. It sounds like it could be related to some lower back strain or perhaps some mild arthritis, but we'll need to do a more thorough examination to be certain. Before we move on to the physical exam, let me ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this back and knee discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. Well, I get a little tired, I suppose. But who doesn’t at my age? And my hands… they ache sometimes, especially in the cold. I thought it was just the weather. Oh, and I’ve been a bit… forgetful lately. But that's nothing new, really. Always misplacing my glasses, things like that. I don’t think that's connected, though. Just…old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of that with me, Ms. Calvery. It’s important to consider all potential symptoms. Fatigue, hand aches, and some forgetfulness – those are all things we should take into account. While they may be related to aging, it’s important to rule out any other possible causes. Now, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Oh, dear. That’s… a bit of a blur, to be honest. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a child, silly thing, climbing a tree. But other than that… nothing much, I don’t think. I’ve always been quite healthy, really. I didn’t go to the doctor much, unless I absolutely had to. I didn’t like all the poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Calvery. Gallbladder removal and a childhood broken wrist – I’ll make a note of those. It's helpful to hear you've generally been healthy. Have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing comes to mind. My daughter handles all the paperwork, you see. She’s very organized. I just… show up. I’m sure if there was anything, she would have told me. She worries about everything. It’s sweet, really, but sometimes… exhausting.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like your daughter is very involved in your healthcare, which is wonderful. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that's a tricky one. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. And my father… he was always very thin, didn't eat much. But other than that… not that I recall. My family… we didn't really talk about these things much. It wasn’t really the custom, you see. We just… dealt with things as they came.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Calvery. It's common for families not to discuss medical history openly. A history of heart problems in your mother is good to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, dear. What does that even mean? I… I live alone now. My husband passed away a few years ago. It was a long time ago, but I still miss him terribly. I used to be very active, but now… I mostly stay home and garden. I have a few friends, we have tea sometimes. And my daughter visits every week. That’s about it, really. A quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Calvery. I’m very sorry for your loss. It sounds like you have a good support system with your daughter and friends, despite the quiet life. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never! Not a drop of alcohol, and certainly no… recreational drugs. My husband always said those things were bad for you, and I always listened to him. I used to smoke when I was young, silly thing, but I gave it up years ago. Best thing I ever did.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Calvery. It’s good to hear you don’t smoke or drink. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Though, my skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the roses. I garden a lot, you see. Lots of thorns.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I try to avoid those things as much as possible. My daughter brought me some vitamins once, a multivitamin, but I didn’t like them. They tasted awful. I just try to eat healthy, you see. Lots of vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. Thank you, Ms. Calvery, that was very helpful. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, alright, I suppose. If you think it's necessary. But please, be gentle. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know? And don’t poke too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints and back. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 88. We'll keep an eye on that. Your pulse and temperature are normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, although I do hear a very faint murmur. It's not necessarily a cause for concern, but we'll want to monitor it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to check your joints and back. Can you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh… stand up? Oh, dear. It creaks a bit. There we go. Carefully, carefully… Don't want to fall. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. I’m gently feeling your spine and knees. I do notice some tenderness in your lower back and some limited range of motion in both knees. When I bend forward, you express some discomfort. Please, have a seat. Based on what I've observed, it appears you have some mild lower back strain and some possible early signs of osteoarthritis in your knees. However, to get a more accurate diagnosis, I would like to order some X-rays of your lower back and knees. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays? Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? I don’t know, Doctor. Are they necessary? My daughter always says I should get all sorts of tests, but I always try to avoid them if I can. It’s just… a bit of creakiness, you know? Is it really that serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Calvery. You’re right, it may just be “a bit of creakiness.” However, X-rays will allow us to rule out any underlying structural issues, such as fractures or significant arthritis, and will provide a clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s a relatively painless procedure, and the information it provides will help us determine the best course of action. We can start with X-rays of your knees. If those don’t reveal anything concerning, we can decide whether or not to proceed with X-rays of your lower back. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Well… just the knees, then. If you absolutely think it's necessary. But promise me, Doctor, no surprises. I don't want to hear anything awful. And please, be quick about it. I don't like being in hospitals.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I promise, I’ll do my best to be as quick and gentle as possible. And I assure you, I will explain the results to you in detail and answer any questions you may have. We'll take things one step at a time. I’ll have my assistant schedule the X-rays for you. They’ll give you instructions on how to prepare. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to take things slow and avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. I’m going to prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help with the discomfort. It’s available over-the-counter, so you shouldn’t need a prescription. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An anti-inflammatory… that sounds sensible. Anything to ease the ache a bit. And yes, let’s just get those X-rays done, and then… hopefully, I can get back to my garden. Roses are blooming, you know. Can’t miss those.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We want to get you back to your roses as soon as possible. I've noted your preference for avoiding further testing if the knee X-rays are unremarkable. I’m also documenting your concerns about the pain affecting your gardening. I’ll have my assistant schedule the X-rays and provide you with a copy of this visit summary, including the recommendations for the anti-inflammatory medication. She’ll also explain how to access your results online. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. Just… try not to find anything too dreadful in those X-rays, alright? And thank you for listening to an old woman’s aches and pains.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Calvery. And I assure you, we'll approach this cautiously and address any concerns you may have. We’ll take things one step at a time. My assistant will be in shortly to schedule your X-rays and answer any administrative questions. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and I hope you enjoy your roses.
