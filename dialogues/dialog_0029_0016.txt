DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about my bruising, really. I’ve been… noticing more of it lately. It’s just… concerning, given I'm on that blood thinner. You know, to prevent clots. It's not like I’m falling all over myself or anything, just… little bumps turn into these big, ugly marks. It’s probably nothing, but my wife – God rest her soul – always said to get these things checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising easily when you’re on a blood thinner is something we need to look into. It's good you're being proactive, and it's always wise to listen to your spouse’s concerns. Let's start with the history of this. When did you first notice this increase in bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly, it’s been… gradual. Maybe a couple of months now? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. I suppose it started with just a little more discoloration than usual after a shave, and then… well, then I noticed it when I bumped into the coffee table a few weeks back. It stayed around much longer than it should. I just thought I was being clumsy, to be perfectly frank. It's not like I'm a young man anymore, you know? Things take longer to heal.
DOCTOR: Right, that makes sense. A few months of gradual change is helpful to know. And you're right, healing does slow down as we get older. Now, besides the bruising from shaving and bumping into things, have you noticed any bruising without any known injury at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I haven't woken up covered in them or anything. It's always something. A little knock, a pinch… that sort of thing. Nothing spontaneous, if that’s what you mean. Though, now that you mention it, my arms do feel a bit… achy sometimes. But I figured that was just the… the weather. We’ve had some strange humidity lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bruising with minor trauma and some achiness. The achiness is good to know, even if you attribute it to the weather. We'll investigate that a bit further. Now, let's talk about your medication. What blood thinner are you currently taking, and what’s the dosage?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the pills. It’s… Warfarin, I believe. And the dosage… let me see, I have it written down here somewhere. Yes, here it is. 5 milligrams, once a day. Every evening. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness, nearly seven years now, since that little atrial fibrillation scare. Doctor Ramirez put me on it. A very good man, but he retired, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, 5 milligrams of Warfarin daily for seven years, prescribed by Dr. Ramirez. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any changes to your other medications recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. Just the usual. My blood pressure pill – Lisinopril, I think it’s called – and a little something for my cholesterol. But those have been the same for ages. I did start taking a Vitamin D supplement a few months back, the pharmacist recommended it, said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. Is that important? It's just an over-the-counter thing, nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes to your blood pressure or cholesterol medication, but you did start a Vitamin D supplement a few months ago. That is good to know, as Vitamin D can interact with Warfarin. Now, let's quickly go over some other things. Do you have any bleeding problems in your family?
PATIENT: Bleeding problems… Not that I'm aware of, no. My mother… she bruised easily, but she was a very frail woman. Always falling. We just put it down to old age, really. And my father… he was a robust, healthy man. Never a sick day in his life, as far as I recall. No hemophilia or anything like that. My wife’s side… I don’t really know, to be honest. We didn’t discuss medical history much with her family. A bit… private, they were.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of bleeding disorders. Good. And finally, just to be thorough, have you noticed any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms… Well, I’ve been a bit… tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. I just figured it was the heat. And… now that you mention it, my gums bleed a little when I brush my teeth. It's nothing dramatic, just a spot of blood on the brush. Again, I just put it down to getting older. You know, things wear out. But… I suppose it’s probably worth mentioning, isn’t it? Everything seems to point back to this blood thinner, doesn’t it? It’s probably just a bit too strong, or… something.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some minor gum bleeding. Yes, those are definitely things we need to consider, especially given you're on Warfarin. Alright, Mr. Farson, I think I have a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure and pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at the bruising on your arms. We'll also take a look at your gums. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. My wife always said it was best to leave these things to the professionals. Just let me know if anything seems… concerning. I do get a bit anxious, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at those bruises. I see several bruises here, as you mentioned. Some are newer, some appear older. They're distributed on both arms, and there doesn't seem to be any specific pattern. They feel…soft. Now, let me take a look at your gums. Your gums are a little inflamed, and there's some bleeding when I gently probe them. Nothing dramatic, but it's present. Alright, Mr. Farson. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about the potential for excessive anticoagulation with your Warfarin. The bruising, fatigue, and gum bleeding are all suggestive of that. We need to get a blood test to check your INR – that's the measurement of how quickly your blood is clotting. We’ll also check a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues. Do you have any known allergies to blood draws?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies to blood draws that I'm aware of. I've had plenty over the years, unfortunately. Always a bit of a pinprick, but nothing serious. So, an INR test, you say? Is that going to involve a lot of blood? I do get a bit… faint, sometimes. And is this something serious? You're starting to worry me a bit, now. Perhaps I should have just stayed home and rested. This blood thinner… it just seems to be causing more problems than it's worth.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions, Mr. Farson. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious in these situations. The INR test is a standard blood draw – just a few vials of blood, no more than usual. We'll send it to the lab right away, and the results should be back within a couple of hours. The reason I'm ordering the test is to ensure your Warfarin dose is correct. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to be proactive to prevent any complications, such as excessive bleeding. It's possible your dose is simply too high, or there could be other factors interfering with the medication. That’s why we need to check the INR. We’ll also rule out other causes for your symptoms. I'm going to order the lab tests now. Then, based on the results, we’ll discuss whether we need to adjust your Warfarin dose or investigate further. We’ll take it one step at a time. Okay, the lab order is sent. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… try not to draw too much blood, if you could. And perhaps a biscuit afterwards? I do get a bit… shaky, you know. It's silly, I know, but my wife always gave me a biscuit after these things. A digestive, usually. It settled my stomach. But a plain one would do, I suppose. Just… try not to make a fuss, alright? I don’t want to bother anyone. It’s probably just my age. Everything is a bit more difficult these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I'll make a note to let the phlebotomist know to be gentle, and I'll see if we can get you a biscuit afterwards. A plain one sounds perfect. And don’t worry about bothering anyone; we're here to take care of you. It’s not silly at all to feel anxious or shaky during a blood draw, and it’s perfectly normal to have preferences for how you like to be treated. I'll step out for a moment while you get the blood draw done, and I'll be back as soon as it's finished to discuss the results. Is there anything else I can get for you before I go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you for being so patient with me. It's just… difficult, getting older. Everything feels… fragile. Just… please let me know if anything is seriously wrong, alright? Don’t sugarcoat it. I'd rather know the truth, no matter how unpleasant. My wife… she always said I was a bit of a worrier. But it's just… hard, without her. But you take care of your patients, and I trust your judgment. Go ahead, then. I’ll be here. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long, alright? The anticipation is the worst part, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I understand. I will be as prompt as possible, and I promise to be honest with you about the results, no matter what they are. I’ll explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. And please, don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you feel unwell at any point. I’ll be right outside.
