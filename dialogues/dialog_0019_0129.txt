DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, why don’t you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day to sit here and explain things. It’s my stool. It’s black. Like tar, nearly. And I take these pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. That’s all there is to it, really. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, black stool… and you’ve been taking pain pills for your arthritis for some time now, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, some time. Since before you were probably even born. They help, but everything has a downside, doesn't it? And now this… the blackness. It started a few days ago, I suppose. Not thrilled about it, obviously. It’s not a pleasant sight, let me tell you. Are we getting somewhere, or are we just going in circles here?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Dawnetta. It’s good you’re noticing these changes and bringing them to my attention. Black, tarry stools can be a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract, and it’s important we investigate that. The pain pills can sometimes contribute to stomach upset, and that's certainly something we’ll consider. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about the stool?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Oh, for heaven’s sake. I haven’t felt anything. No pain, no cramping, nothing. Just…dark stool. And you’re asking me about the details of my stool? Really? It's black, it's sticky, it smells…like stool! What more do you need to know? This is ridiculous. I came here for a quick answer, not a…stool examination. Honestly, the younger generation...
DOCTOR: You're right to be frustrated, Dawnetta, and I apologize if my questions seem…detailed. It’s not about being difficult, it’s just that the consistency of the black stool is important. Is it consistently black and tarry, or has it varied at all?
PATIENT: Varied? How would I know how black it is, precisely? It’s black! Look, I’m not a scientist. I go to the bathroom, I see black, I think something’s wrong, so I came here. It’s been mostly black the last few days, maybe a little less black yesterday, but I couldn’t swear to it. I haven’t been staring at it, if that’s what you’re asking. Are you going to give me a test, or what? Because frankly, I'd like to get this over with. My husband is waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly black the last few days, slightly less yesterday. That's helpful. And yes, we'll need to do a couple of things to get a better understanding. I’d like to check your abdomen, just a quick examination, and then I’d like to order a stool test – a fecal occult blood test – to see if there's any blood present that we can't see with the naked eye. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A test? Of course, a test. Everything is a test these days. Fine. Just get it over with. I don't want to lie here all afternoon. And please, be gentle. My skin is rather sensitive, you know. And don't ask me to describe the stool again. Really. Just do it, and let’s be done with this. My husband doesn’t like waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll just listen to your abdomen and then feel it gently. It shouldn’t take long. Everything seems soft, no obvious tenderness when I press here, here, or here. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No. Not particularly. It's… well, it's a little uncomfortable, naturally, being poked and prodded. But not painful. Honestly, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It’s just old age, probably. Everything starts to ache eventually. I’ve had a long life, you know. A very long life. And this poking around isn’t making it any better. Can we please just get to the test now? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. And you’re right, let’s get you set up for that stool test. I'll have the nurse bring you a collection kit and explain how to collect the sample. It just involves a small collection cup. The instructions will be very clear. We'll send it to the lab, and it should take a few days to get the results. While we’re waiting for the results, I'd also like to ask about your medications. Could you tell me what medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. More questions? The only medication I take regularly is the pain pills, like I told you before. For my arthritis. The ones the doctor prescribed years ago. I can’t remember the name right now, it's one of those long ones. And sometimes I take something for my blood pressure, but that's only when it’s high. My daughter handles all the refills, so I don’t bother with the details. Do you need me to call her? Honestly, this is ridiculous. A stool test and now a medication history? It’s just… too much. Can we just write down “pain pills” and be done with it? I’m getting a headache.
DOCTOR: "Pain pills" is a good start, Dawnetta. We can note that you’re unsure of the specific name. Knowing generally what we’re looking at helps. And it’s okay that your daughter manages refills; that’s very common. Now, while we wait for the test results, is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I've told you everything I'm going to tell you. I want the results of this test, and I want them quickly. And then I want to go home. I’m tired of sitting here answering endless questions and being poked and prodded. My husband is probably worried sick. Just…get the nurse, please. Let’s get this over with. And thank you for nothing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. I’ll have the nurse come in right away to explain the stool test collection process. And we’ll get the results to you as quickly as possible. If you experience any significant abdominal pain, notice any vomiting, or feel particularly weak, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room.
