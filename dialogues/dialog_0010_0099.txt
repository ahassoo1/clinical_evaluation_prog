DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received the results from the gastrointestinal endoscopy test, and they indicated something wasn’t quite right. My regular physician suggested I come in for a more thorough discussion. I must confess, I’m a bit anxious about it, as I don’t fully understand the findings myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Denis. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way when you’re dealing with medical results you don't fully comprehend. I'm happy to go over them with you in detail. Let me just pull up your endoscopy report here… Okay, I see it. It does indicate some findings that warrant further discussion. To start, can you tell me if your regular physician explained anything specific about what the report said?
PATIENT: No, he didn’t, Doctor. He simply handed me the paperwork and recommended I schedule an appointment with you. He mentioned it was…an abnormality, but didn’t elaborate on where or what kind of abnormality. He’s a very busy man, you see. I appreciate him sending me your way, though. I'm hoping you can explain it in a way I can understand. It's… difficult for me to grasp these things without a proper explanation.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Busy doctors sometimes don’t have the time to go into the depth that’s needed. That's what I'm here for. Okay, the report indicates a polyp was found in your colon during the endoscopy. Specifically, it says “adenomatous polyp, approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, located in the descending colon.” Have you ever had a polyp removed before, Denis?
PATIENT: A polyp? No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve had routine check-ups, of course, and various tests over the years, but nothing about a polyp being removed. What exactly is a polyp? And…is it something serious? My apologies for all the questions, I just… I prefer to be fully informed. Is 1.5 centimeters…large?
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Denis. It’s very good that you’re asking questions. That’s the best way to approach this. A polyp is essentially an abnormal growth of tissue in the lining of the colon. They’re fairly common, especially as we get older. Most are benign – meaning not cancerous – but some, like the one found in your colon, have the potential to become cancerous over time. That’s why it’s important to remove them and get them analyzed. 1.5 centimeters is… moderate in size. It’s not enormous, but it’s large enough to warrant removal and further investigation. The report also mentions it was a “tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.” That refers to the type of polyp it was, and the “dysplasia” indicates some abnormal cells were present, hence the need to analyze it carefully. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: It’s… a lot to take in, Doctor. “Abnormal cells”… that sounds frightening. So, the growth was removed during the endoscopy test, correct? And now you want to examine it to see if it’s…dangerous? I'm trying to follow. And “tubulovillous adenoma”... is that something I should be concerned about remembering the name of? I worry about forgetting these terms.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re following perfectly. And it is a lot. Take your time. Yes, the growth was removed during the endoscopy. That's the good news. They actually remove polyps during the endoscopy procedure as a standard practice. And yes, we need to analyze it under a microscope – a pathologist does that – to see exactly what type of cells it contains and if there's any evidence of cancer. As for remembering “tubulovillous adenoma,” don’t worry about it. That’s my job to remember! You don’t need to memorize the specific name. Just understanding that it was a type of polyp that needed removal and analysis is what’s important. It's helpful for me to document the specifics, that's all. Now, do you have any family history of colon cancer or polyps?
PATIENT: That’s reassuring to know about not needing to remember the name. Thank you, Doctor. Hmm…let me see. My mother…she passed away when I was quite young, from complications after childbirth, so I don't recall any specifics about her medical history. My father… he lived to be a very old man, thankfully, but I don’t believe he ever had any problems with his colon. He was a very private man, though, and didn’t share much about his health. I do have an older brother, Ricardo, but I haven’t spoken to him in many years. I wouldn’t know anything about his health either. I apologize, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. You’ve told me what you do know, and that’s what’s important. Family history can be helpful, but it’s not always available. Okay, and just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my bowel habits… Well, now that you mention it… perhaps a little. Not dramatic changes, but… I've been experiencing a bit more… irregularity, I suppose. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… a bit looser than usual. It's been happening on and off for a few months now. I attributed it to my diet, to be honest. I've been trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. Also, I've noticed a small amount of…blood in the stool a couple of times. It wasn't a large amount, just a few drops. It didn’t cause me much alarm, as sometimes I get small hemorrhoids, but now that I'm thinking about it, it might be connected. Should I have mentioned this earlier? I apologize for not bringing it up immediately.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned that now, Denis. Don’t apologize. That’s precisely why I’m asking these questions. Changes in bowel habits and blood in the stool are important things to discuss, even if you initially think they might be minor. The irregularity and the small amount of blood are concerning, and they do warrant further investigation, especially in light of the polyp being found. The blood could be from the polyp itself, from hemorrhoids, or from something else. Given your history and these symptoms, I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a fecal immunochemical test to check for hidden blood in your stool. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Anything you think will help determine what's going on is fine with me. I'm a little apprehensive about more tests, naturally, but I understand it's necessary. What exactly does the FIT test involve? Is it… uncomfortable? And will these tests require another visit? I apologize for all the questions, I'm just trying to prepare myself.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Denis. It’s important to be informed. And yes, a little apprehension is normal. The FIT test is very simple and not uncomfortable at all. It involves collecting a small stool sample – just a tiny bit – at home. The clinic will provide you with a kit and instructions. You simply collect the sample, put it in the provided container, and bring it back to the clinic for analysis. It doesn’t require any special preparation. As for another visit, yes, you will need to come back to discuss the results of the CBC and FIT tests. We will also schedule a follow-up colonoscopy in about a year, even if the results are normal, as a preventative measure. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, thankfully. Collecting a stool sample is certainly less daunting than another endoscopy! A year for the follow-up colonoscopy is fine with me. I trust your judgment, Doctor. So, to recap, I’ll receive a kit for the stool sample and a blood test. Then, a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and schedule the colonoscopy. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary changes I should make, or anything I should be watching out for? I apologize if this is a silly question.
DOCTOR: You've got it exactly right, Denis. And that’s not a silly question at all. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a high-fiber diet – plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Staying well-hydrated is also important. If you experience any significant changes in your bowel habits – such as persistent diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or bright red blood in your stool – please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, just continue with your normal routine. I'm going to write up the orders for the CBC and FIT test now, and the nurse will give you the kit and instructions before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before I do that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient with me, and I truly appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel much better informed now, and less anxious about the whole situation. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. I look forward to hearing from the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if any questions arise before your next appointment. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and take care. .
