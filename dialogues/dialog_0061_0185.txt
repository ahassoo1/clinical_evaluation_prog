DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Zelina. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t really have time for pleasantries. It’s my breath. It…stinks, okay? People have been telling me. It’s embarrassing. Just tell me how to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's definitely tough when something like that is bothering you. We can absolutely figure this out. It's good you're addressing it. “Stinks” is a good starting point – can you tell me a little more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: When? Seriously? When do I notice bad breath? When I talk to people, obviously! I just… it seems like it's always there now. It wasn't always like this. Honestly, I don't know. Is that helpful? I work outside all day, if that matters. Lots of sun and… stuff.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. Working outside all day gives me a bit more to consider. And it's okay if you're not sure, we'll try to narrow it down. So, it's a recent change, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe… the last few months? Around the time… never mind. Look, I got divorced, things are stressful, okay? Maybe it’s that. But I need to get back to work, so if it’s something simple, just tell me. I don't need a whole life story session.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Stress can definitely contribute to things like this, so it's good you mentioned that. Let's try to rule out other possibilities first. To start, have you noticed any changes in your teeth or gums?
PATIENT: Changes? No. They're teeth. They’re always the same, aren't they? Look, I brush, sometimes. Okay? And I floss when I remember. It's not like I never take care of them. I just… have a lot going on. Is this going to take long? I have a shift starting in a couple of hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. "Sometimes" brushing and "when I remember" flossing...we can talk about improving that a bit, if you’re open to it. It does make a big difference. Have you noticed any pain in your mouth, or bleeding when you brush or floss?
PATIENT: No! Look, if there was pain, I’d tell you, right? Everything hurts somewhere, you know? That doesn’t mean it's important. I just… I don't like going to doctors. It’s always a waste of time. Are you going to give me a mouthwash or something? That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you, and I understand your frustration. We’ll try to make this as quick and useful as possible. While mouthwash can help mask the odor, it usually doesn't address the underlying cause. Before we jump to a solution, I’d like to just quickly take a look in your mouth, if that’s alright. It’ll only take a minute, and it can help me see if there’s anything obvious going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But make it quick, I really don't have time for this. And don't poke around too much. I hate that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as gentle and quick as possible. Okay… I’m seeing a little redness along your gumline, and some tartar buildup. Your tongue also has a coating on the back of it. Is your diet pretty consistent, or do you eat a lot of different things?
PATIENT: Consistent? No. I grab whatever's fastest when I can. Coffee, usually. Lots of coffee. And I eat… I don’t know. Fast food sometimes. Look, I work long hours, okay? I don’t have time to cook fancy meals. Is that a problem? Just tell me what I need to do to make my breath stop smelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee and fast food… that can contribute to both the tartar buildup and the coating on your tongue. The coating on your tongue harbors bacteria, and the sugar from the coffee and fast food feeds them, which can cause bad breath. The redness in your gums suggests some early inflammation, which can also contribute. It sounds like we have a few things we can work on. Do you have a toothbrush and toothpaste at home?
PATIENT: Yes, obviously! What kind of question is that? Look, I’m not a complete savage, okay? I have basic hygiene. Just… tell me what to do. I need a solution, not a lecture. And I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. No lecture, I promise. Here’s what I recommend. First, let's aim for brushing twice a day, for at least two minutes each time. Really get all surfaces of your teeth, and don’t forget your tongue. Second, try to floss every day. It makes a big difference. Third, let's try to cut back on the coffee and fast food a little bit, if you can. More water would be great too. And finally, you can try a tongue scraper. It helps remove the bacteria from your tongue. You can get them at most drugstores. Let’s start with those things. If those don't help, we can talk about other possibilities, like a referral to a dentist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Twice a day, floss, less coffee… I’ll try. But if it doesn’t work, I’m not coming back. And I’m not paying for a dentist. I don’t have insurance, remember? Just… give me something for the smell now, okay? Like a mouthwash. A strong one. And can I go now? I'm late.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Here. This is a prescription mouthwash called chlorhexidine. It's a stronger formulation than what you'd find over the counter and can help kill the bacteria causing the odor. Use it twice a day after brushing and flossing. Be aware it can sometimes stain your teeth a little, but it's temporary. And yes, you can absolutely go now. We’ll see how these changes work for you. If you don't notice any improvement in a week or two, please consider coming back, even without insurance. We can explore options like a payment plan for a dental visit, or connect you with resources that offer low-cost dental care. Here’s a little information sheet on good oral hygiene practices. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you. I guess. And can I please go now? I really need to get back to work. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're very welcome. Drive safe, and I hope you feel better soon. If anything changes, or if you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out. .
