DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion Chelberg, 62 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It’s my chest, you see. It’s been… bothering me. Not all the time, but enough to worry an old lady like me. It feels… tight sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Tight, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, tight. Not a sharp pain, never sharp. More like… a heavy feeling. And sometimes it goes up to my jaw, a little bit. It happened again this morning when I was making breakfast for my husband.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? It comes and goes, so it's hard to say exactly. Not every day. But when it does come, it's… noticeable. I remember because my husband, Ricardo, he noticed it too, and he told me to come see you. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Ricardo, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Ricardo! A good man. We’ve been married… oh, forty years now, next month. He's a retired carpenter. Very strong, still does little things around the house. He made me this nice shawl, actually. <gestures to a colorful shawl draped over her lap> He gets anxious when I complain about anything. Always says, “Go see the doctor, Sherion!”
DOCTOR: Right, right. So, this tightness… does anything specifically bring it on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't think so, not really. Sometimes it happens when I’m walking up the hill to the store. But other times, I’m just sitting, watching television, and it starts. It doesn't seem to follow a pattern, you know? I try not to overdo it, but I like to keep busy. Baking, gardening… little things.
DOCTOR: And how many stairs do you have at your house?
PATIENT: Oh, not many! Just… seven. To get to the front door. We built the house ourselves, a long time ago, and we didn't want too many. My knees aren't what they used to be, so Ricardo did most of the climbing when we were building! <chuckles softly> Seven steps, though. I can still do them, just… slowly. The chest pain doesn't always happen with the stairs, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about other things. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Never! My mother, she smoked, and it wasn’t pretty. No, no smoking here. Ricardo doesn’t smoke either. We both try to eat healthy, too. Lots of fruits and vegetables from the garden. We aren’t perfect, but we try.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… heart trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My abuela, on my mother’s side, she had a weak heart, I think. She was very old when she passed. And my uncle, he had high blood pressure. He had to watch his salt, you know. But… that’s about it, I think. Nobody died of a heart attack, if that’s what you mean. It's a little hard to remember everything, it was a long time ago. We didn't go to the doctor much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the one for my arthritis, Doctor. It's called… let me see… Naproxen, I think. Little white pills. Helps with the pain in my hands. And sometimes, when it's really bad, I take Tylenol. But that's it. Nothing for my heart or blood pressure, never had to. <pauses> Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It always matters. Alright, let’s have a listen to your chest. <gestures towards the examination table> If you don't mind.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. <slowly gets up from the chair, a little stiffly, and walks towards the examination table> It's a little cold in here, isn’t it? But I’m ready when you are. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally. <begins auscultating Sherion’s chest with a stethoscope, listening intently> Deep breath in… and out… again… okay… and one more time… <continues listening for a moment, then stops abruptly> Hmm. I hear some… diminished breath sounds on the lower right lobe. Nothing too concerning, but we’ll want to get a chest X-ray just to be sure. And I'm going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, but that could be from the stress of coming to the doctor. <pauses> We'll get everything checked out. Don't worry too much. But we need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Oh dear. X-ray and an EKG? Is it something serious, Doctor? I was hoping it was just… gas pains or something. My husband, Ricardo, he’ll be worried sick. I don't like being poked and prodded, you know. And I don’t like being a bother. What exactly are you looking for? <fidgets with her shawl>
DOCTOR: Look, it's standard procedure. Elevated blood pressure, diminished breath sounds, the chest pain… it's better to be thorough, alright?
PATIENT: But what could it be, Doctor? Is it my heart? I’ve never had any problems with my heart before. I just want to know what's going on. And… will it take long? I promised Ricardo I’d make him his favorite soup for dinner. <looks down at her hands, nervously twisting them> I don't want to scare him.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things. We need to rule out pneumonia, bronchitis, and yes, cardiac issues. The EKG will tell us if there are any abnormalities in your heart rhythm, and the chest X-ray will show us if there’s anything going on in your lungs. It's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to get a baseline. Look, worrying won’t help. Let’s just get the tests done, and then we’ll talk about it. The nurse will get you set up for the EKG now. It's just stickers on your chest. Then we’ll send you over to radiology for the X-ray. It shouldn’t take more than an hour or so, and you can still make Ricardo his soup afterwards. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Stickers, you say? Alright… stickers. That sounds… less scary than everything else. And an hour, so I can still make the soup. Okay. <takes a deep breath> But… if it is something bad, Doctor… will I have to go to the hospital? Ricardo isn't very good with hospitals. He gets very upset. <looks at the Doctor with a worried expression>
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. It is unlikely you'll need to go to the hospital. But if the tests show something serious, then, yes, you may need further evaluation there. It's a precaution. We will discuss all your options thoroughly if that becomes necessary. For now, let’s just get the tests done. The nurse is waiting to take you back. Try to stay calm. It’s likely nothing to worry about. But we need to be certain.
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Stickers and X-rays. <slowly gets up from the chair, adjusting her shawl> Ricardo will worry, but… I’ll try to stay calm. <pauses, looking at the Doctor with a hesitant expression> Thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate you explaining everything… even if it’s a little scary. <starts to walk towards the door> I hope it’s just gas pains. That’s all.
