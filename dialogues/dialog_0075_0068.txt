DOCTOR: Bonjour, Madame Queener. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's... my leg. It's been swelling up, you see? After the… the treatment. It’s a bit bothersome, honestly. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Swelling in the leg after treatment… can you tell me a bit more about the treatment you had?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was for… the cancer. A few years ago now. They gave me… pills, mostly. And then some… radiation. Yes, radiation. It was at the hospital, of course. It made me very tired, and now this leg… it's just puffed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, cancer treatment with pills and radiation a few years ago, and now you’re experiencing swelling in your leg. To clarify, is this swelling in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the one. My right leg. It started… maybe a month ago? It’s not painful, exactly, just… heavy. And bigger than the other one, naturally. It makes wearing shoes difficult, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so swelling in the right leg started about a month ago, not painful, just heavy and making it difficult to wear shoes. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your leg – any redness, warmth, or sores?
PATIENT: No, no sores. The skin… it feels normal, I think. Maybe a little… different color? A bit reddish, perhaps, but not much. It doesn’t feel warm, if that makes sense. It's just… puffy. And I worry about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sores, skin feels normal but possibly a bit reddish. Let's take a look. Would you mind if I examined your leg?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Please do. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. It’s a bit embarrassing, showing you my leg like this, but… I need to know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s perfectly alright, Madame Queener, that's what I'm here for. Okay… I’m noting some edema, or swelling, in your lower right leg, particularly around the calf and ankle. The skin does appear slightly reddish, and it’s warm to the touch compared to your left leg. No visible sores or breaks in the skin. Your pulses feel normal. Now, I'm going to measure the circumference of both legs to get a better sense of the difference in size. Right leg circumference is 38 centimeters, left leg is 35 centimeters. That confirms a difference in size.
PATIENT: Oh… centimeters? I don't really understand those. Is that… bad? A difference, you say? I just want it to go back to normal, you know? It's making it hard to walk, even.
DOCTOR: Yes, a difference in circumference suggests there is indeed swelling in your right leg. It's a small difference, but noticeable. It's understandable that it's making it harder to walk. Based on your history of cancer treatment and the current symptoms, my primary concern is lymphedema. It’s a condition where fluid builds up because the lymphatic system isn't draining properly, often a side effect of cancer treatment, particularly after radiation. It's not usually dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable and, as you’re experiencing, make walking difficult. Before we confirm that diagnosis, I'd like to order a Doppler ultrasound to rule out any blood clots in your leg, just to be safe. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… Doppler whatsit? Ultrasound? Oh dear. Is that… painful? And a blood clot? That sounds very bad. I don't want a blood clot! Will it take long? I have a bit of a schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be concerned. A Doppler ultrasound is completely painless. It uses sound waves to create an image of the blood flow in your leg, so we can see if there are any clots present. It's a very common and safe procedure. The technician will simply apply a gel to your leg and move a small device over the skin. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. We’re ruling out a blood clot as a precaution, Madame Queener. Given your history, lymphedema is the more likely cause, but we need to be thorough. Would you like me to explain what we would do if it were a blood clot, so you feel more prepared?
PATIENT: Oh… 30-45 minutes. That's… alright, I suppose. Yes, please. Tell me about the… blood clot thing. Just in case. It’s better to know, isn’t it? I always feel better knowing what to expect. Even if it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If the ultrasound were to show a blood clot – a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT – it would require immediate treatment. The standard treatment is with anticoagulant medication, often called blood thinners, to prevent the clot from growing and to reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs, which can be very serious. We would likely refer you to a specialist, a hematologist, for ongoing management. However, I want to emphasize again, Madame Queener, that lymphedema is far more likely. And even if it is lymphedema, it's very manageable. Treatment typically involves compression therapy – wearing special stockings or bandages – and, in some cases, physical therapy to help improve lymphatic drainage. We can discuss those options in detail once we have the results of the ultrasound. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Stockings? Like… support stockings? I have those already, for my varicose veins. Would those help? And a specialist… oh dear. More doctors. But… if it’s not painful, and just needs stockings, that sounds much better than… medication. Yes, that makes sense. Please, just let me know when I can have the… the ultrasound thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, support stockings might help in the short term, but they're usually not sufficient for lymphedema. Lymphedema stockings are specifically designed with a higher compression gradient to help move fluid out of your leg. We would need to have you properly fitted for the correct size and compression level. I'll have my nurse schedule you for a Doppler ultrasound as soon as possible, likely tomorrow morning. The results usually take about an hour to come back. Once we have those, we'll discuss the findings and create a treatment plan that’s right for you. In the meantime, try to elevate your leg as much as possible when you’re resting, and avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Elevate it… yes, I can do that. My armchair is quite comfortable. And no… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate it. Hopefully, it’s just a bit of swelling and I can get back to walking normally.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Madame Queener. I’m glad I could help. We will get to the bottom of this. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your ultrasound. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
