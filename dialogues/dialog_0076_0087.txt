DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Yes, yes... name and age check out. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Lab work, right? That's all. Doctor said something about needing it done. Honestly, can’t rightly remember why, just… the usual check-up stuff, I suppose. The sooner we get this over with, the better.
DOCTOR: "Usual check-up stuff." Right. Well, “usual” requires some detail, doesn't it?
PATIENT: Detail… hmm. Look, I work at the power plant, you know? Long hours. Things get… fuzzy. Doctor Ruocco, is it? He just said, "Come in for blood work, Early." That's about the extent of it. Medicare covers it, thankfully. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: The power plant. Fascinating. And you expect me to divine what blood work is for based on that information?
PATIENT: Divining… look, I’m not a mind reader! I just… go to work, I keep the lights on. The doctor, he should have written it down. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Is there a form I need to fill out or something? Just point me to it, please.
DOCTOR: There. "Medical History." Fill it out as best you can. Vague answers aren't helpful, Mr. Croonquist. It's a standard form. And frankly, your reluctance to cooperate isn’t making this any easier. I have other patients, you know.
PATIENT: Other patients… always other patients. Fine, fine. Though honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. What year is it again? Just to be sure... before I start writing down dates, and make a mess of things. It feels… strange, lately. Everything does.
DOCTOR: It’s August 2nd, 2025. Now, please. Just fill out the form. We can discuss your “strange feelings” after, if there’s time. And if you can recall what prompted this visit, it would be…helpful. Do you have any specific concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns… hmm. Not really. I mean, I feel… tired, sometimes. More tired than usual, I suppose. But that could just be the plant. Shift work, you know? And aches… old man aches. Nothing specific. Just… everything feels a bit muted, like looking through fog. But the doctor didn't mention any particular reason for the blood work, so I’m not sure what to put here. Is “tired” good enough?
DOCTOR: "Tired." Wonderful. That narrows it down immensely. Alright, let's at least get a basic physical done. Blood pressure, pulse, weight... you’ve already provided the height, apparently. Stand up. And try to remember if you’ve had any…recent illnesses. Anything at all.
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… let me think. No… not really. A little sniffle back in… March, maybe? But it didn't last. Nothing a bit of rest didn't fix. Power plant air conditioning is always playing tricks on you, you see. Makes you sick then well. Honestly, I just want this over with. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Weight is 69 kilograms. Height, as noted, is 195 centimeters. Blood pressure… 145 over 90. A bit elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs are clear. No murmurs. Reflexes are…present. Barely. Now, any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never really been bothered by pollen, or cats, or anything. Dust at the plant sometimes… makes me cough, but that’s just dust, right? Not an allergy. Everything is dusty at the plant. It's cold in here. Is there any chance we can hurry this along? I have a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. No known allergies. You've stated your occupation repeatedly, I’ve documented that. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh! I take a little something for my back, now and then. Just when it flares up. Over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think. Something like that. And sometimes a little something to help me sleep... but that's usually only on my days off. Does that count? It's nothing serious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, as needed. And…a sleep aid. What sleep aid?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's a little blue pill. Small, round. I got it from the pharmacy down the street. I can’t rightly remember the name… something with a “Z” in it, maybe? Zzz… something? The pharmacist knows. He's a helpful young man. Honestly, I just take it when I can't sleep. It helps me rest for my shift. Is that important?
DOCTOR: A “little blue pill with a Z in it.” That's incredibly helpful. Very precise. Probably a benzodiazepine. Irresponsible self-medication… alright. We'll run some basic labs to check your kidney function and rule out any obvious issues. Don't expect a detailed explanation, I have other patients. The nurse will draw your blood. Afterwards, I’ll review the results and let you know if any further action is needed. Stop by in a week. Don’t bother calling unless something is seriously wrong. Next!
PATIENT: A week… alright. Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. Though honestly, I didn't learn much. Just glad it's almost over. I hope the nurse is quick. And… thank you again.
