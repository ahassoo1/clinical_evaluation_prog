DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor Ranjan. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been… coughing up a little blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see someone. It’s not a lot, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood is definitely something we want to investigate. Just to clarify, when you say “a little blood”, can you describe what it looks like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… bright red. Not dark, you know? And it’s… mixed with the mucus. Not just blood. Sometimes there is more blood than other times. It happened… three times now, over the last week. I try to remember if anything made it happen, but… I don’t think so. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood mixed with mucus, happening three times in the last week, and not associated with anything specific you’ve noticed. That’s helpful. Have you been having any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have been… a little tired, maybe? But I am always a little tired. And… a small fever, I think? But not a high fever. Just… warm. No… no pain. No trouble breathing. Just the cough and… being tired. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little fatigue and a mild fever along with the cough and blood. It's good you're keeping track of everything. Do you have any pain in your chest, or shortness of breath at all, even with just walking around?
PATIENT: No, no pain. And I can walk normally. I walk… a lot, actually. I am a physical therapist, so I am on my feet all day. No trouble at all with breathing. It’s just… the blood is worrying me. It’s not like me to… cough up blood. It makes me think of… bad things.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. Being a physical therapist, you're very aware of your body, so noticing this change is important. Let's go over some of your medical history. I see you’ve had no prior serious illnesses or surgeries. Any allergies to medications, or any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies. And… no medications, not currently. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor said I didn't need it anymore. That was… maybe five years ago? It was a small pill. I don’t remember the name. I haven't taken anything regularly since then. Just… sometimes, if my head hurts, I take something for that. Over-the-counter.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, used to take something for blood pressure five years ago but it was discontinued, and occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. That’s good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is… difficult. My mother… she passed away when I was young. Cancer, I think. Lung cancer. But… it was a long time ago. And my father… he had heart problems. But he was very old when he passed. I don’t know… I don't remember if anyone else had… problems with their lungs. My family is… not very good at talking about these things. It’s… uncomfortable. I’m sorry. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It's okay, I understand. Family history can be difficult to gather, and it's perfectly fine if you don't have all the details. Knowing about lung cancer in your mother and heart problems in your father is helpful, thank you. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I do not smoke. My husband… he smoked, but he passed away last year. He tried to quit many times, but… he couldn't. It was… difficult for him. But I never smoked. I always told him not to smoke near me. It is… bad for your health.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been very difficult. Okay, so no history of smoking for you. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look in your throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what is happening. I hope it is not… serious. Thank you for checking.
DOCTOR: Of course. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your lungs sound… clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing on exhale. Your heart rate is normal. Your throat looks normal, no signs of infection or irritation. The wheezing is a little concerning, but the fact that your lungs otherwise sound clear is good. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. It will help us to rule out any underlying causes for the blood you're coughing up and the wheezing. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes… an X-ray is… alright. If you think it is necessary. I just… I don’t want anything bad to be happening. Will it be… painful? And how long will I have to wait for the results? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: No, an X-ray isn’t painful at all. You’ll just stand or sit while a technician takes a picture of your chest. It's very quick. As for the results, the radiologist usually reads them within 24-48 hours. I'll review them as soon as I receive them and call you with the findings. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler. It's a bronchodilator that will help open up your airways. It may help with the wheezing and hopefully reduce the irritation causing the blood. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. An inhaler… to open my airways? Is that… serious? I’m sorry, I’m just… confused. And a little scared. I don't want to be a bother. What if it doesn’t work?
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel scared and confused. The inhaler isn't necessarily a sign of something serious. It’s simply a medication to help manage any airway inflammation you might be experiencing. We're being cautious and addressing the symptoms while we wait for the X-ray results. It's very common for people with even mild asthma or bronchitis to use inhalers. If it doesn’t work, that just means we need to investigate further to find the cause of the issue. Here's the prescription. The pharmacy should have it ready for you shortly. I also want you to monitor your symptoms closely – note any changes in the amount of blood you're coughing up, any shortness of breath, or any fever. And if anything worsens, please don't hesitate to call my office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. I will… monitor my symptoms, and I will call if anything changes. Thank you for being so patient with me. I appreciate your kindness. And… thank you for checking everything. I hope it is nothing… too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, it’s something minor. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. .
