DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, good to meet you. Though frankly, my schedule is quite packed. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about these… spells, I guess you could call them. My wife, she keeps saying I have these moments where I don’t… know things. Important things. It's quite embarrassing, really. I'm a tile setter, been doing it for forty years. A man needs to remember things in my line of work. It’s not like I'm losing my hands, it’s my head that's the problem.
DOCTOR: “Spells,” you say?
PATIENT: Don’t look at me like that, Doctor. It's the best way to describe it. It's like… a fog rolls in. I’ll be mid-sentence, talking about a job, and then… blank. My wife has to remind me what I was saying, or who she even invited over for dinner last week. It's not constant, thankfully. But it’s happening more and more often. And it’s… unsettling. A man should be able to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “fog” isn’t a medical term, Mr. Lason. We need specifics. When did these… episodes start?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It was subtle at first. Forgetting where I put my tools, things like that. I figured it was just getting old. I turned sixty-six in March, you know. But then it started being bigger things. Like… last month, I completely forgot the address of Mr. Henderson’s house. I’ve done three bathrooms for that man! Three! My wife had to look it up for me. It’s… humiliating, really. A good tile setter doesn’t forget a client’s address.
DOCTOR: And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… my appetite hasn't been the best, I suppose. My wife makes a lovely fish amok, but sometimes… I just don't feel like eating. Not like I used to. And I’ve been… a little more irritable, maybe? Snapping at my wife over small things. She says I’m more easily confused, but I think she just worries too much. Though, to be fair, she is usually right about these things. She knows me better than I know myself, I suppose. Still, a little less fish amok isn't exactly a medical emergency, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any trouble with sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? No, no trouble sleeping at all. I sleep like a log. Always have. That is, when my wife isn’t nudging me to remind me what we had for breakfast. I usually get right off to sleep, though. It’s staying awake that’s the issue, sometimes. These… these little gaps in my memory. They bother me more than a sleepless night, I can tell you that. A good night’s sleep doesn’t fix forgetting who I was talking to five minutes ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? No, no medications at all. Never have. I don't believe in filling my body with all sorts of chemicals. My wife keeps trying to get me to take something for my… well, she says it’s my “blood pressure.” But I feel fine. A little forgetful, perhaps, but otherwise perfectly healthy. I eat well, sleep well, work hard. I don’t need pills. Honestly, I think this whole thing is just stress. My son keeps pressuring me to retire, you know. Says I’m “too old” to be crawling around on floors. That’s the real problem. Not some… fog.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick look, just to be sure. Nothing wrong with a baseline. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, please?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just don’t expect anything dramatic. I'm a perfectly capable man, Doctor. A few gaps in my memory don’t mean I'm… fading away. Go ahead. Point your finger. Though I do have a tile job to get back to this afternoon, so let’s not take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now I'd like to check your reflexes. Just relax your arm.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Honestly, Doctor. I’ve been laying tile for forty years. My reflexes are perfectly fine. All this poking and prodding… it’s unnecessary. But, fine. Go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just don’t expect anything remarkable. I'm a tradesman, not an athlete.
DOCTOR: Hmmm. Alright. And could you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? That’s… that’s… Well, it’s August. Definitely August. Let me think… it’s the… the second, isn't it? The second of August. 2025, of course. Yes, that’s right. August the second, 2025. Though my wife usually keeps track of these things. It’s not exactly something I need to know when I’m laying tile, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Lason, based on what you've told me, and the quick assessment, it seems you’re experiencing some early signs of cognitive impairment. It could be a number of things, truthfully. It's not necessarily anything drastic at this stage, but it’s something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Cognitive… impairment? What are you saying, Doctor? Am I losing my mind? I'm a perfectly capable man! I build things. I create things! This is ridiculous. Just because I forget the date sometimes doesn’t mean I’m… falling apart. My wife worries too much, and now you’re telling me this? What kind of investigation? More poking and prodding? I don’t like the sound of this at all. Is this going to involve… tests? Because I’m not good with tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concern, truly. But ignoring this won't make it go away. We need to rule out certain possibilities. I’m going to recommend a series of blood tests, to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other potential causes. And I’d like you to undergo a cognitive screening test. It’s not a pass or fail, it’s just a way to get a baseline and see where we are. I’m also going to suggest a referral to a neurologist. They specialize in these kinds of issues, and can provide a more thorough evaluation. It doesn't mean anything serious, but it’s best to be cautious.
PATIENT: A neurologist? Blood tests? This is… this is getting out of hand. I told you, I’m perfectly fine. A few gaps in my memory, that’s all. My wife… she worries too much. She always has. She’ll drag me to all sorts of doctors and specialists for nothing. And a neurologist? That sounds… serious. I don’t want to see a neurologist. I just want to go back to work. I have a job to finish. No. I don’t think so. I’ll just… try to remember things better, okay? That’s all. No tests, no blood work, no neurologists. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your reluctance, but this isn't something you can just "try to remember better." Cognitive impairment can have underlying causes that need to be addressed. Ignoring it could have serious consequences. I strongly advise you to reconsider the referral to a neurologist and the blood tests. It’s for your own well-being. If you absolutely refuse, I will document that you declined further investigation, but I must advise you that this is against medical recommendations. .
