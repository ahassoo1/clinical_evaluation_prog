DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Yackey. It's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for... well, a good few days now, I reckon. Not constantly, mind you, but they pop up at the strangest times. It's a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: “A few days,” you say. Right. And can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Well, they're… regular hiccups, I suppose! You know, that little hic sound, and a bit of a jolt. Not painful, thankfully. But they come on without warning. Yesterday I was just enjoying a cup of tea, peaceful as you please, and hic! There it was. And then again when I was watering my plants. No rhyme or reason, really. Sometimes a single one, sometimes a little burst of them. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. I see. And have you tried anything to resolve them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Plenty. My daughter, bless her heart, told me to hold my breath, you know? Tried that. Didn't do a thing. Then I tried drinking water upside down, that old trick. Nope. And I even had a spoonful of sugar. Still hiccuping! Honestly, Doctor, I'm running out of ideas. It’s not like it’s life-threatening, but it's wearing me down a little, you know? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I've noticed, no. No heartburn, no trouble breathing, no dizziness… everything feels normal, apart from the hic! I’ve been sleeping alright, eating as usual… maybe a little less tea lately, just because of the hiccups, don’t want to trigger them! But nothing else really. It’s just… the hiccups. A bothersome little mystery, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick examination, then. It's likely nothing serious, but we’ll rule out anything obvious. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. Sounds good to me. Anything to get rid of these pesky hiccups! Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm not as nimble as I used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Heart sounds regular. Your vital signs are within normal limits. As I suspected, it doesn’t appear to be anything significant. It could be a simple case of a vagus nerve irritation. It’s often self-limiting.
PATIENT: Vagus nerve, you say? Oh dear, is that something serious? I’ve never even heard of that! And self-limiting… does that mean it will just… go away on its own eventually? I suppose I can live with it for a bit, if that’s the case. But it’s just so… random! It's unsettling to have your body do something without any reason, you know? Is there anything at all I can do to help it along, Doctor? Any little thing?
DOCTOR: There are a few… folk remedies. But frankly, the efficacy is questionable. Try sipping ice water slowly. Deep, slow breathing exercises. Avoid carbonated beverages and excessive alcohol. And… try to relax. Stress can exacerbate it. If they persist for more than a week, or if you develop any new symptoms – difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe abdominal pain – then you should return. But I suspect it will resolve on its own. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. Ice water, deep breaths, no fizzy drinks… I can manage that. And I’ll certainly try to relax, though it's easier said than done sometimes! No, I don’t think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for looking at me, even if it’s just a pesky vagus nerve. It's good to know it's not something terribly wrong. I appreciate you taking the time. Perhaps a bit of peace and quiet is all I need. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Just monitor it, as I said. Don't hesitate to return if it worsens. Have a good day, Ms. Sucich.
