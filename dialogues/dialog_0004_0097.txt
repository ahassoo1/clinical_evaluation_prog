DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is…Chilla, yes. My husband suggested I come. He worries unduly, but…he says we should have some of these…arrangements made. For when…well, you understand. I believe he called it an “advance directive” or a “POLST form”? Honestly, I don't entirely follow all the paperwork he brought, but it seems prudent, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your husband is…thoughtful. It is sensible to plan ahead. Though frankly, at your age, it’s a bit…premature. These documents outline your wishes for medical care if you become unable to express them yourself. It’s good you’re considering this. So, to be clear, you're here specifically to discuss completing an advance directive and possibly a POLST form?
PATIENT: Precisely. He printed…several pages. Quite a lot of legal language, really. I skimmed them, but I confess, I didn’t grasp all the nuances. I am a literature teacher, Doctor, not a lawyer. I simply want to ensure things are…handled appropriately, should the need arise. And, frankly, to appease my husband. He’s very…firm in his opinions. Is there a form I need to…complete, or is this a more…involved discussion?
DOCTOR: Yes, there are forms, naturally. But it’s not simply a matter of signing paperwork. It requires a careful consideration of your values and wishes regarding medical treatment. We need to discuss what you would want in various scenarios – things like life-sustaining treatment, resuscitation, and pain management. Before we get to the specifics of the forms, let’s get a general sense of your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I’m generally quite healthy, thank you. I walk every morning, I maintain a…respectable diet, though my husband insists I add more vegetables. I had a bout of…the flu last winter, a rather unpleasant affair, but otherwise, I’m robust. No chronic conditions to speak of. I do require glasses for reading, and my joints sometimes ache in cold weather, but I attribute that to age, naturally. My husband keeps trying to schedule appointments for…everything. He worries about the smallest things. Do you require a complete medical history, Doctor? It seems rather…unnecessary for a simple directive.
DOCTOR: While a comprehensive history isn't strictly required, it’s still prudent to have a baseline understanding of your health. It helps us ensure the directives are appropriate for your specific situation. Knowing even seemingly minor details can be relevant. Let’s start with medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I prefer a natural approach, whenever possible. My husband occasionally attempts to convince me to take vitamins, but I find them…unnecessary. I drink plenty of water and eat a balanced diet. He worries about my calcium intake, naturally. He’s convinced I’m going to…fracture something. But truly, I take no medications of any kind. I find them…interfering. And potentially harmful, given all the side effects one hears about.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. And you mentioned no chronic conditions. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Only for the birth of my son, many years ago. A perfectly normal delivery, thankfully. No complications. A brief stay, of course. And…a rather unpleasant bout of food poisoning in Morocco, years ago, during a research trip. But that was…decades ago. I recovered quickly, and it was hardly a serious affair. Really, Doctor, I assure you, I am a remarkably healthy woman. I simply want to have these forms completed, so my husband will…cease his fretting. Is there a faster way to proceed? Perhaps a questionnaire?
DOCTOR: A questionnaire wouldn’t suffice, Ms. Chilla. While I appreciate your assertion of good health, we still need to establish a more complete picture. It’s a matter of due diligence. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely none. I have travelled extensively throughout North Africa and the Middle East, and I assure you, I’ve encountered all manner of…flora and fauna. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My constitution is…robust, as I’ve mentioned. Really, I believe my husband is exaggerating when he speaks of my health concerns to…whomever he consults. It's…irritating, to be quite frank. He tends towards…dramatics. Are we nearing the completion of these forms, Doctor? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are proceeding as quickly as possible, Ms. Chilla. However, a thorough assessment is crucial. Let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history... my mother had…high blood pressure, I believe. And my uncle suffered from…arthritis. Nothing particularly alarming, really. Mostly…age-related ailments. My father was remarkably healthy, until his…untimely demise. A heart attack, I believe, but he smoked rather heavily, so it wasn’t entirely unexpected. Honestly, Doctor, I doubt any of this is relevant. My genetic predisposition is… quite sound, I assure you. Must we delve into such… minutiae? I feel I am being subjected to a rather…exhaustive examination for a simple directive. Are you certain this is standard procedure?
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Chilla. It’s about understanding potential risks, even if you perceive them as unlikely. Now, let's talk about social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I find such habits…deplorable. I maintain a refined lifestyle. I enjoy reading, classical music, and…intellectual pursuits. My husband occasionally enjoys a glass of wine with dinner, but I abstain entirely. I find alcohol…clouding my judgment. And smoking is…utterly repulsive. Really, Doctor, I should think my lifestyle is…exemplary. Are we nearing the end of this…interrogation? I confess, I am growing increasingly…impatient.
DOCTOR: Very well. Since you are in excellent health and maintain a refined lifestyle, as you say, we can move on to the actual directives. However, before we do, I must ask one final question. Are you currently experiencing any pain, discomfort, or other physical symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none whatsoever. I may experience a slight ache in my joints during inclement weather, as I previously mentioned, but that is hardly a…symptom. I am perfectly comfortable, perfectly healthy, and perfectly capable of making my own decisions. Honestly, I believe my husband has…exaggerated my concerns to an unreasonable degree. I came here to appease him, not to undergo a…medical examination. Are these forms, at last, within reach? I truly have limited time this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Since you insist you are in excellent health and have no current medical concerns, we can proceed with completing the advance directive and POLST form. However, I must strongly advise that these documents are reviewed by a legal professional to ensure they fully reflect your wishes and comply with relevant regulations. I have the forms here. They outline various medical scenarios and allow you to specify your preferences regarding treatment options, resuscitation, and end-of-life care. We will go through each section together. Do you have your reading glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, thankfully. My vision is…deteriorating slightly, as one might expect at my age. Though I maintain an active intellectual life, despite such…minor inconveniences. And yes, let us proceed. I trust these forms are…straightforward? I would prefer to minimize the…legal jargon, if possible. I simply want to ensure my wishes are…respected, and to finally appease my husband. Perhaps a summary after each section? He will undoubtedly…interrogate me upon our return.
DOCTOR: They are as straightforward as they can be, given the complexity of the subject matter. I will provide a brief summary after each section, as you requested. Now, the first section concerns your general preferences regarding life-sustaining treatment. This includes things like mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and hydration. It asks if you would want these measures to be withheld or withdrawn if you were in a persistent vegetative state or had no reasonable prospect of recovery. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Persistent vegetative state...a rather unpleasant thought. And no prospect of recovery… equally distressing. Honestly, Doctor, I find the very premise of these questions…morbid. But…yes, I understand the basic concept. I suppose…I would not want to be…propped up artificially, if there was no hope of…regaining my faculties. A natural end…would be preferable, I suppose. Though the thought is…unsettling. So, I should…indicate that I do not want such measures employed, in the event of such…a catastrophe? Is that correct? I find this terminology…rather stark.
DOCTOR: Precisely. Check the box indicating you would not want life-sustaining treatment in the event of a persistent vegetative state or no reasonable prospect of recovery. It’s your right to refuse such measures. It's also possible to specify certain conditions, such as whether you’d want a trial period before making a final decision. Would you like to add any stipulations?
PATIENT: A trial period...hmmm. Yes, perhaps. A week, perhaps? To allow for…unforeseen improvements? One always hopes for a miracle, doesn’t one? Though I confess, my husband would likely insist on a shorter timeframe. He’s…practical, to a fault. So, yes, let us indicate a one-week trial period, should such a…dire situation arise. And…perhaps add a clause stating that my wishes are… paramount? Though I suspect my husband would…challenge that. Honestly, Doctor, this is rather…stressful. Are we nearing the completion of this section? I believe I am beginning to…sweat.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve added a clause stating a one-week trial period and a statement affirming that your wishes are paramount, as long as they are legally permissible. We can revisit that clause with your husband if he raises concerns. Now, the next section concerns resuscitation preferences. This asks if you would want cardiopulmonary resuscitation – CPR – performed if your heart stopped beating or you stopped breathing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: CPR…yes, the chest compressions and…mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. A rather…invasive procedure, I imagine. Honestly, Doctor, I find the very thought…undignified. And frankly, at my age… I doubt it would be…effective. So, no. I do not want CPR performed, should such an… unfortunate event occur. I would prefer a…peaceful end, rather than a…frantic attempt at resuscitation. Is that sufficient? I suspect my husband will…object strenuously. He believes in…miracles, you see. And…aggressive intervention, in all matters. Really, Doctor, this is exhausting. Are we nearing the end of this…ordeal?
DOCTOR: Very well. No CPR. It’s your right to refuse. Now, the next section concerns pain management. This asks about your preferences regarding medication and other methods of relieving pain and discomfort, especially in the event of a terminal illness. Do you have any specific wishes regarding pain control?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. Pain…is intolerable. I have a…low threshold, you see. I require…adequate relief, should such a…dire situation arise. I would prefer…whatever is necessary to ensure my comfort. Morphine, perhaps? Or…something equally potent? I do not want to suffer needlessly. And I would want…regular monitoring to ensure adequate pain control. Honestly, Doctor, I trust your judgment in this matter. I simply want to be…comfortable, should the worst occur. And…no prolonged suffering, at all costs. Is that clear? I suspect my husband would…insist on a minimalist approach, naturally. He believes in…enduring hardship. Really, Doctor, this is… quite draining. Are we nearing completion? I have a faculty meeting, you see. And I suspect my husband has…prepared a list of questions.
DOCTOR: Very well. Adequate pain control, with regular monitoring. I’ve noted your preference for aggressive pain management. Now, the final section concerns your designated healthcare proxy. This is the person you choose to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Have you already designated a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be my husband, of course. He is…quite capable, despite his…unyielding opinions. Though I suspect he will…impose his own wishes, regardless of my directives. He believes he knows what is best, you see. But yes, he is my designated healthcare proxy. He has…power of attorney, as well, so it’s…a formality, really. Though I suspect he will…challenge me on several points, once he examines these forms. He’s…quite meticulous, and…opinionated, to a fault. Honestly, Doctor, this has been… quite stressful. Is there anything else? I truly must be going. My faculty meeting, you see. And my husband…is waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. The forms are complete. As I mentioned earlier, I strongly advise having them reviewed by a legal professional. And I recommend discussing them thoroughly with your husband. Here’s a copy for your records. I've included some resources about end-of-life care. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Thank you for your…assistance. Though I confess, this has been…quite taxing. I suspect my husband will…have numerous questions. And…objections. But at least I have…completed the forms, as he requested. Perhaps this will…appease him. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
