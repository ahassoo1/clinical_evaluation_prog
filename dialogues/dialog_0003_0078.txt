DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I am Dr. Yackey. I see here you're a new patient. Let's try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, I am. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Concise is good – I appreciate that. I’m hoping you can help me… well, I’m not sure exactly how to put this. I just feel… sluggish, I suppose. Like I need a bit of a… restart.
DOCTOR: "Sluggish," is it?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s difficult to explain. Not sick, exactly. More… like the battery is low. I have energy, but it doesn’t feel like enough to do everything I want, or even need to do. Does that make sense? I apologize if it’s vague.
DOCTOR: Vague is… not ideal, Ms. Pitzel. Let's attempt a bit of structure, if you will. When did this “low battery” feeling begin?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Honestly, it’s been creeping up on me for… maybe six months now? It started slowly, just feeling more tired than usual after a long day. Now it’s… almost all the time. It’s hard to pinpoint a specific moment, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Six months. Prolonged… suboptimal energy levels. And has this impacted your daily activities, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. I run a small business – I do sculpting and casting, mostly decorative pieces for homes. It requires a lot of physical work, and concentration. I’ve found myself needing more and more breaks, and… I’m having trouble finishing projects. I used to be able to work for hours straight. Now, it’s… frustrating. My husband has been very understanding, but I don’t want to fall behind.
DOCTOR: A physically demanding profession. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I’ve been having some trouble sleeping. Not falling asleep, necessarily, but staying asleep. I wake up several times during the night. And… sometimes I feel a little… disconnected, I suppose. Like I’m not fully present. It’s a strange feeling to describe. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a subjective term, Ms. Pitzel. Interrupted sleep and… a sense of detachment. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: That’s a fair point. No, not really. My appetite is the same, maybe a little less, but I attribute that to being tired. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my clothes fit the same. I’m fairly consistent, I don’t fluctuate much. I do try to eat healthily, as much as possible. Mostly fruits, vegetables, lean protein.
DOCTOR: Adequate diet, consistent weight… Alright. Any family history of… let’s say, similar complaints?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother always had low energy, but she just chalked it up to being a busy woman. She never really went to the doctor about it. My father… he was always very active, so it’s hard to say. No major illnesses that I’m aware of, if that helps. I suppose it’s not a very helpful answer, I apologize.
DOCTOR: A vague familial predisposition. Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I'll start with your vital signs, and then we'll do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and a neurological assessment. Nothing invasive, Ms. Pitzel. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is 72. Respiratory rate is 16. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Balance is within normal limits. Coordination appears intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits.
PATIENT: Okay. That all sounds… good, I suppose? I don’t really know what any of that means, but if you say it’s good, I trust you. Is something wrong? It feels like you’re trying to find something, and I’m starting to worry a little. I apologize for my naivete.
DOCTOR: Worry is… unproductive, Ms. Pitzel. The examination was unremarkable, which is, in itself, a positive finding. However, given the persistence of your symptoms, I believe some basic laboratory work is warranted. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level, to start. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes for your fatigue.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Yes, please. Anything to get to the bottom of this. What does that involve? Will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a few commissions I need to finish, so I’m trying to plan accordingly. I’m not trying to rush you, I just… I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: A standard blood draw, Ms. Pitzel. Minimal discomfort – a brief pinprick. The results typically take 3-5 business days, depending on the lab’s workload. I will have the nurse draw the blood before you leave. Until we have the results, I recommend maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and ensuring adequate hydration. Do not self-treat with any over-the-counter remedies before we have a clearer understanding of the underlying cause. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly understood. Regular sleep, hydration, and no self-treating. I can definitely do that. Thank you, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to have a plan, even if it’s just a first step. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if there’s anything else you need to know. I’m happy to provide any information I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I will review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’ll see you when the results are in. Please let me know if anything urgent comes up, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Pitzel.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
