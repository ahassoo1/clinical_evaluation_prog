DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I've been awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s…it’s been quite noticeable, actually. I seem to be constantly reaching for a drink or a snack. It’s a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… okay. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…oh, I'd say about a month ago, maybe a little longer. It wasn't sudden, more of a gradual increase. At first, I just thought I was being more active, but it hasn't let up. It’s still getting worse, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: A month, gradually worsening… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your weight – either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Actually, now that you mention it… I think I've lost a bit. Not a dramatic amount, but my trousers feel a little looser than usual. I hadn’t really paid it much mind, to be perfectly truthful, as I’ve been… preoccupied with other things. My divorce was finalised recently.
DOCTOR: I see. That certainly adds some stress. Weight loss with increased thirst and hunger… Okay. Have you noticed any changes in how often you’re urinating?
PATIENT: Yes, actually! That’s another thing. I’m going to the bathroom much more often than I used to. Especially at night. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I'm up several times a night, which is new. It's tiring, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Increased urination, particularly at night… Alright. And are you experiencing any blurred vision, or increased fatigue, beyond what you’d expect with disrupted sleep?
PATIENT: Blurred vision…not consistently, but I have noticed things seeming a little…off, now and then. Like I need to squint more. As for fatigue…well, yes. I’m tired a lot, but I put that down to everything else, if I'm honest. The divorce, the constant thirst, getting up all night... it all adds up. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor? I'd like to get this sorted as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Mr. Erxleben. What you’re describing raises some concerns, and we need to investigate further. It’s too early to say definitively, but these symptoms are consistent with… well, let’s not jump to conclusions. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and then order some blood work to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly sensible. A physical exam and blood work… whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to understand what's going on and get it resolved. The sooner, the better, if you don't mind. I have…commitments, you see. And I’d rather not have this hanging over me any longer than necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step over here, we’ll start with your vitals and a brief physical. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and just check a few things. It shouldn’t take long. Let’s start with your blood pressure…
PATIENT: Right, of course. Blood pressure first. It’s… a bit chilly in here, isn’t it? Not that I’m complaining, mind you. Just… noticing.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and again… Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. I'm going to check your reflexes now… and your feet… Any numbness or tingling in your extremities?
PATIENT: No numbness or tingling, no. Everything feels…normal, aside from the thirst and fatigue, of course. Just a bit tired, generally. And a bit… anxious, if I'm honest, about what you might find. But I suppose that’s only natural. Is my blood pressure usually this high, do you think? I don’t recall ever having it checked before.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. As for your blood pressure, it's slightly elevated, but one reading isn't definitive. We'll want to monitor it over time. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Alright. Everything seems normal on initial examination, but the blood work will give us a much clearer picture. I'll order a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a hemoglobin A1c. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly sensible. A complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and… a hemoglobin A1c. I’m not familiar with those, but if you recommend them, I trust your judgement. The sooner we get the results, the better, if that's possible. I have a…rather busy schedule, you see. Will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood work. No food or drinks, except water. The lab will give you specific instructions when you go. Here’s the requisition form. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the right. Once the results are back, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. It usually takes a couple of days. Now, while we're waiting for the results, try to drink plenty of water, but avoid sugary drinks. And if you experience any unusual symptoms – blurred vision worsens significantly, extreme fatigue, nausea, or vomiting – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Right, fasting for eight hours and no sugary drinks. I can manage that. And I will contact the clinic if anything worsens. Thank you. As for allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. I’m not one for taking pills unless absolutely necessary, to be honest. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime, Doctor? Or anything I should specifically avoid?
DOCTOR: No, not at this point. Just focus on staying hydrated and getting some rest when you can. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption, and try to manage your stress levels as best you can. We'll get these results back and formulate a plan from there. It’s important to remember that these are just initial observations, and we don't have enough information yet to make a definitive diagnosis. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I’ll go and get the blood work done as soon as possible. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. You take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day. .
