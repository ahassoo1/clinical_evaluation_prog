DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling awfully sleepy during the day, even though I’m using one of those machines at night for my sleep apnea. It just doesn’t seem to be helping as much as it used to, and it’s… well, it’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea – that is something we should look into. First, let's talk a bit more about this sleepiness. When did you first notice it becoming a problem again?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe… three months ago, I’d say? It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual thing. At first, I just felt a little more tired than usual, you know? But it’s gotten worse since then. Now, I find myself dozing off in my chair after lunch sometimes. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. And my wife – well, she worries, naturally. She's the one who pointed it out, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. It's helpful to know it's been gradual and your wife has noticed it too. And it’s good she’s keeping an eye on things! Can you describe how you feel when you’re sleepy?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a sudden urge to fall asleep, not usually. More like… a heavy feeling in my eyelids, and a real lack of energy. Everything feels… muffled, if that makes sense? It’s hard to concentrate, and I just feel… sluggish, I guess. Sometimes I’ll be reading, and I realize I've re-read the same paragraph three times because my mind just wanders. And then there are those times, after lunch especially, when I just… drift off. It doesn’t last long, maybe five or ten minutes, but it’s unsettling. It's not a refreshing nap, either. I wake up feeling groggy, if anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy eyelids, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and that grogginess even after a short nap… that gives me a clearer picture. Now, let’s talk about the CPAP machine itself. How often do you use it?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm very good about using it. I use it every single night. Well, almost every night. There have been maybe… two or three nights in the last year when I forgot it while travelling, but other than that, it’s on. I make sure the mask fits properly, and I clean it regularly. I even got one of those little apps that tracks how much I use it, and it always says I’m doing well. I think the number is usually around seven or eight hours a night, sometimes a little more. I really try to stick with it, because I know how important it is.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Paske. Consistent use is really important, and seven to eight hours is a good amount. The fact that you're tracking it and maintaining a good routine is great. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you snore?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I always have. Even before I was diagnosed with the sleep apnea, my wife used to complain about it. She said it sounded like a freight train coming through the bedroom! The machine has definitely helped reduce it, but I still do a little bit, I think. She's still in a separate room, you see. Partly because of the snoring, and partly because… well, she’s a light sleeper. It's been better since the machine, though. Much, much better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some residual snoring despite the CPAP. Thank you. Now, I’m going to ask you a few general health questions. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I've actually lost a little weight, I think. Maybe five or ten pounds over the last few months. It wasn't intentional, really. I haven’t been eating much differently, but I’ve been walking a bit more, trying to stay active. My appetite hasn't been as good, either, now that I think about it. Nothing drastic, just… less hungry than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite. That’s good information to have. Now, have you been experiencing any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, not really. No headaches, no dizziness. My vision is… well, it’s not what it used to be, of course. I'm 83, Doctor! But it hasn't gotten any worse recently. I get my eyes checked every year, and the doctor says it's just normal age-related stuff. Nothing sudden or alarming. I wear glasses for reading, and that works just fine.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, have you noticed any changes in your mood – feeling more depressed or anxious than usual?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I have been a little more… withdrawn lately, I suppose. Not really depressed, not exactly. But I don't have the energy to socialize as much, and I find myself spending more time alone. It’s probably just the tiredness, honestly. And… well, my daughter lives quite a distance away, and I haven't seen her in a while. I miss her. But no, I wouldn’t say I’m anxious. Just… a bit down sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Paske. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological exam. It will just take a few minutes. Then we can discuss what might be going on and what steps we should take. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement completely. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if there's anything uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske, take a nice deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breathing is somewhat shallow. Blood pressure is 130/80. That's a little elevated, but not concerningly so. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that's common for your age. Balance is stable. No obvious focal neurological deficits noted. Throat looks clear, no obvious signs of infection. Ears are clear as well. Okay, Mr. Paske. Everything seems generally okay on initial examination, but given your symptoms – the daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use, unintentional weight loss, decreased appetite, and somewhat low mood – I think we need to investigate this a bit further. I want to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, blood sugar, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work sounds perfectly fine. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate this properly. It’s reassuring to know you’re taking it seriously. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Do I need to fast, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s my job. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is okay. We’ll schedule the blood work for first thing tomorrow morning, so you can fast overnight. I’ll also send a prescription to your pharmacy for a vitamin D supplement. Many people your age are deficient in vitamin D, and it can contribute to fatigue and low mood. It's a relatively harmless supplement, and it may help you feel a bit better while we’re waiting for the blood work results. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds very reasonable. Fast overnight and the vitamin D… I can certainly manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And for sending the prescription, that’s very thoughtful. I suppose we just wait for the results now. How long will that take, roughly? And will I need to schedule another appointment to discuss them?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could clarify things. The blood work results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. I will have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. If everything looks normal, we can discuss them over the phone. However, if there are any concerning findings, I will want to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in person and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any dizziness, confusion, or shortness of breath – please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your thoroughness. I feel much better knowing we're getting this checked out. I appreciate your kindness and patience with an old man like me. I'll just wait for the nurse to call. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was my pleasure. And please don’t think of yourself as an “old man”! You’re a very active and engaged patient, and I appreciate you taking such good care of your health. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon. .
