DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s getting worse, you see. My legs, mostly. It’s hard to explain, but it feels like they just… don’t want to go sometimes. It’s been happening for a while now, but lately it's a little more than usual.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness in your legs that's been progressively worsening. That's certainly something we should investigate. When you say it's been happening for a while, could you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe five years ago? Just a little bit of trouble with balance, you know. I thought it was just getting old! But then it started being harder to walk long distances. Now, even getting up from a chair sometimes takes a little effort. It's not every day, mind you, but… more often than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Five years of progressive weakness, starting with balance issues and now affecting your ability to rise from a chair. That's helpful information. Can you describe the weakness itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… pain, exactly. It’s more like… heavy. Like my legs are filled with sand. And sometimes they feel… numb? Not all the time, but especially when I’ve been trying to walk for a bit. It's hard to explain. Like they just… don’t listen when I tell them to move. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astores. Heavy, numb, and a feeling of not responding when you try to move them. We call that subjective weakness. Now, is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are better than others. Like today, it's not too bad. But a few weeks ago, I had a day where I really struggled just getting around the house. My wife had to help me. It doesn't happen all the time, thankfully, but… it worries me when it does.
DOCTOR: Intermittent weakness, with some days being significantly worse than others. That’s important to know. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think… resting helps. If I sit down for a while, it gets a little better. And walking in the water, at the pool, that seems to help too. It's easier on my legs, you know? But walking on uneven ground? That's definitely bad. And… being tired makes it worse. If I don't get enough sleep, I can feel it the next day.
DOCTOR: Rest and water therapy seem to help, while uneven ground and fatigue worsen the symptoms. Very good. Now, I’d like to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your bladder or bowel function?
PATIENT: Oh… bladder and bowel? Well… now that you mention it… sometimes it feels like it takes a little longer to… empty my bladder. And… I’ve had a few accidents. Small ones, thankfully, but… it’s been happening more often lately. I didn’t really think much of it, just thought it was old age again!
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty emptying your bladder and some recent episodes of incontinence. That’s important information, Mr. Astores. Now, have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My feet… sometimes they feel like they’re asleep. Especially at night. And… I get a little tingling in my fingers sometimes too. Not all the time, but it’s been happening more often lately. It’s not painful, just… strange. It’s like pins and needles, you know?
DOCTOR: Pins and needles sensation in your feet and fingers. And is this sensation constant, or does it come and go like the weakness?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, Doctor. It’s worse at night, like I said. And if I’m walking for a long time, it can start up then too. It doesn't happen every time, but… it’s definitely something I’ve noticed. My wife noticed it too, she keeps telling me to tell you everything!
DOCTOR: That’s good of her, Mr. Astores. It's always helpful to have a second perspective. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bad flu when I was younger, but nothing serious. And my blood pressure was a little high for a while, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been okay ever since. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. I’ve never been a sickly man, really. Just getting old now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and an appendectomy in your youth. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take a little white pill every morning for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knees, when they bother me. Just ibuprofen, over the counter. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always says I’m too tough to be allergic to anything! She jokes, of course. But no, I don't have any allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And my older brother… he had some trouble walking when he got older. The doctor said it was something with his nerves, I think. But that's about all I can think of. My family… we're mostly healthy people, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in your mother and some nerve issues in your brother. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be a very active man. I was a trainer, you see. Worked with athletes for many years. But I’ve slowed down a bit in recent years. I still try to walk as much as I can, and I like to spend time with my grandchildren. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Active lifestyle, no smoking, and moderate alcohol consumption. Now, Mr. Astores, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, we’ll start with your reflexes. Then I'll check your strength and coordination. It won't take long. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, could you please let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here I go.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's check your ankle reflexes. Ankle reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist as I try to move your legs. Strength is 5 out of 5 in both legs, meaning full strength. However, I notice some mild resistance to movement, particularly with dorsiflexion of your feet. Coordination is slightly impaired with the heel-to-shin test. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. I notice some mild swelling in both feet and decreased sensation to light touch on the outer aspects of your feet.
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s interesting. I have noticed my feet feeling a little numb sometimes, like you said. And they do get swollen if I stand for too long. I didn't really think much of it. So, what does all this mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Astores, based on the physical exam and your history, several possibilities come to mind. The combination of weakness, numbness, swelling, and impaired coordination suggests a possible peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. The mild resistance to movement could indicate some underlying muscle weakness as well. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, or vascular issues. I recommend some blood work to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. We should also consider an electromyography and nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves more precisely. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work and… what was the other thing? EMG? Sounds complicated. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. I want to know what’s going on. I just don't want anything too painful, if possible. And… what does all this mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Astores. An EMG is a painless procedure where we use small electrodes to measure the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. It doesn’t hurt, though you may feel some slight discomfort. As for what it means, it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. Peripheral neuropathy can have many causes, some of which are easily treatable, while others require more ongoing management. The good news is that we can identify the cause and develop a plan to help manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. I’m going to order the blood work now. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist for the EMG and nerve conduction study. They’re the specialists in this area and can provide a more detailed assessment. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to stay active as much as possible, elevating your feet when you’re resting, and avoiding activities that worsen your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. Staying active, elevating my feet… I can do that. And I’ll see the specialist. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. When should I expect to hear back about the blood work?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could help. The blood work results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. My office will contact you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and the neurologist’s recommendations. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you experience any new symptoms, such as severe pain, weakness, or loss of bowel or bladder control, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting it checked out. Thank you again for your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Here is a summary of our discussion and the plan moving forward, and a copy of the referral to the neurologist. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too.
