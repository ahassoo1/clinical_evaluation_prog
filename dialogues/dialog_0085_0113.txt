DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Segretto is the name. Honestly, it's just… the bathroom. I seem to be going awfully often these days. It's a nuisance, really. Not how a man should be spending his time, you know? Used to be able to go a good stretch without a worry. Now… well, you get the picture. It's just… frequent. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. It is disruptive when things change like that. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. Let me think. It's… all the time, practically. Especially at night. Wakes my wife up, poor thing. I get the urge, and then… well, gotta go. Not a lot each time, mind you. Just… often. And I drink a normal amount, I suppose. Not like I’m guzzling water all day, if that’s what you're thinking. I always have, though. Always liked a glass of water with my meals. Can't remember exactly when it started getting worse, to be honest. Things blur these days. Is this helping? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Segretto. That’s all very helpful information. So, frequent urination, especially at night – we call that nocturia – and not a large volume each time. And it’s been gradual, so it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. You mentioned you always drink a normal amount of water with your meals. Do you notice any urgency, like you have to go right away when you feel the urge, or is it more of a gradual feeling?
PATIENT: Urgency… yes, now that you mention it. It is urgent. Not always, but often. Like I can't… hold it. It’s unpleasant. Makes it hard to get out and about, you know? Can’t go far without worrying about finding a… well, you understand. It’s not a comfortable feeling, let me tell you. And it's a bit embarrassing, too. A man shouldn't have to worry about these things. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It's just… inconvenient. Very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Segretto. It sounds very frustrating. The urgency is a key piece of information. Now, let’s try to get a broader picture. Do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Burning… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. Nothing like that. Just… the frequent need to go. And the urgency, of course. It's not painful, just… bothersome. A real bother. Sometimes a little bit of… strain, maybe? But that could just be my age, you know? Things don't work quite like they used to. I’m seventy-four, Doctor. Things are bound to… loosen up a bit. I don't want to complain, but it's just… these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning, perhaps a little strain. That's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color or smell… now there’s a question. I don't spend a lot of time looking at my urine, Doctor. Honestly. I go to the bathroom, and… well, that’s about it. It looks… normal, I suppose. Yellowish. And the smell… smells like urine. I haven't noticed anything unusual. My wife might notice things like that, she's got a better nose than me, but she hasn’t said anything. Are you asking if it’s… cloudy or something? I really don’t know. I’m a farmer, not a… a urine expert. Is that a thing?
DOCTOR: No, you're not expected to be a urine expert, Mr. Segretto! It's just part of gathering information. So, no noticeable changes in color or smell. Okay. Now, let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any health conditions like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. The doctor mentioned something about that a few years back, but I think it was just a scare. Something about my blood sugar being a little high at one appointment. He said to watch my diet, so I tried. Didn't last long, though. Too fond of my perogies, I’m afraid. Heart… well, my heart feels alright. Gets a bit fluttery sometimes when I’m doing heavy work, but that's to be expected. I’ve always been a bit… robust. Nothing a good nap can’t fix. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor much. Don’t see the point if I feel alright. Mostly just aches and pains, you know? Old age. That's what it is. Do you need a list? My wife keeps track of these things, but it’s… somewhere. In a pile, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past mention of slightly high blood sugar, and some heart flutters with exertion. We'll definitely want to look into that blood sugar. And just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. That’s about it. No major surgeries, nothing like that. Hospitalized… I was in for a few days after the arm, but that was… sixty years ago? Something like that. Nothing recent, Doctor. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Spent most of my life working on the farm, so I haven’t had much time for… hospitals. And I prefer it that way. A man needs his land, you know? Can’t run a farm from a hospital bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child, and a broken arm. That’s good to know. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any health problems, like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tough one. My mother… she passed away when I was young, heart problems, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember much about it. My father… he lived to be a good age, but he wasn't one for doctors either. Never complained about much, as I recall. My brother… he's still alive, but we don’t see each other much. He lives out west somewhere. Never talks about his health, even if he wanted to. My children… they’re all healthy, as far as I know. Busy with their own lives, don’t bother much with their old man. So… not much help, I’m afraid. My family weren’t big on talking about these things. Too busy working, I suppose. Is this important? I feel like I'm rambling again.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling, Mr. Segretto. It's helpful information even if it's limited. So, a mother who passed away from heart problems, and a generally healthy family who don't discuss health much. Okay. Now, I just need to ask a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was against it, said it was a waste of good money. And I always listened to my father. Bad for the lungs, you know? And I need my lungs for working on the farm. No, never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t care for people who do, either. Smells terrible. Now, alcohol… that's a different story. A glass of horilka with my perogies on a special occasion, maybe. But nothing excessive. A man needs a little something to warm him up in the winter, you know? But nothing that would cause any trouble. Now, what else did you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional horilka. Good to know. And one last quick thing. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. My wife gives me a little pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. But I forget to take it half the time. She gets annoyed with me about that. And I take something for my knees, when they're acting up. But that's just an ointment, you rub it on. Nothing serious. Oh, and I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I can’t remember when I last bought a bottle. It's somewhere in the kitchen, probably. That’s about it, Doctor. I don’t like taking a lot of pills. Makes me feel… sluggish. Now, is that all? I'm starting to feel a bit tired. These questions are making my head spin.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blood pressure pill sometimes, ointment for your knees, and a multivitamin occasionally. Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A quick exam. Fine. Just don't poke and prod too much, eh? An old man's bones aren't what they used to be. And try to be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. Farm doesn't run itself. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. Though, I must say, you look a bit young to be a doctor. Are you sure you're qualified? No offense meant, mind you. Just… observing.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Segretto. I understand your concerns. I assure you, I am qualified. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. It shouldn’t take long. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, if you could take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen… Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Abdomen… hmm. A little tender, maybe? But that could just be from all the work I do. It always feels a bit… sore. Not a sharp pain, mind you. Just… discomfort. Like a dull ache. And it feels… bloated, maybe? Like I’ve eaten too much perogies. Which, admittedly, I sometimes do. But nothing to worry about, I wouldn't think. I've had a strong stomach all my life. Can we get this over with? I’m starting to feel a bit… restless. And I have a feeling the cows are getting into trouble. They’re mischievous creatures, you know. Always finding a way to escape.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness and bloating in the abdomen. I’m just going to palpate your prostate now, this will give me some information. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but that is common for men your age. No nodules or tenderness. Alright, Mr. Segretto, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. That's an enlarged prostate, which is very common as men get older. It can cause frequent urination, urgency, and difficulty emptying your bladder. The slight enlargement I felt on the exam supports that. However, the bloating you mentioned and your history of occasional high blood sugar warrants further investigation. To rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a blood test to check your blood sugar and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Benign… what did you call it? Enlarged… something? Sounds serious. But you said it’s common, so… I suppose that’s good. And tests? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a fan of tests. They always make me anxious. And what about my bloating? Is that from the… enlarged thing? Or is it something else? And the cows! What if they escape while I'm getting poked and prodded at? I need to be home to keep an eye on them. Fine. Tests. But make them quick, eh? And tell me what they're for, in plain English. No fancy medical terms, if you don't mind. I'm a farmer, not a doctor. Just want to get this over with and get back to my land. And, please, tell me if it's something serious. I need to know if I should be worried. Though I don’t know what I’d do if I had to sell the farm… it’s been in the family for generations.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Segretto. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about tests, and I’ll explain everything in plain English. The BPH – Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia – means your prostate gland is enlarged. It's not cancer, it’s just a common part of aging. It can press on your bladder, causing the symptoms you're experiencing. We need the tests to rule out other possibilities. The urine analysis will check for infection, and the blood test will check your blood sugar and kidney function. The bloating could be related to the BPH, or it could be something else entirely, which is why the tests are important. The blood test is a simple draw, and the urine analysis is just a sample. We can get those done quickly at the lab right down the hall. It shouldn't take long at all. In the meantime, I recommend drinking less fluid before bedtime and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as those can irritate your bladder. And don't worry about the cows. You focus on getting this checked out, and I'm sure everything will be alright with them. Would you like me to write down those recommendations for you?
PATIENT: Write them down, yes, please. My memory isn’t what it used to be. And less fluid before bed… that’ll be tough. I like a glass of water with my perogies, even at night. But I suppose I can try. And no caffeine… that won't be a problem. I don’t care for coffee much anyway. So, enlarged something, tests, less water, no caffeine. Is that it? And you said it’s not… serious? Not cancer? Just an old man thing? Because if it’s not cancer, I’ll feel a lot better. Honestly, Doctor, you have no idea how much that would relieve my anxiety. This farm… it's all I have left of my family. I need to be strong for it. Now, where is this lab you mentioned? And how long will these tests take? I need to get back to the land before… well, before disaster strikes. Those cows are capable of anything, you know.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Segretto. "Drink less fluid before bedtime, especially caffeinated beverages and alcohol. See lab for urine analysis and blood work ." Yes, it’s not cancer. It’s a very common condition as men age, and it’s usually manageable. We can discuss treatment options – like medication or lifestyle changes – once we have the test results back. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. It shouldn't take long – about 15-20 minutes for both tests. They'll need you to fast for the blood test, so you haven't eaten anything for at least eight hours before. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results in a few days. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: Fasting… eight hours? Oh dear. That means no breakfast? No lunch? I usually have a hearty lunch. That’s going to be tough. But… alright, eight hours. I can manage. No breakfast, no lunch. Just tests and… no cows. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… get this over with, eh? And please, tell my wife I said hello. She's probably worried sick. And remind her to keep an eye on the cows. They’re… mischievous, as I said. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient. And you explained everything in plain English, which I appreciate. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a farm to worry about. And a very hungry stomach. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I’m glad I could help. And I will be sure to tell your wife hello. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope your cows behave themselves! Have a good day.
