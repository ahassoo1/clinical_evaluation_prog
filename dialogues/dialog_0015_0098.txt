DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Heindel. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Just… wanted to check things out, you know? Been feelin’ okay, mostly. Just thought it was a good idea to come get a look-see. Never really been sick much, but figured it couldn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: A preventative check-up is… commendable, I suppose. Though typically, people come when something is wrong. Still. “Feeling okay” is rather vague, Mr. Heindel. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yeah, you’re right. Vague is… a good word for it. Uh… well, I work on ships, right? Sailor and… oil stuff. It’s a lot of… movin’ around. Sometimes I get a little tired, but that’s just the work, I think. No pains or nothin’. Just… regular tired. And maybe a little thirsty sometimes, even when I drink water. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Regular tired" and "a little thirsty"… These are symptoms, certainly, but not particularly informative ones. You’ve been working on ships for how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Uh, about five years now. Started right outta… well, nevermind. Five years, give or take. Mostly on the big freighters, goin’ all over. Before that… nothin’ really. Just kinda drifted around. The ship work's steady, though. That's good. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Five years of demanding physical labor, frequently traversing different climates… And you've never had a formal physical examination?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never really… needed one, I guess. Always felt alright enough to keep workin’. Didn’t wanna bother nobody if I wasn't sick. Plus, ships don't really have doctors, you know? Just a first-aid kit and… hope. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It is…suboptimal, Mr. Heindel. Ignoring potential health issues until they become acute is rarely a wise course of action. Let’s start with a basic review of systems. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat when I'm hungry, and I'm hungry pretty regular. Maybe I eat a little less when the work is real hard, but that’s just ‘cause I’m tired. Not like… losin’ weight or not wantin’ food at all. Just… smaller portions sometimes. Does that make sense? I ain't good at explainin' this stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any recent changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Uh… changes? Like… how often? I go when I gotta go. Same as always, I guess. Not… stuck, not… runny. Just… normal. Sorry, this is kinda personal, right? I ain't used to talkin' about this with people.
DOCTOR: It is medically relevant, Mr. Heindel. And frankly, avoiding these questions does not aid in a proper assessment. Any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No to all of that, Doctor. Definitely no to all of it. Never had much luck with gettin’ sick, even when I wanted to. Just… sturdy, I guess. Like a ship. Abdominal pain… nope. Never had that either. I eat pretty good, mostly. Try to, anyway. It's hard on a ship sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination… you mean… peeing? Everything seems normal there, too. Same as always. No burnin’, no… trouble goin’. Just… regular. I drink a lot of water, so I go pretty often. Is that… bad? I’m startin’ to feel like I'm explainin’ my whole life here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, you describe a lack of any specific complaints, yet you've been working a physically demanding job for five years without a physical. It’s… unusual. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Not even as a kid. Mom always said I was too tough to get sick. Just scrapes and bruises, nothin’ serious. I broke my arm once climbin’ a tree, but that was when I was little. They just put a cast on it. That's it. No big deal. Never needed nothin’ more than that.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries either. Never had to go under the knife. Always managed to heal up on my own. Mom said I had a gift for it. I guess I just got lucky. Never needed to bother with doctors or hospitals, so I never really did. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's discuss your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Mom passed away a few years back. Sad thing, real sad. Dad… well, I don’t really talk to my dad. Haven’t seen him since I was a kid. He wasn’t around much. As for what happened to her… she had… problems with her heart, I think. Always tired, always short of breath. Never really knew much about it. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: And did your mother’s heart problems have a formal diagnosis?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so, Doctor. She just… got weaker and weaker. Went to the hospital a few times, but they never really told us what was wrong. Just… said it was her heart. Back then, we didn’t have much money for fancy tests or nothin’. Just… did what we could. She had a good heart, though. Real good. That’s all I really know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched a cigarette in my life. Always figured it was a bad habit. Besides, workin' on a ship, you gotta have good lungs, right? Can't be coughin' and wheezin' when you're climbin' ladders and movin' cargo. Don't drink much either, come to think of it. Couple of beers with the guys sometimes, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No ma’am. Never have, never will. Not my thing. I stay busy enough with work, and… well, I just don’t need that kind of trouble. Always been a pretty straight-laced kinda guy, if you know what I mean. Work's enough excitement for me. Is that what you're gettin' at, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no medications at all. Never been on anythin’ in my life. Just… tough as nails, I guess. Mom always said I was a miracle worker when it came to healin’. Seriously. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I feel like I've told you my whole life story here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, with all due respect, a lack of complaints does not equate to good health. Given your family history of cardiac issues, your physically demanding occupation, and the complete absence of prior medical evaluations, I recommend a comprehensive workup. This will include an electrocardiogram, a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a chest X-ray. We will also need to check your blood pressure and conduct a thorough physical examination. Do you agree to this?
PATIENT: Uh… well, that sounds like a lot. And kinda scary, if I’m bein’ honest. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yeah. I guess so. I just… don’t wanna hear nothin’ bad, you know? But I trust your judgment. If you think I need it, then let’s do it. How long is all that gonna take? And is it gonna cost a lot? I don’t have a ton of money, you see.
DOCTOR: The tests themselves will take approximately two hours. As for the cost, I will have the billing department contact you directly regarding your insurance coverage and potential out-of-pocket expenses. Now, if you will follow me, we can begin with the physical examination. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, sure. Two hours… that’s not too bad, I guess. Alright. Here we go… Just let me know if you need anything, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Please take deep, slow breaths.
PATIENT: Okay… deep breaths… Like this? Is everything alright? I always feel kinda weird when people listen to my chest.
DOCTOR: Your respiratory sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute. Blood pressure is 130/85. Now, let's examine your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back.
PATIENT: Okay, lie flat… Alright, I’m flat. Is that okay? What are you lookin’ for in my abdomen? I always get kinda ticklish there.
DOCTOR: I am assessing for tenderness, masses, and organomegaly. Any pain or discomfort with palpation?
PATIENT: Nope… no pain yet. Just… kinda weird feelin’, you know? Like… somebody’s pressin’ on my stomach. But nothin’ painful. Ooh… that’s a little… firm there. But still not really painful. Just… noticeable. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Your lower abdomen is slightly firm to palpation. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Like… when you hit your knee with that thing? I always hated that thing. What are you lookin’ for in my reflexes? I’m not very good at those things, if I’m bein’ honest.
DOCTOR: It is a simple neurological assessment. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay, relaxing… Oh… that tickles! See? I told you I wasn’t good at those things. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. That is within normal limits. Now, let’s check for any swelling in your legs and feet.
PATIENT: Swelling… nope, don’t think so. My feet get kinda puffy sometimes after a long shift, but that goes away pretty quick. Nope, nothin’ right now. My legs feel alright. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just from work. No swelling, I promise.
DOCTOR: Alright. The physical examination is complete. Based on my initial assessment, your vital signs are stable, but your heart rate is slightly elevated and your abdomen is slightly firm to palpation. Given your family history and lack of prior medical evaluations, I recommend ordering a comprehensive blood workup, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Uh… all those tests… sounds like a lot. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yeah. Okay, I consent. I just… I hope everything’s alright. I don’t wanna hear nothin’ bad, you know? What’s the next step? And how long is all this gonna take? I gotta get back to work eventually.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have the laboratory technician draw a sample of your blood. The electrocardiogram and chest X-ray will be performed in the radiology department. The entire process should take approximately two to three hours. After the results are available, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Please, do not hesitate to contact the clinic immediately if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms. A nurse will be with you shortly to collect your blood sample.
PATIENT: Okay… two to three hours… alright. Chest pain, shortness of breath… I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to check me out. I hope everything’s alright.
