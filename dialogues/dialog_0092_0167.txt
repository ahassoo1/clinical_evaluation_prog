DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're with Medicare and we’re located in the suburban clinic. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, Stoegbauer is the name. It is nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot… it’s been bothering me. A sore, really. A bad one. It won’t heal, and it’s quite painful. My wife, she used to take care of it, but… well, she’s gone now. That was… a little while back. I think the doctor before said something about… the sugar? In my blood? I don’t remember all the details.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Stoegbauer. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. We'll take our time today, and get to the bottom of this foot sore. You mentioned the previous doctor spoke about “sugar” in your blood, which likely refers to your blood sugar levels. This could be related to diabetes, and it's something we'll definitely investigate. To start, could you describe the sore on your foot for me?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. It is hard. The sore… it’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes, I think. It’s… red around the edges. And it’s deep. Not a little scratch, you understand? It feels… warm sometimes, and it aches. Mostly when I try to walk. It’s been there for… oh, I don’t know. Weeks, maybe months? I stopped looking at it so much. It just… doesn’t get better.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that description, Mr. Stoegbauer. A sore that doesn’t heal, particularly one that’s red, warm, and deep, is something we need to take seriously. To get a better understanding of the situation, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… yes. A little bit. It’s… not much, usually. Clearish, I think. Sometimes a little bit… yellow? I’ve been keeping it covered with a bandage, like the other doctor told me. It makes a mess, you see. I try to keep it clean. I don’t want an infection.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’re keeping it covered and trying to keep it clean. Any drainage, even a little, is something we need to be aware of. And yellow drainage could indicate an infection. Mr. Stoegbauer, do you have any pain in other parts of your body, or any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Well, my legs ache sometimes. Old age, I suppose. But not always. And… yes, a little tingling in my feet. Not bad, usually. Just… like pins and needles, you know? More in the toes, I think. It comes and goes. I thought it was just… bad circulation. My wife used to rub my feet. That helped.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot. That tingling sensation, along with the aching legs, is important information. It could certainly be related to circulation, but we need to investigate further. Mr. Stoegbauer, do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as heart problems, kidney problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me about that years ago. I take a little pill for it, every day. And… I think something about my kidneys? Not sure, really. It was a long time ago. The doctor kept changing, you see. My wife took care of all the papers and remembering the details. I mostly just took the pills she gave me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s common to forget details, especially over time and with different doctors. We can review your medication list to be sure, and I'll check your records to get a better understanding of your medical history. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it's a little white pill. Small one. I believe… it starts with an ‘A’? No, maybe a ‘L’? Oh dear, this is difficult. I get them all mixed up. I take one every morning with my breakfast. It’s in a little bottle. That’s about all I can tell you, Doctor. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Don't worry about it at all. We can figure it out. I’m going to take a look at your records now. Okay, I see here you are currently taking Lisinopril for your high blood pressure. And there's a history of mild kidney disease. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your foot, if that's alright with you. I'll need to take a look at the sore, and check the circulation in your feet. It won’t be painful, I promise.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine, Doctor. Lisinopril, you say? Yes, that might be it. And yes, you can look at my foot. Be gentle, please? It’s quite sensitive. I don't want any more pain, if you don't mind. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. I will be very gentle. Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. The sore is located on the plantar surface of your foot, near the base of your fifth toe. It’s approximately 2 centimeters in diameter and appears to be full thickness, extending down to the deeper tissues. I’m detecting a weak pulse in your right foot, which is concerning, and there is diminished sensation in your toes. There's some redness and warmth surrounding the sore. Based on this exam, it appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer. The weak pulse and diminished sensation suggest poor circulation, which is common in patients with diabetes. The ulcer itself is showing signs of possible infection.
PATIENT: Diabetic… ulcer? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Poor circulation, you say? That’s what my wife said, years ago. She worried about my feet. Infection, too? Now that’s not good, is it? What… what does that mean, Doctor? What do we do about it?
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, Mr. Stoegbauer. It is serious, but we can definitely manage it. A diabetic foot ulcer is a wound that develops on the foot of someone with diabetes, often due to poor circulation and nerve damage. The infection is a concern because it can spread and lead to more serious complications. The diminished sensation makes it difficult for you to detect problems like this early on. That’s why regular foot exams are so important. To determine the extent of the infection, and whether it has spread to the bone, we need to perform some tests. I’d like to order a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and white blood cell count. And we’ll need to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any bone infection. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, that’s alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood test and an X-ray. My sugar levels… I haven’t had those checked in a while. I think the last doctor just told me to watch what I eat. Is it going to… hurt? The X-ray, I mean. And the blood test? I don’t like needles very much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's good we're checking those levels now. The X-ray will not hurt at all. You’ll just need to stand still for a few moments while the machine takes the pictures. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, but it's usually very quick, and most people don’t feel much discomfort. We'll take it slow and be as gentle as possible. I'll also need to clean and dress the wound today to prevent further infection. It’s important to keep it covered and clean. Based on the results of the tests, we can discuss the best course of treatment. Depending on the severity of the infection, that could involve antibiotics, wound care, and potentially a referral to a podiatrist or vascular surgeon. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so, Doctor. X-ray, blood test, cleaning the sore… antibiotics if needed. A podia… what was it? Someone who looks at feet? It sounds… like a lot. But I suppose it’s best to get it checked out. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. My wife… she used to handle all this. It’s a little overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly understandable that it feels overwhelming, especially without your wife’s help. A podiatrist is a doctor who specializes in the care of feet. They can help with wound care and other foot problems. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll write down all the instructions for you, and my nursing staff can help schedule the tests and any necessary appointments. We're here to support you through this. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, as we discussed, and that’s about it. I sometimes take something for aches and pains, but just over the counter. Nothing fancy. Is… is this going to be expensive? I worry about the cost, you see. Medicare… it doesn’t always cover everything.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Stoegbauer. I understand. We will do everything we can to work within your Medicare coverage. I’ll write down the codes for the tests and procedures, and my billing staff can help you understand what costs will be covered. They can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests ordered and a plan in place. I’ll write the orders for the blood test and X-ray, and I’ll have the nursing staff schedule them for you. They’ll also clean and dress the wound for you today. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very well. Just… thank you. I appreciate your kindness. And your patience. It’s… it’s nice to know someone is taking care of me. Let’s get those tests done, then. The sooner, the better, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm happy to help. Alright, let me get those orders written up. The nursing staff will be in shortly to take your blood pressure and get you set up for the tests. I will review the results as soon as they become available and we will discuss a treatment plan at that time. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… thank you again. I’ll just sit here quietly while I wait for the nurse, then. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
