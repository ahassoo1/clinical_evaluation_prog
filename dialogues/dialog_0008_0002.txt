DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… well, it's my waterworks. They’re not working so good, you see. It’s hard to… push it out. Does that make sense? I forget things easily, so I hope I’m explaining it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Ms. Stoffregen. So you’re having difficulty with urination – feeling like you can’t empty your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Emptying… yes. It feels like there’s always a little bit left, even when I try. It’s been… a while now. Not suddenly, you know? It just got harder and harder. I don't know when it started, exactly. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily just old age, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about how it’s difficult?
PATIENT: How it’s difficult… hmm. Well, it takes a long time to start, sometimes. I have to… strain a bit. And the stream isn’t very strong, like a little dribble at first. Then it gets a little better, but never really powerful, you see? It’s just… weak. And like I said, never feels like it’s all gone. Does that help? I'm trying my best to remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… in the color? I don’t… I don’t really look, Doctor. My husband, he does the looking, usually. He'd tell me if it was anything funny, I suppose. He hasn't said anything lately. It looks… yellow, I think? Like it always does. I really don’t pay much attention. Sorry. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. We can figure things out together. Okay, let’s talk about other things. Have you been having any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really pain. Sometimes a little… discomfort, maybe? Like a little ache afterward. But not burning, no. It’s not sharp or anything. Just… a little sore feeling. Not all the time, though. Only sometimes. I’m sorry I can’t be more clear. My memory… it’s like trying to hold water in my hands.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll take our time. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven’t felt warm. And no chills. My husband would have noticed, he always knows when I'm too hot or too cold. And my tummy… no pain there. Just feels… old, you know? Like it’s tired. Not a sharp pain, just… achy sometimes. Like after a big meal. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I take something for my… my bones, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my knee acts up, I take something for that too. It’s a little pink one. But that’s it, I think. My doctor, Dr. Aalona, she gives them to me. I don't write things down, you see. My husband usually remembers what I take, but he’s not here today.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you know the names of those medications, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I really don't. I just take what Dr. Aalona gives me. She tells me what they are for, but I forget the names right away. They come in little bottles, and I just… take them when I need to. One is for the bones, and one is for the knee. That’s all I can tell you, I’m afraid. I'm so sorry. It's getting harder and harder to remember these things. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen, don’t worry. We can check your medication list in our system. Now, just one more question for now. Have you had any recent changes in your bowel habits – any constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… oh dear. Well, I go when I need to. Sometimes it’s a little hard, you know? I drink a lot of water, so it’s usually not too bad. And no… no diarrhea. Not recently. Just… sometimes a little effort. Old age, maybe? Everything gets a little slower, doesn't it? I try not to think about it too much. It’s not a very polite subject, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for answering my questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve checking your abdomen and possibly a quick neurological check. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And it won’t be… unpleasant, will it? My skin is very sensitive these days. And I don't like being poked and prodded too much. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I trust you. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I will be very gentle. We’ll start with just listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then a quick feel. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. Could you please lie back on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. This is a bit high, isn't it? But it's alright, I can manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. And… be gentle, like you said. My bones are a bit creaky these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. I'm feeling your abdomen now. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. A little… pressure, maybe? Like a dull ache. But it's not sharp, you know? Just… a little uncomfortable. That part feels a little… full, maybe? Like something is pushing out. But it doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… strange. Is that normal? I'm sorry, I'm probably not being very helpful. My tummy is just… old.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen, you’re being very helpful. I’m just checking. I do feel a slight fullness in your lower abdomen, and it does seem a bit tender to the touch. No masses that I can feel right now. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. This won’t hurt a bit. Please keep your legs relaxed. Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Everything seems fairly normal neurologically. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. That’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh… good. It wasn’t too bad, I suppose. A little uncomfortable, but not painful. So… what does it mean, Doctor? Is something seriously wrong? Is it my bladder? Or my tummy? Or… something else? I'm getting a little frightened now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Let’s talk about what we’ve found. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention – difficulty emptying your bladder completely. The diminished reflexes could be contributing to that, and the fullness I felt in your abdomen suggests there’s some urine remaining. Now, it’s important to rule out any infection or blockage. I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for infection, and a bladder scan to see how much urine is actually left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An infection? I don’t feel sick, you know? No fever, no chills… just the trouble with my waterworks. A scan… is that like an X-ray? I don’t like X-rays. They make me nervous. What if it’s something serious? What if I need… surgery? I'm just an old woman, Doctor. I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Let’s take things one step at a time. The urine analysis is just a simple test – we’ll collect a small sample of your urine. And the bladder scan is not an X-ray. It uses sound waves – like an ultrasound – to measure the amount of urine in your bladder. It's completely painless and doesn’t involve any radiation. It’s much too early to talk about surgery. We need to find out what’s causing the problem first. The tests will help us do that. And based on the results, we can discuss the best course of action. It may be something simple – like medication or bladder training. We'll cross that bridge when we get there, alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. No X-rays, that’s good. And no talk of surgery yet. That makes me feel a little better. So… a little sample of my waterworks, and then the sound waves. Can I still drink water? I get very thirsty, you know. And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting for weeks. I have my quilting group on Thursday.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, you can still drink water – in fact, please do! Staying hydrated is important. And we can usually get the urine analysis results back within a few hours. The bladder scan results will be available immediately after the test. I'll have the nurse come in and collect a urine sample from you now. Then, we’ll do the bladder scan. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes altogether. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we can discuss them before you leave. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that sounds alright. A few hours, not weeks. That’s good. And the nurse will help me with the waterworks sample. I’m not very good at these things anymore, you know. My hands shake. Alright, then. Let’s get it over with. I trust you and the nurse, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. And let me know what you find, as soon as you can. I'm getting a little tired now, though. All this talking… it wears me out.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll take it slow and be very gentle. The nurse is very experienced and will help you every step of the way. And I’ll let you know the results as soon as they are available. I’ll go get the nurse now. Just relax, and we’ll take care of everything.
