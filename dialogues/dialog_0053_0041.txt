DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. Doyle Pitmon, I’m your doctor today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Pitmon. Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain exactly. Things just… aren’t working like they used to, you see. My legs, mostly. They feel weak, and it’s getting worse slowly. It makes walking difficult, and I stumble sometimes. It’s been happening for a while now, but it’s definitely not getting any better.
DOCTOR: “Slowly” is a bit vague, Mr. Astores. Can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Just a little bit of tiredness in my legs after a long walk, nothing too serious. But over the last three months, it’s been… more noticeable. It’s not a sudden thing, you understand. It creeps up on you. I used to be able to walk around the market with no problem, now I need to sit down after a little while. And sometimes, even getting out of a chair is a bit of a struggle. It's… worrying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this weakness just in your legs, or do you feel it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Mostly in my legs, yes. But… sometimes my hands feel a little clumsy, too. Not as bad as my legs, mind you. It’s like… I drop things more often than I used to. And I get tired easier, even when I haven't done much. It's hard to explain… just a general feeling of being worn out, you know? It's not pain, thankfully. Just… weakness.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history, Mr. Astores. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have… multiple sclerosis. I was diagnosed many years ago, maybe twenty years now. It's been… quiet for a long time, though. That’s why I didn’t bother the doctor for so long. I thought it was just getting old, you see. But this… this feels different. It feels like the MS is… waking up again.
DOCTOR: Twenty years is a long time to be in remission. And you haven’t had any regular follow-ups with a neurologist during that time, I presume?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s right. After the initial treatment, the doctor said it was… stable. He said to just come back if things changed. And they… hadn’t, until now. I just… I didn't want to bother anyone if everything was alright. It’s foolish, I suppose, but I thought I could manage on my own. I should have kept a closer eye on things, maybe. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Well, hindsight is always twenty-twenty, Mr. Astores. Alright, let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications for the MS, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Like I said, everything was quiet for so long. I didn't need anything, you see? I stopped taking the pills years ago. The doctor said it was okay, that the MS wasn't active. Now… I wish I hadn’t. I'm not sure what to think anymore. It’s all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, I don’t worry too much about food. My wife always makes sure I get good food, though. She worries about me. I try to stay healthy, but… getting old is hard. This weakness… it’s just making everything harder. I hope we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then we'll talk about some possible next steps. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. If you could just follow my instructions. First, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. I’m squeezing as hard as I can. Is that alright? I hope I’m not too strong. My wife says I have strong hands for an old man.
DOCTOR: Not bad. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap your knees with this little hammer. Just relax your legs. Hmm. Slightly diminished on both sides. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There we go. A bit wobbly, maybe. It takes me a moment to get going sometimes. My legs… they just don’t feel as strong as they used to. I hope I’m not causing you too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like that? It’s… harder than it looks, you know. I used to be able to walk for miles. Now, just a few steps tires me out. I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores. Please, sit back down. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it does seem like your MS is…reactivating. The diminished reflexes and weakness are consistent with that. However, we need to confirm this with an MRI. It's the best way to see what’s happening in your brain and spinal cord.
PATIENT: An MRI, you say? Oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? I haven’t had one of those in a long time. Is it painful? My wife… she gets very anxious about these things. I just hope it’s not too bad. What does it mean if it is reactivating? I was hoping it would just be old age.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Astores, an MRI isn’t painful. You lie in a scanner, it’s a bit noisy, but it’s harmless. As for reactivating… it means the disease is becoming active again. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s “bad”, but it does mean we need to manage it. We can discuss treatment options, likely medication, to slow down the progression and minimize symptoms. However, it’s vital we get the MRI first to assess the extent of the activity. I'll order it for you right away. Do you have any metal implants or pacemakers we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. No metal inside me, no pacemakers. Just old bones, I’m afraid. Just the normal wear and tear of a long life. Treatment, you say? Medication? Oh dear. I was hoping to avoid that, if possible. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose I have no choice. My wife will be glad we’re finally getting to the bottom of things, I think. She worries so much. When can I have this MRI, Doctor? I just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m sending the order to the radiology department now. They should call you within 24-48 hours to schedule an appointment. It will likely be within the next week. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a referral to a neurologist. You haven’t seen one in twenty years, and frankly, this is beyond my area of expertise. They will be best suited to manage your long-term care. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: A neurologist, you say? Oh… another doctor. I suppose that makes sense. Twenty years is a long time. But… will they know my history? I’ve been so long without treatment. Will I have to explain everything all over again? I’m just… a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. So many appointments, so many doctors. It’s all happening so fast. I just want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astores, I'll ensure your primary care records are sent along with the referral. The neurologist will have access to your medical history. It’s standard procedure. And yes, you’ll likely need to reiterate some information, but that’s unavoidable. It’s their responsibility to get a complete picture. Look, I've done my initial assessment, and now it’s time for a specialist to take over. I'm happy to provide a summary of our consultation to them. Is there anything else I can do for you at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I suppose not. Just… a summary to the neurologist would be helpful, yes. My wife… she worries about me forgetting things. It’s… an age thing, you know. Thank you for your time, Doctor Pitmon. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I hope this neurologist is a good one. I think I’ll just… take it one step at a time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores. The receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for you after you've seen the neurologist. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any sudden changes in your condition. Have a good day. .
