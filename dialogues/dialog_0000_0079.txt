DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Hainley, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Batara. Thanks. Um, it's my bruising. It's just…worse lately. I’m on something for my blood, you know, to thin it, and I bump into things like normal, but the bruises are staying on longer and looking bigger. It’s a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. On something to thin your blood... and you’re bruising easily. Hmm. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the bruising has always been a thing since I started the medication, which was… March 15th, 2024. But it’s gotten noticeably worse in the last month, maybe six weeks. Like, a regular little knock and I’m looking like I’ve been in a fight! It's a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: March of last year, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. March 15th, 2024. I remember because it was right before my cousin’s wedding and I was trying to make sure I didn't look too beat up in the photos, haha. I didn’t want to worry everyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medication is this, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, um… hold on a sec. I have it written down somewhere… …ah, here we go. It’s Rivaroxaban. 20 milligrams, once a day. The doctor prescribed it after I had a blood clot in my leg.
DOCTOR: Rivaroxaban. Yes, a blood thinner, as you said. And you’ve been on a stable dose since March?
PATIENT: Yes, always 20 milligrams. Never changed it. I’m pretty good about remembering things like that, you know? It's important to take it regularly. I haven't missed a dose, not even once, as far as I can recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the bruising, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No dizziness, no headaches, no bleeding gums or anything like that. Just the bruises. And they seem to be popping up even with really minor bumps. Like, I leaned against the kitchen counter yesterday and had a bruise this morning. It's just…weird.
DOCTOR: Let’s just take a quick look. Okay. Yes, I see what you mean. Some discoloration here, varying shades… and it does seem more extensive than I’d expect. Do you have any family history of bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mom had high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes, but nothing about bleeding. I grew up with a pretty big family, lots of cousins, and no one ever talked about anything like that. Honestly, we mostly talked about rugby!
DOCTOR: Rugby, hmm. Alright. And have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I had a little cold back in January, but that was it. Nothing serious, just a sniffle and a cough for a few days. I took some over-the-counter stuff and it cleared right up. I haven’t been to the hospital or anything since the blood clot, thankfully. I’m trying to stay healthy, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick check of your vital signs. Just routine. Blood pressure is… elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is normal. Temperature is normal. We'll need to run some blood work, of course, to get a clearer picture. A complete blood count and a coagulation panel. Just to see where things stand.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a cousin’s birthday dinner on Saturday and I really don't want to be feeling sick then. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, avoiding anything specific?
DOCTOR: Avoid any activities that could cause injury, obviously. And absolutely no new medications – not even over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or aspirin. They can interfere with the Rivaroxaban. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, but realistically, it will take a couple of days. Try to be careful and let me know immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, heavy periods, blood in your stool, anything like that. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. No ibuprofen, no aspirin, be careful, and call if anything bleeds. Got it. A couple of days is fine. I’m just glad we’re getting it checked out. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the requisition for your blood work. The lab is just down the hall. Once they’ve processed it, the results will be sent directly to me. I'll give you a call as soon as I’ve reviewed them. In the meantime… try not to worry too much. But be sensible. And careful. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor Batara. I will. I appreciate you seeing me so quickly. Bye now.
