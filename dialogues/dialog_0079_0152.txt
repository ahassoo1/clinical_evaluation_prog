DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Now, to what do we owe the honour of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the clinic, actually. Said my cholesterol was a bit high. That's why I'm here. I don’t really know what that means, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A letter, you say. Yes, routine screenings are… important. High cholesterol, while not immediately alarming, does require attention. It's a bit difficult to explain without knowing your specific numbers, but essentially, it’s a fatty substance in your blood. Too much can lead to… complications. Perhaps we should begin with a more detailed history. Do you have any family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My father… he had some heart trouble when he was older. He needed a… a bypass, I think it was. And my mother’s sister, Aunt Riet… she had a stroke, yes. Quite a while ago now. She was a smoker, though. I never smoked myself. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is… relevant. A family history of cardiovascular disease certainly increases your risk. And good for you regarding not smoking. Now, Ms. Geho, let’s discuss your lifestyle. What is your typical diet like?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, some fish… I like potatoes, though. And a little bit of cheese. Not too much. I bake a lot, you see, so there’s usually something sweet around. But I don't eat a lot of red meat, if that makes a difference. I do enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning, too.
DOCTOR: Potatoes and baked goods… understandable. Coffee is… acceptable in moderation. Do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Regular… hmm. I walk. A lot. I live on a farm, you see, so there’s always something to do outside. Checking fences, feeding the chickens… It’s not like going to the gym, but I’m moving around all day, most days. I used to ride my bicycle more, but… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Walking is… beneficial. The farm work counts as activity, certainly. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies to report?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Nothing at all. And allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, really. Apart from this cholesterol thing, of course.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Ms. Geho, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and… briefly palpate your abdomen. Standard procedure, of course. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind. I'm used to being poked and prodded by vets, so this shouldn’t be any different!
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 142/88. Slightly elevated, but not… alarming. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No palpable masses. Now, I would like to order a lipid panel to get a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels. It will include your total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. We'll also check your blood sugar, just to be… thorough.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. A lipid panel… and a blood sugar check. Is that just a normal blood draw, then? Will it take long? I have to get back to the farm eventually, you see, to check on the new lambs.
DOCTOR: Yes, a standard blood draw. It will take only a few minutes. The results usually take a few days to come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend… attempting to reduce your intake of saturated fats and cholesterol. And perhaps increasing your physical activity, if possible. Though, given your lifestyle, that may not be necessary. We'll see what the lab results show. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Saturated fats… so less cheese? And maybe fewer baked goods? That sounds… difficult. And I suppose I could try and walk a bit further each day. It’s just… my knees. But yes, I think I understand. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just when do I get the blood draw done? And where?
DOCTOR: Yes, less cheese, fewer baked goods… moderation is key. The lab is just down the hall, Room 3. The technician, Margaret, is quite capable. She will take care of you. You don't need an appointment; simply present your insurance card. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. I’ll have the receptionist contact you. Is that satisfactory?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly satisfactory, Doctor. Room 3, with Margaret. I’ll go there now, then. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do try to adhere to the… recommendations. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Good day, Ms. Geho.
PATIENT: .
