DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. So, you’re here today… and for what exactly?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Right. The… the breathing. It’s been… hard. And my mouth feels like the desert, you know? And my eyes… like sand in 'em. Not good. Not good at all. I don't remember when it started, exactly. A while now, though.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” is… not terribly helpful, Mr. Guilds. But we'll try to narrow it down. Let’s start with the breathing. Is it hard all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Yeah, that's it. Mostly when I… when I do stuff. Walkin', mostly. Even just gettin' up from the chair sometimes. Not all the time, though. When I'm sittin'… mostly okay. But then it gets… gets to me, you know? It’s… annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying, right. Well, shortness of breath can be caused by a number of things. And the dry mouth… is that constant as well, or does it worsen with the breathing?
PATIENT: Worsens… yeah, that’s a good word. It gets worse when I try to… breathe, I guess. Feels like everything just… dries up. Like someone left the window open in a bakery all day. And my eyes too. Everything’s scratchy. I used to have good eyes, you know. Could see a pin drop across the room. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this started… a while ago?
PATIENT: A while... look, lady, I'm eighty-three! Things get fuzzy, alright? I don't remember dates. It's been… a few months, maybe? Since it started getting really bad. Before that, it was just… old age, you know? Little puffs here and there. This is… different. More than just old age.
DOCTOR: Right. "A few months." Well, we need something to work with, Mr. Guilds. Do you recall any particular event that might have coincided with this worsening?
PATIENT: Event? Hmm. Let me think... I went to the… the parade. Fourth of July. Lots of… fireworks. Loud noises. Maybe that? I don’t know. Maybe it just… happened. It’s hot, you know. Always makes things worse. Everything gets dry in the heat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick examination, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then we'll see. Could you please sit up straight on the examination table?
PATIENT: Examination? What for? I told you what’s wrong! Breathing hard, dry mouth, scratchy eyes. What more do you need to examine? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, with all due respect, simply telling me your symptoms isn't a diagnosis. I am a doctor, and it is my job to assess your condition properly. Listening to your lungs, checking your vital signs – these are basic steps. It’s for your benefit. Now, please, if you'll cooperate. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctors these days. Always gotta poke and prod. Alright, alright. But don’t go stickin’ nothin’ up my nose. I hate that. Just listen to my lungs, like you said. And be quick about it. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath for me, and exhale slowly. Alright. And again, please. Your breathing is a little… wheezy. And your oxygen saturation is 92%. It’s not critically low, but it’s on the lower end. Now, open your mouth, please. Let me take a look. Your mouth is quite dry, as you mentioned. And a little red. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? I don’t… think so. Never paid much attention to that sort of thing. Maybe to dust? I sneeze sometimes. But everyone sneezes, right? Look, I grew up in Cuba, lady. We didn't have time for allergies. Just tryin' to survive. That’s what we did.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications... Let me think. Just the… the little blue pill. For my… you know. Keeps things workin', so to speak. And sometimes, a pain reliever for my knees. When they really act up. That’s about it. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: The little blue pill… and the pain reliever. Do you know the names of those medications, or the dosages you take?
PATIENT: Names? No, I just ask the pharmacist for 'em. Same ones every time. He knows what I need. Dosage… a little one for the blue pill. And two of the white ones for my knees, when I need 'em. Look, I’m not a pharmacist, alright? I just take 'em.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of… lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems... hmm. My father, he smoked. Lots of cigars. Coughin' all the time. Didn't kill him, though. Lived to be eighty-five, the old man. My mother… she just got old. That’s all. No fancy diseases. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering your symptoms, your history, and the examination findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing a mild exacerbation of COPD, possibly triggered by the heat or the fireworks. The wheezing in your lungs and your low oxygen levels suggest some airway obstruction. However, given your limited recollection of medication dosages and family history, and the fact that you haven’t had a formal diagnosis before, I recommend a chest x-ray to rule out other possibilities, like pneumonia. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Huh? X-ray? What for? You're makin’ a big deal outta nothin’. I just got a little short of breath, lady. A little dry mouth. And you wanna stick me in some machine? No, thank you. I don't like machines. Sounds expensive too. And I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, the x-ray isn't about making a "big deal out of nothing." It’s about ruling things out. It’s a standard procedure to ensure we get an accurate diagnosis, so we can provide you with the right treatment. Medicare will cover it, as it’s medically necessary. Without it, we're just guessing. It’s a quick, painless procedure. And frankly, if it is something more serious, like pneumonia, we need to know. I strongly advise you to get the x-ray. I can arrange it for you today. Otherwise, I can prescribe an inhaler to manage your symptoms, but it won’t address the underlying cause. Would you like me to write you a prescription for the inhaler or schedule the x-ray?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Fine! But if it costs me a penny, I’m comin’ back to see you. And if it's a waste of time, you’re hearin’ about it. Schedule the… the x-ray. Just get it over with. But no pokin’ and prodin’, alright? And make it quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m scheduling the x-ray for this afternoon at the imaging center across the street. They’ll need your insurance information, which I have here. They'll call you when they're ready. Here’s the appointment information and the center’s address. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler to help with your shortness of breath. It’s a rescue inhaler, so use it as needed. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Albuterol... sounds like somethin' you put on your skin. As long as it helps me breathe, I guess. And… no, I don’t think so. Just… tell me where I park. That place is always crowded. And make sure they don't keep me waitin’ too long. I hate waitin’.
DOCTOR: Here's a map to the imaging center and parking information. There's free parking in the lot next to the building. They can get busy, but try to arrive 15 minutes before your appointment time. And please, if your shortness of breath worsens significantly before your appointment, or you develop a fever, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… Fine, fine. I understand. Don’t want to end up in no emergency room. Just gettin’ old, that’s all. This whole thing is a big fuss over nothin', you know. But… thank you. I guess.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Guilds. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. I’ll see you back here for the results of the x-ray. Have a good day. And please, try to stay cool. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Right. Stay cool. Easy for you to say. Machines… fireworks… fuss over nothin'…
