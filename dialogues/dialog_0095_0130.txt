DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s my family, you see. Lots of… problems. My mother, she had… something with her heart. And my brother, he… well, he had trouble with his thinking, later in life. I just want to make sure I don’t get those things, if that makes sense. I’m getting older, and… it worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It’s very responsible of you to think about your family history and your own health. We can certainly explore that. So, to clarify, you're worried about potentially inheriting heart problems like your mother had, and cognitive issues similar to your brother’s?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s right. I don’t really know what they had, to be honest. Just… trouble. My sister, she knows more, but she lives far away. I just want to be… sure. You know? Is there a test for that? For… family things?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's good you're being proactive. We can definitely look into this. There isn't one single test, but we can gather a detailed family history, and then potentially do some blood work and other screenings depending on what we find. First, let's talk about your mother. Do you know roughly what age she was when she started having heart trouble?
PATIENT: Um… I think she was… maybe in her sixties? It was a long time ago. She got tired very easily, and then she had… swelling in her legs, I remember that. And she went to the hospital a few times. I was still a young man then, so I didn’t pay much attention to the details. My father mostly handled everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, sixties, with fatigue and leg swelling. That gives us something to work with. And your brother – can you tell me a bit more about the trouble he had with his thinking?
PATIENT: Well, he started forgetting things. Little things at first, like where he put his keys. But then it got worse. He… he didn’t recognize people sometimes. And he got very confused. It was… sad to watch. He needed someone to take care of him towards the end. It was… a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: That sounds very difficult, Mr. Schwer. It's understandable you'd be worried. So, memory loss progressing to not recognizing people... Roughly what age did these symptoms start for him?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. I think he was… maybe in his seventies? Early seventies, maybe. He was a smoker, you know. Always smoking. That probably didn’t help. He didn’t take care of himself very well. I always told him to stop, but… he wouldn’t listen.
DOCTOR: Okay, early seventies, and a smoking history. That’s important information. Now, let’s talk about you, Mr. Schwer. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? I try to walk every day, but my knees bother me. And my blood pressure, the nurse checked it today, and she said it was a little high. But she said it wasn’t too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and knee pain, and the nurse noted a slightly elevated blood pressure. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No, never. She just said it was a little high today. I think I was nervous being here, maybe? I don't usually go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. A single elevated reading doesn’t necessarily mean anything. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Just… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they really bother me. An over-the-counter thing, like ibuprofen. But not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. My wife, she was always careful about allergies, but… well, we’re divorced now. She worried about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My wife didn’t like it. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, when I was younger. But not anymore. And… no, nothing else. I’m a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking, minimal alcohol in the past, no other substance use. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, are there any other concerns you have today?
PATIENT: Um… No, I think that’s everything. Just… wanting to be sure. I want to be around for my grandkids, you know? That’s all. They're getting older, and… I want to see them grow up.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful goal, Mr. Schwer. We can definitely work towards that. Alright, let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be perfect. Let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. I lie back on the examination table and take a few deep breaths, trying to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. It's 142/88 today. Still a little elevated. Finally, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: I bend my knees as instructed, wincing slightly. They… they creak a bit. And they're a little stiff. It’s worse in the morning.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some crepitus, and there’s some mild tenderness on the inner side of both knees. No significant swelling. Based on this quick exam, it sounds like you likely have some osteoarthritis in your knees, which is common with age. Now, given your family history of heart issues and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We’ll also do an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Okay. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and… the EKG, you said? Is that… painful?
DOCTOR: The EKG isn't painful at all, Mr. Schwer. We'll just put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It measures the electrical activity of your heart. The blood work will just be a standard draw from your arm. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to walk as much as you comfortably can, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help with your knee pain. Are you comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… manageable. Walking and ibuprofen. Okay. And… you’ll call me when the results are back?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The lab will typically have the results back within a few days, and my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they're available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I just… I want to be around for my grandkids, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. And we'll do everything we can to help you achieve that. We’ve ordered the blood work and EKG, and we’ll be in touch soon with the results. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant swelling in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here’s a copy of the lab order, and a list of local hospitals. Have a good day, Mr. Schwer. And please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns. .
