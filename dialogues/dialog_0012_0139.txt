DOCTOR: Hi Yamir, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Yes. I need... evaluation for referee. For fitness. I want to do this quick, if possible. I have things... things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a referee fitness evaluation. I understand you’re hoping to get this done quickly. We can definitely work towards that. Just to clarify – are you looking for a general health check to make sure you’re fit for refereeing, or is there a specific requirement from an organization that needs to be met?
PATIENT: Organization. Yes. They want... paper. Showing I okay. Not sick. Strong enough. I don’t know what kind of check... just need paper. They said fitness evaluation. Is that... right? I just want to pass.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like a physical exam for clearance with a specific form to fill out. That makes sense. Do you happen to have the form with you, or did the organization say they’d send it to us directly?
PATIENT: No. They said... I come here. You know. They have my name. I think they send it to you already. I don't know. I just... got email saying come to doctor. For this. Is okay if they send it? I don’t want to make trouble.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Yamir. It’s common for organizations to send the form directly to us. Let me just double-check to see if we’ve received anything under your name… Ah, yes, here it is - a Referee Physical Evaluation form from the Coastal Officials Association. Great. This form covers a basic medical history, a physical exam, and some specific requirements for cardiovascular health and musculoskeletal function. Before we get started with the exam, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Okay. Good. I... okay. I think. No big problems. Last year, small cough. But gone now. I work hard. Repairing... inside furnaces. Hot work. That's all. I don't get sick easy. But... sometimes tired. Very tired. After work. Is normal, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, repairing furnaces – that is physically demanding work. And being tired after a long day like that is definitely understandable. When you say “very tired,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Like... heavy. Legs heavy. Can’t... want to just sit. Don’t have energy for anything. Not like sick tired. Just... no power. And sometimes... hard to sleep. Mind keeps going. Thinking about work. It is... annoying. Happens few times a week. Maybe more. I don't really count.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heavy legs, fatigue that makes you want to rest, and some difficulty sleeping with your mind racing. That’s helpful to know. And this has been going on for how long now, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe six months? Hard to say. Work busy. I didn’t think much about it. Just... getting older. I'm thirty-one. Maybe body not like before. Not important, I think. Just need paper for referee.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of fatigue and sleep disturbance. Even though you’re hoping to get this cleared quickly for refereeing, it is important for me to understand what’s going on with your body, even if it’s just to rule out anything serious. We can still proceed with the exam for the form, but I'd like to ask a few more questions just to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. But quick, please. I have to... things. Ask questions. Then exam. Then I go. Yes? I don't want to waste time. But I trust you, Doctor. Just... quick.
DOCTOR: I understand, Yamir. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. I healthy. Always. Little coughs sometimes. But nothing serious. My wife... she had problems. But I... I am okay. Never been to doctor much. Just when wife sick. And now... for this paper. That’s all. No high blood pressure. No... sugar problem. No heart. Yes? I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never surgery. Never hospital. Not even broken bone. I work careful. My wife... she broke her arm once. But me? Never. I'm strong. Careful. That's why I'm still working. Still repairing furnaces. Is hard work, but I'm okay. Really. No surgery. No hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family... my parents... they are old now. In China. I don't talk to them much. My wife... she passed away last year. Cancer. She… she had heart problems too, before cancer. That's why I worry a little about my heart. But I feel okay. My brother... he is healthy. Works in a shop. That's all I know about my family’s health. Not close. Very far away.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Yamir. That must have been incredibly difficult. It's understandable that you'd be thinking about heart problems given her history. Okay, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No pills. No anything. I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel… strange. My wife… she had many pills. I don't like them. Just… water. And sometimes tea. That's all. No supplements. No vitamins. Just… normal. Water and tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I eat everything. Chinese food, American food… doesn’t matter. Never been sick from food. Never had a rash from anything. I am strong. My body… it’s okay. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Alright, Yamir. Before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work. A lot. Six days a week. Inside furnaces. Hot, dirty work. I go home. Eat. Sleep. Sometimes watch TV. Not much else. I don’t drink much. Maybe one beer sometimes. I don't smoke. Never. That’s it. Simple. Work. Home. Sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a physically demanding job, limited social activities, minimal alcohol, and no smoking. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Uh… I eat what my wife used to make. Rice. Vegetables. Some meat. Chinese food mostly. Sometimes American food. Fast food sometimes, when I’m tired. I don’t really pay attention. Just… food. Need energy for work. Whatever is quick. Not fancy. Rice, vegetables, meat. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Yamir. It sounds like you lead a very busy life. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment, and some musculoskeletal tests to make sure you're fit for refereeing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Just… quick, please. I want to finish. Blood pressure… okay. Listen… okay. Just… fast. I need to go to work later.
DOCTOR: I'll be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/85. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s faint, but I want to note it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’ll need to test your range of motion. Can you please stand up and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Okay. Not very good. Back hurts a little. Getting old, I guess. Is that bad? I need to bend to fix furnaces. Sometimes… I have to get in small spaces. It hurts sometimes, but I can do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your flexibility is a bit limited, and you do seem to have some discomfort in your lower back. That's good information to have. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes. Right there. A little sore. Not all the time. Just when I bend. Or lift something heavy. Been like that for a while. Months. I just… ignore it. Need to work. Is it bad? Should I stop working?
DOCTOR: Okay, it does seem like you have some tenderness in your lower spine. Given your line of work and the limitations I’m seeing with your flexibility, it’s possible you have some muscle strain or a mild lower back injury. It’s not necessarily something that requires you to stop working immediately, but it is something we need to address. I’m going to recommend an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any structural issues. And I’d like to discuss some physical therapy exercises to help strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. Before we proceed with the X-ray, do you have any other symptoms, like numbness or tingling in your legs, or pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No numbness. No tingling. No pain down my legs. Just… sore back. Sometimes stiff. Makes it hard to bend. But I can still work. I have to work. X-ray… how long? Will it take long? And physical therapy… will I have to go somewhere? I don’t have much time. Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and cost, Yamir. The X-ray itself will only take a few minutes, but it may take a little longer to get the results. As for physical therapy, it typically involves several sessions over a few weeks. We can look at options nearby that offer flexible scheduling, and I can help you check with your insurance to see what is covered. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur I heard, I'd also like to recommend a basic EKG to check your heart rhythm. It's a quick and painless test. To be thorough, I also want to discuss your fatigue and lack of sleep. It could be related to your work stress and back pain, but it's important to rule out any other underlying causes. A simple blood test can check your vitamin levels and thyroid function. Before we move forward with these tests, do you have any questions or concerns?
PATIENT: So… X-ray, EKG, blood test… and physical therapy… That’s a lot. Can I just… get the paper for the referee? Is it possible? I really don’t have time for all this. I just need to show I’m okay. Can you just… sign something? Say I’m fit? I’ll be careful. I promise.
DOCTOR: Yamir, I understand you want to get the paper for the referee evaluation and get back to work as soon as possible. However, I have a professional and ethical responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Signing off on a form without a proper assessment would be irresponsible. I'm hearing a murmur, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you're experiencing fatigue and back pain. It’s important to investigate these issues to rule out any underlying conditions. I’m concerned about potential cardiovascular problems and musculoskeletal injuries that could be aggravated by your physically demanding job. While I can’t sign off on the form without further investigation, I can offer a compromise. We can proceed with the X-ray and EKG today. I’ll also order the blood tests. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. If the results are normal, I can complete the form and recommend you start physical therapy. If there are any concerning findings, we'll discuss appropriate treatment options. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. X-ray. EKG. Blood tests. But quick, please. I have things to do. And... how much will it cost? I have insurance, but… And… can I still work while I wait for the results? I really need the money.
DOCTOR: Okay, Yamir. I understand. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. I'll have the nurse draw the blood for the tests right away. The X-ray and EKG can be done here in the clinic, and it shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes total. As for the cost, I'll have the billing department verify your insurance coverage and provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. We can also discuss a payment plan if needed. Regarding your work, generally, you can continue working while waiting for the results, provided you don't experience any new or worsening symptoms, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe back pain. However, I strongly advise you to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we have the results. I'll write the orders for the tests now. The nurse will be in shortly to get you started. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… hurry, please. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Yamir. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. The nurse will be right with you. And please, don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you experience any discomfort or have any questions during the tests.
