DOCTOR: Hi Liza, welcome! I’m Dr. Hernandez, but you can call me Valerie. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Valerie. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… trying to be more present, you know? I heard good things about mindfulness and meditation, and thought maybe you could point me in the right direction. I’m Liza Sugino, by the way.
DOCTOR: Liza, that's… wonderful! It's great you're focusing on your well-being. However, this clinic is for medical concerns. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms, or is this about exploring resources for mental wellness, like stress reduction techniques?
PATIENT: Oh! I see. My apologies. I hadn't quite… connected that. No, no physical symptoms, thankfully. Just… wanting to learn some ways to manage things better. A friend mentioned you were good at recommending things like that, even if it’s not a “sick” visit, you know? I hope that’s alright.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Liza. Many people utilize mindfulness for overall health, and I'm happy to point you to resources. But just to be thorough, and because I am a physician, let me quickly ask a few standard questions to make sure there isn’t anything underlying your desire to explore mindfulness. Have you noticed any significant changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That makes sense. Let me think… Sleep is usually okay, I don’t have much trouble falling asleep, but I do wake up sometimes in the middle of the night. Appetite is normal, I guess. I enjoy my food, haven’t lost interest in anything. And energy… well, it fluctuates, doesn’t it? It's August, it’s hot… work is demanding, sometimes I feel tired, sometimes I don't. Nothing drastic, though. I work on the railways, so it’s physical work, you know? A lot of walking and checking things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to clarify a little further—have you been feeling more stressed or anxious than usual lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. “More” is hard to say. Work is always a bit stressful, it's a responsible job, making sure everything’s safe and running on time. But I wouldn't say it's been worse lately, just… always there, you know? I suppose I’m just looking for better tools to handle the usual stress, before it gets to be too much. I try to be proactive, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Liza. Being proactive is excellent. And it sounds like you’ve been managing reasonably well, but are looking for additional support. Have you ever experienced anything like panic attacks, or a prolonged feeling of worry that interferes with your daily life?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Nothing like that. Just… sometimes my mind races, especially before a big project at work. I just want to be able to calm it down faster, if that makes sense. I don’t need to fix something broken, I just want to be… more equipped. I’ve heard mindfulness can help with that racing thought, you know? Focusing on the breath and all that?
DOCTOR: Yes, mindfulness can be very effective for racing thoughts, and you’re right about the breathwork. Before we get to some specific resources, let’s just do a quick check of your medical history, just to rule out anything that could be contributing to your stress or anxiety. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. No allergies that I know of. I haven’t taken any new medications recently, either. I'm generally quite healthy, I eat a pretty good diet, and I try to stay active when I can, despite the work. I did have my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was all sorted out and I haven't had any issues since. I have Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Liza. Ten years ago, gallbladder removal… noted. And Medicare is helpful for resource recommendations. And no new medications currently?
PATIENT: No, nothing new. Just the usual over-the-counter pain reliever sometimes, for a sore muscle after a long day. Nothing regular, though. I try to tough it out whenever possible. I don’t like relying on pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Liza, based on what you've told me, and without any indication of underlying medical conditions, it sounds like exploring mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques is a very reasonable path. Now, let's talk about some resources. Are you comfortable with apps on your smartphone, or do you prefer more traditional approaches, like books or in-person classes?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful to hear! Thank you. And yes, I’m pretty comfortable with apps. I use one for tracking my steps, so I’m used to them. Books are good too, I enjoy reading, but an app might be easier to fit into my day, you know? Something I can do during my lunch break or on the train. I’m quite open to suggestions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. There are a few really good ones. “Headspace” and “Calm” are both popular, offering guided meditations for various levels of experience and focusing on different aspects like stress, sleep, and anxiety. “Insight Timer” has a huge library of free meditations as well, if you’d like to try a wider variety before committing to a subscription. I can email you links to all three. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be fantastic! Yes, please, email me those links. That's incredibly helpful. Thank you so much, Valerie. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and offer suggestions. It feels good to have a little direction.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. I'll email those links over right now. And remember, mindfulness is a practice—it takes time and consistency. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't feel easy right away. If you find that your stress becomes overwhelming or significantly impacts your daily life despite these techniques, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment, or see your primary care physician. Here's my card. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything beautifully. Thank you again, Valerie. This has been really helpful. I feel much more optimistic now, and equipped to get started. Have a lovely day!
DOCTOR: You too, Liza! And remember to be kind to yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day! .
