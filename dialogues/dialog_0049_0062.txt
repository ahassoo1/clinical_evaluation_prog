DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Nestingen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and… well, I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption. It’s been… difficult.
DOCTOR: An exemption, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. It’s not that I’m against protecting people, not at all. But I’ve found wearing a mask… causes me some rather significant discomfort. It’s hard to explain, but it feels… constricting. And I’ve had some trouble with… dizziness, afterward. It impacts my ability to perform my duties safely, and the duties require a clear head, you see. I work with people, and need to be fully present.
DOCTOR: Constricting and dizziness… Right. And what is your occupation, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: I am a Protective Service Worker. All Other, the paperwork calls it. It means I respond to various situations – ensuring the wellbeing of folks who need assistance. Sometimes it's very… stressful work. Requires a calm demeanor, quick thinking. The mask makes all that harder.
DOCTOR: Protective Services… that does require a certain… level of alertness. Have you been evaluated for any underlying respiratory conditions, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, I haven’t. I haven’t had any trouble breathing, not exactly. It’s not a lung thing, I don’t believe. It’s more… a feeling. A pressure, a tightness in my chest and head. And then the dizziness comes on a few minutes after I take the mask off. It passes, but it’s… unsettling. I haven't spoken to a doctor about it before today.
DOCTOR: A feeling… right. And how long have you been experiencing this when wearing a mask?
PATIENT: It started when the mask requirements became… firm, I suppose you could say. About six months ago. At first I thought it was just getting used to it. But it hasn't gotten better. If anything, it’s become more pronounced. It’s almost immediate now, the pressure. And the dizziness… well, that’s worrying. I need to be able to trust my senses.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go through some general questions then, Mr. Knabenshue. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been… fairly resilient, if you will. Never had any bad reactions to anything, thankfully. I eat most anything, and I haven’t ever needed to avoid any particular medicines. I suppose I’ve been lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Nothing at all. I prefer to… avoid them if I can. I try to take care of myself, stay active, eat well. Medicare covers things, of course, but I only use it when absolutely necessary. I believe in letting the body heal itself, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any history of anxiety or panic attacks?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like that. I work in a stressful field, as I mentioned, but I’ve always been able to manage. I’m a fairly calm person, generally. Stoic, some might say. It's important to be level-headed in my line of work. Though, I admit, the mask does make me feel a bit… trapped. But I wouldn’t call it a panic attack. It’s more… discomfort. A physical reaction.
DOCTOR: Right. Physical reaction… We need to rule things out. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, we can discuss some possible, simple tests.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate. I want to be thorough, do things the proper way. I just want to be able to do my job safely, for everyone involved. Please, proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 90. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is 78 and regular. Any history of chest pain, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, not at all. Never had any chest pain. My heart’s always been strong. I walk a good distance most days, and I've always been physically active. I suppose being Lakota, we tend to be… built for endurance. I’ve never felt any discomfort or tightness in my chest, aside from what I described with the mask. Just the pressure, the feeling of being… constricted.
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering your occupation and the symptoms you're describing… We need to rule out any cardiac issues, despite your self-reporting. I'm going to order an EKG and a basic metabolic panel. It’s a simple blood test. These are standard procedures, Mr. Knabenshue. It's better to be certain.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Certainty is… wise. I agree. If it will rule things out and give peace of mind, then please, proceed. I appreciate you being thorough, even if it's just standard procedure. I’d rather know one way or the other, and I trust your judgment. When would I be able to schedule those tests?
DOCTOR: The lab is right down the hall. I'll send an order over electronically. They can take the blood and perform the EKG immediately. After that, the results should be available to me within 24 hours. I’ll have the nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. In the meantime, I advise you to limit strenuous activity. Until we have those results, I cannot provide an exemption. That would be irresponsible.
PATIENT: That is… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I wouldn't expect anything less. Prudence is essential. I completely understand. Limit strenuous activity… that’s wise. And I'll await the nurse’s call to schedule the follow-up. Thank you for your time, and for your thoroughness. I appreciate your attention to this matter. I will see you then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in touch. Have a good day, Mr. Knabenshue. .
PATIENT: Yes, you as well, Doctor. Thank you again.
