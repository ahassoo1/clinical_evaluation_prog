DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it’s about this… this shape of me. Not happy with it, you see. Always been a strong man, worked hard all me life. Pile driver ain't build no pretty figures, y'know? Just… not what it used to be. Waste of time talkin’ ‘bout feelings, though. Just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. You're… concerned about changes in your physique, and you'd like to address them. When did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Noticin’? Since I stopped workin’, mostly. Used to be all muscle, tight, strong. Now… well, now it’s just… loose. Maybe ten years ago? Around then, when me wife, bless her soul, got sick. Didn’t have the energy for much after that. Point is, it happened after that, not before. Don’t need a calendar to tell me that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around ten years ago, coinciding with your wife’s illness. And you'd describe it as a loss of muscle tone and… looseness. Can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by "loose"?
PATIENT: Loose like… like a bag. A flour bag, hangin’ empty. Used to be firm, you see? Now it… jiggles. Especially here. Don’t like it. Always been a proud man. Don’t want to look… weak. It's a disgrace, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes you mean? I eat normal. Maybe a bit less now, but that's just 'cause I ain't workin' up an appetite. No aches or pains, just… this. Feel tired sometimes, but who doesn't at me age? Don't go lookin' for trouble where there ain't none. Just want this fixed, not a whole list of problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no other symptoms that you’ve noticed. Just the change in your physique and some fatigue. Now, I just want to rule a few things out. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you askin' me about… that? Really? Look, I came here 'bout me shape, not... business. Always been regular, thank you very much. What’s that got to do with anything? Waste of time, this is.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It's just a routine question to get a complete picture. Sometimes these things can be connected. But alright, we’ll move on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Already told you 'bout me appetite. A bit less, that’s all. And weight… probably lost a bit. Don’t weigh meself, don't see the point. It's goin' down, alright? Everything's goin' down eventually. But it’s not like I'm disappearin' or somethin'. Just… less. Less of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some weight loss, less appetite, but not drastic. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Health problems? Had the usual. Flu, bad cold now and then. High blood pressure, doctor told me years ago. Take a pill for it, mostly keeps it under control. But that's it. Nothing fancy. And don't go lookin' for things that ain't there. Me wife always said I was a stubborn mule, and I reckon she was right. Strong as an ox, always been that way.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication. Good. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Had me appendix out when I was a young man. Long time ago, don’t remember much of it. And when me wife got sick, spent a good deal of time in the hospital with her. Didn’t need surgery meself, just… there. That’s about it. Nothing major. Definitely nothin’ like now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the one. Little white one. Take it every mornin’. That's it. Don't like takin' pills, makes me feel weak. Always been a healthy man, I don't need a whole pharmacy just to stay alive.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had no allergies. I eat everything. Spicy food, shellfish, you name it. Jamaican food is full of flavour. If I was allergic to somethin’, I'd know it by now. Don't need a list of things I can't eat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just a look, feel your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs. It'll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Exam? You mean poke and prod at me? Look, I came here 'bout me shape, not a general check-up. I’m a sensible man, I know what’s wrong. Less muscle, more… jiggle. Don’t need a doctor tellin’ me what I already know. If you can fix it, fine. If not, I’m wastin’ me time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. But a quick exam is important to rule out any underlying medical causes for the changes you’re experiencing. It doesn’t have to be extensive. Just a few minutes to make sure everything is as it should be. It helps me determine the best course of action. For example, we need to assess your muscle mass and strength. Are you willing to let me at least listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t go pokin’ around too much. And don't tell me nothin' I don't wanna hear. Heart and lungs, alright. And just a quick feel. I got things to do, you know. Don’t want to be here all day. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the exam table. Okay, heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I do notice some decreased muscle mass in your abdomen and limbs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Can you try squeezing my hands?
PATIENT: There. Done. Not as strong as I used to be, I admit. Pile drivin’ takes a toll, y’know? But I can still lift things. Don't need no help carryin' groceries. Just want to get rid of this… sag. Is that what you call it? Sag. Disgraceful. So, can you fix it, or not?
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it appears you're experiencing age-related muscle loss, likely compounded by decreased activity following your wife’s illness. This is a common condition called sarcopenia. It's not something we can “fix” overnight, but we can certainly manage it. I recommend a combination of regular exercise, particularly strength training, and a diet rich in protein. I’d also like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: Exercise? Blood work? You mean change me whole life? Look, I came here for a quick solution, not a whole program. I’m too old for that. And blood work? Sounds expensive. Just want to get rid of this… this problem. Can't you just give me somethin' to… tighten things up? Some kind of cream or somethin’? I ain’t lookin’ for a marathon, just a decent shape.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there’s no quick fix, Mr. Trendler. Creams and lotions won’t address the underlying muscle loss. And while I understand your hesitation about changing your routine, exercise and a good diet are the most effective ways to improve your strength and physique. The blood work is primarily to rule out any other issues that might be contributing to your symptoms. It’s a standard precaution. However, if you’re absolutely opposed to the blood work and a change in lifestyle, I can refer you to a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. They may have other options, but I want to be realistic – those options will likely still involve some level of exercise and dietary changes. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Specialist, eh? More doctors, more tests… Waste of time, all of it. Look, I’ve lived a long life. Ain't expectin' miracles. If you can't give me somethin' quick and easy, just forget it. I’ll just… deal with it. No need for fancy tests or a whole new routine. I'm a sensible man, I know when I'm beaten.
