DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Lindra Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is good to meet you too. My… how you say… the place where old people live? My daughter, she want me to go there. She say I need paper from doctor, yes? To make sure I… okay for live there.
DOCTOR: Ah, I understand. You mean a residential care facility, or assisted living?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! Assisted… that is it! She say they need to know I am okay. Not too sick. I work still, you know? I am bartender. But sometimes… forget things. Small things. Is why daughter worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like your daughter is being very thoughtful and wants to ensure you’re safe and comfortable, and that the facility is a good fit for you. We’ll certainly work through everything together to get the necessary documentation. To start, could you tell me a little more about these "small things" you forget?
PATIENT: Hmm… like… names. Sometimes I see face, know I see them before, but… the name gone. Or… I put things down, then… where did I put it? Little things. Not big. Not like… forget my whole life, no? Just… small. And sometimes… I need write things down now. Before, no need. It just… get harder.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly normal for memory to change as we age, Ms. Abdollahi. It's good you're aware of these changes, and even better that your daughter is supporting you. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately when you started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… two years ago? Maybe less. Is hard to say. It come slowly, you know? Not one day I wake up and… forget everything. Just… little by little. I still work, still cook, still talk with friends. But… I worry sometimes. That is why daughter bring me here. She very… how you say… careful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very insightful of you, Ms. Abdollahi. A gradual onset is quite common. And it's excellent that you're able to continue with your daily activities. Now, let’s briefly go through some other areas to get a more complete understanding. Have you noticed any changes in your mood – feeling more sad or anxious than usual?
PATIENT: No, not really. I am… okay. Sometimes tired, you know? Work long hours. But not sad. Not worried all the time. Just… get old. Old people get tired. I still like music, still like talk with people. Still like… make good drinks! Sometimes worry about money, but… that is always. Not new.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like you’re maintaining a positive outlook. And it's helpful to know you haven't experienced significant changes in your mood. Now, have you had any difficulty with tasks that require problem-solving or planning, like managing your finances or following a complicated recipe?
PATIENT: Hmm… the finances… sometimes I ask my daughter to help now. Before, I do everything. But now… numbers get confusing. And recipes… I still cook, but simple things. Not fancy. The complicated… I don't try anymore. Is too much work. I like the simple food anyway. Rice and beans, chicken… good. That is enough.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good that you recognize these changes and are adapting. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you had any history of stroke, head injury, or neurological conditions, like Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease, in yourself or close family members?
PATIENT: Stroke… no. Never stroke. Head injury… when I was little girl, I fall from tree. But… long time ago. Not important, I think. My mother… she get sick when she old. Doctor say… something with the mind. Forget things very bad. But she no have name for it. My father… he healthy all his life. No problem with mind. My sister… she good too. I think that is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Abdollahi. That's very helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I take… this one, for my pressure. Doctor give me. And this one, for my knees. They hurt sometimes. And… this one, is vitamin. My daughter buy it. She say I need it for… the bones. Is all, I think. Just those three.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. Let me just confirm these names… Amlodipine for blood pressure, Ibuprofen for knee pain, and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never have allergies. I eat everything. I like all the food. My daughter, she very careful about the food. But I never have problem. No hives, no trouble breathing. Never. I eat fish, I eat chicken, I eat beans… everything. Is good to eat!
DOCTOR: That's excellent to know, Ms. Abdollahi. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a general sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Is okay. You check me. Whatever you need. I want to make sure I am okay for the… place. For the old people. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very good. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths in and out, please. Your heart rate and rhythm sound normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Pulse is regular. Next, I’ll take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear, and your throat is normal. Finally, I’m going to do a simple neurological exam. This just involves checking your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I follow. Like this? Is okay? I try very hard. Sometimes my eyes… little tired. But I am trying. I want to show you I am okay.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Ms. Abdollahi. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, could you please lift your arms out to the sides and hold them up?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? They… little heavy. But I can hold them. Is okay? I feel… little weak maybe. But I hold them. I try very hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, let’s try a simple balance test. Could you please stand up slowly and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Yes, I try. Oh… little dizzy. I feel… not so good. Maybe I sit down. Is okay? I am little scared.
DOCTOR: Please sit down, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s perfectly alright. Based on the exam and our conversation, you’re experiencing some changes in memory, balance, and strength. It's important to determine the cause of these changes. There are several possibilities, including normal age-related changes, medication side effects, or a more significant underlying condition. To help clarify things, I recommend a few tests. First, a complete blood count to rule out any deficiencies. Second, a thyroid function test to assess your thyroid hormone levels. Finally, and most importantly, I'd like to order an MRI of your brain to look for any structural changes. Would you be comfortable with these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. If you think is good… I do the tests. I want to know what is happening. I want to know if I am okay for the… the place. If I need help… I need to know. Yes, please. Do the tests. Is the MRI… scary? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Abdollahi. The MRI is not scary, although it can be a little noisy. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation and it doesn’t hurt. You'll need to remove any metal objects, like jewelry or hairpins, before the scan. And you’ll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. I’ll also refer you to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nerve disorders, for further evaluation. They will be able to interpret the MRI results and provide a more definitive diagnosis. In the meantime, to ensure your safety, I recommend that you avoid driving and operating heavy machinery. And I'd like you to continue taking your current medications as prescribed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No driving… okay. I mostly stay at home anyway. And the neurologist… is good. I want to see someone who knows about the… the brain. I trust you. You are very kind. And… about the place? Should I still tell them? Or wait for the tests? I don’t want them to say no… if I am not okay.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful question, Ms. Abdollahi. I understand your concerns. I recommend that you do inform the assisted living facility about the tests and your neurological appointment. You don’t need to go into great detail, but it’s important to be transparent about your health concerns. They are likely to require this information regardless. Many facilities have on-site medical staff or partnerships with local doctors who can help assess your needs and determine if the facility is a suitable fit for you. I can provide a letter to the facility outlining your current health status and the planned tests and referral, which may be helpful. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The letter… is very good. That will help. I am so glad you are here. You explain everything so nicely. My daughter… she worry so much. She will be happy to hear you are helping. So… I tell them about the tests and you will write the letter? And I wait for the neurologist? Is that right?
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right, Ms. Abdollahi. You tell them about the tests and the neurological appointment, and I will provide a letter outlining your current health status and the planned evaluations. You wait for the neurologist’s evaluation and we will discuss the results together. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment with you in two weeks, after the tests have been completed, to review the results and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as dizziness, weakness, confusion, or difficulty speaking, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. You answer everything. You are very patient. Thank you. I feel… a little less scared now. Please… tell my daughter you said she is very careful. She worry so much, you know? Thank you, Doctor. From the bottom of my heart.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Abdollahi. And I certainly will tell your daughter that she is very thoughtful and caring. She’s doing a wonderful job supporting you. I’ll have my nurse schedule the tests and neurology appointment for you before you leave. And remember, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Okay. I will wait for the nurse. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Abdollahi. Take care.
