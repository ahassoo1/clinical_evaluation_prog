DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s me ears, I think. They ain't what they used to be, that’s for sure. People mumble a lot these days, or maybe it's just me. It's hard to say, really. I just… don’t hear everything like I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. Hearing changes are very common as we get older, Mr. Schneer. It is often hard to tell if it’s people mumbling, or our ears playing tricks on us. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this happening?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. When did I notice…? Now that’s a question. Seems like it’s been gradual, ya know? Not like a sudden thing. Maybe… a couple of years, perhaps? Or longer. I used to be able to hear the birds clear as a bell, even from inside the house. Now… not so much. And the TV… gotta have it up pretty loud, which bothers the neighbors, I expect. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Sorry, I'm not much help with dates.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. It's common to not remember exact dates. Gradual onset is quite typical with hearing loss. And it's good you noticed it's been affecting your TV listening. Do you notice it more in certain situations than others?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. It’s worse when there’s… background noise, I think. Like if the radio’s on, or people are talkin’ at the same time. Restaurants are… well, forget about restaurants. And when folks don't look at me when they’re speakin’. I need to see their face, I think, to understand 'em better. It’s a bit of a struggle, it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Background noise and difficulty when you can't see the speaker’s face. Those are both common things people with hearing loss experience. Now, have you ever had any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now, you sayin’ like a… a high-pitched sound? Sometimes, yes, I think so. It comes and goes. Not all the time, mind you. Mostly when things are quiet. It’s… well, it's just a sort of… fizzin’ sound, I suppose. Not terribly loud, but… there. It doesn't bother me too much, but I've noticed it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent ringing, or tinnitus, that’s good to know. And it's not constant. Have you ever been exposed to loud noises at work, or in your hobbies?
PATIENT: Loud noises… well, I used to work in a shoe factory, makin’ shoes. Lots of machines, bangin’ and whirrin’ all day long. It was a noisy place, now that I think about it. Didn’t think much of it at the time, ya know? Just part of the job. As for hobbies… not really. Just liked to sit and read, mostly. Quiet things.
DOCTOR: Okay, shoe factory work with exposure to loud noises. That’s definitely something we’ll consider. Now, have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with wax buildup in your ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… I think maybe when I was a little boy, but I don’t rightly remember. It was a long time ago. Wax buildup… oh, now and then I’d get some, and the doctor would clean it out. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a little bit of wax. I haven’t had any trouble with it lately, though. I think the last time was… well, I couldn’t say for sure. Years ago, I expect.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent ear infections or wax buildup concerns. Now, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears, just to see what things look like. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Don't mind at all. It’s probably nothin’, but it can’t hurt to look, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer. Just gonna take a look. Alright, I see some wax present in both ears, not a large amount, but enough to potentially be contributing to the difficulty you’re experiencing. The ear canals themselves look normal. The eardrums appear intact, but slightly dull. I’m going to perform a quick hearing test, just to get a better idea of where the hearing loss is. It’s a simple test, no pain involved, I promise. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that doesn’t sound too bad. Wax, you say? Maybe that’s all it is! A good cleanin’ out. And a test? Alright, go right ahead, Doctor. I'll do whatever ya need me to. Sounds perfectly alright to me. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll give it my best shot. I ain’t done one of these in a long while, though!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, that’s all for the test. Okay, the hearing test confirms some mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, primarily affecting higher frequencies. This is consistent with age-related hearing loss and can be exacerbated by noise exposure and wax buildup. Given the wax buildup and the results of the test, I recommend we start with a simple earwax removal. We can do that here in the office. After that, we'll re-evaluate your hearing. If it doesn’t improve enough, we can discuss the possibility of a hearing aid evaluation with an audiologist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Wax removal first, then see if that helps. That seems a good plan to me. I trust your judgement. A hearin’ aid… well, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that, but I'm glad to know there are options. Alright, wax removal it is. Whatever you think is best. Just tell me what needs doin’. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. We’ll start with your right ear. I’m going to use a small instrument to gently remove the wax. You might feel a little bit of pressure or coolness, but it shouldn't be painful. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit of… pressure, like you said. Not unpleasant, just… different. A little cool, maybe? It’s alright, though, Doctor. Not botherin’ me none. You just keep goin’. I'm trustin’ ya. I just hope it works, that’s all. It’s been a bit of a struggle, ya know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, all done. I’ve removed a good amount of wax from both ears. It looks much better in there now, and your eardrums are clearer. We'll need to wait a few days to see if there’s a noticeable improvement in your hearing. I’m going to give you a prescription for some ear drops to help soften any remaining wax and prevent buildup in the future. Use them as directed. I want you to come back in one week for a follow-up hearing test to see how things are progressing. If your hearing hasn't improved, or if it gets worse, we can then discuss a referral to an audiologist for a full hearing aid evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that sounds… grand, Doctor. Good to hear it looks better already. And drops… alright, I’ll be sure to use 'em. A week… yes, that gives it a good try. Alright, a week it is. And if it don’t work… we'll see about them hearin’ aids. Thank ya, Doctor. I appreciate ya takin’ the time. I’m feelin’ a bit more hopeful now, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to avoid loud noises as much as possible.
