DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks. They bother me. A lot. I keep getting… trouble, down there. It’s happened a few times now. I don't rightly remember when it started, to be honest. It just… does.
DOCTOR: Okay, “trouble with your waterworks.” Can you tell me a bit more specifically what that means?
PATIENT: Specifically? Oh dear. Well… it burns when I go to the bathroom. And I have to go very often. Even when I don’t need to, it feels like I have to. It's quite… inconvenient, if I'm being frank. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination and frequent urges, even when you don't feel a strong need to go. That sounds really uncomfortable. And you said this has been happening for a while now, but you're not sure how long exactly?
PATIENT: Yes, uncomfortable is… a good word for it. A while… oh goodness. Months, I think? Maybe longer. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s alright for a bit, then it starts up again. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just know it’s been happening… repeatedly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you're not sure of exact dates—we'll figure things out. So, it comes and goes, and when it is happening, you experience burning and frequent urges. Have you noticed any pain in your lower abdomen or back with this?
PATIENT: Lower… abdomen? Oh, yes. Sometimes. A dull ache, mostly. Not sharp pain, you understand. And… my back, yes, a little bit. Not all the time, though. It’s hard to say if that’s the same trouble, or just my old bones. I do a lot of work with my hands, you see. Fixing those… recreational vehicles.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dull ache in the lower abdomen and sometimes in your back, and you do physically demanding work. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any unusual odor?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear, no. I don’t think so. I… I try not to look too closely, if you understand. And… odor? Well, it smells like… urine, Doctor. I haven’t noticed anything strange. Honestly, I mostly just try to get it over with quickly. It’s not a pleasant subject.
DOCTOR: Alright, no blood or unusual odor. And you've mentioned the burning, frequency, and occasional dull ache. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… yes. A long time ago. Maybe… fifteen years? I had to go to the doctor then, too. Something about… an infection. But I don't remember the details. They gave me some… pills, I think? And it went away. It’s all very hazy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, a similar issue about fifteen years ago, treated with antibiotics, and resolved. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. I've taken… painkillers, for my hands, from time to time. And some allergy pills when the pollen is bad. But I don't recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. I hope that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. And you take painkillers and allergy medication occasionally. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick check of your lower back. Then I'll need a urine sample to send to the lab. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… sensible. Listening and checking… fine. A sample? Yes, alright. I suppose that’s necessary. Just… please be quick, if you could. I have a vehicle waiting for me, you see. It needs fixing.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll move as quickly as we can. First, let's listen to your abdomen. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m just going to gently press here and listen with my stethoscope. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Sounds normal so far. Now, let’s check your lower back. Just tell me if anything feels tender. And… any tenderness there?
PATIENT: There… yes, a little bit on the right side. Not sharp pain, just… a bit sensitive. It feels a bit achy, actually. Like a muscle pulled, perhaps. Though I haven’t done anything to pull a muscle. It's just… always a little bit sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness and achiness on the right side of your lower back. Noted. Now, if you could please collect a urine sample for me, I'll show you how. I’ll give you a container, and you’ll want to clean the area thoroughly before collecting the sample. Just about two ounces should be enough. I'll be right outside when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A container… and clean the area… Yes, I think I can manage that. It’s… a bit embarrassing, but I understand it’s necessary. I’ll try to be quick.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Claudene. And don't hesitate to call out if you need any assistance. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. Here you are. I believe that’s enough.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, I'll send this off to the lab, and we should have results back within a few days. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have a urinary tract infection – a UTI. It's very common, especially in women. The burning, frequent urination, and lower abdominal discomfort all point in that direction. We’ll confirm with the lab results, but I'm going to go ahead and prescribe you an antibiotic, just to get started. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An antibiotic… yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what’s wrong, I want it gone. I just… I hope it doesn’t interfere with my work. I have a lot of vehicles to fix, you see. And I don’t have time to be unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll prescribe something that should be effective with minimal side effects. I'm going to prescribe you Nitrofurantoin 100mg twice a day for 7 days. It’s usually very well tolerated. Take it with food, and drink plenty of water – at least 8 glasses a day. Also, try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and sugary drinks while you’re on it. It can help prevent irritation. Now, I'm also going to give you some Phenazopyridine 100mg three times a day for 2 days. This won't treat the infection, but it will help relieve the burning pain. Just be aware it will turn your urine orange - that's perfectly normal. Do you have any questions about those medications?
PATIENT: Orange urine…? Oh dear. Well, that’s… good to know, I suppose. I don’t want to be alarmed. Nitrofurantoin and… Phenazopyridine… twice and three times a day… with food… and water. And avoid… caffeine? I drink a lot of coffee. Will avoiding coffee make the antibiotic… less effective?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. No, avoiding coffee won’t make the antibiotic less effective. It just might irritate your bladder more while it’s already inflamed, and we’re trying to minimize that irritation. Caffeine can also have a diuretic effect, meaning it makes you urinate more, which isn’t ideal when you’re trying to treat an infection. Now, I'm going to print out instructions for both medications, including potential side effects to watch out for. If you experience any severe side effects – like fever, chills, or back pain – stop taking the antibiotic and contact me immediately. I also want you to follow up with me in a week, even if you’re feeling better, just to make sure the infection has cleared up completely. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Fever, chills, back pain… stop the medication… contact you. Follow up in a week. Caffeine… avoid. It’s a lot to remember. I… I don’t suppose you could write it all down somewhere? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I wouldn’t want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. This has everything written down, including potential side effects and my contact information. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. I'm also going to give you a work note excusing you from heavy lifting for the next few days, just in case. I understand you have a busy schedule. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you. A work note… yes, that will be helpful. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I think… no. I believe that’s all. I just want to get this sorted and back to work. Thank you very much for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Claudene. I'm glad I could help. Get plenty of rest, drink lots of water, and take your medications as prescribed. If you don’t feel better within a couple of days, or if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to contact me. Here’s the number for the clinic if you need it. Take care, and feel better soon!
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. I will. .
