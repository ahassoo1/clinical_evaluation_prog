DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn't been the best lately. It feels a little weaker, you know? It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart palpitations – feeling weaker, you said. A few weeks, alright. Let’s try to get a better understanding of both of those. Could you tell me a bit more about the cough?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a bad cough all the time. Sometimes it's just a tickle, really. But then other times, especially when I lie down, it gets pretty deep. And it's… productive, if you know what I mean. I have to spit something up. It’s usually clear, but sometimes it’s a little… yellowish. And it always seems worse in the mornings. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A cough that’s worse when lying down and productive, meaning you’re bringing up mucus, with changes in colour… that's helpful. Yellowish mucus suggests it could be related to an infection, but we shouldn’t jump to conclusions. And you mentioned it’s worse in the mornings?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely worse in the mornings. I usually wake up feeling alright, then after I get out of bed and start moving around, it starts. It’s like something’s stuck in my chest, and then I have to cough it up. And it sometimes makes me a little short of breath, but not too bad. I can still walk around and do things, just… slower. I used to be able to do a lot more, of course. But my heart… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the cough is worse with activity and after lying down, producing mucus, and sometimes leaves you a little short of breath. You also feel your heart isn't as strong as it used to be. Let's talk about that heart feeling a bit more. Could you describe what you feel when you say it's weaker?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt, not exactly. It’s more like… a fluttering. Sometimes I feel it beating really fast, and sometimes it just feels… heavy, like it’s working too hard. And I get tired very easily. I used to be able to walk to the market and back without a problem, but now I have to stop and rest a couple of times. It's just… not the same. And I get a little breathless doing things I used to not even think about. My ankles also swell up sometimes, especially at the end of the day. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds right. A fluttering sensation, a feeling of heaviness, increased fatigue, and swelling in your ankles… those are all things we need to investigate further. It's good you’re mentioning these things. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright with you. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Years ago, the doctor told me I had something wrong with my heart. Congestive heart failure, he called it. It was a long time ago, though, maybe… fifteen years? I take some pills for it, a water pill and another one, I can’t remember the name. I also had high blood pressure for a while, but that seems to be under control now. I also had a little bit of diabetes, but the doctor said it was mild, and I've been careful with my sugar. Does that help? I’m trying to remember everything. It's hard getting old!
DOCTOR: It absolutely helps, Nadene. Thank you for sharing that. Congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, and mild diabetes… that gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned you take a water pill and another medication for your heart… do you happen to have a list of your medications with you, or perhaps know the dosages?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I think I do. Let me see… Here we are. It’s a bit faded, but… Okay, the water pill is called Furosemide, 40 milligrams, once a day in the morning. And the other one… let me see… it’s Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, also once a day. I think that’s everything. I’ve been taking these for years now, like the doctor told me. Sometimes I forget a dose, but I try to be good about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Furosemide 40mg and Lisinopril 20mg daily. That's very helpful. And you do your best to take them as prescribed, despite the occasional missed dose. Good. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask about any allergies you might have. Any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t think I have any food allergies, not that I’ve ever noticed. I used to get a little itchy when I was a little girl if I touched poison ivy, but that was a long time ago. As for medications… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. The doctor has given me a lot of different pills over the years, and I don’t remember having a bad reaction to any of them. I did get a rash once, years ago, after taking some antibiotics, but the doctor said it wasn't an allergy, just a side effect. Does that make sense? I always tell the doctor if something doesn't feel right, so I think I’d know if I was allergic to something.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors. You’ve kept a good track of that, and that’s very helpful. Alright, Nadene, I think it’s time to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My ankles have been a little swollen lately, so I don’t mind you taking a look at those. And it's alright if it takes a while, I don’t rush things. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of a murmur… it's not very loud, but it’s there. It’s consistent with a history of congestive heart failure, but we’ll need to investigate further to see if anything has changed. Your lungs sound a little crackly at the base, especially on the left side. That could be fluid build-up, which again, is consistent with heart failure. Your blood pressure is 145/85. That's a little elevated, but not critically high. And yes, your ankles do have some swelling, as you mentioned. It’s pitting edema – meaning the swelling remains for a few seconds after I press on it. So, to summarise, I've heard some irregularities with your heart rhythm and crackles in your lungs, your blood pressure is a little high, and your ankles are swollen. It sounds like your heart failure may be a little worse than it was previously. We need to do some tests to confirm this and to see how best to manage it. Would you mind if we got some blood work done, and an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? Well, I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think tests are needed, then I’m happy to get them done. Blood work and an EKG… yes, that sounds alright. I just hope it’s not too serious. I don’t want to end up in the hospital again. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Should I cut back on salt? Or anything else?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Nadene, but let’s not jump to conclusions. These tests will give us a clearer picture, and then we can make a plan. You are absolutely right to think about things you can do in the meantime. Cutting back on salt is a very good idea. It will help reduce fluid build-up. Also, try to limit your fluid intake to about 2 liters per day. And, if you haven't already, it's important to weigh yourself daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain of more than 2 pounds in a day, that could be a sign of fluid build-up, and you should call the office immediately. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood and get an EKG done. She’ll also get your weight for me. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Salt, fluids, and weigh myself… I can do that. Two liters… that’s about eight glasses, right? And two pounds weight gain… I’ll keep an eye on that. The nurse… yes, she can do the blood work and the EKG. I’m a little nervous, but I trust you and the nurse to take good care of me. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It helps to know what’s going on, and what I can do to help. When will the nurse come to get me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease a little. It's completely normal to be nervous, but you're right to be proactive, and you’re doing a great job. The nurse, Maria, should be in shortly to get you started. She’s very experienced and will explain everything to you before she begins. It will only take a few minutes. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Just waiting for Maria now. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait, then. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I'll leave you to rest comfortably, then. Maria will be with you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to call out if you need anything at all.
