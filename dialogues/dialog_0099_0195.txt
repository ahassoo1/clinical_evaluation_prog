DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci, welcome. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s not really a problem, you see. More of a…a little boost I need. My daughter, she thinks I should come get a card from you. A “get well” card, or… encouragement, she said. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. A bit tired, maybe, but who isn’t? It’s just… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: A "boost," you say. And your daughter specifically suggested coming here for this…boost?
PATIENT: Yes, specifically here. She says you’re… thorough. And write very nice notes. Apparently, a card with a doctor’s signature is more… official? I don’t know, young people these days. They have such strange ideas. It’s just, she’s being quite insistent, and it’s easier to come than to argue with her, truthfully. She means well, but sometimes… sometimes she’s a bit much.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I appreciate her confidence in my note-taking abilities. Even if it’s for a somewhat…unconventional reason. Just to be absolutely clear, though, despite your daughter's concerns, you genuinely feel no underlying medical issues are present?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely none! Perfectly fine, I tell you. A little aches here and there, what can you expect at my age? But nothing a good night's sleep and a cup of chai can't fix. It's not like I'm sick sick. She just...she worries if I don't have something 'official' saying I'm alright. Honestly, I think she just wants to show her friends how caring she is. It's all a bit much, but what's the harm in a card, right? As long as I don't have to fill out a bunch of paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. Just so I can document everything properly – and avoid any future concerns from your daughter – let’s just run through a quick, standard review of systems. It’s routine, and it will simply confirm what you’re telling me – that you’re in good health. It will only take a few minutes. We’ll start with your cardiovascular system. Any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A review? Really? I just want a card. But alright, if you insist. Chest pain… no, not at all. Sometimes a little flutter in my chest if I have too much tea, but that’s just the caffeine, I think. Palpitations… I don’t know what that even means, to be honest. And swelling in my ankles? No, my feet are perfectly normal. A bit calloused from walking barefoot, maybe, but not swollen. This is rather a lot of fuss for a simple card, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: "Flutter" is good to note. And palpitations simply refer to feeling a racing or irregular heartbeat. Alright, good. Let's move on to your respiratory system. Any shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing?
PATIENT: Wheezing? No, I don’t wheeze. I used to sing quite well, you know. Still do, sometimes, when my husband isn't home. He says I'm a bit loud. But no wheezing. And no shortness of breath. I walk to the market every day, up the hill and everything. A bit winded maybe, but that's just the hill. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure you need to ask all these questions? It's just a card! You're starting to make me feel unwell, worrying about what you're writing down.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Micucci. It's simply standard practice to rule out any underlying issues, even when a patient reports feeling well. It’s for your own benefit, as much as for documentation. Now, moving onto your gastrointestinal system - any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Now you’re asking about my stomach? Really? My daughter sends me all sorts of herbal remedies, you know, for digestion. So, no nausea, no vomiting. A little constipation sometimes, if I don't eat enough fruits. But nothing serious! And no abdominal pain. I eat my lentils and rice every day, like a good Nepalese woman should. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to think you’re trying to find something wrong with me. It's very unsettling. I just want a card with a nice signature! Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I assure you, I am not attempting to find anything wrong. I’m attempting to conduct a basic medical assessment, as I am obligated to do. While your daughter’s concerns may seem… unusual, it is my professional duty to ensure that you are, in fact, in good health before providing any documentation. Now, let’s finish this quickly. Any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking about my eyes and ears? Honestly! Very well. My vision… a little blurry up close, I suppose. That’s just age, isn’t it? I need my glasses for reading, as you can see. And my hearing… well, my husband mumbles a lot, so sometimes I have to ask him to repeat himself. But that's him, not me! Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I feel perfectly fine, and now you’re making me question whether I am sick! All this fuss for a card… it’s truly baffling. I’m starting to wish I hadn’t come.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Micucci, I’m going to be direct with you. While you insist you feel “perfectly fine,” you're reporting several changes – blurry vision, difficulty hearing, occasional constipation, palpitations with caffeine. These are not things to be dismissed, even if you attribute them to age or your husband. I understand your daughter's motivation is unusual, but her concern – however misplaced – has prompted you to seek medical attention. And I have a professional obligation to address these issues, even if they seem minor to you. I'm going to recommend a basic blood work panel to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels, and a simple hearing test. It’s a standard procedure, and it will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re going to draw blood and poke at my ears? After all this questioning? Honestly! This is absolutely preposterous. My daughter sent me with a request for a card, Doctor, not a full medical examination. I came here for a small kindness, a bit of reassurance, and now you're talking about blood work and hearing tests? It’s simply outrageous! I’m perfectly capable of hearing just fine, and my vision is perfectly acceptable for my age. And as for blood work… I haven't even had a good cup of chai today! No, Doctor, I will not be subjected to any tests. I want a card, with a nice signature, and I want to leave. Now. This is a complete waste of my time. If you won't write me a card, then I’ll just go somewhere else. I’m sure there’s another doctor in this town who understands a simple request when they hear one.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Micucci. I respect your decision. However, I must state for the record that declining a basic assessment, despite reporting multiple changes, is not advisable. I cannot, in good conscience, provide documentation stating you are in perfect health without a minimum level of evaluation. I will write a note stating that you presented today requesting a “wellness card” and declined any medical assessment. This is all I am able to offer. Have a good day. .
