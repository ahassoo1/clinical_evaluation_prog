DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it's been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. And my mouth… it feels very dry. My eyes too, actually. It’s just… a gradual thing, I think. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradually increasing difficulty breathing and dryness in your mouth and eyes. I understand it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when this began. Can you describe the breathing difficulty a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not… a wheezing sort of thing. More like… I have to try harder to get a full breath. Like there isn’t quite enough air. It’s worse when I… move around, I think. Or… if I’m talking for a long time. It doesn’t happen all the time, though. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine. It’s… confusing.
DOCTOR: So it's exertional, and intermittent…not constant. And you say it feels like you have to work harder to breathe, not a wheezing or tightness?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… right. “Exertional.” That's a good word for it. Not a wheeze… no. And not tight, exactly. Just… more effort. I apologize, Doctor. I'm not very good at explaining. It's… hard to put into words, and I don't… recall ever having this described to me before.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Kobler. These things are difficult to describe, and it's perfectly alright if you don't have the medical vocabulary. We'll get to the bottom of it together. Now, aside from the breathing and the dryness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I have been… rather tired lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And I've been… thirsty a lot. I drink a lot of water, but it doesn't seem to help much with the dryness. Other than that… I don’t… believe so. My memory isn't what it used to be, so it’s possible I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and fatigue. We'll explore that. Now, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… is difficult. I was… divorced a few years ago, and things were… not entirely amicable. My medical records… I believe they may be with my ex-husband. I’m not certain. I have private insurance, I know that much. And I… I have been generally healthy, I think. I don’t… recall any major illnesses or surgeries. I apologize again, Doctor. I truly wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… things are a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. Don't worry about it at all. We can work with what you do remember, and we can certainly request records if needed. Let's try this: have you had any significant injuries or hospitalizations, even if you don’t remember the details?
PATIENT: Hmm… I… think I broke my arm once, when I was a child. A long time ago. It healed, of course. And… I may have had the flu a few times. Nothing serious, I don’t believe. I… spent a few days in the hospital once, but I truly can’t recall why. It was… a long time ago. I'm so sorry, Doctor. I feel like I’m being utterly useless. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: You are not being useless at all, Ms. Kobler. It sounds like you've had a relatively uneventful medical history, which is good. Now, are there any illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult. My family… wasn’t very close. We didn't… talk much about those things. My mother… she had some sort of… heart trouble, I think. But I don’t know the details. And… my father… he was a fisherman, and… well, life was hard for him. I don't recall any other significant illnesses in the family, but again… I’m afraid my memory is… unreliable. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart trouble in your mother, otherwise not much known. Now, Ms. Kobler, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. I haven’t had any… reactions to anything that I recall. But… I haven’t taken many medications in my life. Just… over-the-counter things for colds, perhaps. And… I don't have any food allergies, not that I know of. I apologize again, Doctor. I wish I could be more certain. It’s just… things aren't as clear as they used to be. I truly appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Ms. Kobler. And your patience is appreciated as well. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not taking anything currently. Not even vitamins. I haven't taken anything regularly for… a long time, I think. I used to take a multivitamin, perhaps, but I stopped. I… I don’t really have much of an appetite these days, so I haven't felt the need. I apologize for being so vague. I feel like I’m failing at this.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications currently. No need to apologize at all. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I will… try to be as helpful as possible. It’s just… I may not be able to recall all the details. But I will do my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here, we can begin. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Your breathing sounds slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles noted. Now, I'm listening to your heart… rate is regular, but there's a faint murmur… difficult to characterize at this point. Blood pressure is 118 over 76. Oxygen saturation is 94%. Throat appears slightly dry, but no significant inflammation or redness. Mucous membranes are a little pale.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… alright. Diminished… I don’t know what that means, exactly. And a murmur? Is that… bad? My throat does feel dry, you’re right. And I have been feeling rather tired, as I mentioned. Pale… well, I haven’t looked at myself in the mirror recently. It's just… I haven’t had much reason to. Is something… seriously wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Ms. Kobler. “Diminished” simply means the sound of your breathing is a little quieter than expected. A murmur is an extra sound the heart makes - many murmurs are harmless, but it’s something we need to investigate further. The dryness and fatigue are also concerning, and, taken together with your symptoms, warrant some additional testing. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We’ll also want to run an EKG to assess your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Testing… Yes, that sounds… sensible. I understand. A complete blood count… that checks for… things? And a metabolic panel… and the thyroid… I apologize, Doctor. I'm just… getting a little overwhelmed. EKG… that’s for my heart, right? Is it… painful? I just… I want to know what’s happening. Is it something serious? I feel… rather frightened.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel frightened, Ms. Kobler. It’s my job to explain everything and help you understand what’s going on. A complete blood count will check for things like anemia and infection. The metabolic panel looks at your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. The thyroid panel checks your thyroid hormone levels, as that can sometimes cause fatigue and other symptoms. And yes, the EKG checks your heart rhythm. The EKG is completely painless. Small sensors will be placed on your chest, and they will record the electrical activity of your heart. It takes just a few minutes. At this point, we don't know what’s causing your symptoms, and it could be any number of things. These tests will give us a better understanding and help us determine the best course of action. I will review the results as soon as they are available and discuss them with you in detail. Now, while we are waiting for the results, I'd like you to stay well-hydrated and get plenty of rest. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: Okay… that makes… a little more sense. No latex allergies, no. I understand about the hydration and rest. I will… try my best. It's just… hard to rest when you’re feeling… anxious. And I… I keep forgetting things. I worry I won't remember what you tell me. Perhaps… if you could write down the instructions? Just in case. And… when will the results be available? A few days? A week? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just… I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No apologies necessary at all, Ms. Kobler. It's important to be informed, and I'm happy to answer all your questions. “1. Stay well-hydrated – drink at least 8 glasses of water per day. 2. Get plenty of rest – aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night. 3. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the test results. 4. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3-5 business days to discuss the results." The results should be available within 3-5 business days. I will call you as soon as they are in, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very… helpful. 3-5 business days… I will… mark it on my calendar. No, I believe that’s all for now. I appreciate your patience and… kindness. It’s… a relief to have someone listening. I… I feel a little less frightened, actually. Thank you again, Doctor Pirl. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kobler. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
