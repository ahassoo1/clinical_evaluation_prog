DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Croonquist, welcome. I’m Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, hello. Just… lab work, I think? The usual. Honestly, I don't really keep track of these things anymore. Medicare sent something… a form, maybe? I just need what they asked for, if that's alright. Quick as you can, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here a request for some routine bloodwork and a physical, covered by Medicare. You're right, it's all here. "Routine check-up and labs" it says. Just to be sure, are you feeling alright generally?
PATIENT: Generally… yes, I suppose. Old. Everything feels… old. Nothing hurts particularly, if that makes sense? I mean, there’s the usual creaks and groans, but that’s just… being this age, isn't it? I really don't recall being told anything specific was wrong. Is a physical really necessary? It’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you aren't experiencing any specific pain. Even if nothing feels acutely wrong, a physical can still be helpful to get a baseline and make sure everything is functioning as it should, especially as we get older. It’s a good way to catch things early, if there are any subtle changes. It doesn’t have to be extensive, just a quick check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look at your general health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose a quick look can’t hurt. Just… please don't take too long. I have… things to do. And honestly, I don't remember the last time I was poked and prodded. It's probably been decades.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit here for a moment, I'll get that started. Then we can do a quick listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we can talk about any concerns you have, and go over the bloodwork request. Sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds… fine. Yes, go ahead. Blood pressure first, you said? This cuff doesn't feel too tight, does it? I always worry about those things. It’s… restricting.
DOCTOR: Not at all, I’ll make sure it’s comfortable. It should feel snug, but not constricting. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Here we go… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so for your age. It's good to get a baseline reading though. Okay, just breathe normally… heart sounds are regular, a little murmur, which is common with age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Anything bothering you in particular, like shortness of breath, chest pain, or persistent cough?
PATIENT: No… no cough. I do get… winded, sometimes. Walking up stairs, mostly. But I always figured that was just… the age. And… a bit of a tightness in my chest now and then, but nothing… alarming. It comes and goes. Really, I don’t make a fuss. I’ve always been… stoic, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. Shortness of breath with exertion and occasional chest tightness are worth noting. It's good you've been stoic, but sometimes it's best to get these things checked out, just to be safe. To get a better picture of what's going on, I’d like to order a simple EKG – that’s a heart tracing – and a chest X-ray. The X-ray will allow us to look at your lungs and heart, and the EKG will help us assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… and a what now? A chest… picture? Look, I really just came for the lab work. Are these necessary for the Medicare thing? I’m trying to avoid… complications. And frankly, I don’t do well in hospitals. Bad memories.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. Those aren’t strictly necessary for the routine Medicare check-up. But, given your shortness of breath and occasional chest tightness, I would recommend them to rule out any potential heart or lung issues. It's simply a precautionary measure. The EKG and X-ray can be done right here in the clinic – no hospital visit required. It’s quick and painless. If everything looks normal, we can proceed with just the bloodwork as originally planned. Would you be more comfortable if we just stick to the blood work today, and perhaps discuss these further with a specialist?
PATIENT: A specialist… yes, perhaps that would be best. I don’t like extra tests if they aren't absolutely needed. Just the blood work, then. And quickly, if you don't mind. I have… appointments. Old friends. We don't have much time left, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll just do the bloodwork then. We'll get that drawn right away. The phlebotomist, Maria, is very skilled. She’ll make it as comfortable as possible. Maria, could you please come in and draw blood for Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Good. Yes, good. Quickly now. I don't have a strong constitution, you see. Always faint at the sight of needles. But I'll… I'll try to be brave. Just… let me know when it's all over.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take extra care. Maria is excellent at making patients comfortable, and I’ll be right here with you. It will be over before you know it. I’ll let you know as soon as it’s finished. Just try to relax, and take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Right. Deep breaths. Yes. I… I used to be good at that. Years ago. Before… everything. Just hurry, please. That’s all I ask. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Maria, this is Mr. Croonquist. He’s a little anxious about the blood draw and has a history of faintness. Could we take extra precautions and make sure he’s comfortable?
