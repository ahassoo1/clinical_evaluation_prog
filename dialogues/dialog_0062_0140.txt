DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, to be frank. It’s a… a problem in my mouth. A white coating, you see. It’s quite bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't hurt exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white coating in your mouth. I understand it's a bit bothersome, and that's good you're getting it checked out, even if it doesn't hurt. It's always best to figure things out. When did you first notice this coating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Honestly? I’m not entirely sure. A week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. I don’t spend a great deal of time examining my mouth, if you understand. It just… appeared. It’s not as if it’s a pressing matter.
DOCTOR: That's alright, a lot of things develop gradually. So, about a week or so. Has anything changed in your routine around that time?
PATIENT: Changed? No, not really. Same work, same meals… my wife prepares everything, as always. We haven’t been traveling. I did try a new brand of mouthwash, now that you mention it. Some… herbal concoction she picked up at the market. Perhaps that’s it? Honestly, these natural remedies… usually a waste of money.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new herbal mouthwash around the same time. That’s a good thing to know. And just to clarify, you said your wife prepares your meals - have there been any changes to what you're eating recently?
PATIENT: No, no changes to the food. She makes the same things she always does. Chicken, rice, vegetables… perfectly normal fare. I assure you, my diet is not the issue here. It’s probably this ridiculous mouthwash. A perfectly good rinse is all one needs, not some… botanical brew.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just covering all bases. Now, aside from the white coating, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I told you, it doesn't hurt. Perhaps a little… taste difference, now that I think about it. A bit bland, everything. But that could be anything. Honestly, I’m wasting my time here, aren’t I? It’s just a bit of white stuff. .
DOCTOR: It's not a waste of time at all, Antoine. Even small changes can sometimes point to something we should address. A bland taste is something to note. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any pain when you eat or drink?
