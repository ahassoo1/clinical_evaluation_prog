DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, my… where to begin? Well, I’ve been having quite a bit of pain, down low. In my abdomen, you see. It comes and goes, but when it is here, it’s… substantial. I believe that’s the correct word. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it looked at. I do have… a condition. Lupus, I think they call it? It’s been some years since the diagnosis, and my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Alese. “Substantial” is a very good word to describe pain, and it’s wise to get it checked out. Lupus is important information, as it can certainly be related to abdominal pain. Just to clarify, when you say “a little while now,” could you give me a rough estimate of how long you’ve been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate. That is difficult. Let me think… It feels like… several months, perhaps? Three or four, I would guess. It’s hard to pinpoint, really. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, and other times it’s… sharper. It’s not constant, thankfully. There are days where I barely notice it at all. But those days are becoming less frequent, I fear. I apologize for being so vague; my mind just doesn’t hold onto dates like it once did.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alese. It's common for memories of when symptoms start to be a little hazy. Three or four months is helpful, thank you. And it’s good to know it's not constant. You mentioned it's a dull ache sometimes and sharper at other times. Could you describe where specifically in your abdomen you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… Well, it’s mostly… low down. In the center, I think. But sometimes it radiates, you see. It feels like it spreads to both sides. More often the right side, perhaps. It’s not high up, definitely lower abdomen. Almost… where your stomach is, but a bit further down. It's difficult to explain without… pointing, I suppose. . I do hope that makes some sense. I’m not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Alese, and you’re describing it perfectly well. Lower, central abdomen with radiation to both sides, more often the right. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, aside from the pain itself, have you noticed any other symptoms that seem to come and go with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think carefully… Well, I have been rather tired lately. More tired than usual, even for me. And my appetite hasn’t been quite what it used to be, though that could just be old age creeping up on me! Sometimes, when the pain is particularly bad, I feel a little… nauseous. Not enough to… be sick, just a bit queasy. And I think… I’ve been going to the restroom more frequently. But again, it’s hard to say for certain. My body feels rather… out of sorts, generally. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very helpful, Alese. Fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea with the pain, and increased frequency of restroom visits… We're building a good picture here. When you say increased frequency of restroom visits, are we talking about urination or bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That's a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it specifically. I believe… urination, yes. I've been needing to go more often, and sometimes it feels… urgent. Not painful, just… frequent. I don’t believe my bowel movements have changed significantly, thankfully. That's one thing I haven't been worrying about, at least. Is that information useful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Very useful, thank you. Frequent urination with urgency… Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you mind?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, ask away. I'll do my best to answer. As I mentioned before, my memory isn't the greatest, so please do forgive me if I'm a little slow or forgetful. I believe I’ve been under the care of doctors for quite some time, but the details… they escape me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alese. Take your time, and we'll work through it together. You already mentioned your lupus diagnosis. Do you know when you were diagnosed with lupus, or who your primary rheumatologist was at the time?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a difficult one. It was… quite some time ago. Perhaps… twenty years or more? I truly can't recall the exact year. I was living in… another state then. I believe the doctor’s name was Dr. Hemlock, but I’m not entirely certain. It was a large practice, and I saw different doctors at times. I do remember that they gave me medication… pills, of course. But the name escapes me. It was a long time ago, and I've been on and off different medications since then. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You’re not unhelpful at all, Alese. Twenty years ago is a long time, and it's perfectly understandable that details are fuzzy. Knowing you were under the care of Dr. Hemlock and were on medication for your lupus is helpful. Do you currently see a rheumatologist for your lupus?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I haven't seen a rheumatologist in… many years. After a time, the symptoms became more manageable, and I felt it wasn’t necessary to continue regular visits. I was managing it with my general practitioner, you see. And then… life happened. I moved, and things got… complicated. I should probably revisit that, shouldn’t I? But it’s been such a long time, and I suppose I’ve just gotten used to handling it on my own.
DOCTOR: It’s common to fall out of regular care, and life certainly does happen. We can certainly discuss re-establishing care with a rheumatologist later if you'd like. Now, aside from lupus, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I do have… high blood pressure. I was diagnosed with that several years ago, and I take medication for it. A small pill, every morning. And… I believe I had a bout of… diverticulitis, some time ago. It was quite painful, and I had to go to the hospital. But that was many years ago, and I haven't had any trouble with it since. I think those are the main ones. I'm sure there have been minor ailments over the years, but nothing significant.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and a history of diverticulitis. And you're currently taking medication for your blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. A small white pill every morning. I believe it’s… Lisinopril. Though I could be mistaken. It's been a while since anyone asked me about my medications specifically. I just take it as prescribed. I try to be a good patient, you see. Though my memory does fail me from time to time.
DOCTOR: You are a very good patient, Alese. It’s more important that you take your medication as prescribed than remember the name perfectly. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh dear… surgeries. Let me think carefully… Yes, I believe I had my appendix removed when I was a young woman. A long, long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy as well, many years later. That was… necessary, unfortunately. Those are the only two surgeries I can recall. I do believe there was a small procedure on my knee at one point, but it was so minor, I barely remember it.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and a hysterectomy. Okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me see… My mother… she had heart trouble, I believe. She passed away when I was still quite young. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. He also suffered from high blood pressure. As for autoimmune diseases… I don't recall anyone specifically being diagnosed with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. But my aunt… she had something… a chronic illness, that caused a lot of pain. I don't recall the specifics, unfortunately. My family wasn't one for talking about medical matters, you see. It was considered… private. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alese. Knowing about the heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure in your parents is helpful. And it’s common for families to not discuss medical history openly. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh my. Social history? Well, I’ve never been a particularly… social person. I’m single, never married. I have a few… acquaintances, but no close family nearby. I live alone, and I manage quite well on my own. I enjoy reading, and gardening, when the weather permits. I used to travel quite a bit, but that was many years ago. I’ve lived a… quiet life, you could say. Not much excitement. Is that what you were looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Alese. Knowing you live alone, enjoy reading and gardening, and haven't been traveling recently is helpful. Now, have you ever smoked cigarettes or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never been one for smoking. It never appealed to me, and my parents discouraged it. I've always been quite careful about my health, despite my… forgetfulness. I believe in moderation, you see. Though I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner from time to time. Is that acceptable, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Perfectly acceptable, Alese. A glass of wine is fine. Now, how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. As I said, I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps… two glasses on a special occasion. But I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. It’s more of a… social thing, you see. Or a way to relax after a long day. I certainly don’t drink to excess. I’m not a heavy drinker, Doctor. Perhaps one or two times a week, if that. And never more than two glasses at a time.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Alese. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think carefully… Oh, yes! I do take something for my arthritis. It’s… a pain reliever, I believe. And I occasionally take something for… sleep. When I’m having trouble getting to sleep, that is. It’s a small, white pill. I can’t recall the name, unfortunately. And I sometimes take something for… indigestion. When I eat something that doesn’t agree with me. But that’s only occasionally. Is that helpful, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague; my memory is simply not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Alese. It's perfectly alright. Pain medication, something for sleep occasionally, and something for indigestion. We'll try to get a complete list together shortly. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your current symptoms. You mentioned abdominal pain. Can you rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you've ever experienced?
PATIENT: Oh my. A scale of 0 to 10… That’s a difficult one. It varies so much, you see. On a good day, it’s perhaps a 2 or 3. Barely noticeable. But when it’s bad… it can be quite severe. Perhaps an 8 or 9. It’s a sharp, aching pain, and it makes it difficult to move around. It’s worse when I’m stressed, or when I’ve eaten something heavy. And it seems to be getting worse lately, unfortunately. I do try to manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don’t always help. I apologize for being so vague; it’s difficult to quantify pain, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. An 8 or 9 at its worst is significant. And it's helpful to know it's worse with stress and heavy meals. You mentioned over-the-counter pain relievers. What specifically have you been taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… mostly ibuprofen, I believe. Or naproxen, sometimes. Whatever I have in the cupboard, really. I don't take it regularly, only when the pain is bad. Perhaps two or three pills at a time, if needed. It doesn't always help, and I worry about taking too much. My stomach doesn’t always agree with those pills, you see. They sometimes give me indigestion. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Alese. Ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. Now, are there any other symptoms that accompany your pain?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When the pain is particularly bad, I do experience some… bloating. My stomach feels quite full and uncomfortable. And I sometimes feel… nauseous, as I mentioned before. Not enough to be sick, just a little queasy. And occasionally, I have… difficulty sleeping. The pain keeps me awake at night. And when it's really bad, I do feel a little… shaky. Like I’m going to faint. It doesn't happen often, but it's quite frightening when it does. Is that helpful, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Alese. Bloating, nausea, difficulty sleeping, and shakiness with the pain. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… yes, actually. I have been… more constipated lately. It’s a bit difficult to… pass things, if you understand what I mean. And the stool is… harder than usual. It hasn’t been a major problem, but it’s definitely a change from what I’m used to. I apologize for being so vague; it’s not a very pleasant topic to discuss. But I thought it might be relevant.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. It's good to know. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool or any changes in the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s… a difficult question. I don’t think so. I haven't noticed any blood in my stool. And the color seems… normal, as far as I can tell. It’s… brown, of course. But I haven’t been paying particularly close attention, to be honest. It’s not something I usually think about. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at noticing these things. It’s a bit embarrassing to discuss, you see.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Alese. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… no, I haven’t had a fever or chills. And I don’t believe I’ve lost any weight recently. In fact, I might have gained a little, if anything. I do enjoy my food, you see. But I haven’t been feeling particularly well lately, so I haven’t been eating as much as usual. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at remembering these things. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Alese. Now, I'm going to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at medical things.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142 over 88, pulse is 78 and regular, respiration is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear to auscultation. Okay, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any pain. There's mild tenderness in the lower central abdomen and right lower quadrant. No rebound tenderness or guarding noted. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly decreased. Alright, Alese. Everything seems relatively normal, but there is some tenderness in your lower abdomen. I’d like to ask some further questions now, and then we will discuss some potential next steps. Does this all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all makes perfect sense. Mild tenderness in my lower abdomen… that sounds about right. That's where the pain is, of course. And slightly decreased bowel sounds… I suppose that explains why I’ve been a little… constipated. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at understanding medical things. But thank you for explaining it to me so clearly. Please, proceed with your questions. I’ll do my best to answer them.
DOCTOR: You’re not vague at all, Alese. Alright, considering your symptoms – the abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and mild tenderness I found on examination – and your history of lupus, we need to consider a few possibilities. Lupus itself can cause abdominal symptoms, but we also need to rule out other conditions. Have you had any recent changes in your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve been taking the same medications for quite some time now. Just my blood pressure medication, and the pain reliever for my arthritis. I haven’t added anything new, or changed the dosage of anything. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at remembering these things. But I’m quite certain I haven’t changed anything recently. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Alese. Considering you haven’t changed any medications, and given your symptoms, I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine test. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health, check for inflammation, and rule out any infections. The urine test will help rule out a urinary tract infection, which can sometimes cause abdominal pain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Blood tests and a urine test… that seems reasonable. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to figure out what’s going on. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at understanding medical things. But I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for the tests.
DOCTOR: That’s great, Alese. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for the tests. You can eat and drink normally. We’ll draw the blood in the lab just down the hall, and you can provide a urine sample in the restroom. The results should be back in a few days. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and eating a healthy diet. If your pain worsens, or you develop a fever, please contact the office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all makes perfect sense. Drink plenty of fluids, eat a healthy diet, and contact the office if my pain worsens or I develop a fever. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at remembering these things. I will do my best to follow your instructions. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Is there anything else I need to know?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t think so, Alese. I also want to emphasize that it's important to continue to see your primary care physician for your regular checkups. And, if you haven’t seen a rheumatologist in a while, I’d recommend scheduling an appointment with one. They can help manage your lupus and monitor for any complications. While we’re waiting for the results, let’s discuss a plan. If your pain becomes unbearable, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, but be sure to follow the dosage instructions on the label. And, if your constipation worsens, you can try a mild stool softener. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Ibuprofen or naproxen if the pain becomes unbearable, and a stool softener if the constipation worsens. I apologize for being so vague; I'm not very good at remembering these things. I will do my best to follow your instructions. I think I’ve got it all now. Thank you so much for your time and patience, Doctor Solero. I really appreciate it. Is there anything else I can do? Or, should I go to the lab now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. It was my pleasure to meet you. You can go to the lab now, and they’ll take care of everything. They’ll just need a copy of my order, which I’ve already sent over. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if your pain worsens or you develop a fever, please contact us immediately. Thank you again for coming in today. I wish you all the best. .
