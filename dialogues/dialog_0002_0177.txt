DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… something. Down there. It’s… leaking. I don’t know what to call it. It’s not good, I tell you. Not good at all. It’s been happenin’ a little while now, I think. Maybe a week? I lose track, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Leaking” down there… that sounds concerning, and we definitely want to figure out what’s going on. About a week, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a week or so. Maybe longer. Time just… goes. It’s not like a lot, mind you. But it’s there. And it smells funny. Not a good smell. Like… old fish, maybe? I keep tryin’ to wash it away, but it just comes back. It’s embarrassing, really. A woman my age… shouldn’t be dealin’ with this.
DOCTOR: I completely understand why that would be embarrassing, Jimmi, and you’re right, we want to get this sorted out. It’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. The smell is a helpful clue, actually. To get a better idea of what's happening, could you describe the leakage a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm… well, it’s not like… a flood, you know? More like… drops. Little drops here and there. Sometimes clear, sometimes… kinda yellow. And sticky. It gets on my underwear, and it's not pleasant. I mostly wear dark colors now, just in case. I don’t know what else to tell you, Doctor. It just is. And it’s botherin’ me. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, drops, sometimes clear, sometimes yellow and sticky… that’s helpful. And it’s definitely causing you some worry. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the leakage?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feelin’ sick? No, not really. I feel a little… itchy sometimes. Down there, where the leakin’ is. And a little burnin’ when I… you know. Go to the bathroom. It’s not constant, mind you. Just now and then. And it hurts a little. Not a lot, but it’s there. It’s just… uncomfortable. Everything’s uncomfortable now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some itching, burning with urination, and some discomfort… that’s all good information. Have you noticed any pain anywhere else – like your lower abdomen, or your back?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back always aches, that’s just old age. But no, no pain down there, except for when I… go. And it’s not a sharp pain, more like… a sting. And my belly feels alright, I guess. I eat a lot of rice, so maybe that’s why it feels… full? I don’t know. I just feel tired, mostly. And embarrassed, like I said. This is just… a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain in your abdomen, just the familiar backache and the stinging with urination. And feeling tired overall. Thank you for sharing all of that, Jimmi. It sounds like this has been quite bothersome for you. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Oh dear. Let me think… Doc, I’m an old woman. I’ve had something over the years, I’m sure. But I don’t remember what. My husband, he took care of all that paperwork. He's gone now, bless his soul. I think I had high blood pressure once? But they gave me pills, and I took them for a while. I don't take anything now. I mostly just drink tea and eat rice. I don't go to the doctor much. They always poke and prod, and it’s just… a hassle.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely normal to not remember everything, especially after many years, and losing your husband must have made keeping track of things even harder. High blood pressure is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me see. Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was… a long time ago. And I had a baby, of course. They cut me open for that. But other than that… I don't think so. Maybe I had my appendix out? I’m not sure. Everything’s a blur, Doc. A real blur. I mostly just try to forget the bad parts. It’s easier that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child and a cesarean section for your baby. We'll make a note of those. Now, thinking about your family… do you know if anyone in your family has had any medical problems, like cancer or heart disease?
PATIENT: Family… oh, that’s a hard one. My mother, she died young. Something with her heart, I think. Real sudden. And my brother, he had… trouble breathin’. He smoked too much. But other than that, I don't really know. We didn't talk about those things much. My family, they were… quiet people. They kept things to themselves. We mostly just stuck to the island and kept to ourselves. It was a simpler time, I guess. Not like now.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother with heart problems and your brother with breathing difficulties. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! My husband, he smoked, but I always told him it was a terrible habit. And drinkin’? Just a little tea, Doc. Sometimes with a little sugar. I don't go for strong drinks. They don’t sit well with me. I mostly just like to sit on my porch and watch the birds. And worry about things, of course. That comes free. I don’t go out much anymore. Too many people, too much noise. It’s just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking and just a little tea. Watching the birds sounds lovely. One last question about your history before we move onto a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat everything, mostly rice. I’ve never had a problem with food. And I haven’t taken any medicine in years, so I can’t say I’m allergic to anything. Maybe dust? I sneeze sometimes when I’m cleanin’, but that’s just normal. I'm an old woman, Doc, I sneeze a lot. Everything bothers me these days. I just want to get rid of this leakin’, that’s all. It’s embarrassin’ and uncomfortable, and I want it gone.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Jimmi, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It really helps me to understand what’s going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay. Just a quick look to see what we’re dealing with. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I will explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lie down? Well… I guess so. But be gentle, Doc. I’m not as spry as I used to be. And please explain everything. I don’t like surprises. I’m a nervous woman, you see. And I want to know what you’re lookin’ for. Just tell me what you’re doin’ before you do it. Okay? I trust you, but I like to know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I will be very gentle and explain everything before I do it. You can absolutely stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It's a quick listen to make sure everything sounds normal. . Then I’ll just take your blood pressure. Okay, heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. That’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to need you to bend your knees and let me take a look at the area that’s been bothering you. I’ll use a light and a speculum, but I'll explain everything before I do it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A speculum? What’s a speculum? Is it gonna hurt? I don’t like things goin’ in there. My husband, he always did everything so gently. I don't want any pokin' and proddin'. Can't you just look at it? Is it really necessary? I'm a very sensitive woman, Doctor. Very sensitive. Explain it to me. Please. I need to know what you’re doin’. And be quick, okay? Just be quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Jimmi. A speculum is a small, curved instrument that helps me gently open the vaginal canal so I can see the inside. It's made of plastic and it doesn’t hurt, but it can feel a little bit of pressure or discomfort. It’s like a gentle widening, so I can get a good look. It's important to use the speculum to get a clear view, because that's the best way to figure out what’s causing the leakage and discomfort. I can see if there’s any irritation, inflammation, or infection. We absolutely can try to do a visual exam first, but it might not give me enough information to make an accurate diagnosis. If we can't see clearly, we may end up needing the speculum anyway. I promise to be very gentle and move slowly. I’ll explain every step before I do it, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Okay?
PATIENT: Hmm… a visual exam first, you say? Maybe that’s alright. Just look at it, don’t touch it. And be quick, Doc. Really quick. I don’t want to lie here all day. My legs are gettin’ tired. And tell me what you’re lookin’ for. What am I supposed to be lookin’ for? If you see somethin’ bad, just tell me straight. I’m an old woman, I’ve seen things. Just don’t poke around. Okay? And be gentle. You hear me? Gentle.
DOCTOR: I absolutely hear you, Jimmi. Gentle is the priority. And I will tell you everything I see, straight away. No poking, just looking. Okay, I’m just going to take a quick look at the outside of your vaginal area. I’m looking for any redness, swelling, or sores. . I do notice some mild redness around the opening, and a small amount of clear discharge. It doesn't look severely inflamed, but the redness is a bit concerning. I’m also noting some slight thinning of the skin, which can happen with age. This doesn't immediately indicate anything serious, but we need to get a better look to figure out what's going on. Do you feel any pain when I gently touch this area?
PATIENT: A little… a little sting. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a little burn. It’s not terrible, but it’s there. Especially when you touch there. . It’s been burnin’ a little when I… you know. Go to the bathroom. Maybe it's just old age, Doc? Everything hurts when you get old. My knees hurt, my back hurts, now there hurts. Is it somethin’ serious? I don’t want any bad news. I’m too old for bad news.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jimmi. The stinging is definitely helpful information. It could indicate some irritation or inflammation. And you're right, sometimes things just hurt more as we get older, but we still want to figure out why it's hurting. Okay, I think the best thing to do at this point is to use the speculum, just for a few moments, to get a better look. It will help me to see if there’s any infection, dryness, or other problems that are causing the leakage and burning. I will be very gentle and move slowly, and you can stop me at any time. Before I do that, would you like me to explain the procedure one more time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. One more time, I guess. It won't make it any easier, but… alright. Just tell me again what you’re gonna do. And promise me you’ll be gentle. Really gentle. And don’t poke. Promise. I hate pokin’ and proddin’. My husband, he always said a gentle touch is the best touch. Just tell me what to expect. And be quick. Please, be quick. I’m gettin’ nervous. Really nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I promise to be very gentle. The speculum is a small, curved instrument made of plastic. It's about the size of your thumb. It doesn’t hurt, but you might feel a little bit of pressure as I gently open the vaginal canal. It's similar to how you feel during a pap smear, if you’ve ever had one. I’ll use a light to get a good look inside, and I’ll be looking for any redness, swelling, sores, or discharge. I’ll just quickly take a look, and then remove the speculum. It will only take a few moments. I will explain everything as I do it, and you can tell me to stop at any time. Before I start, I'm going to put on some gloves. This is just for hygiene. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Gloves. That doesn’t sound good. But… alright. I guess I’m ready. As ready as I’ll ever be. Just… be quick, Doc. And gentle. Remember gentle. And tell me what you’re seein’. Everything. Don’t leave nothin’ out. I want to know what’s goin’ on down there. And if it hurts, I’m tellin’ you to stop. Understand? Stop. Now just… get it over with. Quickly. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll tell you everything I see. And I will absolutely stop if you feel any pain. Okay, I’m just gently opening the speculum now. You might feel a little bit of pressure. Just breathe deeply and relax. Okay, now I’m just taking a look inside… … I do see some redness and dryness of the vaginal walls. It looks like there's some thinning of the tissue as well. There doesn't appear to be any active infection or sores, which is good. I’m also seeing a small amount of clear discharge. Okay, I’m removing the speculum now. That wasn't too bad, was it?
PATIENT: It wasn’t terrible. Just… uncomfortable. And cold. It felt cold down there. But not terrible. What does it mean, Doc? What does all that redness and dryness mean? Is it somethin’ serious? Am I sick? Is it somethin’ I caught? Oh dear. Don’t tell me it’s somethin’ terrible. I’m too old for terrible news. Just tell me straight. What is it? And what are we gonna do about it? Quickly, please. My heart is racin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, take a deep breath. It’s not necessarily something terrible. The redness and dryness you’re experiencing is very common, especially as we get older. It’s often caused by a decrease in estrogen levels during menopause. This can lead to thinning and dryness of the vaginal walls, which can cause discomfort, burning, and discharge. It’s called vaginal atrophy or atrophic vaginitis. It’s not something you “caught,” it’s a natural part of aging. And it’s very treatable. The good news is, there are a few things we can do to help. The most common treatment is estrogen therapy, which can help restore the vaginal lining and relieve your symptoms. There are different forms of estrogen therapy available – creams, tablets, or a vaginal ring. We can discuss which option might be best for you. We can also try using vaginal lubricants to help with discomfort. Would you like me to explain the different estrogen therapy options in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Estrogen? I don’t like takin’ pills. My daughter, she took estrogen, and she got sick. Real sick. I don’t want to get sick. Is there somethin’ else? Somethin’ without pills? I’m too old for pills. And I don’t want to get sick. Just somethin’ simple. Somethin’ I can rub on. Like a cream? That sounds better. Less scary. Can we just try a cream? Please, Doc? No pills. I don’t want any pills. And explain it to me. Everything. How long do I have to use it? What if it doesn’t work? What if I get sick? Explain it all. Slowly. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, absolutely. We can definitely start with a cream. That's a very reasonable approach, and it avoids the need for pills. The cream contains a low dose of estrogen, and it’s applied directly to the vaginal area. It helps to restore the vaginal lining and relieve your symptoms – the dryness, burning, and discomfort. It doesn't get absorbed into your bloodstream like pills, so it has fewer side effects. You would typically apply a small amount of cream to the vagina using an applicator, once a day for a few weeks. After that, you may be able to reduce the frequency to a few times a week to maintain the benefits. As for side effects, they are usually mild, such as some spotting or slight vaginal discharge. Rarely, some women may experience some breast tenderness or nausea. As for whether it will work, it’s very effective for most women. It takes a few weeks to see the full benefits, but many women notice improvement within a week or two. If it doesn’t work, we can discuss other options, such as a vaginal ring or a different type of estrogen therapy. I understand your concerns about getting sick, and I want to assure you that the risks are very low with this treatment. However, it’s important to be aware of the potential side effects and to let me know if you experience any unusual symptoms. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Okay. A cream sounds… alright. Less scary than pills. And if it doesn't work, we can try somethin’ else? That’s good. I like havin’ options. And if I get any spotin’ or feelin’ sick, I just tell you? And how much does it cost? I don’t have much money, you see. My husband, he took care of all the money things. I don’t want to spend a lot of money. Just somethin’ simple and not too expensive. And one more thing. Can I still… you know… be with my friend? Will it hurt? Will it be okay? I don’t want to hurt him. That’s important. Tell me straight. Is it okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. Yes, we can absolutely start with the cream. And yes, we can always discuss other options if it doesn't work. The cost of the cream varies depending on the pharmacy, but it's typically around $30-$50 for a tube. I can write you a prescription that you can take to a discount pharmacy to get a better price. I can also see if there are any patient assistance programs that can help cover the cost. And yes, you can absolutely still be with your friend. The cream will actually help make things more comfortable during intimacy. It will restore some lubrication and reduce any discomfort. It shouldn't hurt, and it should be perfectly okay. In fact, it may even make things more enjoyable. It's important to communicate with your friend and let him know what you're experiencing. He'll be supportive and understanding. I want you to feel comfortable and confident, and I'm here to help you every step of the way. Shall I write you a prescription for the cream?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A prescription would be good. Thank you, Doc. You’re a good doctor. You explain things so well. And you don’t judge. That’s important. And can you write down the name of the cream? So I can remember it. My memory isn’t what it used to be. And the name of the pharmacy? Just in case I forget. And thank you again, Doc. You’ve made me feel much better. Just gettin’ it off my chest… it helps. Now, I think I’m ready to go home. I need to take a nap. All this talkin’… it’s tired me out. Thank you. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jimmi. I'm glad I could help. It was my pleasure. Here's a written prescription for the cream, along with the name and address of a discount pharmacy nearby. The cream is called Estrace Vaginal Cream. And the pharmacy is called Good Price Pharmacy, located at 123 Main Street. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And don’t worry about forgetting things, that’s perfectly normal. Take a nap and rest up. You deserve it. It was lovely meeting you, Jimmi. I’m glad you’re feeling a little better. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment in a month. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doc. You too. Goodbye now. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Jimmi. Take care. .
