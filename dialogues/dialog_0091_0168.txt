DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though, frankly, I wouldn't be here if I didn't feel it was… necessary. I’m dating someone, and I just want to ensure everything is… as it should be, before things progress too far. A woman has to be careful, you know. It’s not like the old days.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Prudence is always advisable, Ms. Pandolfi. I commend you for taking this proactive step. To clarify, are you concerned about sexually transmitted infections, or are there other health concerns you'd like to address in relation to your new relationship?
PATIENT: Well, naturally, that is a concern. One can’t be too careful these days, as I said. But it’s more than just… that. I want a complete picture, you understand? He’s… older. A good deal older. And one never truly knows a person until… well, you get my meaning. I want to be certain he isn't bringing anything to the table that I haven’t already accounted for. It’s about peace of mind, Doctor. Pure and simple.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pandolfi. A thorough assessment for your peace of mind is certainly reasonable, and I’m happy to provide that. It sounds like you are interested in a comprehensive health evaluation, encompassing not only sexually transmitted infections, but a general assessment of his overall health status as well. To begin, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your own medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Ask away, Doctor. Though, I must warn you, I have a rather… meticulous memory. Don't expect me to be vague. And please, don't patronize me with simple explanations. I assure you, I'm quite capable of understanding. I have Medicare, after all. They require a certain level of… detail.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Pandolfi, I wouldn’t dream of it. Your Medicare coverage is quite right to expect thoroughness, and I strive for clarity and precision in all my evaluations. And a meticulous memory is an asset, not a hindrance. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve always been quite diligent about my health. My mother always said, “Prevention is better than cure,” and she was a very sensible woman. I watch my diet, I exercise regularly – when the weather permits, of course – and I’ve never had any significant illnesses. A touch of the flu now and then, but nothing serious. I did have a rather unpleasant bout of shingles a few years ago, but that’s long resolved. And I keep up with all my vaccinations. I’m a very responsible person, Doctor. Honestly.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Ms. Pandolfi. A strong focus on preventative care is commendable. Shingles can be quite debilitating, so I'm glad you've recovered well. And your commitment to vaccinations is also reassuring. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Let me see… nothing major. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child – a very common procedure back then, I believe – and I spent a night in the hospital once with a rather severe case of appendicitis. But that was decades ago, and I recovered perfectly. No complications whatsoever. Beyond that, no. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I’m not the type to… break easily, you see. Both physically and… otherwise.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Pandolfi. Tonsillectomy and appendectomy are relatively common procedures, and it's reassuring to hear you recovered without complication. Could you tell me a bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a bit of a… complicated subject. My mother’s side was remarkably healthy, long-lived people, mostly. Though, my grandmother did have a touch of arthritis, and my great-aunt suffered from high blood pressure towards the end. On my father’s side… well, let’s just say there was a predisposition towards… certain mental instabilities. Nothing I care to elaborate on, frankly. And it’s certainly not relevant to my health. I've always been very grounded, very stable. It skipped a generation, thankfully. I don’t intend to revisit that part of my family history if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pandolfi. I respect your privacy and will certainly not press further on that topic. It is, of course, your decision what information you wish to share. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, I try to maintain a healthy routine. I'm married, and my husband and I enjoy… quiet evenings at home. We don’t really care for large gatherings. He’s a retired accountant – very sensible, very reliable – and we mostly keep to ourselves. I enjoy reading, and I volunteer at the local library a few afternoons a week. I don’t smoke, I drink very little – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion – and I’m not prone to… excesses of any kind. I consider myself a rather… well-behaved woman, Doctor. It’s a point of pride, really.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Pandolfi. A stable and healthy lifestyle is a significant asset. And volunteer work is commendable. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. And occasionally, I take an ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s quite rare. I prefer to address things naturally whenever possible. I have a rather… sensitive stomach, you see. I’m very careful about what I put into my body. Honestly, I wouldn’t dream of loading myself up with unnecessary chemicals. It’s just… not sensible. And I’ve always been rather skeptical of Big Pharma, if you don’t mind my saying so. They seem to push pills for everything these days.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Pandolfi. And it’s certainly prudent to be mindful of what you’re taking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve never had any allergic reactions. I’m rather… robust in that regard. I’ve always been able to tolerate most things. Though, I do find certain perfumes and strong floral scents rather… overpowering. But that’s merely a matter of personal preference, not an allergy. I pride myself on having a… strong constitution. It’s a family trait, you see.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Ms. Pandolfi. A strong constitution is certainly a good thing. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to confirm something. You mentioned earlier that your concern stemmed, in part, from wanting to be certain about your partner’s health. Would you like to discuss his medical history as well, if you have that information?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… a delicate subject. He’s not particularly forthcoming about such things. He prefers to keep his personal affairs… private, shall we say? He’s a bit older, you see, and has… lived a full life. He brushes off my attempts at polite inquiry, claiming he sees his doctor regularly and everything is “under control.” Honestly, I suspect he’s more concerned with maintaining a certain… image than being completely transparent. But I suppose if you were to ask him directly… he might be willing to cooperate, if pressed. Although I doubt he’d volunteer any information willingly. It's frustrating, really. A woman deserves to know these things, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Pandolfi. Transparency regarding health is certainly ideal in any relationship, and it’s understandable that you’d want to have that peace of mind. Perhaps, we could proceed with a basic screening for you initially, and if you feel comfortable, encourage him to schedule an appointment as well. We can discuss the specific tests we might recommend for someone his age, and I can provide him with a list of questions to discuss with his physician, should he prefer to keep his existing care team involved. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. A basic screening for me would be a good start. And perhaps, having a list of questions for him would… encourage him to be a bit more forthcoming. He does respect your profession, I believe. He’s always going on about the importance of “reliable counsel.” Yes, that’s a good idea. Let’s proceed with the screening for me, then. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say. Although, honestly, I doubt anything will be amiss. He seems perfectly healthy. But one can never be too careful, can one?
DOCTOR: Indeed, one can never be too careful, Ms. Pandolfi. We’ll proceed with a comprehensive screening for you, then. I’d like to start with a brief physical exam, including blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and auscultation of your heart and lungs. After that, we’ll draw some blood for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and some screening tests for sexually transmitted infections. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Though, I must insist on having a female nurse present during the physical exam. I’m a bit… sensitive, you understand. It’s merely a matter of personal comfort. And I would appreciate it if you could explain each test as you proceed, so I know exactly what’s being checked and why. I don’t like surprises, you see. I prefer to be fully informed at all times. Honestly, I’m not a difficult patient, but I do value clarity and respect.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. Your comfort and understanding are my priority. I will ensure a female nurse is present throughout the physical exam, and I will explain each test in detail before we proceed. Let me just confirm – you are comfortable changing into a gown for the exam?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable. Though, I must say, I have always been rather… particular about my undergarments. I trust the examination room is… private and properly sanitized? Honestly, I’ve heard such dreadful stories about these places. A woman has to maintain some standards, you know. And I do prefer a warm room. I get rather… chilled easily. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. Your comfort is paramount. I can assure you the examination room is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized between each patient. I've just adjusted the thermostat to ensure a comfortable temperature, and the room is entirely private. A gown and a clean drape will be provided. The nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to assist you with changing. Once you’re ready, I will return to begin the examination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Sarah, you say? I trust she’s… discreet and professional? Honestly, I’ve met some rather… unsavory individuals in my time. And I do appreciate you taking my preferences into consideration. It shows a certain… attentiveness to detail. Very well. I’ll await Sarah’s arrival, then. I suppose there’s nothing more to do for now but… prepare. Although, I must say, I do wish these things were less… intrusive. But one does what one must, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Indeed, Ms. Pandolfi. Sarah is a highly professional and compassionate nurse, and I’m confident you will be comfortable with her assistance. I will leave you to change, and return as soon as you are ready. Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
