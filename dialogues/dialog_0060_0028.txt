DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away. It’s been bothering me for… oh, I’d say about three weeks now. It feels deep in my chest, and sometimes it makes me feel really tired. My heart… it doesn’t feel right when I cough, either.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, alright. And you said it’s a deep cough… is it productive?
PATIENT: Productive? Oh, dear… you mean, do I cough anything up? Yes, yes I do. It’s… it’s clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit of white stuff. Not much, though. It's not like a terrible, rattling cough, if that makes sense. More… persistent. It just is.
DOCTOR: Clear or white mucus… okay. And it doesn't seem to be getting worse, just… staying the same for these three weeks?
PATIENT: No, it hasn’t gotten worse, thankfully. But it hasn’t gotten better, either. It’s just… there. It bothers me mostly at night. Keeps me up some. I have to sit up to breathe, you know? It feels… full. My heart feels like it’s working too hard when I lie flat.
DOCTOR: Sitting up helps, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, sitting up does help a lot. When I prop myself up with a couple of pillows, I can breathe easier. It’s not a cure, mind you, but it takes the pressure off my chest. And… well, I’ve been using extra pillows for a long time now, to be honest. Years. It just seems like it’s gotten… more necessary lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed in your life recently, Nadene?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… let me think. Not really. My grandson, Miguel, he came to visit last month, which was lovely. He brought his new wife, very nice girl. But… no, nothing major. I eat the same things, I walk the same amount… well, maybe a little less in the heat, you know? It’s been awfully hot this summer. No new medications, no falls, no new aches and pains… just this cough. And the tiredness.
DOCTOR: You mentioned tiredness. Is this a new development, or have you been feeling fatigued for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness… it's newer, I think. I always get a little tired, you know, at my age. But this is… different. It’s a deeper tiredness. Like I’m carrying a weight. It doesn't go away even after a good nap. I used to be able to get through the day with a little rest, but now… It feels like I need to sleep all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll check your oxygen levels. Then we can talk about some possibilities. Can you please sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Straight as I can. Go ahead. I always feel a bit nervous when they listen to my chest. It reminds me of my husband… he had trouble breathing, too. But don't you worry, I’ll be still.
DOCTOR: Okay, your oxygen is a little low at 92%, which isn’t great. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated as well, 150/90. And… I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, primarily on the right side. It sounds congested. Your heart sounds a bit irregular, too. Now, I'm not saying anything definitive yet, but this could indicate a few things. I think we need to get a chest X-ray just to rule out pneumonia or heart failure.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Heart failure? That's… that's what my husband had. Is it… is it bad? The tiredness… and the cough… and the pillows… It all makes sense now. I just… I just didn't want to think about it being that. What does the X-ray show? And what do we do if it is heart failure? I don’t want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Now, Nadene, let's not jump to conclusions. It could be heart failure, but it could also be something else. We need the X-ray to be sure. It’s a simple procedure, just a quick image of your chest. I'm ordering it now. As for what we do if it is heart failure… well, there are treatments. Medications to help your heart pump better, reduce fluid buildup, and manage your symptoms. Many people live very full lives with heart failure, with proper care. We'll start with the X-ray. Then we can discuss the results and create a plan. I’ll also want to do an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. And to be thorough, I’m going to order some blood work to check your kidney function and look for any signs of infection. The nurse will be in shortly to take you for the X-ray and EKG. In the meantime, try to relax. We're just gathering information right now.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds like a lot. But… alright. Information. That's good. The nurse will take me for the X-ray, you said? And then blood work? I always get cold when they take blood. Will I have to wait a long time for the results? I have a little bit of a headache now. Maybe it’s the worrying.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will take you for the X-ray and then draw some blood. I’ll ask them to be gentle, and you can tell them if you get cold easily. As for the results, the X-ray should be available within the hour. The blood work might take a day or two. I’ll call you as soon as I have everything back. We'll discuss it all then, and I'll explain everything clearly. In the meantime, is there anyone you’d like me to contact while you’re here?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good about the X-ray being quick. A day or two for the blood work is… alright. I can manage. Yes, please. Could you call my grandson, Miguel? He’s very good with things like this. His number is… let me think… 555-123-4567. He lives nearby and can come if I need anything. He worries about me, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve got Miguel’s number here. I’ll give him a quick call to let him know we’ve ordered some tests, and that you might need a ride home or some help afterwards. He doesn't need all the details right now, just a heads-up. Now, is there anything else I can do for you while we wait for the nurse?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. For being so thorough, and for calling Miguel. It makes me feel a little less scared. I just… I just want to feel better. And be able to sleep through the night again. That’s all. I suppose I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse then. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Nadene. We’ll do everything we can to help you feel better. Just relax, and the nurse will be with you shortly. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all.
