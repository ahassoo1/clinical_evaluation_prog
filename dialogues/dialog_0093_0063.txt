DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It's my back, really hurting. Been hurting for... well, a little while now, but worse these past few weeks. It makes it hard to do things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Back pain can be quite debilitating. “A little while now” is fairly vague, Ms. Meigs, if you don’t mind me saying. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry. Okay, um... I think it started maybe three months ago? Just a little ache after work, you know? I work at the factory, doing the boxes. But then, maybe a month ago, it started hurting even when I wasn't working. Now it's... constant, mostly. Some days it's just a dull ache, and some days I can barely stand up.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Meigs. That's helpful. So, three months ago, it began as an ache after work, related to your job at the factory, and has progressed to a constant pain over the past month, with fluctuations in intensity. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Okay. Hmm... it's not a sharp pain, not really. More like… heavy. A really, really heavy weight on my lower back. And sometimes, it feels like it goes down my leg a little bit, but not all the way to my foot. It's mostly just in my back, though. And it gets worse if I bend over, or try to lift anything. Even just twisting to look behind me makes it bad.
DOCTOR: Thank you. “Heavy” is a good description. And the radiation down the leg is important to note. Does this pain affect your sleep at all, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Oh yes. It does. I have to… I have to move a lot. Can’t get comfortable. I try to sleep on my side, with a pillow between my legs, but it still wakes me up. Maybe three or four times a night? Sometimes more. I’m always tired.
DOCTOR: I see. Disrupted sleep is certainly contributing to your fatigue. Have you noticed any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: No, not really. My legs feel… tired, like I said, but not weak. And no numbness. I can still walk okay, I can still do things, just… it hurts. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable and heavy. It doesn’t stop hurting.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Meigs. It sounds quite bothersome. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any back problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. When I was younger, I pulled a muscle lifting something heavy, years ago. It hurt really bad then, but it went away after a few weeks with rest. Nothing like this, though. This is… different. And… well, you probably already know, but I have cancer. They found it last year. It’s… in my lungs. That’s why I’m here, I guess. I worried this back pain might be… related.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Meigs. It is important for me to know about your cancer diagnosis, and your concern about a possible connection is very valid. We will certainly consider that as we evaluate your back pain. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me what treatment you have received for your lung cancer so far?
PATIENT: I had chemotherapy, for about six months. It stopped a little while ago. And… radiation too, on my chest. It helped, the doctors said. Things were good for a bit, but… I worry the cancer might have spread. That’s why I was so scared when my back started hurting. Is it possible it went to my bones? I’m sorry, I'm asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You are not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Meigs. It is completely understandable to be concerned about a possible connection between your back pain and your cancer history. Bone metastasis is certainly a possibility we need to investigate. Let’s talk about your past medical history more broadly. Aside from the lung cancer, do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, a few years back, but the doctor gave me some pills, and it went away. Besides that, I'm pretty healthy. I try to eat good, and I walk when I can, but… with the cancer and now this back pain, it's been harder. I don't have any trouble with my heart or anything like that. Just…tired all the time. Is that okay? Am I giving you enough information? I worry I forget things.
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Ms. Meigs. You are providing me with very helpful information, and it is perfectly normal to be concerned about remembering everything. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Do you have any family members who have had back problems, cancer, or bone diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm... My mother had arthritis in her hands, really bad. It made it hard for her to move. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had cancer too, I think. Lung cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don’t remember exactly. Nobody else, not that I know of, had any trouble with their back. They were mostly healthy people. I think. It's hard to remember things sometimes. Do you need me to think harder?
DOCTOR: No, that’s quite alright, Ms. Meigs. You’ve provided valuable information. Let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Yes, I used to. A long time ago. I quit about… ten years ago. Before the cancer. The doctors told me I had to. It was… hard, but I did it. I don't drink much alcohol either, just a little bit on special occasions. I live alone now, after the divorce. I try to keep busy, but it's hard sometimes. I used to like gardening, but with the back pain... it's hard to bend over. Does that make sense? I'm trying to tell you everything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Meigs. Thank you. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh yes. I take pills for my blood pressure, like I said. And some vitamins, just a multivitamin. And… the doctors gave me some pills to help with the pain after the chemotherapy. But they didn’t really help much, so I don’t take them anymore. I also use a cream on my skin sometimes, it gets dry. Is that everything? I feel like I’m forgetting something. I'm really sorry.
DOCTOR: You’ve been very thorough, Ms. Meigs. Don't worry about forgetting anything. We can always revisit things if necessary. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination to assess your back pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope you can find out what’s wrong. It's just… it hurts a lot. And I worry about the cancer. I just want to know what’s going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you would please lie down on your stomach on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to gently palpate your spine and the surrounding muscles to check for tenderness or any abnormalities. Then, I'll assess your range of motion, and we will do some neurological tests to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please let me know immediately if anything causes you significant pain. Okay, Ms. Meigs, can you tell me if this is tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Yes, right there. And a little bit on this side too. It's not sharp, just… sore. Really sore when you push on it. And it feels… warm? Is that weird? It feels warm and sore. Like a bruise, almost. But I didn't hit myself. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm just telling you what it feels like.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Meigs. Tenderness on both sides, and warmth noted. Now, let's check your range of motion. Can you please try to bend forward as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooh. That hurts. I can't go very far. It feels like something is pulling in my back. And it's hard to breathe when I bend over. That's about as far as I can go, Doctor. It's really uncomfortable. And my back feels… tight. Like a knot. Is that bad? It's just… really hard to move. I don't think I can bend over much further without really hurting myself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. Limited range of motion noted, with reported pain during flexion. Now, let's try extending your back. Can you please try to lean backwards as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooh… that's not good either. It feels… different than bending forward. Like a pinching feeling in my back. And it makes my legs feel… tingly. Not numb, just… tingly. It's hard to explain. It's like the feeling when your foot falls asleep, but in my legs. I can't go very far, Doctor. It really hurts. And I feel dizzy a little bit. I think I should sit up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, that's quite alright. We don’t need to push through any pain. Limited range of motion with reported tingling in the legs noted. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Your reflexes are slightly diminished bilaterally, and there is some mild weakness in your right leg compared to your left. Do you feel any pain, numbness, or tingling when I do this?
PATIENT: Hmm... It doesn't feel numb, but it feels… strange. Like my leg is heavy. And… a little bit of tingling, now that you mention it. It's not bad, just… different. Like a pins and needles feeling, but not painful. Mostly in my calf, I think. And my right leg does feel… weaker. I noticed that too, sometimes when I walk. It's hard to explain, but it feels like it's not working as well as my other leg. It's just… subtle. But it's there. Is that bad, Doctor? It's probably nothing, right? I'm sorry, I'm just worried. I don't want this to be serious.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be worried, Ms. Meigs, and I appreciate you being so forthcoming with your symptoms. The diminished reflexes and mild weakness in your right leg are concerning and warrant further investigation. Based on your history and the physical examination, I am concerned about a possible nerve compression or spinal issue, and we need to consider your cancer diagnosis as well. I recommend we order some imaging studies, specifically an MRI of your lumbar spine, to evaluate the spinal cord and surrounding structures. We will also order blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any other potential causes of your back pain. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. If it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes. I’m worried about the cancer, like you said. Is it possible it’s spread to my spine? I know you can’t tell me for sure, but… is that something you’re worried about? I just… I want to know what’s going on. The pain is bad, and I’m scared. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’ll do them. Just… please tell me what you find out. I'm ready to do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Meigs. It is certainly possible that your cancer could have spread to your spine, and that is precisely why we need to obtain an MRI to evaluate this possibility. However, it is also important to remember that there are other potential causes of your back pain, and we need to consider all possibilities before reaching a diagnosis. I will order the MRI today and schedule it for you as soon as possible. We will also draw blood work, and I will review the results as soon as they become available. In the meantime, I will prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. I will also recommend you continue to rest and avoid any strenuous activities. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm... Will the MRI show for sure if the cancer is in my spine? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to work next week, and I don't know if I can do it if the pain is still this bad. And... if it is the cancer, what happens then? I'm sorry, I'm asking a lot of questions. I just… I need to know what to expect. I’m really scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Those are all very important questions, Ms. Meigs, and I'm glad you are asking them. An MRI is the best imaging modality for evaluating the spine and detecting the presence of cancer. It provides detailed images of the spinal cord, nerves, and surrounding tissues, and it is highly sensitive in detecting abnormalities. While it is not a definitive guarantee, it will give us a clear picture of what is going on in your spine. The results typically take 24-48 hours to become available, and I will contact you as soon as I have them. Regarding your return to work, we will need to assess your pain level and functional status after we have the MRI results. If your pain is still significant, I will provide you with a work note and discuss options for modified duty or temporary disability. If the MRI confirms the presence of cancer in your spine, we will discuss treatment options, which may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, or a combination of these modalities. We will also consult with an oncologist to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. I understand that this is a frightening situation, Ms. Meigs, but please know that you are not alone. I will be with you every step of the way, and we will work together to develop the best possible plan for your care. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No... I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. You've been very helpful. And... thank you for being honest. I appreciate that. I'll just... wait for the MRI results. And try not to worry too much. That's hard, though.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I am glad I could provide you with some clarity and reassurance. It is perfectly normal to feel anxious and worried during times like these, and I encourage you to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before we receive the MRI results. My staff will contact you to schedule the MRI appointment, and I will be in touch as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and try to rest as much as possible. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Meigs.
