DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I just moved here, and I need to... get set up with a doctor, I think? It's mostly just a check-up, I guess. I don’t really remember what I need to do when I move to a new place. Everything feels kinda fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It is a lot to keep track of when you’re new to an area. A general check-up is a wonderful place to start. We’ll get everything documented and make sure you’re healthy and well-cared for. First, let’s go over some basics. I see here you're 21 years old. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Twenty-one. Feels like a long time ago sometimes, honestly. Everything is kinda... mixed up in my head. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Emileigh. It's completely understandable to feel a little overwhelmed. We’ll take our time. Okay, and I see your race is listed as Haida. Is that how you identify?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. That’s right. My family… they’re from Haida Gwaii. I… don't really remember much about it, but that’s what I’ve always been told. It's kinda hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Emileigh. It's important for me to have a complete picture of your background. We don't need to go into detail if you're not comfortable, but knowing your heritage can be helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in for a check-up today specifically?
PATIENT: Um… well, my husband, he said I should. He worries a lot. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. I think. It's all a bit of a blur. He just wanted to make sure I was okay, now that we moved and everything. And, you know, get my Medicare sorted.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your husband. It's wonderful to have someone looking out for you. And getting your Medicare in order is a great first step. So, to clarify – you haven’t seen a doctor regularly for a while, and you’re primarily here for a general check-up and to establish care with me?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right. A check-up… and to make sure I don't, like, need anything. I just… feel a bit lost, I guess. And I forget things easily. Everything feels kinda foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh. It sounds like we’ll do a thorough assessment today, and address those feelings of being lost and foggy. We can certainly investigate those concerns. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me about any specific symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Um… I get headaches sometimes. Not, like, awful ones, but they’re there. And I feel tired a lot. Just… really tired. And… Oh! And I've been tripping over things more lately. I keep bumping into furniture. It’s silly, I know. But yeah, those things. That's about it, I think. It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Those aren’t silly at all, Emileigh. Headaches, fatigue, and increased clumsiness are all things worth investigating. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… a few months, maybe? It's hard to say for sure. It started around the time we started planning the move, I think. Everything kinda blurred together after that. I don't remember things very clearly. It's frustrating. I feel like I'm missing pieces of my own life.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly frustrating, Emileigh, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. A few months is helpful to know. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these symptoms, or have they come on gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn't like a sudden thing. Just… slowly getting worse. And… being stressed probably doesn't help. The move was really stressful. Lots of packing, and selling stuff, and saying goodbye to people. And then getting settled here… it’s been hard. I just feel… overwhelmed, all the time. I forget what I was even saying. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Emileigh. It sounds like you've been through a lot of change and stress. That would certainly be enough to cause some symptoms. Let's talk a bit more about the headaches. Where do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Mostly here. And sometimes at the back of my head too. It's not, like, a throbbing pain, just… a dull ache. It comes and goes, but it's almost always there, even if it's just a little bit. It gets worse when I'm stressed, or when I haven’t had enough sleep. I’ve been having trouble sleeping lately. That probably isn't helping either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dull ache in the temples, forehead, and sometimes the back of your head, worse with stress and lack of sleep. That gives me a better picture. And you mentioned trouble sleeping. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Um… I have trouble falling asleep, mostly. I just… lie there, thinking. And then when I finally do fall asleep, I don’t sleep very well. I wake up a lot during the night. And I don’t feel rested when I wake up. It’s… frustrating. My husband says I toss and turn a lot too. I don’t remember doing it, but he says I do. It makes me feel kinda foggy in the morning.
DOCTOR: That sounds very disruptive, Emileigh. Difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and feeling unrefreshed in the morning are all things we need to address. Now, let's move on to something else. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision…? Um… I don't think so. Everything seems pretty normal. But… Maybe things are a little blurry sometimes? But I wear glasses already, so I just assumed it was my prescription. I haven't been to the eye doctor in… a long time. I forget how often I'm supposed to go. I just kinda ignore it, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some occasional blurriness, which you attribute to your glasses. That's helpful to know. We can certainly look into getting your vision checked if you’d like. Now, have you experienced any dizziness or balance problems, besides the tripping you mentioned?
PATIENT: Dizziness…? Um… not really. But… sometimes I feel kinda lightheaded, like I’m going to faint. But it doesn't last long. It just happens when I stand up too quickly. It’s probably nothing. I just get up too fast, sometimes. I’m kinda clumsy, remember? I bump into things a lot. It's probably just that. I don't really pay attention to it. I forget things easily, like I said. It’s hard to explain. Everything feels fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional lightheadedness when standing up quickly. It’s good you’re aware of that. Now, Emileigh, I'm going to ask about some other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Um… I think I've been eating less. I don't really feel hungry much. And… I think I’ve lost a little weight. But I haven’t really been weighing myself. It’s hard to tell. I just… haven't been feeling myself lately. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. It's hard to remember things, even what I ate yesterday. My husband says I'm not eating enough, but I just don’t feel hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some unintentional weight loss. That’s good information. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. Not that I remember. I haven’t been to the doctor much. I went when I was a kid, for shots, I think. But I don't remember being diagnosed with anything. Does that mean something is wrong? Everything is kinda fuzzy, like I said. I forget a lot. It’s hard to keep track of things. I just know I haven't been feeling myself lately.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t mean anything is wrong, Emileigh. It just helps me get a complete picture of your health. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember. We'll work through this together. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Not that I remember. I’ve never had surgery. And I’ve never been in the hospital. I had my tonsils out when I was little, maybe? But I don’t really remember it. It was a long time ago. Everything is kinda fuzzy. I don't really pay attention to things like that. I just know I haven't been feeling well lately. Everything is blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, possibly tonsillectomy as a child. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Um… My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had heart problems, maybe? But I don’t really know. It was a long time ago. And I don’t really talk about it with my family. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. I forget a lot. It's hard to remember things. I'm sorry. I just know I haven't been feeling well lately. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Emileigh. It’s perfectly alright if you don't have all the details. Knowing that your mother had high blood pressure and your father had heart problems is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink alcohol. And I definitely don’t do drugs. I don’t like any of those things. They’re bad for you. My husband doesn't like them either. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. But I know those things are bad for you. I just haven't been feeling well lately. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Emileigh. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. Not that I remember. I haven’t really had any allergic reactions. But I get itchy sometimes, if I’m outside in the grass. But that’s probably just from the bugs. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. I forget things easily. I just haven’t been feeling well lately. It’s frustrating. My husband always gives me the medicine, I never remember what it’s for.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild seasonal allergies, no known drug allergies. And you said your husband usually handles your medications?
PATIENT: Yes! He does. He’s really good at remembering things. I always forget what they're for. He tells me what to take and when. He worries a lot. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. I just haven’t been feeling well lately. It’s frustrating. I feel like I'm missing pieces of my own life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh. It sounds like your husband is a great support to you. Now, can you tell me what medications you’re currently taking, even if he’s the one managing them?
PATIENT: Um… I don't know! He gives me pills every morning. And sometimes at night. I think one is for my blood pressure? But I don’t know what the others are for. He just says, “Take these.” I don’t like asking him because he gets frustrated. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. It’s frustrating. I just wish I could remember things better. I feel like I’m a burden to him.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh. That’s perfectly alright. It's helpful to know that you are taking multiple medications, even if you don't know what they are. We will figure this out together. I’m going to need to do a physical exam now to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I get nervous easily. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. But… I trust you. I just wish I could remember things better. What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It won't take long, and I'll explain everything as I go. We'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… That sounds… a lot. But I trust you. As long as you tell me what you’re doing. And if it gets too much, can I stop? Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. I just wish I could remember things better. I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. You can stop at any time. And I will explain everything as I go. Let's start with your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn't be painful. Just relax your arm, and take some deep breaths. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/85. That's a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is 72, regular rhythm. No murmurs or extra sounds detected. Your lungs sound clear on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your ears. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums appear normal. Now, I'm going to check your throat and lymph nodes. Say "Ahhh." Your throat looks clear, and your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes, balance and coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yeah… I think so. It's kinda hard. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. My eyes feel a little tired. Is this going to take much longer? I get nervous easily. And I keep forgetting what you said.
DOCTOR: No, we’re almost finished, Emileigh. Your eye movements are a little slow, but that’s not necessarily concerning. Now, can you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Um… Oops. I missed. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. And I'm a little shaky. It's hard to remember what I'm supposed to do. I get nervous easily. I feel like I'm failing this test.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Don't worry about it. It's just a basic assessment, and it's okay if you miss. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Um… I feel a little dizzy. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. And my legs feel weak. I'm afraid I'm going to fall.
DOCTOR: That's okay, Emileigh. Sit down. You’re not alone. You did a good job just trying. It's important for me to see these things, and your wobble and feeling of dizziness are important clues. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Now, I'm going to review your medical history and the results of the exam, and we will discuss a plan. Give me a moment. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, you’re experiencing a combination of symptoms – headaches, fatigue, memory problems, balance issues, and decreased appetite. It's good you brought your husband, this is helpful. It sounds like it's been going on for a few months. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that could be due to stress. We need to investigate these symptoms further to find out what’s going on. It's not possible to say definitively what's causing them without more tests. It's good to know you're on multiple medications, even if you don't remember what they're for. Do you mind if I contact your husband to get a list of the medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Um… okay. That sounds good. You can talk to my husband. He knows everything. I always forget. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. I just want to feel better. I just wish I could remember things better. What kind of tests do you need to do? And will they hurt? I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. I understand you’re feeling anxious. I'll make sure to explain everything very clearly. The first thing I want to do is order some blood tests. These will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and inflammation. We'll also do a complete blood count to rule out any infections. The blood draw itself might feel like a small pinch, but it shouldn't hurt for long. It's quick and relatively painless. I can also order a CT scan of your brain to look for any structural issues. The scan is non-invasive and painless, but you’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes. Finally, I'd like to do an MRI of your brain to get a more detailed view. This can take a bit longer than the CT scan, and it might be a little noisy. It's important to rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. Given your memory problems and balance issues, it's also important to consult with a neurologist. They are specialists in the brain and nervous system, and they can perform a more detailed neurological exam and recommend further testing if needed. I can make a referral for you. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Um… that sounds like a lot. A lot of tests. And a specialist… It’s scary. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. I just want to feel better. I don't want anything to be seriously wrong. Will the tests take a long time? And will they hurt? And what if the specialist finds something bad? I get nervous easily. And I always forget things. It's hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emileigh. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel scared and overwhelmed. I want to assure you that we’re taking these steps to get to the bottom of what’s going on and to make sure you get the best possible care. The blood tests will only take a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. The CT scan and MRI will take a bit longer, but they're painless. We'll make sure you're comfortable and informed every step of the way. The neurologist is a specialist who will perform a more detailed assessment. They'll explain everything very clearly and answer any questions you have. It's important to remember that we're not making any assumptions right now. These tests are just to gather more information. We don't know what's causing your symptoms yet, and it's possible that everything will turn out to be nothing serious. I’m here to support you every step of the way. I’ll explain all the results clearly and answer any questions you have. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. I can also connect you with a counselor or therapist if you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Um… yes, please. A counselor would be good. I get nervous easily. And I always forget things. It's hard to keep track of everything. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said. And my husband worries a lot. He gets stressed easily too. I just want to feel better. And I want to remember things. And I want to stop bumping into furniture.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh. I will make a referral to a counselor right away. They can help you manage your anxiety and cope with the stress. I’ll also give you a list of resources for memory support. Now, let’s get these tests scheduled. I’ll have my nurse call you tomorrow to set up appointments for the blood tests, CT scan, and MRI. We'll schedule the neurologist appointment as well. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headaches, dizziness, weakness, or confusion, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. Everything is kinda blurry, like I said, but you made me feel a little better. I just hope the tests don’t find anything bad. And I hope I can remember everything you told me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help. Don’t worry about remembering everything – my nurse will go over everything with you again when she calls. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care of yourself, and try not to stress too much. We'll figure this out together. Goodbye, Emileigh.
