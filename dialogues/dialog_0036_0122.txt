DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bacy. Thank you for seeing me. I… it is about my memory. It has been… troubling me, lately. I am Venus Alvara. It is very kind of you to have me. Perhaps we can be quick? I have many things to oversee.
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Ms. Alvara. And of course, we’ll do our best to be efficient. “Troubling” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on with your memory?
PATIENT: Yes. It is…difficult to explain. I remember everything usually. Dates, names, numbers… all very clear. But recently… small things. Where I put my keys, if I took my medicine… things like that. It is… unsettling. I do not forget important things, not yet. Just… the little details. It started maybe… two months ago? I think. I am quite certain of the date. August 2nd, 2025, is today, yes?
DOCTOR: You are very precise, Ms. Alvara, and yes, today is August 2nd, 2025. It sounds like you're experiencing some trouble with recent memory – specifically, recalling everyday details. That can certainly be unsettling. You mentioned it started about two months ago. Has this been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… more frequent now. In the beginning, maybe once a week. Now… almost every day. It is not a complete blank, you understand. More like… a fog. I know I put the keys somewhere, but where? I search and search. It does not happen all the time, but enough to worry me. And my blood pressure… it has been high, also. I do not like taking pills, but the doctor before… he said it must be controlled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's becoming more frequent, and you’re experiencing a feeling of “fog” rather than a complete loss of memory. And you've noted that your blood pressure has been high, and you were previously advised to manage it with medication. That’s helpful information. Let’s talk a little more about this memory issue. Are these memory lapses associated with any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. That is a good question. Let me think. No… not really. I sleep well, I believe. Perhaps a little tired, but that is just from work. I eat normally, though not always healthy. No dizziness, no headaches… nothing like that. It is just the memory. Sometimes… I feel a little… anxious, worrying about forgetting something important. But I suppose that is natural. I do not… see colors differently, if that is what you mean? I do not understand what kind of symptoms you are asking about.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. You're right to ask – I should be more specific. By "symptoms," I mean things like changes in your mood, difficulty with speech, any weakness or numbness, or changes in your vision. It sounds like you haven’t experienced any of those. You mentioned feeling anxious about forgetting things. Has anything particularly stressful been happening in your life recently?
PATIENT: Stressful… yes, actually. My husband… he passed away six months ago. It was… unexpected. I am trying to manage everything myself now. The properties, the community association… he handled much of it. I have hired someone to help, but it is still a great burden. And the loneliness… it is difficult. I do not want to sound… dramatic. But it is a very big change. Perhaps the stress is affecting my memory? I had not thought of that.
DOCTOR: That is a significant change, Ms. Alvara, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Losing your husband so recently is a major life event, and managing everything on your own is a huge undertaking. It's very possible that the stress is contributing to your memory concerns. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… the blood pressure, of course. And…arthritis in my knees, but it is not severe. No diabetes, no cholesterol problems, I do not think. The doctor did tests before, many times. He always said I was quite healthy, for my age. Just the blood pressure. And a small surgery on my shoulder, many years ago. Nothing else that I recall. I do not take many medications, only for the blood pressure when it gets very high. I prefer not to, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis in your knees, a previous shoulder surgery, and managed high blood pressure. And you generally consider yourself to be in good health otherwise. That’s helpful. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Hmm. I… I believe it is called… Lisinopril? Yes, that sounds right. The doctor before… he wrote the prescription. I do not like remembering names of pills, if I can help it. I just tell the pharmacist which one I need. I take it when my pressure goes above… 140 over 90, I think. Sometimes I forget to take it at all, if I am busy. It is foolish, I know, but I do not like feeling… drowsy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Lisinopril is a common blood pressure medication. And it's understandable that you’d prefer to avoid taking it if you're not feeling drowsy. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any family members—parents, siblings, or close relatives—who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That is a difficult question. My mother… she was always a bit forgetful, even when she was young. But it was just… her personality, I think. She misplaced things often. My father… he had heart problems. He passed away when I was quite young. I do not recall anyone with… serious memory problems, like dementia. My brother… he is healthy, as far as I know. We do not speak often. He lives in Russia. It is difficult to get information from him. I hope that is helpful. I do not know much about my family’s medical history, if you are honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like there may have been some mild forgetfulness in your mother, but no significant memory issues in other family members. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not drink alcohol. Not at all. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never cared for it. I prefer tea. Green tea, mostly. It is good for health, I believe. I do not smoke, either. Never have. I believe in healthy living, as much as possible. Though, I must admit, I do enjoy a sweet pastry occasionally. But nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. A healthy lifestyle is always a good thing. Now, Ms. Alvara, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better baseline understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is fine. I suppose that is what doctors do, yes? I am ready when you are. I just hope it is not too long. I have many things to oversee, you understand. But I want to find out what is happening with my memory, so I am willing to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It won’t be long, I promise. We’ll start with your blood pressure, just to confirm what you’ve been measuring. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment – checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Okay, let’s start here… Can you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will try to relax. It is difficult, when I am worried about my memory. But I am trying. Please be quick, if you can. I must return to my properties soon. Is this machine… painful? It feels a little tight.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be painful at all, just a little tight. I'll release it as soon as I have a reading. Okay, your blood pressure is 152 over 94. That is a bit elevated, as you suspected. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, normal breath sounds. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Can you please sit up and cross your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My legs are a little stiff, from sitting. But I can cross them. Is everything alright so far? You are very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. I just hope it is not something serious. My properties… they need me.
DOCTOR: Everything is going well so far, Ms. Alvara. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon for your age. Your balance is a little unsteady with your eyes closed, but again, that’s not necessarily cause for concern. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and cognitive function. I'll start with something easy. Can you tell me today’s date again?
PATIENT: Today’s date? August 2nd, 2025. It is… a Tuesday, yes? I remember it quite clearly. I have many appointments this week. It is important to keep track of the dates. It is… disturbing that you must ask me, Doctor. Does that mean something is wrong? I hope it is not something serious. My properties… they require much oversight.
DOCTOR: You are perfectly correct, Ms. Alvara, today is August 2nd, 2025, a Tuesday. It's good that you remember that so well. I ask everyone the same questions as part of the routine exam, and it helps me get a baseline understanding. Now, can you repeat three unrelated words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Very well. What are the words, Doctor? I hope they are not too difficult. I must return to my properties soon. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. I repeated them. Is that what you wanted, Doctor? It is…odd asking me to remember simple words. Does that mean something is truly wrong? My properties… they depend on me. They require constant attention.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. You remembered them correctly. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a simple calculation. Can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Count backwards from 100 by sevens? That is… difficult. I am not good with numbers. One hundred… ninety-three? No… that is wrong. I think it is making me anxious. My properties… they are very complex. This is…stressful. I do not like numbers.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. It’s a challenging task for many people. Based on the exam and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing some mild memory lapses, particularly with recent recall and some difficulty with complex tasks like counting backwards. Your blood pressure is elevated, which could be contributing to these issues. Before I offer a plan, I’d like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be affecting your memory. We’ll also check your vitamin levels, as deficiencies can sometimes cause cognitive issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Yes, I suppose so. If it will help. But I do not like needles. And I have many appointments. But if it is necessary… very well. But can it be done quickly? My properties… they cannot wait. I just want to return to my normal routine.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It will be as quick as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it shouldn’t take long at all. It's just a routine procedure to help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. While we wait for the results, I recommend a few things. First, let's focus on getting your blood pressure under control. Have you considered restarting your Lisinopril medication?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes. I do not like the drowsiness, Doctor. But… perhaps you are right. If it will help my memory. But I do not want to feel… incapacitated. My properties… they require constant oversight. I cannot be sluggish. If it is a small dose… perhaps. But I must be able to function. My properties… they depend on me. It is a great responsibility.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can start with a low dose of Lisinopril and monitor your response. If you experience excessive drowsiness, we can adjust the dosage or explore other blood pressure medication options. There are many alternatives available. And in addition to medication, it’s important to prioritize stress management. Have you considered any relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation?
PATIENT: Meditation? No, Doctor. I do not have time for such things. My properties… they are very demanding. I have too many responsibilities. I do not sit still. Perhaps a warm bath… but that is all. My properties… they require constant attention. I cannot simply relax. It is impossible. This is all very…stressful. My properties… they depend on me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have a great deal on your plate. Perhaps we can explore some other, more practical ways to manage stress. Would you be open to talking to a social worker or therapist?
PATIENT: A therapist? No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not need a therapist. I am a very capable woman. I have managed my properties for many years, on my own. My husband… he always said I was strong. I do not need someone to… analyze me. My properties… they require my attention, not someone else’s. I simply need to find a way to improve my memory. That is all. My properties… they depend on me. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright. We can focus on strategies to improve your memory without resorting to therapy. One thing that can be helpful is creating routines and checklists to help you keep track of important tasks. Have you tried anything like that?
PATIENT: Checklists… My husband… he used checklists. But I always thought they were… unnecessary. I prefer to keep everything in my head. It is more efficient. But perhaps… Perhaps if I write down my appointments… and the important tasks… it might help. But it feels…degrading. To need to write things down. My properties… they require constant attention. It is very demanding. But perhaps… I will try it. But if it does not work… I do not want to waste time. My properties… they depend on me.
DOCTOR: That’s a great first step, Ms. Alvara. And it’s not about “needing” anything, it’s about utilizing tools to help you manage your workload and reduce stress. We can also discuss some mnemonic techniques to improve your recall, if you’re interested. For now, let’s get those blood tests ordered. I’ll also provide you with a prescription for Lisinopril, starting at a low dose. And I’ll give you a checklist template and some information on stress management techniques. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds acceptable. Blood tests, Lisinopril, checklists… it is a lot, but I will try. I must return to my properties soon. They require constant attention. My husband… he always said I was strong. I will manage. But if it does not work… I will let you know. Please be quick. My properties… they depend on me. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take things one step at a time. And I’m here to support you every step of the way. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw your blood right away. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and adjust the plan as needed. Here you go. And here’s the checklist template. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll step out and let you get started. Please take care, Ms. Alvara, and don’t hesitate to let us know how you’re doing.
