DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Yes, well, I got a… a thing I wanna get done. A clearance, you said? Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s just get to it. It’s about… makin’ myself look a little better. That’s all. I work with towers, you see. Radio towers. Needs a presentable face for meetings.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. A physical exam for employment purposes. I understand you're on a tight schedule. To ensure I can complete this efficiently and thoroughly, could you clarify what specifically this clearance requires?
PATIENT: Employment? No, no. Not employment. It's… cosmetic. For my face. I want somethin’… lifted. Tightened. You know. I ain’t explainin’ my whole life story. Just need a doctor to say I'm okay to… have it done. Is that so hard? I saw an advertisement, a very nice one, and they asked for this clearance thing. That's all.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this is a medical clearance for an elective cosmetic procedure, specifically facial tightening. Thank you for clarifying. To properly assess your suitability for this procedure, I’ll need to gather some medical history and perform a brief examination. It’s important to ensure there are no underlying conditions that could pose a risk. Could you start by telling me about any past medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Past medical… Hmm. That was… a long time ago. I had… somethin’ with my blood pressure, I think. Or maybe it was my sugar? Old age, you know. Things get fuzzy. I don’t go to doctors much. Waste of time, mostly. And money. I mostly just… work. Towers, like I said. Been climbin’ those things for… well, a long time. Does climbin’ towers count as a medical condition? It's hard on the knees.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for things to become less clear with time. High blood pressure or diabetes are important conditions to note, and we'll want to get a clearer picture of those. And yes, repeatedly climbing towers can definitely impact your joints, particularly your knees. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, sugar, or your knees?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never been a fan of pills. Always figured fresh air and hard work were better than anything you get in a bottle. I might take somethin’ for the aches now and then, somethin’ over-the-counter. Ibuprofen, maybe? But nothin’ regularly. I just… push through it. You gotta. It’s a tower. You can’t just… stop climbin’.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for managing things without medication. Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Let’s do a quick review of your overall health. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations recently?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Is that… when your heart races? No, nothin’ like that. I get winded, sure. Climbin’ those towers ain’t easy, like I said. But it’s just… bein’ out of shape. Old age. Not somethin’ serious. Look, is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Honcoop. We're getting through it. Just a few more questions to ensure everything is safe. Have you had any recent changes in your vision, any headaches, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Vision’s… alright, I guess. Need glasses, like you can see. Headaches… sometimes. Stress, probably. Worryin’ about the towers. Dizziness… not really. Unless I’m way up high, then everything looks a little dizzy. But that’s just… the height. It's a tower.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a quick look at your general appearance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Blood pressure’s probably high, always is when they stick somethin’ on my arm. Just… don’t take too long. I got a tower waitin’.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 95. Your pulse is regular at 78. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. I notice some sun exposure and minor skin tags, consistent with outdoor work. No obvious signs of acute illness. I'm going to briefly examine your knees, given your mention of discomfort. Please let me know if anything is painful. There's mild tenderness on both knees, especially with extension. Range of motion is slightly limited. No significant swelling or warmth.
PATIENT: Told ya. The towers. It’s all the towers. Climbin’ up and down… it does a number on you. I just… deal with it. I ain’t askin’ for a cure, just need a piece of paper so I can get this face fixed. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand you're looking for a clearance for an elective procedure, Mr. Honcoop. Given your elevated blood pressure and mild knee discomfort, I recommend further evaluation before proceeding. We need to rule out any underlying conditions that could increase your risk during and after the procedure. I would recommend a visit with a primary care physician for blood pressure management and potentially a consultation with an orthopedist to evaluate your knees. Would you be open to obtaining these referrals?
PATIENT: Referrals? You want me to go to more doctors? Look, I ain’t got time for this. I told you, I just need a paper. Can’t you just… sign it? Say I’m healthy enough? I promise I’ll be careful. I’ve been climbin’ towers for forty years, haven't fallen yet. It’s a tower, not a tightrope.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically provide a clearance without a reasonable assessment of your health. Providing a clearance when I know you have uncontrolled high blood pressure and knee discomfort would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I am happy to document your request and your current health status, but I cannot sign a clearance stating you are healthy enough for the procedure without further evaluation. I can provide you with the names of some excellent primary care physicians and orthopedists in the area. I strongly encourage you to schedule appointments with them to discuss your concerns and obtain the necessary clearance. Would you like me to provide those referrals to you?
PATIENT: Look, this is ridiculous. I’ve dealt with more complicated things than this on a tower. Fine. Give me the names. But don’t expect me to be runnin’ around for weeks. I got a life, you know? A tower to climb. Just… write ‘em down quickly. And that's it. I’m not comin’ back.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Honcoop. I understand your concerns about time, and I hope you'll be able to schedule appointments that work for you. I am happy to provide any documentation of our visit to assist with that process. I wish you the best of health and safety in your work. .
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Doctors… always makin’ things complicated.
