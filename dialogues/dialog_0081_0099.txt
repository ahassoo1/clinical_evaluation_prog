DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received the results from a test… an examination of my insides, I believe it was called, and the doctor’s office said it wasn’t quite normal. They suggested I come in to discuss it with you. I must confess, I’m not entirely sure what wasn’t normal, only that it required further attention.
DOCTOR: I see. “An examination of your insides,” as you put it… was that a CT scan, an MRI, perhaps an endoscopy?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a very good question. I really couldn’t say. It involved a long, thin tube… they asked me to swallow it. And I was… asleep, I think. It was all a bit blurry, truthfully. I remember the nurse being very kind, but the specifics of what they did… escape me. Was it an endoscopy, then? That sounds… familiar.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy, yes, that’s likely it. And you received the results from that today?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. The office called yesterday, said something about some… irregularities. They used a word I didn't recognize, honestly. And they strongly advised I schedule an appointment with you to go over everything. I’ve been feeling… perfectly fine, to be honest. A little indigestion sometimes, but nothing I haven’t experienced before. That's why I was rather surprised by the call.
DOCTOR: "Irregularities," is rather vague. Did they mention where these irregularities were located?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, they did. They said it was in my… stomach, I believe. Lower part of my stomach, they specified. Something about the lining not looking quite right. But I am not a medical professional, Doctor, so I could be misremembering. It all felt rather rushed on the phone. I simply wanted to understand what it means, and what, if anything, needs to be done.
DOCTOR: The lower part of the stomach… Alright. And you said some indigestion?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not frequent, mind you. Perhaps once or twice a week, if that. It’s just a slight burning sensation, really. Easily relieved with a little antacid. I hadn’t thought much of it, truthfully. I assumed it was simply something I ate. It’s never been severe enough to cause me any real concern. I mostly brought it up because you asked, and I wanted to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Many people experience mild indigestion, Ms. Minatra. It's rarely anything serious. But let's get a complete picture. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness, no, Doctor, absolutely not. Not a single instance. I have not noticed any blood in my stool. That sounds… quite alarming, and thankfully, I haven’t experienced anything of the sort. I've been… regular, shall we say, and everything has appeared perfectly normal in that regard. That is another thing I haven't been concerned about, at all.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. In fact, if anything, I’ve gained a little weight recently. My appetite has been quite good, perhaps too good. My daughter keeps telling me I need to watch my portions! So, no, unintentional weight loss is definitely not something I've noticed. I maintain a fairly stable weight, all things considered. It fluctuates a bit, naturally, but nothing drastic.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. Let me see… My mother, she lived to be a very good age, nearly ninety. She passed peacefully in her sleep. My father… he had some stomach troubles later in life, I recall. Vague complaints of discomfort, but nothing specifically diagnosed. And my siblings… mostly healthy, as far as I know. No history of stomach cancer or anything like that, to my knowledge. We weren't a family that discussed medical ailments openly, I'm afraid. It was… considered a private matter, mostly. I apologize if that's not very helpful.
DOCTOR: It's...adequate. And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? I was married for a very long time, Doctor, to a wonderful man. He passed away five years ago. We didn't have any children. I live alone now, but I have a very supportive daughter who visits frequently. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol… perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I’m retired now, used to work with metal and plastics, but mostly I enjoy gardening and reading these days. A quiet life, mostly. I don't have a lot of… vices, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to any medication, thankfully. I take a daily vitamin, and occasionally ibuprofen for aches and pains, but nothing regularly. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I am very careful about what I put into my body, and I’ve never had a negative response to anything I’ve taken. A simple constitution, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Minatra. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam. I'd like to palpate your abdomen and listen to your bowel sounds. It’s unlikely to reveal anything significant, given what you’ve described, but it's necessary for a complete assessment. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. A thorough assessment is always a good idea. I will lie down on the examination table right away. Please let me know if you need me to adjust my position in any way. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lie flat, arms at your sides. Now, I'm going to press gently on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Deep breath now… anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just… a normal pressure. Nothing painful, or particularly uncomfortable. A little cool, perhaps, from the examination table itself, but otherwise… quite normal. I am a little nervous, if I'm being honest, but I'm trying to remain still.
DOCTOR: And here… Any tenderness in this area?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, not particularly. Perhaps a slight discomfort, just… a general pressure, like you said. It's not sharp, or stabbing, or anything like that. Just… aware of your touch, I suppose. It's not a painful sensation, Doctor. I wouldn’t describe it as pain, at all. It’s… subtle. Though now that you mention it… it feels a little different on my left side. Still not painful, just… a little tighter, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Tighter, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just a little… firmness, I suppose. Not hard, or rigid, but… not as soft as the other side. It’s difficult to describe. It’s not a pain, truly, just… a different texture. And it’s only when you press on it… I wouldn’t have noticed it otherwise. I am trying very hard to remain relaxed, so perhaps I am being overly sensitive. Though my daughter always said I have a very low pain threshold…
DOCTOR: Alright. Bowel sounds. Normal. Present in all four quadrants. Ms. Minatra, based on what you've told me and my brief examination, it’s unlikely anything is seriously wrong. However, the slight firmness on your left side warrants further investigation. It's likely just a muscular issue or some mild inflammation, but we can't rule out other possibilities. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool occult blood test. We'll also need a repeat endoscopy. I'll refer you to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Alvarez. He's excellent, very thorough. He will schedule the endoscopy for you. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Thoroughness is always appreciated. I understand the need for further investigation, even if it’s only to rule things out. A repeat endoscopy… well, it’s not pleasant, but I trust your judgment. And referring me to Dr. Alvarez… that sounds very good. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. When should I expect to hear from Dr. Alvarez’s office to schedule the endoscopy? And are there any restrictions I should be aware of before the procedure?
DOCTOR: Dr. Alvarez's office should contact you within 48 hours to schedule the endoscopy. As for restrictions, you'll need to be NPO – nothing by mouth – for at least eight hours before the procedure. They will give you detailed instructions when they call. I'll also send the lab orders to your primary care physician's office. You'll need to go there to get the blood work done. Ms. Minatra, I want to be clear. The likelihood of this being anything serious is low. But we must rule everything out. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That answers everything. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… calm reassurance. It’s good to know you're taking it seriously, even if you don’t suspect anything major. I will be sure to follow all instructions carefully and schedule the blood work and endoscopy as soon as Dr. Alvarez’s office calls. Thank you for your time, Doctor Paulino. I am very grateful for your attention to my concerns.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any sudden abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or significant changes in your bowel habits, contact my office immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you after the endoscopy results are available. Have a good day, Ms. Minatra.
