DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty initiating urination and a prolonged time to start… That can be frustrating. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe… three months ago, I’d say? At first it wasn’t so bad, just a little bit of a struggle now and then. But it’s gotten worse steadily since then. I remember it being around the time my nephew visited from Vilnius, actually. He stayed for a week. So, probably end of May, beginning of June it really started being noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly three months ago, around the end of May or beginning of June. And it’s been gradually worsening since then. Is it difficult every time you try to urinate, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty much every time now, yes. But it’s worse in the mornings. Like, when I first wake up, it can take a long time. And I have to… strain a bit. Not terribly hard, but… you know. Later in the day it’s a little easier, but still not normal. Not by a long shot.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the mornings, requiring some straining. Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder when you do go, or do you feel like you have to go back shortly after?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No, not always completely, no. Sometimes I feel like there’s still a little bit left in there. And then I have to go back maybe an hour or so later. It’s not right after, but… not a full emptying, if that makes sense. It's a bit unsettling, honestly. I always make sure to empty everything, you know? It's just a habit.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Feeling like you don't fully empty your bladder is definitely something we need to investigate. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning at all. It’s just… difficult to start. And the feeling of not being completely empty. No discomfort, no stinging, nothing like that. Just… frustrating. I drink plenty of water, you know? So I don’t understand why it's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain or burning, just difficulty initiating and a sense of incomplete emptying. Drinking plenty of water is good. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Let me think. I haven't noticed any blood, no. And the color seems normal, I suppose. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I think that’s just because I drink coffee. I haven’t noticed any smell, either. It’s hard to say, really. I don’t usually pay much attention to it, if I’m being honest. It looks like… pee. I suppose. Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. No, you shouldn't necessarily be actively looking for anything, but I was just checking for any changes in color, odor, or the presence of blood. Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, I think it was. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it's not too bad. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I eat a good diet, I walk every day, I don’t smoke… Nothing major, I don’t think. I’ve been to the doctor for yearly checkups, of course, but nothing serious ever came up. I have Medicare, so they check everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about twenty years ago and arthritis in the knees. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis, sometimes. It's naproxen, I think. Just when my knees are acting up. It's not every day, maybe two or three times a week if I’ve been walking a lot. And… oh, a small dose of vitamin D, the doctor recommended it. But that’s it. Just those two things, occasionally. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright, naproxen as needed for arthritis and vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve had… well, I had a bee sting when I was a child, but that was a long time ago and I didn’t have a bad reaction. Nothing that I’m aware of. I eat all sorts of things, no problems there. I've always been lucky that way. I used to help my mother in the kitchen, always tasting everything, never a problem! No allergies, Doctor. I can assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check a few things. We’ll start with your abdomen, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I'll just lie down on the table, I suppose? Just tell me what to do. I'm not used to all this, but I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. Just relax, and I’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Okay. I’m just listening and feeling your abdomen. It doesn’t seem to be any immediate tenderness here. I’m going to gently tap to check for any fluid retention. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I'm going to check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6. Everything is within normal limits. Now, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Like that? Is that okay? I used to be very good at puzzles, you know. Always had a good eye for detail. It's quite easy, really. It's good to keep the mind active, my mother always said.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your eye movements are good, very smooth. Now, can you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that strong enough? I still do a bit of gardening, you know. Keeps the hands strong. I used to help my husband with heavier work, too, before he passed. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, very good strength. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay… and the other side… Reflexes are present and equal on both sides. Based on the physical exam and what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, even though you're a woman. While BPH is more common in men, women can experience similar urinary symptoms due to changes in the bladder neck or urethra. The incomplete emptying and difficulty starting are consistent with this. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. BPH… that sounds like something a man has! I am a woman, Doctor. Are you sure? It's a bit unsettling to hear that. But… if that’s what you think is best, then yes, of course. A urinalysis and… what was the other thing? A post-void… something. Yes, do whatever you need to do to find out what’s wrong. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. It's embarrassing to talk about, but… it's been interfering with my life. So yes, please. Do those tests.
DOCTOR: Of course. I apologize for the confusion. While the term BPH is specific to men, women can experience similar issues with bladder function due to different causes. It's the symptoms that are important, and we need to investigate them thoroughly. A urinalysis is a simple urine test to check for infection or other abnormalities. The post-void residual volume test will measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after you urinate. We’ll have you empty your bladder as completely as possible, and then we’ll use a small handheld device to measure the remaining volume. I'll write an order for those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be able to assist you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to drink plenty of water, but try to avoid drinking large amounts before bedtime. We also want to avoid caffeine, as that can irritate the bladder. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Drink plenty of water, avoid caffeine before bed… I can do that. And the lab is just down the hall? Good. I'm glad it's not a long trip. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s a relief to have a plan. I suppose I should go down there now then? The nurse will help me? Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. It was very nice meeting you. I hope we can get this sorted out soon. It’s just… unsettling, you know? To not feel like yourself.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse, Sarah, will be right with you to take you down to the lab. She's very experienced and will guide you through everything. And you're very welcome, Kandy. I understand it's unsettling, and that's why we're doing these tests – to get to the bottom of it and find a solution. We'll take things one step at a time. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. And it was lovely meeting you as well. Please let me know if the nurse needs me to further explain anything before you head down to the lab. Sarah is just finishing up with another patient, so she'll be with you shortly.
