DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Well, I am here for… the thing. The sports thing. My… uh, someone told me I need this paper. For the tryouts. You know, to show I am… able. Yes. Able to play. It’s… for the team.
DOCTOR: Right. The "thing." And this is for… tryouts?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Tryouts. It's… baseball. I think. Or… softball? It’s with the… the older men. Not the… young ones. My knees, you know. They aren’t what they used to be. But I can still… throw. I think. It's been a while. A long while.
DOCTOR: Okay. So you need a physical to participate in a baseball or softball league... for older men. And you're concerned about your knees. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes. Fair. Very fair. The knees… and maybe the back. It gets… stiff. Sometimes. I don’t remember… what I did to it. But it’s… there. Not always, but… there. It’s… old. Everything is old, Doctor. Everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get some specifics. Just to clarify, when did this stiffness in your back start?
PATIENT: Specifics… hmm. That’s… hard. A long time ago. Before… the divorce. Yes. Before that. Maybe… ten years? Fifteen? I don’t… keep track of dates so much anymore. It just… happened. Slowly. It wasn’t a… bang. Or a fall. Just… creaky. Like an old door. You know?
DOCTOR: Right. Creaky. Okay. And does this creakiness affect your daily activities?
PATIENT: Activities… well, I… I mostly watch TV. And… I go to the store sometimes. For… you know. Things. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, exactly. It just… reminds me I’m not twenty anymore. When I try to… bend over to pick something up, it's… slower. That’s all. Not a big deal. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Now that you mention it… I think so. When I was… younger. Working construction. Lifting… heavy things. A lot of heavy things. I remember… a pain. A bad pain. But… I don’t remember how it happened. Or what I did about it. Just… pain. I probably wrapped it. With something. I always wrapped things. It's… a habit. You know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a possible injury while doing construction, treated with… wrapping. Alright. Let’s talk about your knees now. What specifically is bothering you with your knees?
PATIENT: Bothering… yes. The knees. Well, they… ache. Especially when it rains. Funny, that. And… when I go up and down the stairs. It’s… not sharp. Just… a dull ache. And sometimes… they feel like they’re going to… give out. But they don’t. Usually. That’s why I’m worried. For the tryouts, you see. I don't want to fall. That would be… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Aching with the weather, discomfort going up stairs, and a feeling of instability. Have you ever had any actual injuries to your knees?
PATIENT: Injuries… oh, dear. Now there’s a question. I… think I twisted one, once. Playing… something. A long time ago. Maybe… football? Or baseball? It was… a long time ago. I definitely had to wrap it. A lot. And… I think someone put ice on it. Someone helped. But… I don’t remember who. Or where. My memory… it’s not what it used to be, Doctor. It really isn’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. Possible knee twist, treated with wrapping and ice. Any surgeries on either your back or your knees?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… Oh! My… my appendix. I had my appendix taken out. A long time ago. But… back or knees? No. No surgeries on those. I’m pretty sure. I would remember that, wouldn't I? A big surgery? No. Just the appendix. A small thing. Well, small for them. Not small for me, at the time. But definitely not back or knees. No.
DOCTOR: Okay. No back or knee surgeries, appendix removed previously. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I can stand. It’s… a little creaky. But I can do it. There. Standing. Be careful, Doctor. I’m not as steady as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your range of motion in your knees. Can you bend each knee as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not so good. This one… it doesn’t go very far. And this one… not much better. It’s… stiff. Yes, very stiff. It's… okay. Don't worry. I can still walk. Mostly. It just… hurts a little. What are you looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I’m assessing your range of motion and checking for any tenderness or swelling. Okay. And now, can you try to squat down a little bit for me?
PATIENT: Squat… oh dear. Oh… oh no. That’s… not good. It’s… it's difficult. It hurts, you see? It’s… not a good sign. Should I stop, Doctor? I don't want to… fall. It’s embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, that's enough. No need to push it. Now, can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I can lie down. It’s… easier than squatting. There. Lying down. Much better. Be careful, Doctor. Everything… creaks. You know? It’s just… old. I’m an old man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax. Your reflexes are… diminished. It's not surprising given your age and history, but… we need to consider this.
PATIENT: Consider… what? What do you mean? What needs to be considered? Is it… bad? Should I be worried? My knees… my back… are they… broken? I just want to play baseball, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? I'm not a young man anymore, I know, but... I just want to play a little baseball.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. "Broken" is unlikely. But you have significant stiffness and reduced range of motion in both knees and your lower back. Your reflexes are also diminished. Based on this brief examination, it appears you have age-related degenerative changes in your knees and spine. It’s not uncommon. I wouldn’t recommend participating in any strenuous activity, like baseball, at this time. It could exacerbate your condition.
PATIENT: No… baseball? Not even a little bit? But… I’ve been looking forward to it. It’s… something to do. Something to… keep me going. What am I supposed to do now? Just… sit and watch TV? Everything hurts… and now I can’t even play baseball? Is there… anything? A cream? A pill? Something I can take? Please, Doctor. Is there anything at all? I just want to play one game… just one. It’s… important to me.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Bartok, I understand you’re disappointed. But you need to be realistic. There are creams and pills, yes, but they will only provide temporary relief. They won't fix the underlying problem. I can prescribe you some pain relievers and recommend physical therapy to help manage your symptoms and improve your range of motion, but I strongly advise against participating in baseball. It’s simply too risky. I'll write you a referral to a physical therapist. They can give you some exercises and stretches. And I’ll send a prescription to your pharmacy for a mild anti-inflammatory. But honestly, I think you should focus on lower-impact activities. Walking, swimming… things that won’t put so much stress on your joints. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Walking… swimming… Yes. I understand. Lower impact. No baseball. It’s… disappointing. Very disappointing. But… if that’s what you think is best… Physical therapy… and pills. Okay. I suppose. Just… please send the prescription to… Miller’s Pharmacy. On Oak Street. And… thank you, Doctor. Even if it’s not what I wanted to hear.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the referral to physical therapy and the prescription for Miller’s Pharmacy. Try to schedule the physical therapy appointment as soon as possible. And remember, listen to your body. Don't push yourself too hard. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Bartok?
