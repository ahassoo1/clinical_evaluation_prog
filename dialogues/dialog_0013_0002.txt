DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my… going to the bathroom. It’s been a little hard lately. Not… not painful, exactly. Just… takes a bit. I forget what the young man at the desk called it, something about… water?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're having some difficulty with urination – taking longer than usual to empty your bladder. And you mentioned something about water… that might be related to how much fluid you're drinking, or possibly a problem with the bladder itself. To help me understand a little better, can you tell me how long “lately” has been?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Lately… hmm. It feels like… a good while now. Maybe a few months? Everything is a bit blurry these days, you know? My husband, he might remember better. We’ve been married a long time. A very long time. Is that helpful? I drink tea, mostly. Lots of tea.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly helpful, Zoie. A few months is good to know. And tea is good – lots of people enjoy tea! It’s good we’re trying to piece things together. So, you mentioned it takes a bit longer to go. Is it that it's hard to start, hard to keep going, or hard to empty completely, or a little of all of those?
PATIENT: Oh… um. It's… it's hard to start, I think. Like, I have to… push a little. Not a lot, but a little. And sometimes, even when I think I’m done, I feel like there’s still a bit left. Does that make sense? My mind isn’t what it used to be, dear. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Zoie. Don't apologize at all. It’s very common for things to change as we get older, and you’re explaining everything perfectly. So, difficulty starting and a feeling of not emptying completely – that’s very helpful. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. I… I go to the bathroom more often at night, I think. Maybe two or three times? My husband doesn’t mind too much, he sleeps like a log. But I don’t like getting up so much. It’s cold on the floor! And… oh dear. What else? I’m terrible at remembering things, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You’re not terrible at all, Zoie. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering. Two or three times at night is good to know. That’s definitely something we should look into. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning either. Just… uncomfortable. And a little frustrating, you know? Having to wait and push… it's not very dignified for an old woman. I used to be very quick, everything was quick! Now everything takes… well, everything takes longer.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Zoie. It's perfectly valid to feel that way. And you’re absolutely right, it is frustrating. Okay, so no pain, no burning, just discomfort and difficulty. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… My husband does all the remembering about those things. I… I think I have a little bit of… the pressure. High blood pressure, that’s it. And my knees are awful. Very, very awful. I take pills for both, I think. He gives them to me every morning. He handles all that. I just… try to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – high blood pressure and some knee pain. And it sounds like your husband is a wonderful help with managing your medications. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… surgeries. I had my tonsils out when I was little. A very long time ago. And… I think I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist. Fell off a horse, many years ago. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major. Just the tonsils and the wrist. And a lot of babies, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture – that’s good to know. And yes, having children is a big event! Now, just one more quick set of questions. Are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm. I don't think so. Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes, but I think that's just old age. My husband says I'm sensitive to dust, but that's not really an allergy, is it? I haven't had a bad reaction to any pills he gives me, so I guess I'm alright. No, no allergies that I’m aware of. Just a little bit of itchiness now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies – that's good. And a little bit of itchiness is very common. Alright, Zoie. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Based on what you've told me – the difficulty starting your stream, feeling like you don't empty completely, the increased urination at night – it sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of an overactive bladder, possibly with some degree of urinary retention. It’s very common as we get older. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and I may want to order a urine test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A physical exam? And a test? What kind of test? I don’t like tests. Is it going to hurt? I always get nervous when doctors talk about tests. My husband always says I’m a big baby. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can do it. Just… be gentle, dear. And tell me what’s going to happen. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Zoie. You’re not a baby at all – it’s perfectly normal to be nervous about medical exams and tests. And I promise to be as gentle as possible and explain everything beforehand. The physical exam will just involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a quick pelvic exam to assess your bladder and pelvic floor muscles. It won't take long. The urine test is very simple – you’ll just need to provide a small sample. It helps us rule out any infection or other issues. It doesn’t hurt at all, just a little bit of inconvenience. Would you like me to show you the bathroom first so you can get comfortable with that part?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam. That doesn’t sound very nice. But… I suppose if you think it’s important. And a urine test… well, alright. Yes, please. Showing me the bathroom would be very helpful. I’m a bit shaky, you know. Old age. Everything is a bit harder these days. And I don’t want to make a mess. Lead the way, dear.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. Let's go ahead and get you settled in the bathroom. It’s just down the hall, and it’s very private. There’s a stool in there if you need it, and I'll be right outside when you’re ready. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call my name if you need any assistance at all. We’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. That’s very kind of you. Lead the way. And… remind me to be careful sitting down. It’s been a bit tricky lately.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. We’ll take things very slowly. And yes, I’ll definitely remind you to be careful sitting down. It's good you mentioned that. Here we are. The bathroom is right here. There’s a disposable hat and wipes inside if you’d like them. Just take your time, and call out my name when you’re ready, and I’ll be just outside the door. Don’t rush, and feel free to use the stool if you need it.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You’re very patient. I will call when I’m ready. And… try not to wait too long, my old bones get cold easily.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Hello? Dear? I… I think I’m ready. But… it took a little longer than usual. And… I’m a bit unsteady on my feet. Could you come in and help me?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Zoie. Are you alright?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. I’m just… a bit dizzy. And my legs feel like jelly. It’s probably just from sitting for too long. But… could you just help me steady myself? I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. Let’s take it slowly. Lean on me, and we’ll walk back to the examining room together. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little dizzy after sitting for a while, especially when you’re a bit unsteady. Just take your time, and breathe deeply. We'll get you seated comfortably. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. That’s very kind of you. Slowly is good. Very slowly. And… thank you. You’re a very patient doctor. I used to be so strong. But… things change, don’t they?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Zoie. It’s my job to take care of you, and I’m happy to do it. And you’re right, things do change, but that doesn’t make you any less wonderful. Now that you're seated, let’s take a few deep breaths. That will help you feel a little more steady. Are you feeling any better now?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. A little better. The breathing helped. Still a bit shaky, but… manageable. Thank you for being so patient. You don’t know how much I appreciate it. Now… what did you want to do next? You said something about an exam? I’m a little nervous, dear. But… if it has to be done, I suppose I can try.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Zoie. And don't worry, we'll take things at your pace. The exam is just to get a better understanding of what's going on. It won't take long, and I'll explain everything as I go. First, I just want to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me check for any abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. That sounds… alright. Listening doesn’t sound too bad. As long as you don’t poke and prod too much. My skin is very sensitive these days. Go ahead, dear. But… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. I’ll be very gentle. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. This won't take long. Everything sounds normal so far, Zoie. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. This will help me assess your nerve function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. Go ahead. But… what does that involve? I don’t like surprises. My knees are bad enough, I don’t need any more surprises with my legs.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I’ll explain everything beforehand. Checking your reflexes just involves a gentle tap on your knee and ankle with a small hammer. It doesn't hurt, I promise. It’s just to see how your nerves are responding. It's very quick, and it will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Would you like to see the hammer first?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. I would like to see it. I’ve always been a bit squeamish. If I know what’s coming, it’s not so bad. Go ahead. But… be gentle, please. I don’t want to jump.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Zoie. This is just a small hammer, and it’s very light. I’m just going to gently tap on your knee and ankle with it. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. I suppose so. But… warn me before you tap. I don’t like being startled. And… be very gentle, please. My legs are very sensitive these days. Go ahead. But… be careful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. I will definitely warn you before I tap, and I will be very gentle. Just relax your leg, and I’ll do the rest. Okay, just a little tap now… How did that feel?
PATIENT: Oh! That was… surprising. It didn’t hurt, exactly. Just… unexpected. A little bit of a jolt, I suppose. My leg twitched a bit. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, that’s perfectly normal. A little twitch is a good thing – it means your reflexes are still working. It shows that the nerves are responding. Now, I’m just going to check the other leg. Just a little tap now… How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh. That was… about the same. A little jolt, a little twitch. It’s not painful, but it’s… not very pleasant either. My legs are very sensitive, you know. Old age. Is it over soon? I don’t think I can take many more jolts.
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, we’re almost finished. Just one more quick check now on your ankles. It’s very similar to what we just did with your knees – just a little tap. This will help me get a complete picture of your nerve function. It will only take a moment. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. But… please be gentle. And warn me before you tap. I don’t want to be surprised. My legs are very sensitive, you know. Old age.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I will be very gentle, and I'll warn you before I tap. Just relax your leg, and I’ll do the rest. Okay, just a little tap now… How did that feel?
PATIENT: Oh! That was… about the same. A little jolt, a little twitch. It’s not painful, but it’s… unnerving, you know? All these taps and jolts. Is it over now? I think I’ve had enough taps for one day.
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, that’s it. We’re finished with the physical exam now. You did a wonderful job, and I really appreciate your cooperation. Now, I just need to review your chart and discuss some possible causes for your symptoms and what we can do to help. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. That sounds good. I’m glad it’s over. All those taps were… unsettling. Now… what did you find? Is it something serious? I hope it’s nothing too bad. I just want to be able to sleep through the night without having to get up all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of an overactive bladder, possibly with some degree of urinary retention. This is very common as we get older, and it’s often caused by changes in the bladder muscles or the nerves that control them. The fact that you’re having difficulty starting your stream and feeling like you don't empty completely suggests that your bladder isn’t emptying as effectively as it should. And the increased urination at night could be related to changes in your body's hormone levels or other factors. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something serious, but it’s something we should address to improve your quality of life. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Overactive bladder… is that… bad? And urinary retention… does that mean I’m… holding something back? Oh dear. Is it something that needs surgery? I don’t like surgery. And what about… pills? Will I have to take a lot of pills? I already take pills for my blood pressure and my knees. I don’t want to be taking a whole pharmacy full of pills.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Zoie. Let's address them one by one. Overactive bladder simply means that your bladder muscles are contracting more frequently than they should, which can lead to a sudden urge to urinate. It's not necessarily a serious condition, but it can be very disruptive. Urinary retention means that you're not completely emptying your bladder each time you urinate. It can happen for a variety of reasons, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It just means your bladder isn't functioning as efficiently as it could. Now, regarding surgery, that’s usually not the first line of treatment for overactive bladder. We typically start with more conservative measures, such as lifestyle modifications and medications. As for medications, there are several different types of medications that can help manage overactive bladder. We can start with a low dose and see how you respond. And we’ll definitely work to minimize the number of pills you have to take. It’s important to find a treatment plan that works for you and fits your lifestyle. Does that help to alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: That’s… a little bit better. But what kind of lifestyle modifications? And what kind of medications? I’ve heard stories about medications having bad side effects. I don’t want to be feeling sick all the time. And what if they don’t work? Will I just have to… keep getting up all night? Oh dear. I just want to be able to sleep. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Zoie, that's not too much to ask at all. And I understand your concerns. Let's talk about the lifestyle modifications first. These are things you can do on your own to help manage your symptoms. They include things like limiting your fluid intake before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises – also known as Kegel exercises – to strengthen your bladder muscles. As for the medications, there are a few different types that we can consider. Some medications help to relax the bladder muscles, while others help to reduce the urge to urinate. The most common side effects are usually mild, such as dry mouth or constipation. We can always adjust the dose or try a different medication if you experience any side effects. And if the medications don’t work, there are other options we can explore. We can consider further testing to rule out any underlying conditions. Or we can discuss other treatment options, such as Botox injections or nerve stimulation. We’ll work together to find a plan that works for you. Now, would you like me to explain the pelvic floor exercises in more detail?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises… oh dear. I’ve heard of those. Squeezing… down there? That sounds… embarrassing. And will they really help? I’m an old woman, dear. My muscles aren’t what they used to be. I don’t think squeezing will do much good. But… tell me about them anyway. I suppose it can’t hurt to try. If it’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Zoie, and it's perfectly normal to feel a bit embarrassed. But pelvic floor exercises can actually be very effective, even for older women. They help to strengthen the muscles that support your bladder, which can help to reduce the urge to urinate and improve your control. They're not about squeezing hard, it’s about gently contracting and relaxing the muscles, like you're trying to stop yourself from passing gas. You can do them anywhere, anytime, and no one will even know you're doing them. "Imagine you're trying to stop the flow of urine midstream. Gently contract those muscles, hold for a few seconds, and then relax. Repeat this several times throughout the day. Start with 10 repetitions and gradually increase as you get stronger." "It may take a few weeks to see results, but it's worth giving it a try. There are also some helpful resources online that can guide you through the exercises. Would you like me to print out some information for you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. Please print out some information for me. I'm a bit of a visual learner. And I suppose it can't hurt to try squeezing. If it helps me sleep, it will be worth the embarrassment. And… thank you for being so patient with me. I know I'm a bit of a worrier. And I ask a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Zoie. And please, don’t apologize for asking questions! It’s important to understand your health and feel comfortable with your treatment plan. That’s my job. Here you are. This explains the pelvic floor exercises in more detail and has some helpful tips. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you’re doing and adjust your treatment plan if needed. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as fever, blood in your urine, or severe pain, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all for today. Thank you for everything. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. And you’ve put my mind at ease. I’m looking forward to trying the squeezing. And I’ll be sure to call if anything goes wrong.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Zoie. I’m glad I could help. And remember, take things slowly and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, Zoie. And get some rest!
