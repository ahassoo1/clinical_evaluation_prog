DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now, I reckon. Honestly, time gets away from me these days. Not sure how long exactly. It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, “shaking,” mostly in your hand, and it’s been going on for a while. You said time is getting away from you – that’s alright, we’ll figure it out. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. It’s worse when I try to… do things. Like, holding a cup of coffee. Or, uh… writing. Not that I do much writing anymore. It just… feels harder to keep things steady. It's not all the time though, sometimes my hand's fine. Really, it's just… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, worse with activity… holding a cup, writing. Alright. And is this shaking limited to your right hand, or does it affect your left hand at all?
PATIENT: Right hand, definitely the right. Left hand seems okay. Never really noticed it on the left side. Though, to be fair, I don’t use my left hand for much either. Used to be better with it… years ago. Everything gets a bit mixed up, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's common for things to feel a bit less clear as time goes on. So, right hand mostly. Now, besides the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really. Maybe… feeling a bit tired sometimes? But I’m 79, Doctor, so that’s not exactly news. I don't think anything else has been bothering me. Just the shaking, really. It's just… annoying, and I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, but you attribute that to age, which is reasonable. Now, have you noticed any stiffness in your hand or arm, perhaps in the morning?
PATIENT: Stiffness… not particularly. Maybe a little bit, but I just… work through it. I used to work with pipes, you know? Water treatment plant. Lots of twisting and turning. Maybe it's just old age creaking, if that makes sense. I don’t really pay it much mind. It’s not sharp pain, just… a bit slow to get going sometimes.
DOCTOR: Past work with pipes, twisting and turning… that’s good to know. So, not sharp pain, just some slowness getting going in the mornings. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… uh. Honestly, I’ve seen so many doctors over the years, I can’t really remember. I had something with my heart, I think. A long time ago. And my blood pressure… that was always a bit high. But beyond that… nothing major, I don’t think. I really don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, vague recollection of heart issues and high blood pressure. We can try to look those up in our system, if you'd like. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. And… I think I had a hernia operation at some point. But again, it was a long time ago. My memory… it's just not what it used to be. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Mr. Jezik. It's perfectly understandable. We'll do our best to piece things together. So, appendix as a child, hernia operation at some point. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. Not anymore. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off it years ago. Said it wasn't doing much good. Just some vitamins sometimes, if I remember. Honestly, I’m not much for taking pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, just vitamins occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental things?
PATIENT: Allergies… Nope, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with food or anything like that. I eat pretty much everything. Maybe a little sensitive to dust, but that’s just a sneeze now and then. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, let's talk a little bit about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, Parkinson's, or tremors?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had something with her heart, I think. And my father… he just got old, really. Lots of aches and pains. I don't really know much about anyone else. Not many family left. And to be honest, I don't remember anyone specifically having… what was it? Parkinson's? No, not that I recall. They all just… faded away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. History of heart issues in your mother. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to take a look at your hands and check your reflexes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… let’s get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have a bit of an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll be as quick as possible. First, let's just listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little irregular, but nothing too alarming at this point. Lungs sound clear. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. You can see it, right? That shaking. It’s always worse when I hold them out like this. Honestly, it's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor, Mr. Jezik. It’s most noticeable at rest, as you say. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Can you open and close your hands a few times for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s not easy, you know. Gets harder every day. And please, don't take too long. I really do have to go.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Alright, that's enough for now. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like you’re experiencing a tremor, most likely an essential tremor. It's a common condition, especially as people get older. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests and possibly a neurological evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a neurological evaluation… Honestly, Doctor, that sounds like a lot of fuss. Is it really necessary? I just want something to stop the shaking, if possible. I don't want to spend months going to different specialists.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It does sound like a lot, and I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn’t important to get a clear picture of what's going on. The blood tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the tremor, such as thyroid problems. And the neurological evaluation will allow a specialist to confirm the diagnosis and discuss the best treatment options for you. We can start with just the blood tests and see what those show. If they come back normal, then we can discuss whether or not a neurological evaluation is necessary. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests, then. Just… get it over with. I don’t want to be bothered with this any longer than I have to. Can I go now? I have an appointment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll have the lab technician come in shortly to draw the blood. It will only take a few minutes. Here is a requisition form for the blood work. Once you have had the blood drawn, you can take this to the lab. The results should be back within a week. I’ll have my nurse call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. In the meantime, if the shaking becomes significantly worse or you develop any other symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope these tests will show something. Anything. So I can finally get some relief. Now, if you'll excuse me…
