DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… let me think… over two days now, easily. It’s really starting to bother me, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over two days. That is bothersome. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Well, they're… normal hiccups, I guess? You know, that little jump in your chest, and you have to take a breath in and… hic …and then you can’t control it. It's not painful, just… annoying. And tiring, actually, because I keep jumping. They come and go, not really a pattern, just… randomly. I tried drinking water really fast, like my grandma always told me, but that didn't help at all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Random, not painful, and the usual remedies aren't working. Are they happening constantly, or do they come in bouts?
PATIENT: It's definitely bouts. Not constant, thank goodness. Like, I can go maybe… half an hour, an hour, without one. But then suddenly… hic …a whole bunch, maybe five or six in a row, and then they'll stop again for a while. It's just unpredictable. Makes it hard to concentrate at work, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds quite disruptive. And what sort of work do you do, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: I’m an Entertainment and Recreation Manager. I mostly organize events… parties, corporate things, that sort of thing. It’s a lot of phone calls, emails, and being on my feet, making sure everything runs smoothly. Hard to do when you keep… hic …jumping like a frog! It’s embarrassing with clients, you know?
DOCTOR: I can certainly see how that would be challenging and a bit embarrassing. Alright. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. Had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles – but nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and… oh, and I had a bad fall a few years ago, broke my wrist, but that healed up fine. Other than that, just… the normal aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I don't take any regular medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical history, tonsils out as a child, a broken wrist that healed well, and no current medications. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. And I haven’t ever noticed any issues with medications either. I've taken antibiotics a few times for colds, but nothing serious, and no problems with those.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some problems with his knees when he got older, but nothing really… unusual. No history of… hiccups, if that’s what you’re asking! They both lived long lives, though, so I guess they weren’t too bad off. I have one brother, he's fine, lives in Cairo.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and knee problems, but no significant issues that seem relevant to your current situation. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never have, never will. I don't care for it, and it smells terrible. Always thought it was a silly habit, to be honest. My mother smoked for a while, but she quit years ago. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Maybe a couple of times a week.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional wine. Do you drink alcohol frequently or in large amounts?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Like I said, a glass or two with dinner, that's it. I’m not a big drinker. Never have been. I prefer tea, actually. Lots of herbal tea. It helps me relax. I certainly don’t drink enough to cause any problems, I can assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And how about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, fruit… I like Mediterranean food, things like that. Fish is good. I do enjoy sweets sometimes, though. Can’t resist a good baklava! But overall, I'd say my diet is pretty balanced. I don’t eat a lot of processed food or fast food. Nothing too crazy, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's all very helpful information, Ms. Redeye. Now, if you’ll excuse me for a moment, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Then we can decide what, if anything, we need to do next.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I'm just hoping we can figure out what’s causing these… hic …these dreadful hiccups!
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to report. Everything feels normal to the touch. I don't feel any masses or abnormalities. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Given your history and the physical exam, there doesn't seem to be anything obvious going on. Often, hiccups are benign and resolve on their own. However, since they’ve been going on for over two days, it's worth looking into a little further to rule out anything more serious. Would you be willing to have some blood work done, just to check your electrolytes and rule out any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then definitely. Blood work is fine. I just want these hiccups to stop! I'm starting to get really worried, to be honest. It’s silly, I know, but… hic …it’s just so annoying and disruptive. I'd rather be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Ms. Redeye. It's not silly at all to want to get this sorted out. We’ll run some basic tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your electrolytes, and maybe a thyroid stimulating hormone test. That should give us a good starting point. I'll write you a lab order. The phlebotomist is just down the hall. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if the hiccups get significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… hic …so I'm clear, those are the only things that would be worrying enough to go to the emergency room, right? Shortness of breath, chest pain, and bad stomach pain? And everything else, we just wait for the test results? Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It's a relief to finally be doing something about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain would warrant an immediate trip to the emergency room. Otherwise, we'll wait for the lab results and schedule a follow-up appointment. It’s my pleasure, Ms. Redeye. I understand how frustrating persistent hiccups can be, and I'm glad we're taking steps to investigate. Here's the lab order and a little information on some things you can try at home – deep breathing exercises, drinking water slowly, and avoiding carbonated beverages. It might not solve the problem, but it could provide some temporary relief. Do you have any difficulties getting to the lab, or would you like me to arrange transportation?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I can get to the lab just fine, it’s not far. And I’ve already tried the drinking water thing – didn't work, unfortunately! But I appreciate the pamphlet. I'll try the deep breathing. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a lot better knowing we’re looking into this. I’ll let the receptionist know I'm leaving, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once I have the results. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And I hope the hiccups subside soon. Have a good day. .
