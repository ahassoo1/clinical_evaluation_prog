DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I… well, my husband and I just moved here. I think this is, like, a check-up? He said I needed to come see someone new 'cause of the insurance. I don't really remember everything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. A new-patient check-up is a great place to start, and it's very common to feel a little overwhelmed with new insurance and moving. We’ll take things at your pace. I have your information here – Emileigh Bonck, 21 years old. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Twenty-one… I think so. It all feels kinda fast, you know? Moving and stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. Big changes can definitely be a lot to process. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Not for a long time. I think… maybe when I was a kid? But I don't remember much about it. Mostly, I just try to stay healthy, you know? Eat okay and stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, well, no worries at all. We'll just get some information to get a good baseline. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries that you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. I mean, nothing big. I had my tonsils out when I was little, I think? But other than that… not that I remember. I get sick sometimes, like colds, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy – good to know. And you mentioned occasional colds. Are there any allergies I should be aware of – to medications, food, or anything environmental like pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I get itchy sometimes, but I always thought that was just… my skin being dry? My husband says I’m probably just sensitive. I don’t really know. I don't take any medicine regularly, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. And no regular medications. Now, a few questions about your family history, if you're comfortable sharing. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Um… My mom… she had some problems with her heart, I think? But she lived far away, and we didn’t talk a lot. I don't really know what kind of problems. And my dad… he was healthy, I think. He worked outside a lot. I don’t really remember much about his health either, to be honest. I’m not very good at remembering stuff like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s common not to have all the details. We can work with what you do know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just sometimes a little with dinner. Like, a glass of wine, maybe? And definitely no drugs. My husband doesn't like those things either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently experiencing any specific symptoms that are concerning you – any pain, fatigue, changes in your weight or appetite, or anything else unusual?
PATIENT: Hmm… I have been feeling kinda tired lately, yeah. But I just thought it was from moving and getting settled. And… sometimes my stomach hurts a little. Like, a dull ache. It comes and goes. But it’s not really bad bad, just… annoying. I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and intermittent abdominal pain. Can you describe the abdominal pain a little more?
PATIENT: Um… It's kinda… all over? Not like one specific spot. And it happens mostly after I eat, I think. Not everything I eat, just sometimes. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a full feeling that doesn’t go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, diffuse abdominal pain, occurring intermittently after eating, described as a dull ache or fullness. And is there anything that seems to make it better or worse – certain foods, lying down, taking anything for it?
PATIENT: Um… Lying down helps a little, I think. And… avoiding really spicy food seems to make it better. But I like spicy food! I haven’t really taken anything for it, just tried to ignore it. I don’t really like taking medicine. It makes me feel weird.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then I'd like to gently feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… okay. Just be gentle with my stomach, please? It's kinda sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be very gentle. Let's start with your blood pressure. 128 over 76. That's within a normal range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, Emileigh, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. There is some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses palpable. Bowel sounds are normal.
PATIENT: Okay… That part… yeah, that feels a little sore. But it's not bad bad, just… uncomfortable. Like a pressure. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, described as pressure. It’s good that there’s no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. It doesn’t sound like anything acutely concerning, but given your history of intermittent abdominal pain and the tenderness, I think it would be prudent to order some basic blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. And I’d also like to do a urine analysis to rule out a urinary tract infection, which can sometimes present with similar symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Blood work and… what was the other one? Urine? As long as it doesn’t take too long. I don’t really like going to labs. Is it gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: The blood work involves a small sample taken from your arm. It will be a quick pinch, and then it’s over. The urine sample is just that - you'll collect it in a cup. It shouldn't be painful at all. It should take about 15-20 minutes total, and the lab is right down the hall. I’ll give you the requisition forms and instructions, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any foods that seem to trigger your abdominal pain and staying well-hydrated. And if your pain worsens or you develop any other symptoms like fever, nausea, or vomiting, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… makes sense. Blood work, urine, avoid bad food, drink water. And call if it gets worse. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s everything, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for today. I’ll have the lab requisition forms ready for you. We’ll review the results when they come back and discuss a plan from there. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Here are the forms and a printed summary of our discussion. It was nice meeting you, Emileigh. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor Panjoj. You too. I think I’ll go do the tests now.
