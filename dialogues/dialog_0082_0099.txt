DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUzzolino. It’s… nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I received a letter regarding the results of a test I had done… a GI Endo test, it was called. The results seemed… unusual, and my general practitioner thought it best I come in for a proper discussion.
DOCTOR: A GI Endo test… yes, yes. Right. Unusual results, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. The letter mentioned something about… well, I confess, a lot of it went over my head. I do recall the technician saying everything looked… inflamed. And there was mention of needing to discuss what that means, and potentially… further testing. It’s rather worrying, to be honest, not knowing exactly what’s going on inside.
DOCTOR: Inflammation… yes, that can be concerning, certainly. Let’s see if I can access those results here… just a moment. Ah, here we are. Denis Minatra… August 2nd… Okay. Now, do you mind telling me a little about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It began… oh, about three months ago, I believe. I started experiencing some discomfort, mostly in my abdomen. Not severe pain, mind you, but a persistent ache, and… well, a rather unsettling feeling of fullness, even after only a small amount of food. Then there were the… changes in my bowel habits, if you’ll excuse my bluntness. It was all quite disruptive, and my doctor suggested the endoscopy to investigate. She wanted to rule out anything serious, naturally.
DOCTOR: Persistent ache… fullness… changes in bowel habits. Right. And about these changes… could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. It was… inconsistency, mostly. Sometimes difficult to pass anything at all, other times… more frequent visits than usual, if you understand. And the… color was different on occasion. Darker than it should be, I believe. It didn’t happen every time, mind you, but enough to cause concern. It's difficult to describe precisely, I apologize. I am not one for dwelling on such… personal matters. But I wanted to be thorough, and I recall mentioning it to my general practitioner.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Denis. It's important to be thorough, and you're doing just that. Darker stools… that is something we need to pay attention to. The report here does indicate some inflammation in the… lower colon, and… some polyps were identified. Have you had any polyps removed previously?
PATIENT: Polyps? No, Doctor, I haven’t. I don’t believe so, at least not to my knowledge. I’ve had regular check-ups, of course, but no one has ever mentioned removing anything. This is all rather… new to me. What exactly are polyps, and… is it something to be greatly worried about? I apologize for all the questions, but I am a bit anxious, naturally.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Denis. Questions are good. Polyps are… well, they’re growths in the lining of the colon. Most of the time, they’re not cancerous, but some can become cancerous over time. That’s why it’s important to remove them and have them examined. The report indicates these are… small, but several of them. Now, the endoscopy allows us to remove them during the procedure itself, and then we send them to a lab to be analyzed. Do you recall if your general practitioner discussed a colonoscopy with you at all?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… hmm. I do recall her mentioning something about a more… thorough examination, yes. But I believe she said the endoscopy would provide enough information initially. She didn’t specifically use the term “colonoscopy”, but I remember discussing the need for a… deeper look if necessary. Was that… perhaps what she was referring to? I’m terribly sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s easy to get confused with all the medical jargon.
DOCTOR: That sounds right, Denis. Often doctors will start with an endoscopy, and if something is found, a colonoscopy is the next step to get a better view of the entire colon. This report… indicates we should definitely be considering a colonoscopy. Now, before we jump to that, let’s quickly review your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, heart disease, or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, thankfully, not much. I was a very healthy woman for most of my life. I do have some… arthritis in my knees, which makes walking a bit difficult at times, but it’s well-managed with some over-the-counter medication. Aside from that… and the recent discomfort, I’ve been quite fortunate. No heart disease, no diabetes, nothing of that sort. My late husband, God rest his soul, had some issues with his blood pressure, but that was many years ago, and I don't believe it's hereditary. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing lasting. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? Perhaps I’ve forgotten something.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Denis. Arthritis in the knees… and no significant medical history otherwise. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for the arthritis, Doctor. Nothing regularly, only when the pain flares up. And a daily multivitamin, just to keep things topped up, as they say. I don’t take any other prescription medications, and I rarely use any other over-the-counter remedies. I prefer natural solutions whenever possible, though they haven't been very effective with this abdominal discomfort, unfortunately. I do try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, but… well, it hasn't seemed to make much difference.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed… multivitamin… Okay. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication or food in my life. I’ve eaten everything, travelled extensively, and never had any issues with allergies. My late husband, bless him, was terribly allergic to shellfish, but I inherited none of his sensitivities, thankfully. I’ve always considered myself quite fortunate in that regard. Is that something that is particularly concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, Denis, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk briefly about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – things like colon cancer, breast cancer, heart disease?
PATIENT: That’s a rather difficult question, Doctor. My family… was quite large, and we’ve been spread across several countries for generations. I do know that my grandmother, on my mother’s side, passed away from… some sort of cancer, but I believe it was lung cancer, related to her smoking. My father’s side… I’m less certain. He had several siblings, but I lost contact with most of them many years ago. I believe one of his brothers had heart issues, but it was a long time ago, and I don’t have any specific details. I’m afraid I’m not very knowledgeable about my family’s medical history, Doctor. I wish I could be of more assistance. It’s something I’ve always meant to look into, but… life gets in the way, as they say. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? Perhaps I can try to recall something more.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Denis. Family history can be difficult to trace. Lung cancer in your grandmother… and possible heart issues on your father’s side. That's helpful. Now, one last question for now – do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have never smoked in my life. My late husband was a smoker for many years, but he quit decades ago. I always strongly discouraged it, of course. I believe strongly in a healthy lifestyle, and smoking was something I simply could not abide. I have always been very careful about what I put into my body, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco was a top priority. I do try to encourage others to do the same, whenever possible. Is that something that is of particular concern, Doctor? I understand it can be a contributing factor to many illnesses.
DOCTOR: No, Denis, that's good to know. No history of smoking. Now, let’s talk about the results of your endoscopy. The report indicates inflammation in the lower colon, as we discussed, and several small polyps were identified. These polyps need to be removed and examined to determine if they are cancerous or precancerous. The best way to do that is with a colonoscopy. Now, a colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera attached into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It's a relatively safe procedure, but it does require bowel preparation beforehand to clear out the colon. Would you be open to discussing a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… well, it doesn’t sound particularly pleasant, Doctor, but… if it’s necessary, then I suppose I must. If it’s the best way to determine what’s going on inside, and to ensure everything is alright, then I’m willing to proceed. I’m not particularly fond of medical procedures, but I understand they are sometimes unavoidable. What exactly does this “bowel preparation” entail, Doctor? I confess, that sounds rather… daunting. And is there any discomfort involved with the procedure itself? I would like to be fully informed before proceeding, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Denis. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. The bowel preparation is the least pleasant part, I'm afraid. It involves drinking a special solution the day before the procedure to completely clear out your colon. It does cause frequent trips to the bathroom, but it's essential for a clear view during the colonoscopy. As for the procedure itself, most people don't experience much discomfort. You'll be given medication to help you relax and possibly some pain medication if needed. You’ll be lying on your side, and we will pass the colonoscope through your rectum. There can be some cramping or bloating, but it's usually mild and temporary. The procedure itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes. We’ll also be able to remove the polyps during the procedure, if any are found. Do you have any other concerns about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Thirty to sixty minutes… that doesn’t sound too terrible, all things considered. The bowel preparation… that’s what worries me most, I think. Frequent trips to the bathroom… is it… uncontrollable? And what about afterwards? Will I be able to return home on my own? I do live alone, you see, and I wouldn't want to be incapacitated. And what if they find something… serious? I understand it’s best to be prepared, but the thought is rather unsettling. I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I am a bit anxious, as you can imagine. Perhaps I should have brought someone with me.
DOCTOR: You're not at all inconveniencing me with your questions, Denis. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious, and it’s important to address all your concerns. As for the bowel preparation, yes, it does involve frequent trips to the bathroom, and it is initially uncontrollable. However, it usually subsides after a few hours. We’ll provide you with detailed instructions, and we can also prescribe some anti-nausea medication if you're concerned about feeling unwell. Afterwards, you will likely feel some cramping and bloating, but you should be able to return home on your own. We'll keep you under observation for a short period to ensure you're stable before discharging you. As for finding something serious, that’s always a possibility, but it’s important to remember that early detection is key. If any abnormalities are found, we'll discuss them with you in detail and recommend the appropriate course of treatment. We’ll also have a pathologist examine the polyps to determine if they are cancerous or precancerous. Would you like me to schedule a consultation with a gastroenterologist to discuss the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: A consultation with a gastroenterologist… yes, that would be very reassuring, Doctor. Perhaps someone who specializes in this particular area could address my concerns more thoroughly. And could you perhaps provide me with some written information about the procedure, and the bowel preparation? I find it easier to process things when I have something to refer to later. And… what is the cost involved, Doctor? I am on a fixed income, you see, and I need to be mindful of my finances. I apologize for all the practical questions, but I believe it’s important to be fully informed before proceeding. I trust you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Denis. I completely understand. I’ll schedule a consultation with Dr. Ramirez, she's an excellent gastroenterologist. She'll be able to answer all your questions in detail and address any concerns you may have. Here’s some written information about the procedure and bowel preparation. It includes detailed instructions and contact information if you have any questions afterwards. As for the cost… let me see… Without insurance, the procedure typically costs around $1,800. The pathology report will be an additional $300. However, we do have a financial assistance program available for patients with limited income. I can provide you with the application form and assist you with the process. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: $1,800… plus $300… that is… rather substantial. The financial assistance program sounds like a very good option, Doctor. Yes, please, I would be very grateful if you could provide me with the application form. I confess, I am not sure if I will be eligible, but it’s worth exploring, certainly. And… when is Dr. Ramirez available for a consultation? Perhaps we could schedule something for next week, if possible? I would like to have all the information before making a final decision. This is all rather overwhelming, Doctor, but I appreciate your patience and understanding. You have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Denis. Let's get that application form for you. Here you go. It requires some information about your income and expenses, but we can assist you with completing it if needed. Dr. Ramirez is available next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Would that time work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM… yes, that would be perfect, Doctor. Thank you very much. Perhaps I should bring someone with me, just for support. Is that permissible? And… is there anything I should bring to the consultation, aside from this application form? I want to be fully prepared. I do apologize for all the questions, but I am a bit anxious, as you can imagine. You have been very helpful, Doctor. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding.
DOCTOR: Of course, Denis. You are very welcome. Bringing someone with you is absolutely permissible, and I encourage it. It's always helpful to have support during medical appointments. Aside from the application form, it’s helpful to bring a list of any medications you’re currently taking, and any questions you have prepared beforehand. And perhaps a notebook to jot down any important information. Here’s my business card with the clinic’s contact information. If you have any questions before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call. Now, let's get you scheduled for that consultation with Dr. Ramirez. One moment. Alright, you are scheduled for Tuesday at 2:00 PM. We’ll see you then. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been very thorough, and I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. I feel much more informed, and less anxious, than I did when I first arrived. Thank you again for everything. I look forward to meeting Dr. Ramirez on Tuesday. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. It was my pleasure. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you on Tuesday.
