DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It’s… well, it’s been going on for weeks. Severe diarrhea. Everything I try just doesn’t work. And frankly, I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, weeks of diarrhea – I understand you want to get to the bottom of this quickly. Let's try to get a clear picture. When you say “doesn’t work”, what have you tried so far?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? I’ve tried… you know, the usual stuff. Imodium, Pepto-Bismol. Those over-the-counter things. And I even went to the drugstore and got one of those probiotics, the kind with all the… cultures. It didn’t do a thing. Honestly, I shouldn’t have to tell you this. Isn’t this what doctors are supposed to ask?
DOCTOR: You're right to call me out on that – apologies. I should be more thorough upfront. It’s just, I like to be efficient. Okay, so Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, and a probiotic, none of which helped. Can you tell me a little more about the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a lot. Multiple times a day. Watery. And it just… keeps happening. It’s embarrassing to even talk about. And it's exhausting. I’m constantly running to the bathroom, and I’m starting to feel really weak. Like I'm dehydrated, even though I’m drinking a ton of water. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Multiple times a day, watery, and feeling weak and dehydrated despite drinking plenty of water. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: No blood, thankfully. I haven’t thrown up, no. No fever either. Just… this. Constant, relentless… movement. And the weakness. I used to be able to get a lot done around the house, you know? Painting, fixing things… Now, I can barely make it through the day. Honestly, it’s humiliating.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: No. I haven't left town in months. And no, I haven't been around anyone sick. I’m very careful about that sort of thing. I don’t go near people who are coughing or sneezing. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. This isn’t some… common bug.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Do you have any underlying medical conditions, or take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Healthy as a horse, usually. Well, was healthy. That's why this is so baffling. And frankly, I don't appreciate being treated like I'm just imagining things. This is real, and it's ruining my life. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going to keep asking pointless questions?
DOCTOR: I apologize again, Ms. Woodring. You’re absolutely right – I should be more focused. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your abdomen, and feel your belly. Then I'll check your vitals, just to rule out dehydration. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I have things to do. And please, try not to poke too hard. You have no idea how sensitive I am right now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is a bit tender, as you'd expect with this much diarrhea, but I'm not detecting anything alarming. Your blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 90, and temperature is 98.6 – so thankfully, no fever. I’ll quickly check your weight as well. That confirms a BMI of 19.2. That is a little on the low side, which could contribute to the weakness.
PATIENT: See? I told you I was weak. It's not just the diarrhea. I haven't been feeling like eating much lately, either. It’s hard to explain. I just don't have an appetite. And frankly, I'm starting to suspect something serious is going on. Something you’re not taking seriously enough.
DOCTOR: You're right to voice your concerns, Ms. Woodring. It’s good you're advocating for yourself. Low appetite alongside this prolonged diarrhea and weight is concerning. Given the duration and lack of response to over-the-counter remedies, I want to order some tests. I'd like to check a stool sample for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. We’ll also do a blood test to look for signs of inflammation and rule out other potential causes. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Finally. Some actual investigation. Yes, do whatever tests you need to. Just… get it done quickly. And please, try to find out what’s wrong with me. I don’t have time to be sick. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. This is really inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m getting the lab orders set up now. The nurse will come in shortly to collect the stool sample and draw your blood. It should take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. And until we have the results, I recommend a bland diet – things like toast, rice, bananas, and applesauce. We’ll follow up as soon as the results are in, and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just…get this over with. I have things to do. And please, don't lose my sample. This is really frustrating. I’m not a fan of hospitals or doctors, to be honest. So the faster this is, the better.
