DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. Amy Raghunathan, right?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Gorga. Yes, that’s me. It’s nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: Right, nice to meet you too. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a few weeks now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out. It doesn’t really hurt, but it’s definitely… noticeable.
DOCTOR: A lump in the lower abdomen, you say. A few weeks… not painful. Okay. Can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels… firm, but not hard, if that makes sense. About the size of a plum, maybe a little smaller. It doesn’t move around much when I touch it, feels kind of… stuck, I suppose. It’s sort of in the middle, just below my belly button.
DOCTOR: Firm, plum-sized, not much movement… below the belly button. Okay. And has anything… changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. I haven’t had any injuries or anything like that. My appetite’s been normal, bowel movements are regular. I haven’t lost any weight, either. Just… the lump appeared. I'm not sure if it grew quickly, to be honest, I didn't really pay much attention at first.
DOCTOR: Right. No changes in appetite, bowel habits, weight… Okay. Let's just do a quick exam, if that's alright with you. It'll help me get a better sense of what we’re dealing with. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Good. If you could just lie down on the table for me, that’d be great. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and feel for the lump… and maybe some other things, just to be thorough. I'll try to be quick.
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me know if there’s anything I should do, or if it’s uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax for me. Deep breaths… Okay, I’m feeling around now… a little discomfort?
PATIENT: Just a little, Doctor. It’s not painful, exactly, just… awareness of it, I suppose. It feels a bit strange when you press on it, but nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling a firm mass… approximately 2 cm in diameter. It is fixed, meaning it doesn’t move around easily. Bowel sounds are normal. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Okay. I’m going to need to access your chart to see your history… Just one moment.
PATIENT: Of course, take your time, Doctor. No rush at all. I appreciate you being so thorough. Is there anything you’re specifically looking for in my chart? Knowing might help me remember if anything’s relevant.
DOCTOR: I'm checking for previous abdominal issues, any family history of similar lumps or cancers… things like that. It's mostly just to build a more complete picture, you know. Ah, okay. No significant past medical history… Medicare coverage… Right. Given the location and firmness, and the fact it’s fixed… It could be a number of things. We'll need some imaging, likely a CT scan, to get a better look. And potentially some blood work. That’s the best next step. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan and some blood work… yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Whatever you recommend. I trust your expertise. Will I need a referral for the scan? And is there anything I should do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need a referral. I’ll get that sent over to the radiology department at City General Hospital. They have the best equipment. For the CT scan itself… it depends. They might ask you to avoid eating for a few hours beforehand, and they'll likely ask about any allergies to contrast dye. The radiology department will call you to schedule it and give you specific instructions. I’m also going to order some routine blood work—a complete blood count and a metabolic panel—just to get a baseline. The lab is also at City General, so you can likely do both at the same time. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds excellent, Doctor. Both the scan and bloodwork at City General. I’ll keep an eye out for a call from them to schedule everything. Do you have any preliminary thoughts on what this could be? I don't expect you to be definitive, but if you have a general idea, I’d feel a little less anxious knowing. Of course, if you'd prefer not to say until the results are back, that’s perfectly fine too.
DOCTOR: Well… given the location and the fact it's fixed… it could be a number of things. A lipoma is possible, though a fixed lipoma is less common. A hernia is also something we need to rule out. More concerning possibilities would be a growth originating from the abdominal wall, or… something originating deeper within the abdomen. It's far too early to say anything definitively, and frankly, worrying about it before we have imaging results won’t do you any good. The scan will give us a much clearer picture. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible, and we’ll discuss them in detail then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. It’s good to know what could be, even if it’s just possibilities. And you're right, worrying won’t help. A scan is the best next step, and I’ll await the results. I think I understand. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should watch out for, or any specific symptoms that warrant a call before the scan appointment?
DOCTOR: Good. In the meantime, just keep an eye out for any significant changes in size, any pain developing, any fever or chills, or any changes in your bowel habits. If you notice any of those things, definitely give us a call. Otherwise, just live as normal and try not to worry too much. I've sent the referrals for the scan and blood work to City General Hospital. They will contact you directly to schedule the appointments. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. Thank you for taking the time to listen and address my concerns. I appreciate it. I will await the call from City General and keep an eye out for any changes, as you advised.
DOCTOR: Good. You're very welcome. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes, or if you have any questions at all before your appointments. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
