DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is okay if I call you Doctor Galena? I am here for… the telehealth visit. The nurse, she told me. It is about my back, mostly. It has been… not good for some weeks now.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do, Doctor Galena is fine. And yes, the telehealth visit... right. Your back. Several weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe six weeks, I think? It started… small. Just a little ache after I work on cars. But now… it is more. It hurts even when I sit, sometimes. It is not good for bending, either.
DOCTOR: Six weeks… and it’s progressed, even with just sitting. Alright. Can you tell me a bit more about the ache after working on cars?
PATIENT: It is… hard to say exactly. It is in my lower back, mostly. Like I have lifted something too heavy, but I haven’t. I am careful. I have worked on cars for… a long time, you know? But after a long day… it feels pulled. And then it just… stays. Usually it goes away with rest, but not anymore.
DOCTOR: So it started as a post-work ache, lower back, and now it’s lingering even with rest. Okay. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… mostly constant, now. Not sharp all the time, but… a dull ache. Like someone is pressing on me. It is worse after I move, or stand for a long time. And… in the morning, it is always worse. I have to… get myself going, you know?
DOCTOR: Constant dull ache, worse with movement and standing, and particularly in the mornings. I see. Now, has this pain radiated anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiated? I… do not understand. You mean… does it go somewhere else? Sometimes my hip feels… tight, on the same side as my back. Is that what you mean? Not pain, exactly, but… not right.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly! Tightness, or pain that travels. Your hip… alright. And have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. No tingling. My legs… they feel okay. I can walk, I can stand. It is just… difficult sometimes. And I have to be careful how I bend. I do not want to make it worse. I still need to work, you know? The cars… they do not fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s good you’re still able to walk and stand. It’s important to stay active, but we need to be smart about it. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just some simple movements to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you need me to do, I will try. Just… be gentle, please. My old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites. I will be very gentle. Alright, can you gently bend forward for me, and just let me know where you feel any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… not good. It hurts… right here, on the left side of my back. And down my… leg a little. Not a sharp pain, but… a pulling. Like a muscle is tight. I cannot go very far. That is enough, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Pain with forward flexion, left-sided, radiating down the leg a bit. And tenderness on palpation. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to have you lie on your stomach for a moment. This will allow me to check your range of motion and assess for any muscle spasms.
PATIENT: Okay. It is… not very comfortable, but I am okay. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything. It is… a long time since I have been on my stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. I’m just going to gently move your leg in different directions. Please let me know if anything causes discomfort. And I’m going to lift your leg straight up, just to see if that reproduces any of the pain you’ve been feeling. Okay, so there is some limited range of motion, and pain with the straight leg raise on the left side. Some muscle guarding as well. It sounds like you may have a lumbar strain or possibly some nerve irritation. It's difficult to say definitively without imaging, but given your history and the physical exam, I think we should start with some conservative treatment.
PATIENT: Conservative treatment? What does that mean, Doctor? Will I need… an X-ray? And can I still work? I need to know that. The cars… they are waiting.
DOCTOR: Conservative treatment means we start with things like rest, ice, over-the-counter pain relievers, and gentle stretching. We try those things first before considering imaging like an X-ray. An X-ray can be helpful, but it doesn't always tell us everything, and we want to avoid unnecessary radiation if possible. As for work… that’s a good question. It depends on what you’re doing. Heavy lifting and bending are definitely out for now. If you can modify your work to avoid those activities, that may be possible. I am going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, to help with the spasms. I also want you to take ibuprofen 600mg three times a day with food. And I want you to start some gentle stretches. I can have the nurse print you out a handout with some simple exercises. I would like to see you back in two weeks to see how you are doing. If the pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, please call the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Muscle relaxant, ibuprofen, stretches… and see you in two weeks. No heavy lifting, you say. I can try to do lighter work. Mostly repairs, not… the big jobs. And the handout… yes, that would be good. I am… not very good with remembering exercises. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… not ordering an X-ray right away. It worries me, the radiation. And I will call if it gets worse. Of course.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could reassure you about the X-ray. We always want to start with the least invasive options first. The nurse will print out that handout for you now, and she'll also go over the medication instructions. Just remember to take the muscle relaxant as directed, as it can cause drowsiness. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I'll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will try my best. And… I will see you in two weeks. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You take care too, Ms. Benites. And don’t push yourself too hard. Goodbye.
