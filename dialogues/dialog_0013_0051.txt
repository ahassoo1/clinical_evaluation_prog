DOCTOR: Hi Darl, welcome! I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. My… well, my son, he said I should come. Something about my blood? He worries, you know. Always has. I just… need to know what type it is, I suppose. I don’t really remember why it’s important, honestly. It’s all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It's very common to not remember all the details, especially when it comes to medical things. Your son's concern is good – knowing your blood type is important for several reasons, like in case of emergencies or if you ever need a transfusion. Let me pull up your chart here… Okay, I see you’re Darl Nini, born… August 12th, 1946. Do you mind confirming that date for me, please?
PATIENT: August… 1946… yes, yes, that sounds right. A long time ago! Though… sometimes the years all blend together, you know? It feels like yesterday, and a lifetime ago all at once. My husband, bless his soul, he always remembered dates. I relied on him for those sorts of things. Is that date… important for the blood type?
DOCTOR: It is, just to confirm we have the correct medical record. And it’s perfectly understandable about the dates – it's easy for time to slip away. Okay, I do see a previous blood type listed here from… 2018. It says you’re A positive. But blood types can sometimes change, or the record could be incorrect, so we usually like to re-check, especially if you've had any transfusions or been hospitalized since then. Have you had any blood transfusions, or been admitted to the hospital at all since 2018, Darl?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. Transfusions… no, I don’t think so. I had a little… a little trouble with my hip a few years back, maybe 2020, 2021? They did some tests, and I stayed overnight once, but I don’t recall getting any… blood. No, I’m pretty sure. Though… it was during… that strange time. Everything was so mixed up. Hard to say for certain, really. It was a stressful time for everyone. Do you… what does getting a transfusion mean, exactly? I’m sorry, I should know this, shouldn't I?
DOCTOR: No, you shouldn’t feel bad about not knowing! It’s my job to explain things. A transfusion is when you receive blood from someone else – it’s usually needed if you've lost a lot of blood, or if your body isn’t making enough of certain blood cells. Okay, let’s not worry about that for now. Since it was a few years ago, and you don't recall a transfusion, we will go ahead and do a quick blood draw to confirm your type. It's a simple test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood draw… yes, that sounds… sensible. I don’t love needles, but if it’s quick… yes, alright. Is it… painful? My son always said I have thin veins… will it take long? Oh, and… will I be able to drive myself home afterwards? I live just outside of town, you see, and I don’t want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's perfectly normal to not love needles! And yes, a quick blood draw is all we need. It usually doesn’t take more than a few minutes. As for your veins, we have skilled phlebotomists who are very good at finding them – don’t worry, we’ll take our time and be gentle. You mentioned your son... is he your primary contact in case of emergencies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Daniel. He’s a good boy, always looking out for me. A little… overprotective, perhaps, but that's just how he is. He's my emergency contact, yes. He lives nearby, thank goodness. He’d be… frantic if anything happened. And… will this test tell us anything else? Like… about my health? I try not to worry, but… at my age, you start to think about things, you know? Is everything alright, generally? My hip's been a little stiff lately, and…well, I forget things, as you've noticed. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Daniel sounds like a wonderful son. It’s good to have someone like that. And you're right to ask about what the test reveals. This basic blood test primarily checks your blood type, but it also gives us some general information about your red blood cell count, which can sometimes indicate things like anemia. We can also check your white blood cell count as part of the routine draw, which helps us see if there’s any sign of infection. We can also assess your hemoglobin levels, and your platelet count, which is helpful to know. And yes, some memory lapses and joint stiffness are common with age, but we'll want to rule out anything else that could be causing them. We can do some more in-depth testing if needed. First, let's get this blood draw done, and then we can discuss your hip stiffness and memory concerns in more detail. Would you like me to go over a brief medical history questionnaire while we wait for the lab results?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that sounds like a lot of things. Red blood cells, white blood cells… It’s all a bit overwhelming, honestly. But… alright. If you think it's best. A questionnaire… yes, that's probably a good idea. I'll try my best to remember everything. Though, as you know… it doesn’t always work. But… if you’re there to help me, that’s good. Yes, a questionnaire. Perhaps something… simple? Is there somewhere I can sit comfortably while I fill it out? And… will it take long? I promised Daniel I'd be home by lunchtime. He makes a lovely paella, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take things one step at a time. The questionnaire is mostly to get a better understanding of your overall health, past medical history, and any medications you’re taking. It's not overly complicated, and I’ll be right here if you have any questions. It should take about 10-15 minutes, and we can absolutely pause if you need a break. And yes, paella sounds wonderful! We’ll try to get you home in plenty of time to enjoy it. Take your time, and just answer to the best of your ability. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Please, let me know if there's anything at all I can do to make this easier.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. It's… a bit bright, isn't it? But… I suppose I can manage. Let's see… "Have you had any surgeries…" Oh dear. This is… a long list. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, and… what else…
DOCTOR: Is that better?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Much better, thank you. That makes a world of difference. "Do you smoke?" No, never. My husband… he tried, once, but I wouldn't allow it. Bad for the health, you see. And… "Have you traveled outside of the country?" Oh, yes! We went to Barcelona, many years ago. Beautiful city. And… It's amazing how many things you forget. And…this asks about allergies. I think I’m allergic to… dust? Or something. I sneeze a lot. Oh dear. This is… quite a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It is quite a bit of information, and it's perfectly normal to not remember everything. Just answer to the best of your ability, and if you're unsure about something, you can write "unknown" or "not sure." We can always clarify later if needed. Take your time, Darl. There’s no rush. I'll be right here if you need any help at all. It’s good you’re remembering Barcelona though, that's wonderful! Do you have any pictures from your trip?
PATIENT: Oh, pictures… yes, I think so. In the attic, somewhere. Daniel said he'd sort through them one day. He's good at those sorts of things. "Do you experience any difficulty sleeping?" Well, sometimes. I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about… things. Old memories, mostly. And… It’s hard to explain. I just… lie awake sometimes. Worrying. It’s an old woman’s habit, I suppose. But I shouldn’t bother you with my stories. You have patients to see, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t feel like you're bothering me at all. It’s important for me to get a complete picture of your health, and that includes understanding your concerns and experiences. Sharing your stories is part of that process. And it's perfectly normal to have difficulty sleeping, especially as we get older. Many things can contribute to that, like worrying, old memories, or just changes in our sleep patterns. We can certainly discuss some strategies to help improve your sleep if you’d like. Are you almost finished with the questionnaire, Darl?
PATIENT: Almost… just a few more questions. "Do you have any living relatives?" Oh, yes. Daniel, of course. And… a niece, I think. In Madrid. I haven’t seen her in years. It’s hard to keep track of everyone. Time… it slips away so quickly. There! All done, I think. Is there anything else you need me to do? I feel… a bit tired now. All this thinking.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, thank you, Darl. You did a great job! It's perfectly normal to feel tired after going through all that information – it is a lot to think about. Okay, I see Daniel is your emergency contact, and you mentioned some difficulty sleeping and occasional worry. That’s all very helpful. Now, I’ll just excuse myself for a moment to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It's just a routine part of the examination. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Blood pressure… yes, that sounds sensible. I haven’t had that checked in… a long time, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… you won't find anything bad, will you? I worry sometimes, you know. It’s just… old age, I suppose. But I try not to think about it. Do you… do you think I should have had more paella when I was younger? It’s very good for you, you know. Daniel always says so. But, yes, go ahead. Check my blood pressure. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and I assure you, we’ll take things one step at a time. And I certainly don’t think it’s ever too late for paella! It sounds like a very healthy choice, especially if Daniel approves. This might feel a little tight for a moment, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Just try to relax, and I’ll let you know the results as soon as I have them. And you don't need to worry, old age doesn't have to mean anything bad. It's just a chapter in life.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at the moment. It's something we can monitor and address if needed. Now, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few moments. Would you mind taking a few deep breaths for me?
