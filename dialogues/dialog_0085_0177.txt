DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Lahn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, somethin’s leakin’. Down there. Not supposed to be, ya know? It’s kinda… gross. I don’t really like talkin’ about this.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be uncomfortable to discuss these things, Jimmi, and that's perfectly alright. We all have bodies, and sometimes things don’t work quite as they should. Don’t worry, I’m here to help, and we’ll get to the bottom of it. When you say “leaking,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's… wet. Not like… when you pee, exactly. It's…different. And kinda smells funny. I don't know why it's happenin’. It just… started a couple days ago. I ain’t been with anyone, if that matters. Not for a long, long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jimmi. It's good to have all the information. And yes, that does matter – it helps me narrow down what might be going on. So, it started a couple of days ago, and it's not related to urination. Is it happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Hard to say for sure. I mostly notice it when I… when I get dressed. And after I go to the bathroom, sometimes. Not every time, but often. It’s not a lot, mind you, but it's enough to be…annoyin’. And worryin’. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating and concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Is there any pain, burning, or itching associated with it?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Not really. And no burnin’ either. Maybe a little…itchy sometimes, but I get itchy easy. Always have. It’s just the leakin' that’s botherin’ me. It feels…dirty, you know? I keep washin’ it, but it keeps comin’ back. Is it somethin’ I caught?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know there’s no pain or burning. And it's a valid question to ask if it's something you 'caught', but based on what you've told me so far, that's less likely. Itching can be caused by a lot of things, and sometimes it's just part of the picture. To get a better understanding of what's happening, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever had any problems with your bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Bladder… not that I know of. I had a little trouble holdin’ it when I was younger, after I had the babies, but that went away. Kidney problems… hmm. Doc told me somethin’ once, a long time ago, when I was sick with the flu, maybe? Somethin’ about my kidneys bein’ a little slow, but he didn't say it was serious. I forget what he said, exactly. I don't really remember much from doctors, to be honest. They always talk so fast.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s very common to not remember everything! We’ll try to piece things together. So, you had some temporary bladder issues after having children, which resolved on their own. And you recall a doctor mentioning something about slow kidneys at some point. Now, have you had any surgeries or major medical illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see... I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And…oh! I had a lump taken off my breast, years ago. A long, long time ago. They said it wasn't anything to worry about. Other than that… nothin’ I can think of. I was pretty healthy, for a long time. Until I started feelin' old, that is. Everything starts achin’ when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jimmi. That’s helpful. Tonsillectomy and a breast lump removal that was deemed non-serious. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but the doctor didn't say nothin' about allergies when he gave it to me. I ate everything as a kid, and never had a problem. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but that’s it. I ain't a delicate flower, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Jimmi. So, no known drug allergies, and just some occasional skin sensitivity. Now, let's talk about your medications. You mentioned taking something for your blood pressure. What’s the name of that medication, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now, I think it’s a little white pill. And it starts with a… an “A”? Or maybe a “T”? I give it to my daughter to refill it for me, so I don’t really pay attention. She handles all that stuff. I’m terrible with names and pills. It's somethin' I take every mornin', though. Just one. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jimmi. It’s common to have trouble remembering medication names. Don't worry about it. We can likely get the information from your pharmacy if we need to. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Do you have any family history of bladder problems, kidney disease, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my brother had… somethin’ with his heart, I think. He died when he was pretty young. Not from his heart, exactly, but he wasn't healthy. Nobody ever talked much about sickness in my family. It was just… bad luck, if somethin’ happened. We didn’t go to the doctor much, back then. Just stayed home and rested. I don't know much about family history, to be honest. Not much was ever said.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jimmi. So, a family history of high blood pressure and some heart issues in your brother. Okay. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I mostly stay home. I used to paint, but my hands get kinda shaky now. I like to watch TV, and talk to my daughter on the phone. I don't really… do much anymore. I eat pretty regular, but I shouldn't have as much sugar as I do. And I don't exercise, not really. Old age ain't for the faint of heart, that’s for sure. It slows you down.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open, Jimmi. It sounds like you enjoy spending time at home with your family, and that's lovely. Okay, I think I have a pretty good understanding of your situation now. If you're comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a simple check of your abdomen, and I’d like to take a look at the area you mentioned. It will just help me rule out any obvious causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, but… I just want this to stop, you know? Whatever it is. Go ahead, then. But be gentle, please. My skin is kinda thin these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go along. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then I’ll gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness. And finally, I’ll take a quick look at the area you mentioned. First, let's start by listening to your abdomen. This will just help me check for any unusual sounds. It might feel a little cool on your skin. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And another one…
PATIENT: It’s kinda cold. And…it tickles a little, I think. I don't usually like things touchin' me. My stomach's been feelin' a little funny lately, too. Not hurtin', exactly, but…just off. Like somethin's movin' around in there. I thought it was just old age, but…
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. It's helpful to know if anything is uncomfortable. The coolness and slight tickle are normal with the stethoscope. And you're right to mention the feeling of something "off" in your stomach. That’s good information. Alright, everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to gently press on different areas of your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. Does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit there, yeah. Not bad, but…sensitive. Like a little ache, maybe? Not all the time, just when you press on it. It’s kinda hard to explain. Like somethin's… swollen, maybe? But not big or anything. Just…full. It feels different than when I have gas, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jimmi. That’s very helpful. A localized tenderness, and a feeling of fullness that’s different from gas. Now, I'm going to gently examine the area you mentioned experiencing the leakage. Please let me know if this is uncomfortable in any way. Does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit. Not really pain, but…sensitive. And kinda…warm, maybe? Not feverish or anything, just… warmer than the rest of me. It’s kinda embarrassing, to have you touchin’ down there. But I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. Just be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I understand it's uncomfortable, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just checking for any obvious signs of inflammation or irritation. I do see a very slight redness in the area, which could explain the warmth and sensitivity you’re feeling. There doesn’t appear to be any significant discharge at the moment. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I have a few ideas about what might be going on.
PATIENT: Oh good. So? What is it? Is it serious? Am I gonna die? It’s probably just somethin’ old people get, right? Like arthritis or somethin’? I don’t want any fancy treatments or nothin’. Just make it stop, please.
DOCTOR: Jimmi, you are not going to die. It's definitely not something life-threatening. And you're right, it's likely something related to age-related changes. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it sounds like you might have a mild case of urinary stress incontinence, and possibly a mild urinary tract infection. The slight redness I saw could be from irritation caused by the incontinence, or a sign of the UTI. Urinary stress incontinence means that you're experiencing some leakage of urine when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or exert yourself. It’s common, especially after menopause, as the muscles that support the bladder weaken. The UTI would explain the feeling of fullness and the potential warmth you’ve been experiencing. However, to confirm this, I'd like to order a urine test. This will help us determine if you have an infection and rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Incon… what? And a what-ee test? You want a piece of my pee? That sounds kinda… awful. I don’t like people pokin’ around down there. And I don’t want any fancy procedures or nothin’. Just make it stop, like I said. Can’t you just give me somethin’ for it? Some pills or somethin’? I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to be comfortable again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Jimmi. You’re not a bother at all. And you are absolutely right – you deserve to be comfortable. Let me explain a little more. The "what-ee test" is a simple urine test. We just collect a small sample of your urine, and it tells us if there are any bacteria present, which would indicate an infection. It’s not invasive at all – you just go to the bathroom and collect it in a cup. No poking around, I promise. If it is a mild UTI, a short course of antibiotics would likely clear it up. That’s the “somethin’” I was thinking of. However, to be sure, we need to confirm the infection with the test. And even if it’s not an infection, the test can help rule out other possibilities. As for the incontinence, there are several non-invasive options we can try, such as pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle modifications. We can discuss those options after we get the test results. Would you be willing to try the urine test?
PATIENT: Ugh. I don't like it, but… I guess if you have to. I just want it over with. And I don't want any funny business. No poking, no prodding, just…a cup. Right? Where do I go? And what do I do with it? I ain't done nothin' like this before. And what if I can't… you know… go? I get nervous easy. Just tell me exactly what to do, step-by-step. And be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. No funny business, I promise. Just a simple cup. Here is a clean collection cup and these are the instructions. You’ll go to the bathroom – there’s one right down the hall. Before you go, please wash your hands thoroughly. Then, try to collect a mid-stream sample. That means you start urinating, and then collect a small amount in the cup about halfway through. You don't need to fill the whole cup, just about an ounce or two is fine. If you’re having trouble starting, just relax and take a few deep breaths. It’s okay if it takes a minute. And if you’re nervous, just focus on your breathing. Once you’ve collected the sample, carefully close the lid and bring it back to me. I’ll send it to the lab, and we should have the results back in a couple of days. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Mid-what-ee? This is all kinda confusing. And what if I mess it up? What if I spill it? Or what if I don't go at all? I told you, I get nervous easy. And… what if it's somethin' really bad? What if I have… cancer or somethin'? You just tell me if it's somethin' serious, okay? Don't sugarcoat it. I'd rather know the truth, even if it's bad. Just… please be honest with me.
DOCTOR: Jimmi, it’s perfectly alright to be nervous. It’s normal to feel anxious about things like this. And I understand your concerns. First, let's talk about the mid-stream sample. It just means collecting a small amount of urine after you’ve been urinating for a few seconds. This helps ensure we get a clean sample, and it’s not difficult at all. Just relax, and take your time. And to answer your concerns, it’s very unlikely to be something serious like cancer. The most common cause of these symptoms is a mild UTI or stress incontinence, which are easily treatable. I promise, I will be honest with you every step of the way. If the results come back with anything concerning, I will explain everything clearly and discuss all of your options. We’ll face this together, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… together. Alright, I guess I’ll go try. But if I mess it up, don't get mad at me, okay? And… remind me to wash my hands. I always forget things. Wish me luck.
DOCTOR: You got this, Jimmi. And don’t worry, I won’t get mad at all. Just take your time, and if you have any trouble, don’t hesitate to come back and ask for help. And yes, remember to wash your hands thoroughly before and after. I’ll be right here when you get back.
