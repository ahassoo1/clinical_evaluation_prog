DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this bruising, really. Seems to be happening more and more, and frankly, it’s unsettling. I’m on that medicine for my blood, you know, to thin it, and I’m starting to look like a plum. It’s just...not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: Right, the bruising. And you’re on a blood thinner… I see. Look, these things happen. It is normal with those medications. Still gotta figure out why it's happening more, though. More than usual, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, more than usual. I mean, I expected a little bit when I first started, but this…this is different. I bumped my arm on the doorframe just yesterday, a very gentle bump, and I’ve got a bruise the size of my hand already. I didn’t even think I would bruise. Before, a knock like that wouldn't have left a mark. And it's not just my arms, it's my legs too. It's ridiculous, honestly. Are you sure it’s just the medicine? Because frankly, I’ve always been quite careful.
DOCTOR: Careful, right. Well, “just” the medicine is a simplification. It could be something else. We have to rule things out. Okay, let's start with a quick history. Any other medications you're taking, besides the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Just the one, as far as I’m concerned. Doctor Ramirez prescribed it after the…well, after my wife passed. Said it was important. Honestly, I don’t see the need for so many pills these days, everyone's trying to get you on something. But Dr. Ramirez was very insistent. I take it every night, same dosage. No changes. I don't take anything else, vitamins, nothing. I eat pretty well, mostly. I try to, anyway. It's difficult living alone, you know? Makes cooking a bother.
DOCTOR: Right, one medication…for anxiety, I presume?
PATIENT: Anxiety? No, not exactly. It was for…irregular heartbeat. After my wife, you see, my…my nerves weren’t what they used to be. It caused a bit of a fluttering, Dr. Ramirez said it could be dangerous if left untreated. It’s…it's a long story. It’s not anxiety, exactly, though I suppose it started with that. It was for the palpitations. It's called… Propranolol, I think. A small dose. Honestly, I barely feel it doing anything at all.
DOCTOR: Propranolol… Okay. So, two medications. Now, family history. Anything with bleeding problems?
PATIENT: Bleeding problems? Not that I’m aware of. My mother…she had high blood pressure, but that's it. My father was perfectly healthy, stubborn as a mule, but healthy. Both of them lived well into their eighties. My wife…well, she had some trouble with her stomach, but it wasn’t a bleeding problem, just ulcers. Nothing like this, I assure you. We didn’t have much in the way of serious illness in the family, really. It’s probably this new doctor…overmedicating everyone. I swear, they just want to keep you coming back for more appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I need to take a look at these bruises, check your blood pressure, and listen to your heart. Just a standard check. Roll up your sleeves and lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examination table? Really? Must we? I haven’t been feeling particularly well lately, but I’m not about to be poked and prodded unnecessarily. Couldn’t you just… look at the bruises? I assure you, they're quite visible. But, if you insist... It’s just… a bit undignified, you know? For a man my age.
DOCTOR: Just need to listen to your heart and lungs, Mr. Farson. And I need to assess the bruises. It's part of the exam. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let me see those bruises on your arm. Roll up your sleeve all the way. I’ll document the size and location. Hmm. And on your legs. Any pain with palpation?
PATIENT: Palpation? Is that… poking? Yes, a little bit. It’s tender, naturally. It's a bruise! Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a specimen. And are you even looking properly? They’re all over! I’m sure I didn’t need to come to a doctor to be told I have bruises on my legs. This is… …a waste of my time, and frankly, rather demeaning. I feel as though you aren't taking my concerns seriously.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I'm documenting the findings. It's necessary. The bruising is extensive, bilateral on the lower extremities, varying sizes, some tenderness to palpation. Now, before we jump to conclusions, we need to rule out any underlying causes. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel. That will give us a better idea of what's going on. You’ll need to go to the lab downstairs. They’ll draw some blood. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, this is becoming quite the ordeal. Very well. Blood tests it is, I suppose. But I expect a full explanation of the results, Doctor. I don’t want any vague assurances or dismissive remarks. And I expect you to actually listen to my concerns this time. My wife always said doctors these days don't take the time to properly understand their patients. Fine. Blood tests. Let's get this over with. And tell me, Doctor, how long will these results take? I don't want to be waiting weeks.
DOCTOR: The lab should have the results back within 48-72 hours. They’ll call you if anything is urgent. The receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment when you check out. Here's the form. Go downstairs, and they'll take care of it. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? Well, there’s the matter of my time, Doctor. And my dignity, frankly. But, no. I think that’s quite enough for today. I’ll go and get this blood test done. I expect a thorough explanation, Doctor. A thorough one. And if it turns out to be nothing more than a side effect of these medications, I expect a sensible plan to manage it, not just a dismissive wave of the hand. Good day, Doctor. I sincerely hope this is the end of this ordeal.
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good day, Mr. Farson. .
