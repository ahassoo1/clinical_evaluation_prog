DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Wartick, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… well, it's a bit embarrassing, Doctor. Really. But I suppose that's what you're for, isn't it? It's… a problem. A delicate problem. And frankly, I haven't the faintest idea what to do about it. It’s… coming from him.
DOCTOR: "Him?
PATIENT: Yes, him. My… friend. He's been… discharging. A rather unpleasant fluid, I must say. And it's been going on for a few days now. It's… quite noticeable, Doctor. And not at all pleasant. I do hope it isn't anything… contagious. He's a very important person, you see.
DOCTOR: Contagious?
PATIENT: Well, one always wonders, doesn’t one? I mean, it’s just… proper hygiene, really. He's usually very particular, but this… this has thrown him off. He's terribly upset, naturally. And I'm concerned. It's… a yellowish colour, I believe. Not a bright yellow, more of a… dingy shade, if that makes sense. Though, truthfully, I didn’t get a terribly close look. It's just… rather distressing, the whole situation. Is it something serious, Doctor? Do we need… tests?
DOCTOR: “Mrs. Wartick, with all due respect, you’re being remarkably vague. Are you speaking about your discharge, or are you describing someone else’s condition?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness. Well, Doctor, I suppose I should have been clearer. It's his discharge. My… companion’s. It's not mine. Really, Doctor, I find your questions rather… indelicate. I'm simply seeking medical advice for a friend. A very close friend. Although, I can see how it’s… confusing. It’s not every woman my age who comes to a doctor about a man's… ailments. But he's too embarrassed to come himself, you understand. He’s a prominent figure in the community.
DOCTOR: “Right. A ‘friend.’ And this friend… is a male companion?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a male companion. A very close one. We've been… acquainted for quite some time. And yes, it's his anatomy that’s causing the… issue. Honestly, I'm not entirely certain what kind of issue it is, beyond the discharge, of course. He won't discuss it. He just keeps muttering about shame and… cleanliness. He is terribly fastidious, you see. I simply thought you might be able to… ascertain what’s wrong. Is it something that requires… special soaps? Or a specific ointment?
DOCTOR: “Mrs. Wartick, I need you to be direct with me. Is this friend experiencing any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… now that you mention it, he has been rather… irritable lately. And he’s been avoiding certain… activities. He keeps wincing, you see. And he’s definitely more… reserved than usual. Not that he’s a particularly demonstrative person to begin with, mind you. But he’s… quieter. And he flinches if I touch him in… certain places. Does that count as pain, Doctor? He simply says it’s… sensitive. Terribly sensitive. And he keeps washing himself. Constantly. It’s really quite exhausting, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: “Mrs. Wartick, is your ‘friend’ sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness. Doctor, really! That’s a terribly personal question! I… I don't believe it's proper for me to discuss such things. It's… private. Very private. And frankly, quite irrelevant. He's simply unwell, and I'm trying to get him help. It doesn't matter what he does in his… personal life, does it? I mean, a doctor should be concerned with the illness, not the… details. Honestly, I'm beginning to feel rather… uncomfortable. Is this standard procedure? Inquiring about a man's… habits? It's terribly unprofessional!
DOCTOR: “Mrs. Wartick, I am attempting to determine the cause of your friend’s discharge. Sexual activity is a crucial piece of information. It is not a matter of ‘habits,’ it is a medical necessity. If you continue to withhold relevant information, I cannot provide an accurate diagnosis or treatment plan. Is he sexually active, yes or no?
PATIENT: Oh, very well! If you must know… yes. He is. But honestly, Doctor, it's hardly the point! He's a grown man, perfectly capable of making his own decisions. And it’s… none of my business, really. I’m simply his… companion. I’m worried about his health, not his… activities. But if you insist on these… invasive questions, then yes, he has… recent activity. There. Are you satisfied now? Can we please get back to the discharge? It’s quite unpleasant, you see. And I'd like to know if it's contagious, as I mentioned before.
DOCTOR: “Does your friend practice safe sex?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness gracious, Doctor. You are relentless! I… I honestly don't know! How would I know about such things? I simply… accompany him. I don't oversee his… personal life! He's a grown man! Honestly, this is becoming quite… humiliating. Is it absolutely necessary to delve into such intimate details? I came here for medical advice, not a… interrogation. Is there not a cream, or a pill, or something you can prescribe without knowing the intricacies of his… relationships? I simply want him to feel better! And frankly, I’m beginning to question if this visit was a good idea.
DOCTOR: “Mrs. Wartick, I understand your discomfort. However, without a complete history, I cannot rule out sexually transmitted infections. It’s irresponsible of me to prescribe medication blindly. I need to know if he has any other symptoms—fever, chills, painful urination, sores, rash. Does he have any of those?
PATIENT: Oh… well, now that you mention it… he has been a bit warm lately. And he's been rather… off his appetite. Not eating much at all. And he complained about a slight… ache, a general malaise, he called it. He's also been… grumpy. More grumpy than usual, anyway. And… yes, I believe I did notice a tiny… spot on his skin. It’s rather small, almost unnoticeable, really. On his… lower abdomen. It wasn’t red, more of a… flesh-coloured bump, I suppose. But he dismissed it as… an insect bite. Is that important, Doctor? Is that what you’re asking about? Really, this is all rather distressing. I simply want him to be healthy, and I'm starting to feel as though I’m making everything worse!
DOCTOR: "Mrs. Wartick, I strongly suspect your friend has a sexually transmitted infection. I need to examine him directly to confirm this diagnosis. Will he allow me to conduct a physical examination?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. That… that’s… rather direct, isn’t it? A sexually transmitted… I mean, he would never! Well… he might. If you assured him it was absolutely confidential. And… discreet. He’s a prominent member of the community, you see. It would be… devastating if anyone found out. He’s terribly sensitive about… appearances. But… yes, I suppose he would allow it. If you were… gentle. And understanding. And promised not to tell anyone. Absolutely anyone. He’s a very private man. And he trusts me, of course. But… this is all very unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling indeed. Do you… do you have experience with… men of his stature?
DOCTOR: “Mrs. Wartick, confidentiality is paramount. I assure you, everything discussed here will remain strictly confidential. I have treated patients from all walks of life. Now, if he is willing, I need him to come in for an examination as soon as possible. I'll need a urine sample, and I may need to take swabs. The sooner we start treatment, the better. Do you think you can convince him to come in today?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I believe I can. He’ll be… reluctant, of course. But he trusts me, as I said. And he’s beginning to feel quite unwell. I’ll explain it’s for the best. And I’ll assure him of your… discretion. But… is it going to be terribly uncomfortable? And… will it be a long process? He has… commitments, you see. Important commitments. And I’m not certain how much he’s willing to… divulge. Perhaps if you could be as… brief as possible? And avoid asking too many… personal questions? He’s a very dignified man. Alright, I’ll speak with him. And we’ll… come in. But please, Doctor, be gentle. And discreet. It means a great deal to both of us. .
DOCTOR: “Very well, Mrs. Wartick. I’ll be ready when you arrive. And I assure you, I will do my best to make him comfortable. Please emphasize the importance of getting this addressed promptly.” .
