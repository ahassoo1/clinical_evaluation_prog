DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta, welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes, well, I need to get one of those cards… for driving. You know, the ride-share one. I want to keep working, and they said I need a medical check-up for it. It's a bit silly at my age, but what can you do?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the commercial driver's license thing. It is a bit much, frankly, but regulations are regulations. So, it’s not so much about feeling well, is it?
PATIENT: No, no, I feel fine, thank you very much. I just need the paper to prove it, I suppose. I've been driving logging equipment for… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years now! Still perfectly capable, I assure you. But they want the card for the little cars now too, just in case. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Still, a little paperwork never hurt anyone. Now, to be thorough – and to satisfy the licensing board, of course – let’s just go over a few things. Have you had any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. Well, my knees ache a bit more than they used to, especially after a long day. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? And I had a bit of a cold last winter, but nothing serious. Oh! And I switched my glasses prescription in March. That's about it, I think. Is that what you mean by changes?
DOCTOR: Alright, knees, cold, glasses… good. Just trying to cover all bases. Now, have you been diagnosed with anything at all, ever?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… well, years ago, back in… 1985, I think it was, I had a bout of really bad acid reflux. The doctor put me on some medication for it, and it cleared right up. And… oh, and I had my gallbladder out in '92. Other than that… nothing major, I don't believe. I’ve been very lucky, you see. Good genes, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. And is anyone in your family… prone to any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, later in life. And my brother, on my father’s side, he had diabetes. He wasn’t very careful with his sweets, you see. My father was as strong as an ox until the very end, though. And my grandmother… she lived to be ninety-eight! So, you know, a bit of both, really. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is… information. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, now and then. It’s called… let me see… Celecoxib. I don't take it every day, only when my knees are really bothering me. And sometimes, just a little antacid, if I eat something spicy. That's it, really. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat. My mother always said, “Everything in moderation.” I’ve never had a reaction to anything, to my knowledge. That's a blessing, isn't it? I've seen enough people suffer with allergies to appreciate a clear bill of health in that department.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. It won’t be anything extensive. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I'm quite used to check-ups, you know. Been driving professionally for so long, they make you do them all the time. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you'll just sit up here. First, let's take your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Sounds clear, no unusual noises. Now, reflexes… Good reflexes. Everything seems alright, physically.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't so bad, was it? I told you I was fine. So, does that mean I get my card? I really need to get back to work, you see. My customers are expecting me.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Sciarrotta, everything seems within normal limits for someone your age. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, and to satisfy the licensing requirements, I'd like to order a basic blood workup. Just to rule out anything concerning. It’s a simple precaution. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work? Is that really necessary? I haven't had a proper blood test in… well, decades. I suppose if you think it's best... but it's a bit of a hassle, you see. Where do I go to get that done? And how long will it take? I really don't want to be off work for too long.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Sciarrotta. The lab is right across the hall. They’ll need to draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take more than an hour, including the wait time. Once I have the results – which usually takes a couple of days – we can discuss them and finalize your medical card. It’s a small inconvenience for peace of mind, and for fulfilling the requirements. They will send the results directly to me. Would you like me to write you a requisition form?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A requisition form, then. Yes, please. A couple of days, you say? Hmm… I suppose I can manage. But please, hurry if you can, Doctor. My customers will be wondering where I am. And is there anything else? I’d rather get this all sorted out quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Take this to the lab. They’ll take care of everything. Once I receive the results, my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and sign off on your form. Now, if you don't mind, I have other patients waiting. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s all, I think. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… thoroughness. I’ll go to the lab right away, then. Hopefully, it won't be too much of a delay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mrs. Sciarrotta.
