DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, lately I does be feelin' real thirsty, always wantin' a drink. And I feel hungry all the time too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just... don't seem right.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Thirsty and hungry, even after eating. And how long have you been experiencing this, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... maybe about a month now? It start gradual, but it gettin' worse each week. I just thought it was the heat, you know? It hot, hot, hot these days. But it not seem to be goin' away with the coolin' breeze.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm... well, I does be goin' to the bathroom more often than usual. Especially at night. Wakin' me up sometimes. And I feel a little tired, even when I sleep enough. Not sick tired, just… draggy. Is that a change? I not sure what all would be a change, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, particularly at night, and some fatigue. Alright. Have you had any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not that I notice. I always have to have my glasses on, you know, since I was a little girl. But they workin' the same as always. Everything blurry if I take them off, same old, same old. You mean like... is everything gettin' more blurry? No, not really.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, I don't think so. If anything, I feel like I might have put on a little weight lately, always snackin' 'cause I hungry. My husband says my clothes feel a little tighter, but that could just be the heat too, you know? Everything swellin' up in this weather.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any family history of… diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Let me see... my mother's sister, Auntie Pearl, she did have somethin' with sugar. She used to take shots, a long time ago. But that was a long time ago, and she live real far away. I don't know much about it, really. It was before my time when she got sick. She pass away years ago, though.
DOCTOR: I see. And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, Doctor. Just some tablets for my pressure, you know, keepin' it down. And sometimes I take a pain reliever for my back, when it actin' up. But that's it, really. Just those two. I try to stay away from too much medicine, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Hypertension medication and pain relievers as needed. Now, Ms. Zicarelli, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam and possibly order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sound good. Whatever you think best. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel normal again, you know? Do whatever you need to do. Blood work is alright, and exam too. I ready when you is ready.
DOCTOR: Good. Let’s start with your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. Then we’ll do a brief neurological check and listen to your heart and lungs. Please relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I relaxin'. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. It hot in here though, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Now, I'd like to check your blood sugar.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That little pinch didn't bother me none. It just a small one. So? What you seein'? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Your blood sugar is quite elevated, Ms. Zicarelli – 210 milligrams per deciliter. This, combined with your symptoms—increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue—strongly suggests the possibility of diabetes mellitus. We need to confirm this with further blood tests, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and possibly a hemoglobin A1c.
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. Auntie Pearl... Is it somethin' real bad, Doctor? Will I have to take shots too? I just don't like needles, you know. And I already told you, I try to stay away from medicine if I can. Is there… other ways?
DOCTOR: Diabetes, if properly managed, is not necessarily “real bad,” Ms. Zicarelli, but it is serious. It requires lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – and, potentially, medication. The type of medication and the need for insulin, which is administered by injection, depends on the severity of your condition and how well you respond to other treatments. We need to get those blood tests back before we can determine the best course of action. I’m ordering the tests now. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours before you come back. I'll have the lab send you a slip with instructions. And I suggest you begin reducing your sugar intake immediately.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I understand. Eight hours fastin'... and less sugar. I can try. My husband, he does the cookin' anyway, maybe I can ask him to help. But these shots... is there really no other way? I just don't like needles, you know? And I worried 'bout all the other medicine too, with the side effects and everything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Zicarelli, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We haven’t even confirmed the diagnosis yet. If, and only if, the tests confirm diabetes, we will discuss all available treatment options thoroughly. Some cases can be managed with diet and exercise alone, or with oral medications. However, I’m not going to make promises. Here is the lab slip. Please schedule your appointment as soon as possible. I have a very busy schedule, so please don't delay. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all for now. Thank you for seein' me. I'll get the tests done as soon as I can, and I'll try my best with the sugar. Is it alright if I ask my husband to come with me next time? Just for support, you know. He's good with numbers and askin' questions.
DOCTOR: That is… acceptable. Good day, Ms. Zicarelli.
