DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a family thing, honestly. My mother… she had a lot of problems, heart problems mostly. And her mother before that. It’s just… I’d like to know I’m not heading down the same path, you know? Get some reassurance, I suppose. I try to eat well and exercise, but… genetics, right? It’s always looming.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible thing to do, Blain. It's good you're thinking proactively about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems. We can definitely explore that and see what steps we can take to assess your risk and keep you healthy. To start, could you tell me a little more about the specific heart problems your mother and grandmother experienced?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, my mother… she had high blood pressure for years. She didn’t really take care of herself, to be honest. Lots of processed food, didn't move much. Eventually she had… something called angina, I think? Chest pain. Then she had a… a blockage, I believe. Needed a stent, and then… well, she didn’t recover well from that. My grandmother… it was similar, but before they had stents, so… it wasn’t good. Lots of swelling in her legs, and shortness of breath. It all seemed… preventable, if they’d just… looked after themselves better. Does that make sense? I'm not a doctor, obviously.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Blain. Thank you for sharing that. Knowing the specifics like angina and the blockage is helpful, and understanding the progression in your grandmother's case gives us a good starting point. So, high blood pressure and potential blockages seem to be the main concerns in your family. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or had any issues with chest pain or shortness of breath yourself?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve had my blood pressure checked at the dentist, and it was always… normal, I think. Maybe a little high sometimes, but the dentist always said it was just white coat syndrome. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. I get a little winded climbing stairs sometimes, but I’m… fairly slender, so I figure it’s just a lack of muscle. I do try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, lots of vegetables, lean protein. Not much fast food, though I confess I enjoy a good dessert now and then. It's just… I worry.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Blain. No personal history of those symptoms is reassuring. And it’s smart to be mindful of your diet, even with occasional treats! "White coat syndrome" is common, so occasional elevated readings at the dentist wouldn’t necessarily be cause for alarm. To get a clearer picture, let’s do a quick review of your general health. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. No food allergies, no drug allergies… I'm pretty sure. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes, but that’s just seasonal. I had a tetanus shot a few years ago when I cut myself gardening, and that was fine. I haven’t really been sick sick in years, just the occasional cold. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I don't want to waste your time listing things I haven’t got.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Blain. No known allergies is good. And it's perfectly fine that you're only listing what's relevant—we're just trying to cover all the bases. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I’ve always been healthy enough to not need anything, and frankly, I'm a bit skeptical of relying on medication unless it’s absolutely necessary. Vitamins occasionally, but that’s it. A multivitamin, sometimes. I try to get most of what I need from my diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional vitamins. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I’m an engineering teacher, postsecondary. So, I spend a lot of time on my feet, demonstrating things, and a fair amount of time in front of a computer, grading papers and preparing lectures. It’s… reasonably active, I suppose. I live alone. Divorced a few years back. No kids. I try to get some exercise, I go for walks a few times a week, and I’ve recently started doing some light weightlifting at the gym. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Nothing excessive. Is that… enough detail? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Blain, and not at all like an interrogation! It gives me a good sense of your daily life. Being on your feet a lot is good, and starting weightlifting is a great addition. The occasional glass of wine and no smoking are also positive. Just to complete the picture, do you have a family history of any other medical conditions besides heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother’s brother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. He wasn’t very good at taking care of himself either. And my grandmother on my father’s side… she had arthritis, really bad. She was in a wheelchair for the last few years of her life. And my father… he had high cholesterol, but he managed it with diet and exercise. Nothing too serious. Overall, it’s mostly heart problems and a bit of diabetes and arthritis. Not a particularly healthy bunch, to be honest. I try to be the exception.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Blain. The diabetes and arthritis are helpful to note. It sounds like you're very aware of the family tendencies, and proactive about making healthy choices. Alright. I think I have a good understanding of your overall health and family history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and check your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have lectures to prepare, you know. But yes, go ahead. Just… please don't poke too much. I’m not particularly fond of being prodded.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Blain. I’ll be as efficient and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I’ll also take a quick look at your throat and ears, and palpate your thyroid. It should only take a few minutes. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, blood pressure is 130/80. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Heart sounds are normal—no murmurs, clicks, or rubs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat looks clear. Ears are normal as well. Thyroid feels normal size and consistency, no nodules detected. Everything sounds and looks good so far. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we’ll want to monitor, but it could be situational. It’s good you're proactive about your health. Given your family history, I recommend we do some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. We should also consider an EKG to get a baseline of your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. An EKG… I’ve heard of those. And blood work is… well, unavoidable, I suppose. Cholesterol and blood sugar… yes, that makes sense, given the family history. Kidney function… why kidney function? Is that something I should be worried about? I don’t have any problems with my kidneys. I haven't noticed anything unusual. But yes, fine. Do the tests. I just… I don’t want a lot of unnecessary poking and prodding. And I'd appreciate it if you could explain the results to me in plain English, not a lot of medical jargon. I don’t pretend to be a doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain. No unnecessary tests, I assure you. We check kidney function because diabetes and high blood pressure can sometimes affect the kidneys, and it's good to have a complete picture. And I completely understand your concern about jargon—I will explain everything in plain English, as if I were talking to a friend. The blood work will require a simple blood draw. The EKG is a painless test where we attach some electrodes to your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes only a few minutes. Let me get the lab orders entered and the EKG scheduled for you. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol wipes?
PATIENT: No. No allergies to either. I used latex gloves when I was gardening last year, and I clean my glasses with alcohol wipes all the time. Everything is fine. Just… get it over with quickly, please. I really do have lectures to prepare, and I’m starting to fall behind. I appreciate you explaining everything, though. That’s… helpful. I just… don’t like being in doctors’ offices. It makes me anxious. Is there anything else I need to do before we get started? Any forms to fill out? Anything?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Blain. I’ll make it as quick and efficient as possible. No unnecessary forms – you’re already in the system. Here's the lab order. You can go to the lab just down the hall, and they'll take care of the blood draw. The EKG technician is right next door, and they're expecting you. Once you've had the tests done, you can come back and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. It typically takes a few days for the lab results to come back. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… the lab is down the hall, the EKG next door, and then come back. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. It’s just… I don’t enjoy these things. I'll see you when the results are back. Hopefully, everything is fine.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Blain. And don’t worry, we’ll get through this. If anything comes up before your follow-up, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and try not to stress too much.
