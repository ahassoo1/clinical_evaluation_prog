DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It’s… my stomach. It’s been puffed up, alright? Feels like I swallowed a balloon. Honestly, I don't have time for a lot of questions. Just… bloated.
DOCTOR: Bloated, alright. And how long has this “balloon” been inflated, so to speak?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don’t know exactly. A few weeks, maybe? Honestly, things have been… a blur since my wife passed. Dates aren’t exactly top of mind, you know? It just… started happening. It’s uncomfortable, mostly. And it doesn’t look good.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly…disrupt things. A few weeks of bloating. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Worse after I eat, I think. Though, honestly, everything makes it worse. I don’t really… enjoy food anymore. It just feels like fuel, you know? And then this happens. It’s a whole thing.
DOCTOR: Worse after eating. And you've noticed a decreased appetite as well?
PATIENT: Decreased appetite? Yeah, that's a nice way of putting it. I barely eat. Like I said, it's not exactly… enjoyable anymore. Look, is this going to take long? I got a job to get to. Pile driving doesn’t exactly wait for a stomach ache.
DOCTOR: Right, pile driving. Demanding work. Alright, Mr. Kristofik, I'll try to be efficient. But I do need some information to rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Look, doc, I’m not here to discuss… that. Is it something serious? Because if it's not, I really need to go. I don't see how that relates to feeling like I’m going to float away.
DOCTOR: It could be something serious, which is why I ask. Changes in bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, anything different than usual – can point to several things. Ignoring it won't make it go away. And frankly, dismissing basic questions doesn't help me help you. Now, can you answer a simple question?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Look, things are… slower. Okay? Constipated, if you have to use fancy words. Happy now? It's not exactly a topic I enjoy discussing, and honestly, I've got better things to worry about. Now, can we get to the part where you tell me if I need surgery or something?
DOCTOR: Constipated. Alright. And any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Look, I said constipated, not… bleeding! Seriously, doc, are you trying to scare me? I just feel bloated and uncomfortable, not… dying. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I am not trying to scare you. I am trying to gather information. Blood in the stool is a symptom of several things, some of which are serious, and it is a relevant question. Now, a straightforward yes or no will suffice. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Look, can we please just… skip the interrogation? I’m a grown man, I know when I’m bleeding. It’s not happening, alright? This is a waste of my time, and frankly, it's a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Insulting, you say. Very well. Let’s move on. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No vomiting. Sometimes I feel a bit sick to my stomach, but I haven’t actually… thrown up. It’s just… a general feeling of unpleasantness. Like everything’s just… off. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me if it’s something I need to worry about, or am I going to be here all day answering personal questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. No vomiting, occasional nausea. And any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Probably. I haven't really been… keeping track. Haven't been eating much, like I said. Clothes might be a little looser, I don't know. Honestly, I haven't stepped on a scale in months. Is this actually going to lead somewhere, or are we just fishing for… problems?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a feel. I'm going to press on your stomach. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Hmm. Some distension here, and a little tenderness… not acutely painful, but present. Any pain radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, it's tender. Especially down there, on both sides. Doesn't radiate, exactly, just… feels uncomfortable when you press on it. Look, I already told you, it's bloated. What does poking me prove?
DOCTOR: It helps me assess the cause of the bloating, Mr. Kristofik. I'm listening for bowel sounds now… They’re a bit sluggish. Alright. Given your symptoms – bloating, constipation, decreased appetite, weight loss, sluggish bowel sounds, and tenderness – it could be several things. Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a possibility, but given the weight loss and sluggish bowel sounds, we need to rule out other issues.
PATIENT: Rule out other issues? Like what?! What are you trying to tell me, doc? This is starting to sound serious. Look, I’m a pile driver, not a hypochondriac. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: It could be something as simple as a dietary issue, or stress. But given your recent loss, and the other symptoms, we need to consider things like a possible blockage, or—and I'm not trying to alarm you—something more serious like colon cancer. That’s why I’m recommending some tests. We’ll need a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for blood and infection. And, frankly, I think a colonoscopy is warranted, given your age and symptoms.
PATIENT: Colonoscopy?! Are you serious?! Look, I’m not sticking a camera up my… there. No way. I’m a busy man, I don’t have time for… procedures. I just want a pill! Something to fix the bloating, and then I can get back to work. This is ridiculous. I think I need a second opinion.
DOCTOR: A pill won’t address the underlying issue, Mr. Kristofik. Dismissing a colonoscopy based on discomfort is… unwise, given your symptoms and family history. I’m not attempting to cause alarm, but we need to be thorough. While I respect your right to seek a second opinion, I strongly advise against delaying a proper investigation. I can provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist, if you wish. They can discuss the risks and benefits of a colonoscopy in more detail. But ignoring this won’t make it go away.
PATIENT: Look, I… fine. A referral. Fine. Just… give me the name and number. And honestly, doc, you could try being a little less… condescending. I'm not stupid, I just don't want to spend my life in a doctor's office. This whole thing is just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a gastroenterologist at City General Hospital. She's excellent. Her number and address are on the slip. She will explain the procedure in detail, and you can make an informed decision. As for my tone, I apologize if it came across as… condescending. I simply want to ensure you receive the best possible care, and that requires a thorough assessment. It’s my job to ask these questions. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's it. Honestly, I just want to get out of here. Thank you… I guess. I really need to get to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest, and follow up with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. And, Mr. Kristofik... please, take care of yourself.
