DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure. Well, I've been havin' a bit o' trouble lately with mornin' sickness, funnily enough. I know it sounds daft for a man o' my age, but there it is. It's been goin' on for a few weeks now, and the nurse thought I should come see ye, seein' as my heart's not the strongest, ye ken?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Benic. It's certainly unusual, but not impossible, to experience symptoms similar to morning sickness. And it’s good that the nurse flagged your heart condition – we’ll definitely keep that in mind. Just to clarify, when you say "morning sickness," could you describe what you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. It's not like the ladies I've known describe, mind ye. It's more… a queasy feelin', right when I wake up. And then I usually get sick, just a wee bit, nothin' major. It doesn't last all day, thankfully. Just that first hour or so. And it’s happened near every mornin' for the past three weeks, I'd say. I’ve been tryin' to eat somethin' small before bed, a biscuit or a piece o' toast, but it doesn't always help.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea and occasional vomiting upon waking, for about three weeks now. You've tried a small bedtime snack with limited success. Do you notice anything specifically triggering it, or making it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't think so, not really. I've tried different things for breakfast, different teas, different amounts o' sleep... it doesn't seem to matter. It just… happens. Sometimes it’s worse if I lie flat, I think. I usually need to sit up for a bit before it gets better, even if it's just to feel a wee bit less awful. I haven’t changed nothin' in my routine, not that I'm aware of, anyhow. It just started one mornin' and hasn't really gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this nausea and vomiting?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it… I've been feelin' a bit more breathless than usual, especially when I'm walkin' up the stairs. I just put it down to gettin' older, to be honest, but it's been worse lately. And my ankles have been a bit swollen in the evenings. Not terribly, mind ye, but definitely noticeable. Oh, and I've been feelin' tired, a right bit tired, but I've always been a bit o' a napper, so I didn't think much o' that either. Is that… important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Benic, that is important. Breathlessness, ankle swelling, and increased fatigue, in addition to the nausea… these things together are definitely worth investigating, especially given your history of heart issues. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust yer judgement. I’ve not been feelin’ myself lately, so anything ye think's worth lookin' at, I'm happy to oblige. I’ll just… unbutton my shirt a wee bit, shall I?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Just breathe normally. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your pulse is regular, but a bit on the slow side. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which we’ve noted before, but it does seem a little more pronounced today. And yes, there is some swelling in both ankles, with some pitting edema. Given these findings, and your reported symptoms, I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, I want to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. We’ll also do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and an echocardiogram to get a more detailed look at your heart structure and function. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. And I appreciate it. It all sounds a bit frightenin', to be honest, but I trust ye know what yer doin'. If it’ll get to the bottom o' this, then I'm all for it. Tests are fine. Just… try not to make a fuss if I'm a wee bit nervous when it comes time for them? I've never been a fan o' doctors, if I’m bein’ honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Benic. We’ll take things at your pace. I understand your apprehension, and we'll explain everything as we go. There’s no need to be nervous – we’ll just gather some information to help us understand what’s going on. The nurse will come in shortly to draw some blood. The EKG is quick and painless – just some stickers placed on your chest. And we can schedule the echocardiogram for next week. It's a non-invasive ultrasound of the heart. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a medication to help with the nausea. It's called Metoclopramide. It can help to speed up digestion and reduce the feeling of sickness. Start with 10mg three times a day, and let me know if you experience any side effects.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… manageable, thankfully. Metoclopramide, ye say? I’ll write that down. And thank ye for explainin' everything so clearly, Doctor. It does ease my mind a bit, knowin' what to expect. I'll try and keep a good note o' any side effects. I suppose there’s no gettin' away from side effects, is there? It's always somethin' or other. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse, then? And try not to worry too much? Easier said than done, mind ye.
DOCTOR: Indeed, it often is something or other. But we’ll address any side effects as they arise. And you're right to try not to worry, though it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. Yes, just relax and wait for the nurse. She'll be in shortly to draw your blood. We’ll also schedule that echocardiogram before you leave. I'll review the test results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss a plan from there. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – particularly if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand, Doctor. Chest pain, shortness o' breath, dizziness… straight to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. I’ve a good friend who lives nearby, I can ask him to take me if need be. Thank ye again for yer time, Doctor Abady. Ye've been most helpful. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. And try to stay calm. .
