DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s been… a bit of a struggle lately. I just… don’t feel right. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I haven’t eaten much. And I fill up so fast when I do eat. It's… frustrating, to say the least. It’s hard to keep anything down, and then I don’t have the energy for… well, for much of anything. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things. It all just feels… muddled.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite distressing, and you’re not needing to apologize at all. It's perfectly alright if it's difficult to put into words. We'll take our time and try to figure things out. So, you’ve been experiencing nausea and feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food, and this is accompanied by a lack of energy. Has this been happening for a specific length of time – perhaps a few weeks, months?
PATIENT: Oh… months, I think. Yes, months now. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, everything just… faded in, you know? Like a slow mist. It wasn’t sudden. And it’s gotten… worse, definitely worse recently. I used to be able to at least try to eat a little something, but now… it’s just getting harder and harder. My appetite isn’t what it used to be, either. Not that I eat a lot normally, but… even less now. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. A gradual onset like that is very helpful information. So, it began months ago, worsening over time, with a decrease in appetite alongside the nausea and early fullness. Could you describe the nausea for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not always like a violent sickness, you know? Sometimes it's just a queasy feeling, like something’s off. Other times it’s… stronger. It comes in waves, really. And it doesn’t always mean I throw up, thankfully. But it’s always there, sort of… lurking. And it makes me not even want to eat, which… I suppose makes things worse. It’s hard to describe. It’s just… unpleasant. Really unpleasant. And sometimes it’s worse in the mornings, I think. But not always. Honestly, everything feels a bit blurry. I apologize. I’m not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Kelder. It’s important for me to get a full picture, and you're describing things very clearly. It sounds like the nausea is variable – sometimes a queasy feeling, sometimes stronger, and not always resulting in vomiting. It also seems to be worse at times, possibly in the mornings. That is very useful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this – anything like bloating, abdominal pain, changes in your bowel habits, unintentional weight loss, or fatigue beyond what we've already discussed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Weight loss… yes, I think so. My clothes are a little looser, aren’t they? I hadn’t really thought much about it, but… yes. And… fatigue. Oh, yes, definitely more tired than usual. Even getting out of the chair is a struggle sometimes. And… Bloating, maybe? My stomach feels… full and tight a lot, even when I haven’t eaten. And… oh dear. I think I go to the bathroom… less often. Not diarrhea or anything, just… less. Is that making sense? I apologize, I keep rambling. I just… my mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. Kelder. This is all very important, and you’re doing a wonderful job. So, to summarize: you've experienced weight loss, increased fatigue, bloating, and a decrease in bowel frequency alongside the nausea, early fullness, and decreased appetite. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of – anything you've been diagnosed with or treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I had my gallbladder out… a long time ago. And… arthritis, I suppose. It’s in my hands mostly. It flares up sometimes, makes it hard to… well, do things. And… Oh, there was something else. Cancer… yes. I had cancer a few years back. Breast cancer. They… did things. Surgery and… other things. I'm… vague on the details. It was a difficult time, and I try not to dwell on it. But… yes, cancer. Is that what you were asking? I hope I’m not confusing you. It all feels so long ago.
DOCTOR: You’re not confusing me at all, Ms. Kelder. Thank you for sharing that information with me. It’s important for me to have a complete understanding of your medical history. So, you’ve had your gallbladder removed, arthritis, and a history of breast cancer that was treated with surgery and other therapies. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with the breast cancer, and what types of treatments you received?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was… I think… about five years ago? Maybe six? It all feels like a blur. They did surgery, of course. A lumpectomy, I think. And then… radiation. Yes, radiation for a while. And… pills. Lots of pills. Tamoxifen, I think that was one of them. And… Oh, there were side effects. Fatigue, mostly. And… nausea. Yes, I remember being very nauseous. It was… a difficult time. I don't remember all the details, though. The doctors told me what was going on, but… my memory isn't what it used to be. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. I just… can't recall everything. It feels so long ago.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. You've been through a lot, and it's completely understandable that you wouldn't remember every detail. You mentioned a lumpectomy, radiation, and Tamoxifen approximately five to six years ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take… this one for my arthritis. It’s called… meloxicam, I think. And… a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I was low on it. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains. That’s about it, I think. No, wait… I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a while ago. He said it was getting too low. But… that’s about it. Just the meloxicam, vitamin D, and occasional Tylenol. Is that helpful? I hope I’m not forgetting anything. My mind is just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Kelder. So, you’re currently taking meloxicam for arthritis, a vitamin D supplement, and occasionally Tylenol for aches and pains. You previously took medication for high blood pressure but are no longer on it. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. No food allergies, no allergies to bee stings or anything like that. And… I don’t think I’m allergic to any medications. I’ve taken a lot of different things over the years, and never had a problem. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. But… no, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I hope I’m not forgetting anything. My mind is… well, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Kelder. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history… My mother… she had heart problems. She passed away when I was young. And… my grandmother, on my father’s side, she had… something with her stomach. Ulcers, maybe? I don’t really remember. And… My sister… she had cancer too. Lung cancer. A few years ago. It… wasn't good. But… that’s about all I can remember. My family wasn't very good at talking about health problems. It was just… not something we did. So… I don’t have a lot of information. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. But… that’s about all I know. It feels like a long time ago, and… well, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. You’ve shared valuable information. Your mother had heart problems, your grandmother had stomach issues, and your sister had lung cancer. It’s understandable that you don’t have a lot of details. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I would like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… want to feel better. I’m tired of feeling sick all the time. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. I appreciate your trust. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. After that, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t hear any murmurs. Your lung sounds are clear, though a bit diminished in the lower lobes, which can be normal with age. Now, I’m going to check your ears… Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums appear normal. Your nose and throat are clear as well. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… a little. Right there… on the right side. It’s not… sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And… It feels… tight. Like something is swollen. But… it's hard to explain. It just feels… off. And… Yes, definitely uncomfortable. Not terrible, but… not good either. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. It’s hard to describe. But… yes, right there on the right side. That’s where it hurts.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’m noting tenderness in your right upper quadrant. That, combined with the nausea, early fullness, weight loss, and history of cancer, is concerning. I don't feel any obvious masses at this time, but there is some mild guarding when I press in that area. Your abdomen is slightly distended, but not significantly. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a gallbladder issue, even though you had it removed years ago, as complications can sometimes arise. It could also be related to your history of breast cancer, or something entirely new. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound. The blood tests will help assess your liver function, and the ultrasound will give us a better look at your gallbladder, liver, and other abdominal organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I’m tired of feeling sick and not knowing why. Blood tests and an ultrasound… yes, please. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s wrong. Will it take long to get the results? And… what happens if it is something serious? I’m… a little scared, to be honest. I’ve been through a lot, and I don’t know if I have the strength for much more.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be scared, Ms. Kelder. You’ve been through a lot, and it’s natural to feel anxious when something new arises. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood tests and ultrasound are relatively quick. The blood tests can be done here in the clinic today, and the ultrasound can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. The results should be back within a few days. As for what happens if it is something serious… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If something is found, we’ll discuss all your options and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. We have a wonderful team of specialists here, and we’ll ensure you receive the best possible care. You’re not alone in this. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I’m going to write you a requisition for the blood tests, and my nurse will schedule the ultrasound for you before you leave. In the meantime, are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: No… not terrible pain. Just… discomfort. Like a dull ache in my right side, and… a feeling of fullness. Even when I haven’t eaten much. And… sometimes a little nausea. It comes and goes. It’s not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like something is swollen, maybe? I don’t know. It’s hard to explain. But… it's manageable, I guess. I can get through it. But… it’s always there, lurking in the background. Thank you, Doctor. For listening. And… for being so kind. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It's my job to listen and provide the best possible care. I’m glad I could offer some reassurance. To summarize, we've ordered blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound to investigate the cause of your nausea, early fullness, weight loss, and right upper quadrant discomfort. My nurse will schedule the ultrasound for you before you leave, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, if your pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, chills, or jaundice, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. And… thank you again for listening. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on, even if it is scary. I guess… I’ll just wait for the results. And… try not to worry too much. Thank you. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It was my pleasure. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your ultrasound. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon.
