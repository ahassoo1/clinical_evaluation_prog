DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. I'm Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Voytek, nice to meet you too. Um, well, I’ve just been getting the chills, and it's been happening on and off for a few days now. It’s a little annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days of chills… Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They don’t really come with a fever, at least not one I’ve noticed. Just… cold. Like, suddenly really cold, even if I’m warm. And sometimes I feel a little shaky when it happens. It’s not constant, you know? It’ll happen, then go away for a bit, then come back. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I've been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t? I haven't had a cough or a sore throat, no aches or anything like that. Just the chills and feeling a bit worn out. Maybe a little bit of a headache yesterday, but it wasn't bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say tired, is it more than just your usual end-of-day tiredness?
PATIENT: Yeah, a bit more than usual, I think. Like, I could nap for hours and still feel… not quite right. It's hard to explain. Just… sluggish. It's not like I'm completely knocked out, but I don't have much energy, you know? It makes it hard to get things done, even simple stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get a few more details. Have you noticed anything that makes the chills worse or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I don’t think so, not really. It doesn’t seem to matter if I’m inside or outside, or what I’m doing. It just… happens. Maybe if I'm really stressed it feels a little worse, but I'm always a bit stressed, to be honest. Does that make sense? I haven't tried anything specific to make it better, I just try to ignore it and keep going.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask some general questions, just to get a broader picture. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. Is there anything specific I should be thinking about? Sometimes I forget these things…
DOCTOR: No, just checking. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I really try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I'll take a painkiller if I really need it, but that’s about it. No vitamins, no regular prescriptions, nothing like that. I try to eat healthy and get enough sleep, so I don't usually need much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that's about it. Nothing major since then. No broken bones, no serious diseases… Just the usual colds and flu, you know? I'm pretty healthy, usually. I mean, apart from these chills!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Do you mean like, any family history of illnesses? I guess my mom had some trouble with her heart when she was older, but nothing I really worried about when I was younger. My dad was pretty healthy all his life. I don't really know much about my grandparents' medical history, to be honest. We weren’t very close. Is there something specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries. Just trying to get a full picture. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, definitely not. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol - maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, that’s it. And I absolutely don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I try to be really careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Finally, and this might seem a little personal, but is there anything going on in your life right now that's particularly stressful or causing you anxiety?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yeah, a little bit. I got divorced about six months ago, so things are still… settling down. It’s been a bit rough, to be honest. Trying to get used to being on my own, you know? It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely added some stress to my life. Work's okay, but juggling everything is a bit much sometimes. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Stress can definitely contribute to these kinds of symptoms. Alright, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Lymph nodes are normal, no swelling. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Ears and throat look clear, no signs of infection. Okay. So, everything seems physically normal at the moment. It's hard to say what's causing the chills without more information, but given your recent life changes and the lack of other symptoms, it could be related to stress and anxiety. However, we can’t rule out other possibilities. I want to order some basic bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – just to get a baseline and see if there's anything else going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Bloodwork sounds good. I'd rather be safe than sorry. Will I need to fast before the test?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the test. That means no food or drinks other than water. I'll give you a lab slip with detailed instructions. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. Once you have the results, you can have them sent directly to the clinic, or you can bring them with you when you come back for a follow-up. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that’s pretty clear, thank you. 8-12 hours, no food or drinks except water. I can definitely do that. And they can send the results straight to the clinic, that’s easier. Is there anything else I need to do or know right now? Should I be looking out for any specific symptoms in the meantime?
DOCTOR: Okay. For now, just monitor your symptoms. If you develop a fever, cough, shortness of breath, or any severe pain, please call the clinic immediately or go to the emergency room. Otherwise, try to manage your stress as much as possible – whatever that looks like for you. Things like exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones can be helpful. We’ll review the bloodwork results when they come back, and we can discuss further options at that time. I’m scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, on August 16th, at 10:00 AM. Does that time work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, August 16th at 10:00 AM is perfect. Thank you so much, Dr. Voytek. I feel a lot better just having talked it through and knowing we’re checking things out. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care.
