DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. All the time. Especially after I eat. It’s just… unpleasant. And frankly, a waste of my day having to deal with it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. I apologize for any inconvenience this is causing you, and I assure you I'll do my best to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. When you say “stuff coming up,” could you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Honestly, it looks like… food. Undigested food. And sometimes… well, stomach acid, I guess. It burns a bit. It's not… pretty. I eat a perfectly good meal, and then a few minutes later, it’s trying to make a second appearance. It’s embarrassing, to be frank. A man shouldn't have to worry about this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Altine. It certainly sounds unpleasant and disruptive. Experiencing undigested food returning shortly after eating, along with stomach acid, is something we need to investigate. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me about when this started?
PATIENT: When did it start? Hmm. That's a good question. It wasn't sudden, you know? It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe six months ago? A little longer? It was just occasional at first, after a big meal. Now it feels like… almost every time I eat anything substantial. Honestly, I've started eating smaller portions just to avoid it. It’s ridiculous. A man should be able to enjoy a proper dinner.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It sounds like this has gradually worsened over the past six months, and is now significantly impacting your diet and quality of life. Now, besides the undigested food and burning sensation, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. Well, there's a bit of a… sour taste in my mouth sometimes, even when nothing's coming up. And… occasionally, a little bit of bloating. Not terrible, but noticeable. And, honestly, I've been a little more tired lately. Though, that could be anything, I suppose. I am getting older, you know. It's probably just old age. It's just… everything seems to be falling apart. And now this.
DOCTOR: I understand. The sour taste, bloating, and increased fatigue are all potentially relevant pieces of information. It's good you mentioned those. While age can certainly contribute to some changes, we need to rule out any underlying medical causes for these symptoms as well. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years. Other than that… nothing major. I've always been a pretty healthy guy, actually. Eat a good diet, get some exercise… well, used to get more exercise. And I’m not a big drinker, if that matters. Just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. It's the wife who worries about everything. Always going to the doctor, getting check-ups. I’m wasting my time here, frankly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Altine. It's good to know your blood pressure is well-managed. And it's certainly helpful to know you maintain a generally healthy lifestyle. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Oh! Years ago, I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That was… a long time ago. Other than that, no. No major hospital stays. Just the usual… flu shots, maybe a broken arm when I was younger. Nothing that would be relevant here, I assure you. This is… something new. And I’d like to get it sorted out, if possible, without too much fuss. I have things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. A childhood appendectomy is good to note. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like stomach problems, acid reflux, or any cancers?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother had some digestive issues, I think. Stomach cramps mostly. She was always complaining about something. And my uncle… on my wife’s side… he had stomach cancer, years ago. But that's… distant. And honestly, I don't pay much attention to all that. It’s just… genes, right? You either get them or you don’t. I’m not one to worry about things I can't control. It’s a waste of energy. This is just… annoying. I want to know what’s causing it and how to fix it. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Altine. A family history of digestive issues and stomach cancer is helpful information, even if it's distant. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll experience the same, but it’s something to consider. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, like I said. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I'll take a Tylenol. That’s it. Nothing else. I’m not one for all those fancy vitamins and supplements. Seems like a waste of money to me. A proper diet is all you need. And I do try to eat properly, despite this… setback. Look, are we getting anywhere? I’d like to know what you think is causing this and what we can do about it. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I appreciate your patience. You’re taking Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional Tylenol for headaches – that’s good to know. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, focusing on your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I’d rather not sit here all day answering questions. Just… be quick about it. I have a landscaping appointment this afternoon. And the wife will be furious if I’m late. She’s already complaining that I wasted a perfectly good morning at the doctor’s office. It's a whole thing, you understand. Just… examine me. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I will be as efficient as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to gently press on your abdomen in different areas. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, particularly on the right side, but no significant guarding or rigidity. Your bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. There is no palpable mass. I don't detect any rebound tenderness. Does this examination bring up any discomfort or pain?
PATIENT: Tenderness? A little bit, maybe, when you press up there on the right side. But it’s… not sharp. Just… a little uncomfortable. I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, so it could just be that. Honestly, I'm not sure. I’m not a doctor, you know. Just… a little uncomfortable when you poke around. I hope that's not serious. I don't have time for serious. What does this all mean? Are you going to send me for a bunch of tests? Because I really don't want to do that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Altine. The mild tenderness in your upper right abdomen, along with your history of undigested food coming up, bloating, and sour taste, suggests a few possibilities. It could be related to simple indigestion, but given the persistence of your symptoms and the family history, we need to consider other causes as well. Given your symptoms, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. I also recommend an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. This will help us determine if there's any structural abnormality causing your discomfort. These tests are relatively non-invasive and will provide us with valuable information to help us make an accurate diagnosis and create an appropriate treatment plan. Would you be agreeable to proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… Ugh. Fine. Do what you have to do. But if it's going to take weeks to get the results, I'm not sure it's worth it. I have a life, you know? I need to know quickly. And I don't want any unnecessary procedures. Just… get it over with. I guess. But if it’s anything serious, I want a second opinion. My wife will insist on it anyway. She's very… thorough. Make sure the lab is close by. I'm not driving all over town for a few blood tests. And send the results directly to my primary care doctor. I don't need to be chasing paperwork. Just...do it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Altine, and I will certainly take them into account. We can schedule the blood tests at the lab located right across the street from the clinic, which should minimize your travel time. And I will ensure the results are sent directly to your primary care doctor, along with a copy for our records. The ultrasound can be scheduled at the imaging center five minutes from here. The typical turnaround time for the blood test results is 2-3 business days, and the ultrasound results should be available within 48-72 hours. I will personally follow up with you once the results are available to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend avoiding large meals, eating slowly, and staying upright for at least 30 minutes after eating. You can also try an over-the-counter antacid to reduce stomach acid. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the tests done. I have things to do. Landscaping. Dinner. My wife. Don't bother me unless something is seriously wrong. And please, no unnecessary phone calls. I’ve wasted enough time here already. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I will arrange for the lab requisitions and ultrasound appointment to be sent to you electronically. I understand your time is valuable, and I will respect your wishes regarding phone calls. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting. Thank you for your patience. I wish you a pleasant day. .
