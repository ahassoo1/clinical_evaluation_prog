DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain again, in my side. Keeps coming back, you see. And with it, these…water infections, I believe they call them. It’s been happening quite a bit lately.
DOCTOR: “Pain in the side,” you say. And recurrent… urinary infections. Right. Let’s try to be a bit more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Precise. It’s mostly on my right side, a bit lower down. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. And it comes and goes. As for the water infections... well, I just feel unwell, need to go to the toilet a lot, and it burns when I go. That’s what I experience, Doctor.
DOCTOR: "Burns when you go," yes. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's hard to say exactly, Doctor. It feels like… a long time now. Perhaps six months, maybe longer? The pain comes in waves, so sometimes I have a good week or two, then it flares up again. The water infections seem to happen more when the pain is bad, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Six months, intermittent pain... and coinciding with these “water infections.” Do you have a fever, chills, or any nausea associated with either of these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No fever, no chills, and I haven’t been sick to my stomach. It’s mostly just the discomfort, the pain, and the need to use the bathroom frequently. It’s… unsettling, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Right. And have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Blood? No, Doctor, I haven’t seen any blood. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no, my bowel habits haven’t changed. Everything is… regular in that department, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was told some years ago – must be fifteen years now – that my kidneys weren't quite right. Something about lots of little… pockets, they called them. The doctor said it was something I was born with. Polycystic… something? I don’t recall the full name. It wasn't causing any trouble then, so I didn't worry too much about it. But I suppose this must be related, yes?
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease. Yes, that explains a few things. Do you recall if you've had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard, all my life. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know. And now this trouble with my kidneys.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Just a small tablet for my blood pressure, Doctor. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it during the winter months. That’s all. Nothing else, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to perform a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'll need to listen to your abdomen and check your flanks. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if you need me to adjust in any way.
DOCTOR: If you could just relax, Mr. Espinueva. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Deep breaths, please. Tenderness here… slight guarding. Normal bowel sounds, but… diminished in the left lower quadrant. Flanks are tender to palpation bilaterally, more so on the right. No palpable masses. Alright. Now, I'll need a urine sample. The nurse will provide you with a container. Please collect a mid-stream sample. Then, we'll send it off to the lab for analysis.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. A urine sample. I can do that. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I’m not very good with these things, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: The lab work will take a few days, Mr. Espinueva. We'll contact you with the results. Based on your history, the intermittent flank pain, and the tenderness on palpation, I suspect a possible kidney infection, complicated by your pre-existing polycystic kidney disease. However, we need to rule out other causes, and the urine analysis will be crucial. I am going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics, pending the lab results. They should help alleviate the symptoms. And I'll also recommend increasing your fluid intake significantly.
PATIENT: Antibiotics, you say? Very well, Doctor. I do drink plenty of water, but I’ll make sure to drink even more. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any specific foods I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Avoid excessive salt and processed foods, Mr. Espinueva. And I would recommend a low-protein diet until we have the lab results. As for other foods… no particular restrictions, but moderation is key. I will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the lab results and assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen – fever, severe pain, blood in your urine – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Low protein, more water, and watch out for worsening symptoms. Thank you very much for your time, Doctor Jules. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Mr. Espinueva. The nurse will escort you out. Try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. Good day to you.
