DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I want to… how you say… find out more about where my family come from. I hear you can do testing with… the spit? To see what people, long time ago, they were?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You're interested in genetic ancestry testing – looking into your family history through a DNA sample, typically saliva. That’s something we can discuss, and potentially arrange. It's not strictly medical testing, but we can facilitate it and help interpret the results in the context of your health, if needed. Before we go further, can you tell me a bit more about why you’re interested in this testing now, at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… I’m old, you know? Eighty-five. Not many more years, maybe. And I always hear stories about the Marshall Islands, about people from… other places, they come. My grandpa, he tell stories, but… not so clear. I want to know… really know… before I go. For my kids, too. They never ask, but maybe they want to know someday. It’s… important, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. It's wonderful you're thinking of preserving that history for your family. It is important. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want answers before it's too late. Let's talk a bit about the testing itself. There are several companies that offer these services. They analyze your DNA and can provide information about your ethnic origins, potential relatives, and even migration patterns. It’s generally a pretty straightforward process. Before we decide if this is right for you, though, I like to get a little bit of your medical background, just to make sure everything is okay and there are no contraindications. Have you ever had any genetic testing done before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Just… regular check-ups. Blood pressure, things like that. I’m pretty healthy for an old man. Never smoke, not much sugar. My wife, she always take care of me. But… no, no testing. Just the spit test, you say? Is it… painful? Or scary?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's very simple. It's not painful or scary at all. You simply provide a saliva sample – it's like spitting into a small tube. The company will send you the kit, and there are detailed instructions. You mail the sample back to their lab, and they do the analysis. It usually takes a few weeks to get the results. Before we order the kit, though, let’s quickly review your medical history. Just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with anything like that. I eat everything. My wife, she make good food! Fish, taro… all kinds. I can eat spicy, too! She always laugh because I put hot pepper on everything. She say I'm gonna burn my mouth out. But no allergies. Just… old. And sometimes forget things. But not today, I think.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies is excellent. And a little forgetfulness is very common at 85 – perfectly normal, Mr. Scobie. Don't worry about that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… one pill. For my blood pressure. Small white pill. Doctor give it to me a long time ago. I take it every morning with my breakfast. That’s all. Nothing else. I don’t like taking too many pills. Make me feel… slow. And my wife, she always say too much medicine is bad. She’s right, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, just one medication for blood pressure. That’s good to know. Do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… no. Doctor give it to me a long time ago. White pill, small. I go to the pharmacy, they know. I just show them… they give me the same pills every time. I don’t remember the name. Sorry, Doctor. Old man brain!
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Scobie. It’s perfectly understandable. We can easily verify the name with your pharmacy records. We have access to that information. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No serious illnesses, Doctor. I had my appendix out when I was young. Long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, falling out of a coconut tree. But that was a long time ago, too. Everything healed up good. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. Pretty lucky, I think. My wife, she always say I’m a tough old bird.
DOCTOR: You certainly sound like it! Appendix and a broken arm – that's it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s all I remember. Nothing else. Just… the usual old man aches and pains. My knees, they bother me sometimes. But I can still walk okay. And… I get tired easy. But who doesn’t at eighty-five?
DOCTOR: Fair enough. And that's good to hear you're still able to walk. Now, a quick question about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one, Doctor. My grandpa, he had… something with his heart. But I don’t know what. He didn’t go to the doctor much. Just… sick, and then gone. My grandma, she lived a long time. Very strong woman. Never sick. My wife's family, they have… maybe some sugar trouble? Her brother, he had to watch what he eat. But that’s all I really know. Nobody talk much about these things back then.
DOCTOR: That’s very common. It’s good to know what little you do. So, a possible heart condition in your grandfather, and some diabetes risk on your wife’s side. Okay, Mr. Scobie. That gives me a good overview. It doesn't seem like there are any immediate medical reasons why you shouldn't proceed with the genetic ancestry testing. Would you like me to go ahead and order the kit for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be good. I want to know. Before… too late. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. I'm happy to help. I’m ordering a kit from 23andMe – it’s a reputable company, and the results are fairly comprehensive. It should arrive within a week or so. The kit will come with instructions on how to collect your saliva sample and mail it back to the lab. It usually takes about 6-8 weeks to get the results. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about two months, so we can discuss the results together, if you'd like. We can review the information and see if there are any health implications you should be aware of. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you explain everything very good. Two months… that’s okay. I just… hope it tells me something interesting. Something about my family. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I hope it does too. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s a printed summary of our discussion, along with instructions on how to access the kit information online. Have a good day, Mr. Scobie. And I look forward to seeing you in two months.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
