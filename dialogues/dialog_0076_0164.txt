DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar, good to see you… I suppose. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Ruocco. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit strange, really. I’ve been feeling quite weak lately, and I’ve also been very yellow. Not just my skin, but my eyes too, it seems. It started after I ate some fava beans. I love fava beans, but… well, now I’m not so sure.
DOCTOR: Weakness and…jaundice, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Jaundice, that’s what my friend called it when she saw how yellow I looked. And the weakness… it just came on suddenly, a few days after eating the beans. It’s making it hard to even walk upstairs sometimes. It’s quite worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Fava beans… Right. Some people have… sensitivities. We’ll need to rule out the obvious things. Any fever?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. I haven’t felt hot or anything like that. Just tired, really, really tired. And yellow. It’s…it’s a very noticeable yellow, if that makes sense. My friend said I should come straight in. She's a nurse, you see.
DOCTOR: A nurse, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, she is. Very sensible woman, my friend Elena. She thought it could be something serious, given the beans and the… well, the colour. I tend to trust her judgment. She said something about… how some people don’t have enough of something in their blood? I’m not very good with medical things, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Right, well, we'll get to the bottom of it. It could be a deficiency, yes. G6PD deficiency, possibly. Though… it's not common. Let's just take a look. Roll up your sleeve. We’ll start with some bloodwork. It's routine.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Bloodwork is fine. G6PD… is that something serious? I’m sorry, I just… I get a little worried when I hear these things. I’ll roll up my sleeve now. Is it painful?
DOCTOR: Not particularly. It’s a poke, really. I need to check your bilirubin levels, amongst other things. You’re Romanian, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, I am Romanian. Born and raised, though I've lived here for quite a while now. Bilirubin… is that the thing that makes you yellow? I always thought it was something to do with the liver, but my friend Elena said it could be the blood. It’s all a bit confusing, honestly. Are you going to use a big needle? I don’t like needles very much.
DOCTOR: No, not a big one. A standard phlebotomy needle. And yes, bilirubin is related to the liver, your friend is partially right. It’s all connected. Now, if you could just hold still… There. See?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that wasn’t as bad as I expected, thank you. It’s just… I always get a bit anxious with these things. How long until we know something? Is it a long wait? I have a small book with me, in case I need to sit for a while.
DOCTOR: The lab usually gets results back quickly. An hour, maybe two. Sit tight. Don’t get your hopes up, though. It’s probably nothing serious. Still, we need to rule things out. There are other possibilities. Now, let’s get to your past medical history… any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. An hour or two… that's not so bad. Thank you. As for my medical history… let me think. Nothing major, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, when I was little, but nothing serious. As an adult… I had my appendix out when I was about twenty-five, but that was quite a long time ago. Otherwise, I've been generally healthy, I think. I do get a little tired easily, even before this, but I put that down to my age, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy... alright. Any family history of, shall we say, interesting conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father had high blood pressure, and my mother had some arthritis in her hands when she got older. And… oh! My aunt, on my mother's side, she had something… a problem with her blood. I don't remember the exact name, but it meant she had to be very careful in the sun. It was quite rare, my mother said. She had to avoid it completely. Is that… is that what you mean by interesting?
DOCTOR: Yes. That’s... pertinent. Avoidance of sunlight suggests a photosensitivity, quite possibly a porphyria or something similar. Alright. Now, any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I mean, good that I remembered something useful! It was quite a while ago, when I was a child visiting my aunt. I'm so glad I remembered. As for allergies… not really. I have a slight sensitivity to pollen in the spring, makes my eyes itch a little, but nothing serious. No medication allergies, no food allergies that I know of. Just the pollen. And nothing that would make me avoid fava beans until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. Medication?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any regular medication at all. Nothing. I don't even take vitamins, unless my friend Elena tells me to! I’ve always been quite healthy, as I said. I occasionally take something for a headache, paracetamol maybe, but that’s it. Very rarely. I think that’s everything. Unless you want to know about my favourite colour? It's blue, if you were wondering. But I don't think that's relevant.
DOCTOR: Well, that's...efficient. Alright, let’s see what the lab says. Don’t get your hopes up. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. .
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Right. Well, thank you, Doctor Ruocco. I'll just… sit here, then. And wait. Bye bye to you too. I hope your other patients are… less interesting.
