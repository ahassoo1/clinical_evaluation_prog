DOCTOR: Good morning, Aldine. Or… is it Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor… Polczynski, is it? Yes, Aldine Popova is right. Just Aldine is fine, though. Plenty people call me that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. Just Aldine it is. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin’ me for… oh, must be a couple weeks now. Not constant, comes and goes. Feels like a pressure, more than a pain, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pressure at the back of your head for a couple weeks, coming and going. Does anything seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not sure if anything makes it worse, exactly. But when I’m tired, it definitely feels more noticeable. And… well, my wife, Delores, she says I get a bit quiet when it’s bad. Not grumpy, just… less chatty. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Aldine. Fatigue can certainly bring those things on. And being “less chatty,” that’s good observation from your wife. Do you notice any other symptoms when the headache is present?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry around the edges when it’s really bad. Not a lot, just… not as sharp as usual. And I think… yes, I get a bit more sensitive to light, too. Bright lights bother me more than they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and sensitivity to light… good to know. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these headaches, Aldine?
PATIENT: No, no sickness at all. Never any vomit, not even feelin' queasy. Just the headache, blurry vision, and the light botherin' me. And bein' a bit quiet, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your balance, or any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, nothin' like that. My balance is fine, I think. Delores might say different if I try to dance, ha! But seriously, no falls, no dizziness, no trouble walkin'. And my arms and legs feel… normal. I can still do my work, ya know? Manicures and pedicures take a steady hand.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Aldine. So, steady hands, no weakness… Have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get the occasional tension headache, you know, from bendin' over all day. But that’s different. Those are more like a band around my head, and I can usually just take a little rest and they go away. This one… this one feels different. It’s…deeper, somehow. And it lingers.
DOCTOR: Okay, a different kind of headache than usual. Let's take a look at your medical history, if you don’t mind. Just to see if anything stands out. Do you have any allergies to medications, Aldine?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I don’t take much medication, just some ibuprofen now and then for my arthritis. Old age, ya know? Keeps me movin’, but sometimes my joints ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, just ibuprofen for arthritis. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Delores says my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything. She checks it now and then with her little machine. Other than that… no, nothin' serious. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible high blood pressure. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. A long time ago! And I was in the hospital once with a bad bout of pneumonia when I was… oh, must be thirty years ago now. Other than that, nothin'. I've always been good at avoidin' trouble, ya know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have a family history of headaches, or any neurological conditions like stroke or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she used to get terrible migraines when she was younger. Real bad ones. Had to lie down in a dark room for hours. And my uncle… he had a stroke, I think, maybe ten years ago. He never fully recovered. Other than that… nothin' springs to mind. My father was as healthy as an ox, right up until the day he died.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Aldine. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your reflexes, your vision, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. Old bones, ya know?
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be gentle. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Pulse is regular at 78. Now, I'm going to shine a light in your eyes, and have you follow my finger. Just look straight ahead. Alright. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Your eye movements seem normal, and your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Your gait is steady, but a little slow. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds clear. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. I'm also going to palpate your head and neck to check for any tenderness or swelling. No tenderness or swelling. Everything feels normal.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Everything feels normal, eh? That’s a relief. My wife worries somethin' awful. She’s a good woman, Delores. Always lookin' out for me.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything seems normal on the exam, Aldine. That's good. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it's likely you're experiencing tension headaches, possibly triggered by stress, fatigue, or the arthritis. The blurry vision and light sensitivity could be related. However, given your age and the new onset of these symptoms, I want to be cautious. I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any underlying issues. It’s a just a precaution, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. What do you think?
PATIENT: An MRI, eh? That sounds…serious. Is it expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. And I don't want to put Delores through any unnecessary expense. I appreciate you bein’ cautious, Doctor, but… is it really necessary? Maybe it’s just a bit of old age catchin' up with me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Aldine. It is an expense, and I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was important. While it could be age-related, the new onset of blurry vision and light sensitivity warrants investigation, especially at your age. It's a way to rule out anything serious, like a small stroke, a tumor, or other issues that could be causing these symptoms. We can discuss options for reducing the cost, such as looking for financial assistance programs or negotiating a lower rate with the imaging center. Also, there are some facilities that offer discounted rates for uninsured patients. I'll have my staff look into that for you. In the meantime, we can try some conservative measures – over-the-counter pain relievers, stress management techniques, and ensuring you get enough rest. But I do strongly recommend the MRI for peace of mind. What do you think?
PATIENT: Well… alright. If you really think it’s best, I suppose I trust your judgment, Doctor. It’s just… I don't like the idea of puttin’ Delores through that expense. But peace of mind… that’s worth somethin’. Okay, let’s look into it. See what options there are for helpin’ with the cost. And yes, I’ll try to get more rest. Delores is always tellin’ me that, ha! And I’ll take those pain relievers. Anything to feel a little better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have my staff get that information for you right away. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for ibuprofen 800mg, to take as needed for the headaches. Take two tablets with food, up to three times a day. Also, if you experience any worsening of symptoms – severe headache, fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Ibuprofen 800mg, two tablets with food, up to three times a day. And if things get worse, go to the emergency room. Emergency room… right. That’s good to know. My wife will be glad to hear that. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Aldine. It’s always good to have someone looking out for you. I'll also give you a handout with information about tension headaches and stress management techniques. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, to discuss the MRI results and how you're feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds fine. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything, Doctor. And thank you for lookin' into helpin’ with the cost of the MRI. That means a lot to me and Delores. I think… I think that’s everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe so. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything I was wonderin’. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You’re a good man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aldine. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And please, encourage Delores to take care of herself as well. Have a good day.
