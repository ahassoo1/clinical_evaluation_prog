DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this cough. It’s been hanging on for a while now, and I’m just tired all the time. Seems like I get a sinus infection right after I start feeling better from the cough, too. It’s a whole cycle.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A cycle, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Cough, feel a little better, then bam – stuffy nose, headache, the whole thing. Then the cough comes back. It’s… frustrating, to say the least. And tiring. Really tiring.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try to get to the bottom of this. How long has this been going on, this cough and sinus cycle?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s a good question. I guess… at least six months, maybe longer? It's hard to say exactly. It kinda comes and goes, you know? Worse in the winter, maybe. But it hasn’t really gone completely.
DOCTOR: Six months is a considerable amount of time for a lingering cough. And the recurring sinus issues… Are you running a fever with these “sinus infections”?
PATIENT: Not usually a high fever. Just kinda… warm. And achy. Mostly the pressure in my face is bad, and the congestion. I don’t really bother taking my temperature unless I’m feeling really bad. My daughter used to, but she moved away… She worried too much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. So, no consistently high fever, mostly aches and facial pressure… And you say it’s been going on for at least six months. Have you tried anything to relieve the symptoms, over-the-counter medications, home remedies, anything at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve tried some stuff. Cough drops, mostly. And I take a decongestant when my nose gets really bad. Doesn’t really fix it, just helps a little for a few hours. Used to drink a lot of tea, but… I just haven't been feeling up to it lately. Everything feels like too much effort.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Cough drops and decongestants… not much sustained relief, then. And feeling fatigued… All right. I’m going to need to listen to your lungs, and I’d like to check your sinuses, just to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, okay? I got things to get back to. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. And another one… Alright. Lungs sound… slightly diminished in a few areas. Not wheezing, but not entirely clear either. Now, I'm going to palpate your sinuses. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Tenderness here… and here. As I suspected. Now, have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or coughing up any blood or discolored mucus?
PATIENT: No shortness of breath, no. And no chest pain. The mucus… sometimes it's a little green, sometimes just clear. Mostly just… a lot of it. And it feels like it’s always stuck in the back of my throat. Like I can’t get rid of it. I don't think I've ever coughed up blood. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Green mucus suggests a possible bacterial component, though clear mucus doesn't rule anything out. Fatigue, prolonged cough, recurring sinus issues… It could be a lingering post-viral infection, but six months is a long time. I'm also noting your age and the fact that you've had these symptoms for quite a while. Have you had a chest X-ray recently?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? No, I don't think so. Not in a long time. Maybe… ten years ago? Something like that. When I broke my collarbone, but they didn't mention anything about my lungs. Just the bone. I don’t really go to the doctor much, if I can help it. It’s never really helped much in the past, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given the duration of your symptoms and the lack of recent imaging, I think a chest X-ray is warranted. It’s just to rule out anything more serious. And I'm going to order some blood work to check for any underlying infection or inflammation. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife… she was the one who kept track of that sort of thing. She always remembered everything. But no, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. The lab should be able to get the blood work done quickly. And I'll send an order to radiology for the X-ray. After we have those results, we can discuss a plan of action. I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics for now, to address the potential bacterial infection. It's a standard treatment, but we’ll see if it helps. I'm also going to recommend you try a saline nasal rinse a few times a day, to help clear out the congestion. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Saline rinse… yeah, I think I can manage that. Antibiotics… alright. Sounds good, I guess. No, I don’t think so. Just… how long until I get the results? I don’t want to be back and forth to this place all the time. It takes up a whole day, you know?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within 48 hours, and the radiology report usually takes about the same amount of time. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment then. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, high fever, or if your symptoms worsen significantly, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Emergency room if things get bad. Look, is that it? Can I go now? I really appreciate you seeing me, Doctor, but… I’ve got things to do. And I don’t want to be here any longer than I have to be. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're all set for now. The nurse will explain the next steps and schedule a follow-up. I’ve sent the orders to the lab and radiology. Get well soon, Mr. Pithan. .
