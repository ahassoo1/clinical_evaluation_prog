DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s…difficult to explain, precisely. I feel…not ill, exactly. More like…drained. Like I need a good…reset, perhaps? A jumpstart to get things moving again. I’m not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A “reset,” huh?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s hard to describe. I’ve been feeling…less myself, for a few months now. I have energy, I suppose, but it’s…thin. Like it’s not really me having it, if that makes any sense at all. It’s not pain, not sickness… just… a lack.
DOCTOR: Right. A lack. Okay. So, this has been going on for a few months you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. Perhaps… six months? It began gradually, I believe. I initially attributed it to… the usual stresses, you understand? Work is demanding, and… well, life. But it hasn't improved. It’s… persistent.
DOCTOR: Persistent. Alright. And can you describe this “thin” energy a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… I can accomplish things, yes. I do accomplish things. But it takes… considerably more effort. And at the end of the day, I feel… empty. Not exhausted, precisely. Just… depleted. Like something is missing. It’s difficult to enjoy things, even things I usually love. It’s a… muted experience, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Muted. Okay. So it’s impacting your enjoyment of things... Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: That's a good question. No, not really. I sleep… normally, I believe. Perhaps a little too much, at times, but nothing dramatic. I don't have trouble falling asleep, nor do I wake up feeling unrested. It’s not a sleep issue, I don't believe. It's more… a feeling of… disconnection, if that clarifies anything.
DOCTOR: Disconnection. Alright. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite… has been somewhat variable, yes. Some days I eat very little, others… a normal amount. I haven’t lost weight, as far as I know. I’m not particularly hungry, but I force myself to eat, mostly. It doesn't seem to make much difference, honestly. The food… doesn't give me the same satisfaction it once did.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, variable appetite, no weight loss, and decreased satisfaction with food... Have you been experiencing any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. I wouldn't say depressed, not precisely. But… less joyful, certainly. Less… enthusiastic. More… resigned, perhaps? It's not a constant sadness, but… a pervasive… grayness. I find myself… withdrawing somewhat from social activities. It’s not that I don’t want to be with people, it’s just… less appealing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Resigned...grayness...and withdrawing. Okay. And have you noticed any physical symptoms at all – headaches, digestive issues, muscle aches, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. No headaches. My digestion is… normal, I think. Perhaps a little… slow, at times, but nothing concerning. No aches or pains. That’s why I’m finding this so difficult to explain, Doctor. It's not a physical ailment, as far as I can tell. It’s… more… internal. A lack of… spark, perhaps? A fading… something. It's very frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant physical complaints, just this pervasive sense of… “fading,” as you put it. Now, let’s go over a little of your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I have had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing… ongoing. My blood pressure is usually… fine, when it’s checked. I had a routine mammogram last year, and everything was normal. I am on Medicare, as I’m… of a certain age now, and I see my general practitioner annually for a check-up. He hasn’t noticed anything… concerning, to date. I did have a rather difficult childbirth with my son, but that was… many years ago.
DOCTOR: Difficult childbirth... Okay. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I had my appendix removed when I was… twenty-three, I believe. And… a hysterectomy approximately fifteen years ago. It was… necessary. But that was… a long time ago now. I don't believe it's relevant, but I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendectomy and hysterectomy. And what about family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she suffered from high blood pressure, and… a touch of arthritis in her later years. My father was… generally healthy, I believe. No… significant illnesses, on either side of the family, as far as I know. No history of… mental illness, or… anything particularly concerning, to be honest. My brother is healthy as well, as far as I am aware. We don't… see each other very often, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to… avoid them, if possible. I take a multivitamin, occasionally, but that’s it. No prescription medications, and no… herbal remedies, or anything like that. I believe in… a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I walk regularly, and I try to eat a balanced diet. But… clearly, something is… amiss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Thank you for being so thorough. It sounds like you've been experiencing a gradual decline in your overall sense of well-being. While we've ruled out many common causes, this does require further investigation. I'd like to order some bloodwork to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a complete metabolic panel. That will give us a better baseline. I'm also going to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll check your heart and lungs, and I'll do a neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Bloodwork and a physical exam. Yes, that is perfectly acceptable. I just… I want to understand what’s happening, and… regain some of my… vitality. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and… investigate. Please, proceed as you deem necessary. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's start with the physical exam. If you could just lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, let me know if I need to adjust anything. I am… not very flexible these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That is… reassuring to hear. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Now, I'm just going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything is tender. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. Alright. Everything seems within normal limits physically, which makes this… more puzzling. I'll order the bloodwork now, and we’ll discuss the results when they come back. It may also be beneficial to consider a referral to a therapist, Ms. Pitzel. Sometimes, these types of symptoms can be related to stress or underlying emotional factors. It wouldn’t hurt to explore that possibility. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A therapist… hmm. I hadn't considered that. I suppose… stress is certainly a factor in my life. I do tend to… internalize things, perhaps. A referral… yes. I am willing to explore that possibility. I just… I want to find the cause, Doctor. Not just… manage the symptoms. But… yes, I am open to a referral. Thank you for suggesting it. And thank you for the thorough examination, despite… the lack of definitive findings. I will await the results of the bloodwork, and… proceed as you advise.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll go ahead and submit those orders now, and I'll also get the referral for therapy processed. You should receive instructions on how to schedule an appointment within the next few days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. We'll discuss these results as soon as they come back, and hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You have been very thorough and… reassuring. I appreciate your time and… your understanding. Just… let me know as soon as the results are available. And thank you again for the referral. I will… schedule an appointment. Hopefully, it will shed some light on things. I believe that is all, for now. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome, Ms. Pitzel. We'll be in touch. The nurse will come in shortly to go over discharge instructions with you. Have a good day.
