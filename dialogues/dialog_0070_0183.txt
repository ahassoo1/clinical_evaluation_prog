DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Abady, you say? Hmm. Well, I'm here 'cause I'm… tired. Just always tired. Doctor said something about my liver, a long time ago. Doesn't feel good, this tired. Like walking through mud, all the time.
DOCTOR: I see. Tiredness, and you recall a previous doctor mentioning something about your liver. “Walking through mud,” that’s a very descriptive way to put it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to say? I told you, I’m tired. All the time. Doesn’t matter if I sleep ten hours, or five. Still tired. I work, you know. With the cloth. Not easy work, but I’m not… weak. It’s just… there. Always.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Grumman. You’re right to point out that simply being tired isn’t enough information. I apologize for the broad question. When did you first notice this tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now you're asking things. Let me think… Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. Maybe a year? Around the time my wife, Selam, started having trouble with her knee. Yes, around then. Everything gets mixed up, you know. But it was after Selam’s knee started. It just… slowly got worse. Not suddenly.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. So, roughly a year ago, around the time your wife Selam began experiencing knee trouble, you started noticing this increasing fatigue. And it’s been a gradual worsening, not a sudden onset. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Like… a fever? No fever. I eat. I… go to the bathroom. What do you mean, symptoms? Everything feels slow, like I said. And sometimes… my stomach feels a little… puffy. Not big, just… not right. And I don’t have much… appetite, these days. Selam worries about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. So, no fever. You've mentioned a general slowing down, some abdominal puffiness, and decreased appetite. Has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? You're asking about… going to the toilet? Is that what you mean? Look, I'm not a doctor. I just tell you I'm tired. It all feels connected, doesn’t it? The tired, the stomach, everything. It's all… slow. Like the water going down the drain.
DOCTOR: You're right to feel that it’s all connected, and I apologize for the specific questions. It’s important to gather as much information as possible. Regarding your bowel habits, have you noticed any changes in the frequency, consistency, or color of your stool?
PATIENT: Color? Consistency? Now you're just being difficult. I look when I have to look. I don't… examine it. It's… normal, I guess? Brown. Sometimes lighter. Sometimes… not so firm. What does it matter? I'm tired! That’s the problem! You keep asking about… things that don't matter.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Grumman. You are right; I am asking a lot of detailed questions, and it's clear you’re focused on the tiredness. I assure you, all of these details can matter. Let's step back for a moment. You mentioned your previous doctor said something about your liver a long time ago. Do you recall what that doctor said, or what tests were done?
PATIENT: Tests… Hmm. It was a long time ago. Selam came with me. She’d remember more. Something about blood. And a machine… it made pictures. Of my liver, I think. He said something about… not working right. But he didn’t say what was wrong. Just told me to… be careful with what I eat. Not much drinking, that’s what he said. I don’t drink much anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Grumman. That’s helpful. Blood tests and imaging of your liver, with a recommendation to modify your diet and limit alcohol. To get a clearer picture of your current condition, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement of your liver or spleen, and check for any signs of jaundice. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Jaundice? What’s jaundice? You keep using these… big words. Look, I’ll let you poke around. But don’t expect me to understand what you’re doing. I just want to feel… less tired. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Grumman, that is not too much to ask at all. Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and eyes, which can sometimes occur with liver problems. We’ll see if you have any signs of that. I’ll explain everything as I go along. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Deep breaths, please. Everything sounds normal so far. Now I’m going to listen to your lungs…
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breaths. Like this? Feels silly. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. Selam is making stew. I like her stew.
DOCTOR: Just a few more moments, Mr. Grumman. Everything sounds clear here as well. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or enlargement. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Oof. There… a little. On the right side. Under the ribs. Not much, but… yeah. A little uncomfortable. Feels… tight. Like a band around my stomach. Not pain, exactly. Just… tight. And… a little full.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. That area is where the liver is located. Feeling a bit of tightness and fullness there is consistent with some possible liver involvement. I also notice some mild tenderness when I press there. I’m not detecting any significant enlargement of the liver or spleen, but there is that tenderness and tightness. I also want to check your skin and eyes for any signs of jaundice. I do not see any obvious signs of jaundice at this time. Okay, Mr. Grumman, that completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, I suspect there may be something going on with your liver. However, to get a definitive diagnosis, we need to run some blood tests and possibly some imaging. Would you be willing to proceed with those?
PATIENT: Blood tests and pictures… Again? Look, I don't like needles. And those machines… they make me nervous. But… I want to feel better. So… yes. Do whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, alright? And explain everything. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Grumman. I understand your concerns, and I promise to explain everything thoroughly and move as quickly as possible. We’ll take it one step at a time. The blood tests will help us assess your liver function, check for any signs of inflammation, and rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. The imaging – likely an ultrasound – will allow us to visualize your liver and see if there are any abnormalities. I'll write the orders for these tests now. The lab is just down the hall. A phlebotomist will draw your blood, and then we'll schedule the ultrasound for you. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… that's the picture machine, right? Will it hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting for weeks. Selam will worry. And… what if it's something bad? You're not going to tell me it's something horrible, are you?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. Grumman. The ultrasound is a painless procedure. It uses sound waves to create images of your liver, and there’s no radiation involved. It typically takes about 20-30 minutes. Regarding the results, we usually get them within a few days. I will personally review them as soon as they’re available and discuss them with you promptly. I assure you, I won’t leave you waiting unnecessarily. And to address your last question… it's impossible to say what the results will be at this point. That’s why we need to do the tests. But I want to emphasize that many liver conditions are treatable, even curable. We’re simply gathering information at this stage. I won't speculate until we have the results. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first. Once we have a clearer picture of what’s going on, we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. That… sounds better. No surprises. And quick results. You promise? Selam gets… anxious. Fine. Let's get the blood tests done. Where do I go? And… will I need to fast? I like breakfast.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Grumman, I promise to get the results to you as quickly as possible. And Selam’s anxiety is understandable. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks – except water – from now until the time of the test. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist will be expecting you. They will give you a requisition form to fill out, and then a phlebotomist will draw your blood. After the blood draw, you can come back here, and we’ll schedule the ultrasound. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: Eight hours… That's a long time. No breakfast… Fine. No breakfast. Eight hours. Lab to the left. Requisition form. Phlebotomist. This is… a lot. No, I think… that’s everything. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. And explain everything. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Grumman. I understand this is a lot, and I will do my best to make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible. I will explain everything clearly, and I won’t keep you waiting unnecessarily. Please, don't hesitate to let me or my staff know if you have any questions or concerns at any time. You go ahead and head to the lab. I’ll see you back here after the blood draw.
