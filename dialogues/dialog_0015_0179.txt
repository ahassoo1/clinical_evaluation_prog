DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. It is about… the words. They do not come so easy now. I have trouble… finding them. It is… frustrating, you understand?
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. “Trouble finding the words” is rather vague, Mr. Gyamfi. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. Hmm. It is… like when I want to say “table”, but… another word comes. Or… no word comes at all. It happens more now, over the last few… months, I think. It is difficult to explain. I work with… numbers and… people’s work. Compensation, you understand? But even talking about that… it is hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: So, this difficulty with word-finding has been increasing over the past few months. It’s interfering with your work, specifically with discussing compensation matters. Is this happening consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days… better. Some days… very difficult. It is not all the time. But… it worries me. I am… a careful man. I like things to be… precise. And this… this is not precise. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling is a fair way to put it. And you said it’s been happening for a few months. Have you noticed any other changes along with this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. My wife… she passed last year. That was… difficult, of course. I am still… adjusting. Perhaps… I am more tired. Not sick tired, just… weary. And… sometimes I feel a little… lost in my thoughts. It is hard to explain. Like a fog, maybe?
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’ve experienced a significant loss recently with the passing of your wife. Fatigue and feeling “lost in your thoughts” are also present. These can certainly contribute to cognitive difficulties. But we need to rule out other causes. Now, have you experienced any headaches, weakness, numbness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. A little tension sometimes, but not a headache. Weakness… no. My hands are… steady enough. Numbness… no. And my vision… it is okay, I think. I wear glasses, as you can see. But no changes. It is… mostly the words, Doctor. That is what worries me the most.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned you work with numbers and compensation. Has your performance at work been affected, or have your colleagues noticed any changes in your speech or memory?
PATIENT: My performance… it is slower, yes. I take longer to write reports. And… I have made a few small errors. Nothing major, but… noticeable. My colleagues… they are very kind. They ask if I am feeling alright. They… they try to help. They have noticed… I stumble sometimes. It is… embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased difficulty with work performance, some errors, and colleagues have observed changes in your speech. We're building a picture here, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, let’s go through some routine questions. Do you have any history of stroke, head injury, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Stroke… no. Head injury… not that I recall. A few bumps and scrapes as a boy, playing football, but nothing serious. Neurological… I do not understand that word, Doctor. What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Neurological conditions refer to diseases of the brain and nervous system. Things like Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis… Do you have any family history of those types of conditions, or dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Dementia… Alzheimer’s… I have heard of those. My aunt… on my mother’s side… she had something like that. Very old, though. She was… confused near the end. But I do not know… details. My mother… she passed many years ago. My father… he was a strong man. Healthy, until the very end. No… I do not think there is a history of that in my family.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor… a few years ago… said it was a little high. A small pill, every morning. And… sometimes, a vitamin D. The sun… it is not strong enough here, you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. I can… breathe anything. No allergies. I am a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a simple neurological assessment – checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step over here and have a seat. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 140 over 85… slightly elevated, but not unexpected given his history. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is this… alright? I am trying my best.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Now, squeeze my hands. Good. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: What year…? Hmm. Is it… 2024? No… I believe… 2025. August 2nd, yes?
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I’m going to test your memory. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Please, go ahead. My memory… it is not what it used to be, but I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Apple… Table… Penny. Now, can you repeat those three words back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… yes. And… a… a fruit? Something round… A penny… I remember a coin… But the other word… It is… on the tip of my tongue…
DOCTOR: Table, Mr. Gyamfi. The word is table. We’ll discuss the results of these tests shortly. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam findings, I suspect we’re dealing with early cognitive decline, likely related to age and possibly exacerbated by the grief from your wife’s passing. However, it's crucial to rule out other potential causes. We need to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture. Do you understand?
PATIENT: MRI… blood tests… I… I understand that you want to check… everything. But… an MRI? Is that… serious? It sounds… complicated. I… I am not sure I want to do that. I just wanted to know why I cannot find the words.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, it is serious, which is why we need to investigate. An MRI is a painless imaging test that allows us to see what’s happening inside your brain. It’s the best way to determine the cause of your cognitive difficulties and rule out more serious conditions, like a stroke or tumor. Avoiding the test won't make the problem go away. It will only delay a proper diagnosis and potentially prevent you from receiving the treatment you need. I understand you're anxious, but it's in your best interest to proceed with these tests. We can discuss any concerns you have about the procedure itself, but I strongly recommend it.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it is best… then I will do the tests. But… please explain everything to me. I am an old man, and… I get frightened easily. I just want to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will schedule the blood tests and the MRI for you. The MRI will take approximately 30-45 minutes. You'll need to lie still inside a scanner, and it can be a bit noisy. You’ll be given earplugs. We will provide you with detailed instructions beforehand. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on maintaining a healthy lifestyle: a balanced diet, regular exercise, and plenty of mental stimulation. We can also explore some cognitive therapy exercises to help improve your memory and word-finding skills. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Thank you for… explaining everything. And thank you for… listening to an old man who cannot find his words.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will see you out. .
