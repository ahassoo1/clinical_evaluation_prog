DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's my leg. It's been swelling up... after the cancer treatment. It's just... bigger than it should be, you know? It's a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling after cancer treatment is certainly something we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… maybe a week after I finished the radiation? Or was it the pills? Oh dear, it's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. But definitely after the last treatment. Maybe a week, a little more, a little less… it's hard to say exactly. It was just a little puffy at first, and now… well, you see it!
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. And you mentioned radiation and pills – just to clarify, were you receiving both radiation and chemotherapy as part of your cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Both. The radiation... that was every day for a while. And then the pills, I had to take those for… a long time, I think. Months. Everything feels like a long time now. I just want it to stop swelling, honestly. It's making it hard to walk.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and wanting to get back to normal is certainly a valid goal. Okay, so both radiation and chemotherapy. And the swelling is affecting your ability to walk. Is the swelling in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one. My right leg is fine, thank goodness. It's mostly in the calf, I think... and a little bit around my ankle. It feels… tight, you know? Like a big, heavy band around it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left leg, primarily in the calf and ankle, feeling tight and heavy. Has the swelling been constant since it started, or does it fluctuate – get better or worse at certain times of the day, or with activity?
PATIENT: Oh, it gets worse. Definitely worse if I'm on my feet too long. And in the evening, it's always bigger. If I sit and put my feet up for a while, it goes down a little... but not much. It never really goes away completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's exacerbated by being on your feet and worse in the evening, with some improvement when you elevate it, but doesn't fully resolve. Have you noticed any changes in the skin of your left leg – redness, warmth, any sores or blisters?
PATIENT: No, no sores or anything. The skin... it feels normal. Maybe a little bit harder, if I press on it, but not red or warm. No, it doesn't feel infected, if that's what you're asking. Just... swollen. And uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no redness, warmth, or changes in skin texture. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any pain in your left leg – any aching, cramping, or sharp pains?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a bit of aching. Not sharp pain, thankfully. Just a dull ache, especially when I walk. It's not terrible, but it's always there, you know? It's just… annoying. It makes me not want to do anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache is certainly concerning, and it’s good you’re describing this to me. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Oh, my blood pressure is a little high, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that, every morning. And I had a bad fall a few years ago, broke my wrist. But that's all, I think. Nothing else major. I don't have… those other things you mentioned. No, not diabetes or heart trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with medication, and a past broken wrist. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes! There's one for my bones, because they said my density was low. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But not every day. Just when it hurts a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication daily, a medication for bone density, and an as-needed medication for arthritis. And just to confirm, what is the name of the medication you take for your bone density?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Now you’re asking too much! I just know the doctor gives me a pill, and I take it. I don’t really remember names. It’s… a little white pill, I think? I have a terrible memory, you know. I really don’t know the name.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it can be difficult to remember medication names. We can look it up in your records. Okay, it looks like you're taking Alendronate for osteoporosis, which is a medication for bone density. And you mentioned the arthritis medication is taken as needed, do you recall what that medication is?
PATIENT: Oh, Alendronate... yes, that sounds right. Goodness, you're very clever! And the arthritis... hmm... I think it's Naproxen? Maybe? It's a little orange pill. I only take it when my joints really bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alendronate for osteoporosis daily and Naproxen as needed for arthritis. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother... she had high blood pressure, like me. And my father, he had… something with his heart, I think. It was a long time ago, I don't remember exactly. No one else, really. My brother is fine, and my sister is healthy too. Not much cancer in the family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure and some heart issues. And finally, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in any regular exercise?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. And I don't really drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not often. And exercise… Not really. I used to walk more, but now it's hard with my leg. Mostly I just sit and read.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional glass of wine, and limited exercise. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Sasha. Now, I'd like to examine your leg to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to find out what’s causing the swelling, you know? It's just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, your leg feels warm to the touch, and there is some definite tenderness when I press here along your calf. And I am noting 2+ pitting edema, meaning there’s moderate swelling that leaves a noticeable indentation when I press on it. Your pulses are normal, and I don’t see any signs of skin breakdown or infection. It seems the swelling is primarily localized to your lower leg. This could be related to a number of factors, including the cancer treatment, fluid retention, or potentially something else. To rule out any deeper issues, like a blood clot, I would like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your leg. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A… what was it? A Doppler ultra-sound? Is that… painful? And a blood clot? That sounds… scary. But if you think it's best, then yes, alright. Do whatever you need to do. I just want it fixed, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you we are being thorough. A Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your leg. It doesn't involve any radiation and isn't painful – you'll just feel a cool gel applied to your skin and a probe moving around. It’s simply to rule out a blood clot, which is a serious but treatable condition. While it's important to consider all possibilities, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a blood clot. It’s simply a precautionary measure. In the meantime, to help manage the swelling, I recommend elevating your leg as much as possible throughout the day, especially when you're sitting. You can also try wearing compression stockings, which can help improve blood flow. I will order the ultrasound now, and the scheduling department will contact you to arrange an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… when will I hear about the results? I don't like waiting. And the compression stockings… where do I get those? Everything feels so complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about waiting. The radiologist typically provides results within 24-48 hours, and my office will contact you as soon as I've reviewed them. As for the compression stockings, you can purchase them at most pharmacies or medical supply stores. I'll write you a prescription for compression stockings – 20-30 mmHg – which you can take to the store. They come in different lengths and sizes, so it's best to get them fitted by a professional. I’m also going to order some blood work to get a better baseline of your kidney function and rule out any underlying issues that could be contributing to the swelling. Are you able to walk without assistance?
PATIENT: Yes, I can walk… slowly. I don’t need a cane or anything, but I get tired easily. And it aches, you know? It just aches. I'm glad you're doing all this, though. It makes me feel… better, knowing you're taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear that, Sasha. It's important to me that you feel confident in the care you're receiving. We're going to get to the bottom of this. I’m going to write up a work note for you excusing you from strenuous activity for the next week, as well as the prescriptions for the compression stockings and the blood work order. I will follow up with you after the ultrasound results are available to discuss them and formulate a plan. If you experience any sudden increase in pain, redness, warmth, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions or concerns before we conclude the consultation today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Quicksey. You've been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just hope… I hope it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. It was my pleasure. And I understand your concern. We will take things one step at a time, and we’ll address whatever the results show. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or experience any changes in your condition. I wish you a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
