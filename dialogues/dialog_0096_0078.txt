DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel, welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Burlingham. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, you know? A jumpstart to get my health back on track. I’m not sure exactly what that looks like, but I haven’t been feeling my best lately.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s hard to explain. I’m 45, and it feels like… everything is just effortful. Not necessarily sick, but definitely not thriving. I used to have so much more energy, and now… it takes a real push to do anything. Even things I enjoy. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Well, at 45, things do start to change, you know. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but we need to figure out what's contributing to this “effortfulness,” as you put it. Let’s start with the basics. Have you noticed any specific symptoms that are bothering you?
PATIENT: That’s fair. It’s just… everything feels a little off. Let me think. I suppose I’m more tired than I used to be, definitely. And my sleep isn’t great – I wake up a lot during the night. And… honestly, I’ve been a bit forgetful lately, though I’m not sure if that’s just age or stress. It’s nothing major, but little things… like where I put my keys. Is that… normal? I apologize, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, no apology needed. It’s good you’re telling me all this. Tiredness and trouble sleeping are common, certainly. Forgetfulness… well, we all have those moments, but it’s good to be aware of it. It could be a lot of things, or nothing at all. Now, aside from the tiredness, sleep, and memory lapses, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My digestion hasn’t been the best. A bit… sluggish, if you will. And I've had some aches and pains, mostly in my joints, but nothing debilitating. It's just a general feeling of being… worn down, I suppose. I haven’t been sick, not a cold or anything. Just… blah. I'm not sure if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Pitzel. “Blah” is a very useful description, actually. Sluggish digestion and joint aches... Alright. Let’s go through some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything… chronic. I do have slightly high blood pressure, my family doctor mentioned it at my last check-up, but it's manageable with diet and exercise, or at least, it was. That was a couple of years ago. He did want me to come back regularly, but… life got in the way. I'm married, and I'm covered by Medicare.
DOCTOR: Medicare, alright. And slightly high blood pressure… a couple of years ago. Hmm. Okay. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Nothing like that. I’ve been very lucky, health-wise. I mean, I’ve had the usual vaccinations, and dental work, but nothing major. I’m a molder, shaper, and caster—not metal and plastic, though—so it’s a fairly physical job. Not extremely strenuous, but I'm on my feet a lot. I think that’s why my blood pressure was a little high, to begin with.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father had heart problems later in life. His side of the family has a history of it, unfortunately. I try to be careful about my diet, knowing that, but… it’s hard sometimes. My siblings are generally healthy, as far as I know, though we don't see each other often. Is that… enough information? I feel like I’m just rambling again.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and heart problems… alright. You're not rambling, Ms. Pitzel. It's good to have this information. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. No reactions to medications, either. I haven’t taken a lot of medicine, thankfully. Mostly just over-the-counter things for headaches or aches, if needed. And vitamins. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Vitamins, yes, that counts. Okay. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Just the usual. Then we'll see where we stand.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Yes, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit here for me… Blood pressure first. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Ears and throat look clear. No swelling. Reflexes are normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems… within normal limits, physically. But the blood pressure is concerning, and your description of how you’re feeling is… not consistent with someone who is completely healthy. Now, Ms. Pitzel, have you had any blood work done recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any blood work done in… years. Not since my family doctor retired, I suppose. He usually did a panel once a year, but I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since then. I suppose that’s… foolish of me. I keep meaning to, but… things always get in the way.
DOCTOR: “Things getting in the way” is often a problem, Ms. Pitzel. But it's important to prioritize your health. Given your symptoms, and your family history, I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Also, let's get an EKG done, just to be safe.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Yes, please. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. Will I need to come back for a separate appointment to discuss the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. The lab work usually takes a few days. Once we have those results, we can determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend that you start keeping a food diary and try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Also, try to reduce your stress levels. I know it's easier said than done, but stress can exacerbate a lot of these symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all makes sense. Food diary, exercise, reduce stress… I can try. When should I schedule the follow-up? And… where do I go for the lab work and EKG?
DOCTOR: The lab work and EKG can be done at the facility across the hall – Suite 204. They take walk-ins, but it’s best to call ahead to avoid a long wait. The number is 555-1212. As for the follow-up appointment, let's schedule it for two weeks from today, August 16th, at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, August 16th at 10:00 AM is perfect. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and… not dismiss how I’m feeling. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, try to be proactive, Ms. Pitzel. These tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
