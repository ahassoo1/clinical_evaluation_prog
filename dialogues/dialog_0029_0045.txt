DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. I get really red in the face. It’s been happening a little while now. Not all the time, but… enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, the flushing. And how long has this “little while” been?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Around February, I think. Yes, February. My wife… she noticed it first. She always had a good eye for things.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months. And does anything specifically seem to trigger it, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not always. Sometimes it just… happens. But… I think when I eat spicy food, it gets worse. And… when I get a little upset. Not angry, just… bothered. Like if someone cuts me off in traffic. Little things. Not big things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. So spicy food and mild stress seem to be associated with it. Is it accompanied by any other symptoms when it happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Sometimes my heart beats a little fast. Not fast fast, you know? Just… noticeable. And… sometimes I feel a little warm. Like a hot flash, maybe? But not… all over. Mostly just in my face and neck. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slightly increased heart rate and warmth in your face and neck along with the flushing. Do you experience any sweating when this happens?
PATIENT: Sweating? Not really. No. My face gets red, but not sweaty. I don’t get… clammy or anything. Just red. And warm. Like I’m… embarrassed, but I’m not. It’s… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any dizziness or lightheadedness with these episodes?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. I haven’t felt like I was going to fall or anything. I’ve felt a little… off sometimes, but I thought that was just… getting old. I don’t know if that’s the same thing. I get a little shaky sometimes, but that's my hands. It's been happening for years. Not with the flushing, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness associated with the flushing. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor checked that a few years ago, and it was a little high, but he said it was okay. Just watch my salt. Diabetes… no, I don’t have diabetes. My wife… she had it, but not me. Heart problems… no. I walk every day. I try to stay healthy. I used to be a lot more active, but… well. It's harder now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to take care of myself. I take a vitamin every day, but that’s it. Just a multivitamin. Nothing for anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My wife used to worry about it, but I never had a problem. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing. I think I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family have a history of similar issues – flushing, heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he used to get red in the face sometimes. But he drank a lot. I always figured it was the alcohol. My mother… she had high blood pressure, like I said. And my sister… she had some kind of heart thing when she was older. A valve problem, I think. It was a long time ago. It's hard to keep track. Everyone has something, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone now, like I said. My wife… passed away a little over a year ago. I try to stay busy. I walk every morning, like I told you. I garden a little. I watch TV. I mostly just… keep to myself. I don't drink much anymore. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. I used to drink more, but… not anymore. I don't smoke, never have. I try to eat healthy, but… it's hard when you're alone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Thank you for that detailed information. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your face. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 145/88. Your heart sounds regular, but I did note some mild redness on your cheeks and neck. Lungs sound clear. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, several things could be causing this flushing. It could be something relatively benign like rosacea, especially given the redness I see. However, given your family history and slightly elevated blood pressure, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a pheochromocytoma. It's a rare tumor that can cause episodes of flushing, headache, and increased heart rate. I want to be thorough. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a chemistry panel, and levels of metanephrines and normetanephrines in both blood and urine to rule that out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and what was that other thing? Pheo… something? That sounds… serious. I… I don't know. If you think it's necessary, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Are those tests… expensive? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. A pheochromocytoma is rare, but it’s important to rule it out given your symptoms and family history. It can be serious if left untreated, but it's also very treatable. As for the cost, it will depend on the lab, but I can write the order and the lab can give you an estimate before they run the tests. I can also see if we have any resources here at the clinic that might help with the cost, or if there are labs that offer a discount for uninsured patients. I’ll also write the order for just the blood work first; the urine test is a 24-hour collection, and we can consider that later if the blood work is inconclusive. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding spicy foods and stressful situations as much as possible. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the blood test results are available, and we’ll discuss the next steps then. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better. Just the blood tests for now. And I'll try to avoid the spicy food. It's hard, sometimes. But I will. Thank you, Doctor. And if you could… if you could just let me know about the cost… I'd appreciate it. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Withycombe. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, call you with an estimate from the lab before they draw the blood. She’s very good about checking for discounts. We’ll get you scheduled for the blood draw as soon as possible. Here’s the order. The lab is just across the street. Please let Maria know if you have any questions. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment. I'll see you then. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate your help.
