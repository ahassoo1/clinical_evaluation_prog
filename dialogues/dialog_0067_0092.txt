DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Pfennig, you say? Hmm. Well, I'm here 'cause...it's hard to breathe, kinda. And my mouth feels like the desert, you know? And my eyes too. Dry. Really dry. It's been...a while now, I guess. Not sure how long, to be honest. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing and dryness in your mouth and eyes… and you’ve been experiencing this for a while. It could be related to age, but we want to figure out what’s going on. Let’s start with the breathing. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What do you mean more? It's hard to get air, that’s what! Like...when I walk, I gotta stop more often. Used to be able to walk a mile, no problem. Now? Forget about it. And sometimes, even just sitting here, I feel…winded. It’s just…not right. I don't know what else to tell you. It just is. You understand what “hard” means, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Guilds, I absolutely understand what “hard” means. It sounds very concerning that you're having to stop frequently while walking and feeling winded even at rest. It’s good you’re letting me know. To help me understand better, can you describe when it's the hardest to breathe?
PATIENT: When? Like…time of day? Doesn't matter. Morning, afternoon, night…same thing. Maybe a little worse when it's hot, I dunno. It's always kinda there though. And…after I eat sometimes. Especially if I eat a big meal. Then I really gotta slow down. It's… uncomfortable. You got air conditioning in here? It's kinda stuffy.
DOCTOR: Yes, we do have air conditioning, I can adjust the temperature if you’d like. Okay, so it’s pretty consistent throughout the day, maybe a bit worse with heat and after meals. Does it feel like you’re wheezing when you breathe, or is it more of a tightness in your chest?
PATIENT: Wheezing? What's wheezing? Is that like a whistle? No, no whistle. It feels… tight. Like someone's squeezing my chest. Not all the time, but a lot of the time. Especially when I try to take a deep breath. It’s just… difficult. This is why I don’t bother with doctors, always asking questions… I just want someone to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Guilds. Asking questions helps me understand what’s going on so I can best help you. Okay, so it’s a tightness in your chest, not a whistling sound. Do you have any pain with that tightness?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. More… discomfort. Like a heavy weight. And sometimes, it feels like I can't get enough air, and that makes me anxious, and that feels bad. But not a sharp pain, you know? Like a broken bone or something. I’ve broken a bone or two in my life, and this ain't like that. It’s just… worrying. This whole thing is worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no sharp pain, just discomfort and a feeling of not getting enough air, which makes you feel anxious. That makes perfect sense. Now, let's go back to the dryness you mentioned. You said your mouth and eyes are dry. Is that all day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: All day. Pretty much. I gotta drink water all the time. Used to not need to do that, but now… constantly. And my eyes… they burn sometimes. Like sand in 'em. I try to put drops in, but it doesn't help much. It's just…dry. And uncomfortable. Like everything is just…worn out. Even talking is hard. My throat gets scratchy. It’s a nuisance, that's what it is. A big, dry nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant dryness in your mouth and eyes, with burning sensations and a scratchy throat. You’ve noticed you’re drinking a lot more water. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh boy. Let me think… Seems like a lifetime ago. The doctor at the VA...they gave me pills for my blood pressure, years ago. But I stopped taking 'em. Made me feel dizzy. Didn’t like that. And…something about my heart, maybe? I had some tests done, but they didn’t find anything wrong, as far as I remember. Honestly, I don’t keep track of this stuff. Too much trouble. It was all a long time ago. Pills, tests, doctors… I just want to be done with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were prescribed blood pressure medication in the past but stopped due to dizziness. And you had some heart tests done, but nothing specific was found. Do you recall any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I broke my leg when I was a kid, playing baseball. They put a cast on it. That’s… a surgery, kinda. And… I had my appendix out, when I was younger. That was… unpleasant. And… oh, and they removed some moles off my back a few years ago. Small ones, nothing big. That's about it, I think. I don’t go to doctors unless I have to. This whole thing is exhausting, you know? Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken leg as a child, an appendectomy, and mole removal. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Family? My mother… she had…something with her heart. I don’t remember exactly what. She was always tired. And my father… he smoked his whole life. Coughing all the time. I think he had lung problems. And my sister… she had diabetes. She wasn't very careful with what she ate. That’s all I really remember, to be honest. Old age, you know? Memory’s not what it used to be. Don't expect me to be a walking medical encyclopedia.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Guilds. It's difficult to recall details from the past. So, heart problems in your mother, lung problems in your father, and diabetes in your sister. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not a one. I told you, I don’t like pills. They make me feel strange. I tried some vitamins a while back, but I couldn't remember to take 'em every day. Waste of money, really. I just drink water. Lots and lots of water. And maybe a little coffee in the morning. But that's it. No fancy supplements or anything like that. Simple is better, that's what I always say. Less trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements, except for a little coffee. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much whatever’s put in front of me. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes if I eat too much spicy food, but that's not an allergy. I’m a Cuban man, we eat flavorful food! I’ve never had trouble breathing from anything. Never had hives or anything like that. Honestly, I think people worry too much about allergies. It's just… a nuisance. A big, unnecessary nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Guilds, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? What's that involve? I don't like being poked and prodded. Are you gonna listen to my chest? And take my blood pressure? I told you about the blood pressure pills, they make me dizzy. As long as it's quick, I guess. But no needles, you hear? I hate needles. Just… try to be gentle, okay? Old man, easily bruised. And don't keep me waiting all day. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. I understand your concerns. We’ll take it slowly and gently. I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and I’ll check your blood pressure – we can do it just once to get a baseline, and if it's elevated, we can talk about options later. No needles today, I promise. And I’ll be as quick as possible. First, let's just have you sit comfortably in the chair. I'm going to listen to your breathing, and then your heart. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And don’t press too hard with that cold thing. It's always cold, those medical instruments. Makes me shiver. Get on with it, doctor. I haven’t got all day. My coffee's getting cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath in... and out... again... deep breath in... and out... I'm hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds on both sides, especially towards the lower lobes of your lungs. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I’m hearing a slight irregularity. Your blood pressure is 148/86. It's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Overall, your breathing sounds are a bit quiet, your heart rate is a little fast and irregular, and your blood pressure is slightly high. Is there any pain when I press on your chest?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Just... uncomfortable. Like someone's sitting on my chest. But I get that sometimes, even when you're not touching me. It's just… a tight feeling. Like I'm being squeezed. And my heart… it always feels like it’s beating too fast. Maybe it's just old age. Everything feels faster when you get old. You know, things just… wear out. And… what does “diminished” mean? Are my lungs getting smaller? Don’t tell me that. That sounds terrible. Is there something seriously wrong with me? I knew I shouldn’t have come to the doctor. It’s always bad news.
DOCTOR: "Diminished" just means they’re a little quieter than expected, Mr. Guilds. It doesn't necessarily mean your lungs are getting smaller. It can be caused by a number of things, and we need to investigate further to figure out what’s going on. I understand your concern. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the exam, I suspect a few possibilities. It could be related to your heart, your lungs, or both. The fast heart rate and irregularity, combined with the diminished breath sounds, could indicate something like atrial fibrillation – an irregular heartbeat – or possibly some early signs of heart failure or even a lung condition like COPD. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. These include an EKG to check your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Just what I needed. And what does all that mean? EKG? Chest X-ray? Blood work? Are you gonna take a whole pint of blood? I hate needles, you remember? And what about this “atrial fibrillation” and “heart failure” and “COPD”? Those sound… serious. Like death serious. You're just gonna scare an old man to death, that's what it feels like. Look, can’t you just give me something for the heart? Maybe some pills? Or a potion? Anything to make this tightness go away. I don’t want all these tests. It’s just… a nuisance. A big, stressful nuisance. Is there anything else I can do? Besides tests? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Guilds, and I apologize if I’ve caused you any worry. I don’t want to scare you. These tests are simply to help us understand what's going on and determine the best course of action. The EKG is a painless test where we place stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. The chest X-ray is a quick image of your lungs, and we only need a small amount of blood for the blood work. Regarding the terms I mentioned, atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat that can sometimes cause shortness of breath and fatigue. Heart failure doesn’t mean your heart has stopped working, it means it’s not pumping as efficiently as it should. And COPD is a lung condition that can cause breathing difficulties. But remember, these are just possibilities. We haven’t confirmed anything yet. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms. First, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity that makes you short of breath. Second, it’s important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. And third, if you smoke, quitting is the single most important thing you can do for your health. Would you be willing to consider the tests so we can get a clear understanding of what's going on?
PATIENT: Fine. Tests, tests, tests. Just get it over with. But no needles if you can avoid it. And make it quick. I don’t want to be here all day. What's the first test? And where do I go? And… who’s going to explain all this to me? I don't understand medical talk. You got to speak plain English, doctor. Plain, simple English. Otherwise, I'm just going to be more confused and worried. And one more thing… is there a bathroom nearby? I drank all that water, you know. And this whole thing is making me nervous. A very nervous old man.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds. I understand. We'll take it one step at a time. The first test is the EKG. We have a technician right here in the office who will perform it. It will only take about 10-15 minutes. They'll place a few stickers on your chest and legs, and then a machine will record your heart’s electrical activity. After that, we’ll get you scheduled for a chest X-ray at the imaging center across the street. They will also draw some blood for the lab work. And I promise, I will explain everything to you in plain English. We'll go over the results together, and I'll answer any questions you have. And yes, the bathroom is just down the hall to your left. Let's get started with the EKG, and then we can schedule the other tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. EKG first. Just get it over with. And tell that technician to be gentle. My skin is sensitive. And don't let them poke around too much. Just… quick and easy. That’s all I ask. Lead the way, doctor. And try to explain everything to me afterwards, okay? In plain English. I don’t want any fancy medical talk. Just… tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. I promise to explain everything in plain English. And I’ll make sure the technician is very gentle. "Maria, this is Mr. Guilds. He’s going to have an EKG done. Could you please be gentle with him?
PATIENT: “Of course, doctor. Hello, Mr. Guilds. We'll get you all set up. It won't take long at all. Just lie back on the table and relax. I'll explain everything as I go." "Relax? How can I relax when you're about to poke stickers all over my chest? This is a nightmare..." "Just get it over with..."
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Guilds. I’m just going to place these stickers on your chest, arms and legs. They measure your heart's electrical activity. It doesn't hurt at all, it's just a little cold. Take deep breaths for me, if you can." "We’re almost done… just a few more…" "Okay, we’re all set. Just lie still for a moment while the machine records your heart’s activity." "It will only take a few minutes."
PATIENT: “Cold… everything is so cold… and uncomfortable. This is torture, I tell you. Pure torture. And what are those beeping sounds? Are those bad signs? Don’t tell me anything bad, I can’t handle bad news. Just… get it over with. And take those stickers off afterwards, please. They're itching. And… what if something goes wrong? What if I have a heart attack right here? This is a nightmare, I tell you. A complete and utter nightmare…” "Just... hurry up..."
DOCTOR: “Mr. Guilds, everything is perfectly normal. Those beeping sounds are just the machine recording your heart’s activity. It doesn't mean anything is wrong. And I'm right here with you the whole time. If anything did happen, I would stop immediately and get the doctor. But everything is fine. Just try to relax and take deep breaths. It will only take a few more minutes." "Almost done… just a little bit longer." "Okay, we're all finished! That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: “Finished? Thank goodness. That was… horrible. Absolutely horrible. And cold. And uncomfortable. And scary. Don't ever make me do that again. Never. Just… take those stickers off now, please. And… is everything okay? Did you see anything bad? Don’t lie to me, doctor. Just tell me the truth. I can handle the truth. I think. But please… tell me everything is okay. It’s just… I don’t want to die, you know? I just want to go home and drink a cup of coffee. Is that too much to ask?”
DOCTOR: “There you go, all done. And don’t worry, Mr. Guilds. Everything looked pretty stable on the EKG. There were a few minor irregularities, but nothing to be overly concerned about right now. That’s why Dr. Pfennig wants to do the chest X-ray and blood work, just to get a more complete picture of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, just a little extra precaution. " “Dr. Pfennig will explain everything to you in detail. You’re going to be okay, Mr. Guilds. We’re just taking things one step at a time." “Let me get Dr. Pfennig for you, and she can answer all your questions."
PATIENT: “A little extra precaution… That’s what they always say. But what if it’s something serious? What if I have to have surgery? Or… take a bunch of pills? I hate pills. Just… tell me the truth. Is it bad? Is it really bad? I can handle it, I think. But please… don’t sugarcoat it. Just… be honest. And… where’s Dr. Pfennig? I want to talk to her now. I need to know what’s going on. And… is there any coffee around here? I really need a cup of coffee.” "Just... hurry up."
DOCTOR: “Hello, Mr. Guilds. Maria tells me you’re all finished with the EKG. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: "I'm… nervous. And scared. And I need a cup of coffee. But mostly nervous. And scared. What did the test show? Is it bad? Is it really bad? Just tell me the truth, doctor. I can handle it. I think. But don't sugarcoat it. Just tell me what's going on. Please." "Just... tell me."
DOCTOR: “Mr. Guilds, it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous and scared right now. I want you to know I’m here to help you, and we’ll get through this together. The EKG showed a few minor irregularities in your heart rhythm. It's called atrial fibrillation, like we discussed. It means your heart isn’t beating as regularly as it should, but it’s not an immediate emergency. Many people live full and healthy lives with atrial fibrillation. " “However, to understand why this is happening and determine the best course of action, we need to do the chest X-ray and blood work. The X-ray will help us look at your lungs, and the blood work will give us a better picture of your overall health. It could be something simple, like a minor infection, or it could be related to your heart or lungs. We won't know until we get the results." “It’s important to remember that these are just tests, and we haven’t confirmed anything yet. I understand you’re worried about surgery and pills, and we'll explore all of your options before making any decisions. My priority is to make sure you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way." “Now, let’s focus on getting the X-ray and blood work done. And then we can talk about your options. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: “Atrial fibrillation… so it’s something serious. It always is, isn’t it? Something serious. And then more tests. And waiting. I hate waiting. And what if it’s… bad? What if it’s something I can’t fix? I just want to go home and drink a cup of coffee. But… okay. Okay, let’s get it over with. But… where do I go for the X-ray? And the blood work? And… who’s going to explain everything to me afterwards? In plain English? I don’t want any fancy medical talk. Just… tell me what’s going on. Please. And… can I at least have a cup of coffee afterwards? I really need a cup of coffee.” "Just... help me."
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Guilds. I will help you. We’ll take everything one step at a time. I understand you need a cup of coffee, and we can definitely arrange that after the tests. We have a cafeteria down the hall, and I can have someone bring you one after you're finished." “Here, I’ve written down the location of the imaging center for the chest X-ray. It’s just across the street, and you can walk there. After the X-ray, you’ll go to the lab, which is right next door. They’ll draw a small sample of blood. It won’t take long." “Maria will be happy to escort you over there and make sure you get settled. And I promise, I will explain everything to you in plain English after the tests are completed. I will be here to answer any questions you have and discuss your options." “You’re not alone in this, Mr. Guilds. We’ll get through this together. Now, let’s get the tests done, and then we can talk. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: “Alright. Alright, let’s get it over with. Maria will escort me? That’s good. I don’t think I can walk across the street by myself. And you promise to explain everything in plain English? No fancy medical talk? And… a cup of coffee afterwards? That’s good. Very good.” "Okay. Lead the way. Or… let Maria lead the way. Just… get it over with. And… thank you, doctor. Thank you for helping me." "Just... hurry up."
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Guilds. Maria, could you please escort Mr. Guilds to the imaging center for his chest X-ray?
PATIENT: “Of course, doctor. Come with me, Mr. Guilds. It’s just across the street. I'll make sure you get settled and help you with anything you need.” “Let’s go. It won't take long.”
