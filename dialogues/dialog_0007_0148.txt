DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Hernandez, but you can call me Valerie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Hernandez. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. It’s about… pain. Down there. It's been bothering me for a little while now, but I haven’t really… talked to anyone about it. It’s a bit difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all. It's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, and you've come to the right place. A lot of people experience discomfort in that area, and it’s important to get it checked out. “Down there” is fine for now, but as we talk, the more specific you can be, the better I can understand what's going on. When did you first start noticing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… right. Hmm… it feels like… maybe a few weeks ago? It’s hard to say exactly. Time… it seems to slip away. I think it started gradually, just a dull ache. Now it comes and goes, but sometimes it's quite sharp. I don't remember anything specific causing it, if that makes sense. It just… started. Is that helpful? I apologize if I am being vague.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Noelani. It’s very common for things to start gradually, and it’s helpful to know it comes and goes, and that there wasn't a specific injury or event that triggered it. Can you describe the location of the pain a little more precisely?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Precisely… It's… well, it’s in my…testicles. Yes, that's the word, isn't it? One of them, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it’s radiating a little, into my… groin, I suppose. It's not constant, but when it's there, it's… uncomfortable. I hope I'm explaining it well enough. I really don't know much about…anatomy.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Noelani. Absolutely no need to apologize – you’re explaining it very well. It’s good you can pinpoint it to one testicle mostly, and that it radiates to your groin. Does anything make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Hmmm… standing for long periods, I think. Yes, that definitely makes it worse. And…when I’m doing things around the shop, you know, with the wood. Lifting things, bending over…that’s not good. Walking a lot doesn’t help either. It’s a bit difficult, because I need to do those things for my work. Is that…important? Will it keep me from working?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. So it’s aggravated by standing, lifting, bending, and walking – activities that put physical stress on that area. We’ll definitely figure out how to minimize impact on your work. That's a very valid concern. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A scale… Hmm… at its worst… it’s not unbearable, you understand. But it’s…sharp, and it makes me…catch my breath. I would say…maybe a 6? Yes, a 6 feels about right. Sometimes it's lower, like a 3 or 4, but when it flares up, it definitely gets to a 6. I don’t think I’ve ever had it higher than that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6 at its worst is good to know. And it’s helpful that it sometimes stays lower, around a 3 or 4. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, other symptoms… Well… sometimes I feel a little… tired. But I always feel a bit tired, to be honest, with the work. Hmm… and I think… maybe a little bit of swelling? But I haven’t looked closely, if that makes sense. I don’t really… examine myself, if you understand what I mean. I’m a bit embarrassed to say it, but…no, I don't think I've noticed anything else specifically.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's common not to regularly examine that area. Fatigue isn’t very specific, but the possibility of some swelling is good to know. Do you have any history of injury to your groin or testicles?
PATIENT: Oh, injury… Hmm… that’s a good question. I’ve been working with wood for…a very long time. There have been a few close calls, you know, with tools and things. But I don’t recall any direct injuries to that area. Nothing I remember needing to see a doctor for, anyway. I might have bumped it against something at some point, but nothing serious. Oh! I did fall off a ladder once, a long time ago, but I think I landed on my arm. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, landing on your arm doesn’t sound relevant. It’s good you haven’t had any direct trauma to the groin or testicles that you recall. Let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions… Hmm… well, the doctor told me my cholesterol was a little high a few years back, but I’ve been trying to eat better. And my back… it bothers me sometimes, from lifting things. But other than that… no, I don’t think so. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, if that’s helpful? I don’t… really see doctors much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Borderline high cholesterol and some back pain aren't likely related, but it's good information to have. And yes, knowing you have Medicare is helpful. Before we move to the physical exam, I’m going to ask a few more questions about your habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, smoking… No, Doctor. Never. My mother… she smoked. It wasn’t a good habit. I've always avoided it. I enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Not much of a drinker, really. I find it makes me a bit sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No smoking, and only occasional light alcohol use. Now, let’s talk about family history. Has anyone in your family – your father, brothers, or sons – ever had any issues with testicular pain, testicular cancer, or other urological problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm… that's a difficult question. My father… he passed away when I was young. I don’t remember him talking about… any of that. And I don’t have any brothers or sons. I have a few cousins, but I haven’t spoken to them in many years, so I don't know anything about their health. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Noelani. You’ve answered everything you know, and it’s not always possible to have a complete family history. Okay, before we do a quick physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Well… I’ve been feeling a little stressed lately, with the shop. It's been quiet, and I'm worried about making enough money. I know stress can cause all sorts of things…maybe that’s it? I try to stay positive, but it’s difficult sometimes. I work alone, mostly, and it can be lonely. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Noelani. Stress can absolutely contribute to physical symptoms. Okay, given everything you’ve told me, I think it’s important to do a physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. I’m going to need to examine your testicles, groin, and abdomen. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please let me know if anything is uncomfortable or if you have any questions. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's alright. I… I trust your judgment. Just please… be gentle? And explain everything, as you said. I’m a bit nervous, if you don’t mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything I'm doing before I do it. Okay, first I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. This will help me check for any abnormalities. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Any pain there?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. No pain there. Just… a little pressure. Ouch. That’s a bit tender, actually. Just there, on the… lower right side. It's not terrible, but it's noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. That tenderness on the lower right side could be related to something else, but we'll keep it in mind. Now, I'm going to examine your groin area. Please lie back comfortably. I’ll start by feeling for any swollen lymph nodes in your groin. I don't feel any significantly swollen lymph nodes on either side. Now, I’m going to examine your testicles. I'll gently lift your scrotum and feel each testicle individually. Please let me know immediately if anything is painful. Any pain on the left side?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s a bit uncomfortable. Just there… on the upper part of the left testicle. It feels… hard. Not like a normal lump, but…firm. And it's a little sensitive to the touch. It's not excruciating pain, but it's definitely something.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It’s good you told me immediately. The lump feels firm, and approximately… one centimeter in diameter. I don't feel any other lumps on the left testicle. Now, let me examine the right testicle. The right testicle feels normal in size and consistency. I don't feel any lumps or abnormalities there. Okay, Noelani. Based on the physical exam, there’s a firm lump on your left testicle. This requires further investigation. It could be a number of things, and it's important to get a definitive diagnosis.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Further investigation… that sounds… frightening. What kind of things could it be, Doctor? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Noelani. It’s good you’re asking questions. It could be a number of things. The most common possibilities include a hydrocele – a fluid-filled sac around the testicle – or a spermatocele, which is a cyst containing sperm. Less commonly, it could be a varicocele – enlarged veins within the scrotum – or, less frequently, a testicular tumor. It’s important to remember that most lumps are not cancerous. However, we need to rule out the possibility of a tumor to be sure. To do that, I recommend a scrotal ultrasound. This is a painless imaging test that will give us a clear picture of the lump and help us determine what it is. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, that sounds… less frightening than surgery. Yes, Doctor, I would be comfortable with that. When can we do it? And… how long will it take? Will I need to do anything to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM here in the clinic. It will only take about 20-30 minutes, and you don’t need to do anything special to prepare for it. No fasting or special medications are required. Just come as you are. I will also order some blood work to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. This will help us determine if any further testing is needed. After the ultrasound, we’ll review the results together and discuss the next steps. Depending on the findings, we may need to refer you to a urologist, which is a specialist in the male reproductive system. Do you have any questions about the ultrasound or the blood work?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Tomorrow at 9:00 AM for the ultrasound, and blood work as well. A urologist… that sounds a bit scary, but I suppose if it’s necessary. Will the blood work take long? And… will the insurance cover all of this? Medicare, I mean. I worry about the cost.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The blood work will only take about 15-20 minutes. We can draw it right here in the clinic after our consultation today. As for Medicare coverage, the ultrasound and blood work should be fully covered, as long as it’s deemed medically necessary. We will submit all the necessary paperwork for you. If there are any issues with coverage, our billing department will contact you directly. Now, while we wait for the results, I want you to avoid strenuous activity and lifting heavy objects. This will help prevent any further irritation or discomfort. Also, if you notice any sudden pain, redness, or swelling, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm alright. Avoiding strenuous activity… that will be difficult with the shop, but I can manage. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You've put my mind a little at ease. Let's go ahead with the blood work, then. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's head over to the lab. The phlebotomist will take care of you, and it shouldn't take long. And remember, if you feel lightheaded or faint at any point, let them know immediately. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Take a deep breath, and we'll get this done.
