DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, it’s about how I look. Always been a strong man, you see. Pile driving, hard work. But things… shift. Let’s just say I don't fill out my clothes like I used to. And it bothers me. It really does. So, can you fix it? Or what?
DOCTOR: Right. So you’re concerned about… weight loss, and how it’s affecting your appearance. I understand that’s bothering you. "Fix it" isn't quite how we approach things in medicine, Mr. Trendler, but we can investigate why this is happening. How long have you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Investigate? Look, I'm seventy-six years old! What is there to investigate? Things go down, that's what happens. But it wasn’t always like this. Maybe… six months, seven? Since my wife passed, things ain’t been the same, if you get my meaning. Eating’s not… a priority, you know? But I was a big man before, and I’d like to be again. Not asking for miracles, just… help.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, approximately six to seven months, coinciding with the loss of your wife. A change in appetite is understandable in that situation. But significant weight loss always warrants investigation, even at your age. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. Have you noticed any other changes besides the weight loss?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… let me think. Not really. I get tired easier, maybe. But I always worked hard, so tiredness ain't new. No pains, no fever, no nothin' like that. Just… smaller. And it’s depressing, to be honest. I used to be proud of how I looked, strong and capable. Now… now I look like a shadow of myself. You got a machine that can put some meat back on my bones? That's what I'm asking.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. But there isn’t a “machine” to simply add weight back on. We need to find out why you're losing weight before we can talk about solutions. Fatigue can be a symptom of a lot of things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kinda question is that? Look, I ain't here to talk about… that. I told you, I’m losing weight! I feel weak! You asking about… about going to the bathroom? This is ridiculous. I came here for a quick fix, not a… a check-up. Honestly, I don’t see what that has to do with anything. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, I am listening. And bowel habits are very relevant when investigating unexplained weight loss. It could indicate a problem with absorption, or even something more serious. I need a complete picture to provide proper care. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! No blood! Look, I ain’t a child. I know when somethin’s wrong, and I ain’t seein’ blood. You're making me nervous now. I just want to be stronger again, that's all! This is getting… intrusive. I think I'm gonna go. This ain't what I expected, not at all. You want a list of what I eat? Fine. Toast, soup, sometimes a little fish. Not a feast, but it's enough to keep me going. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. If you're unwilling to answer basic questions, it’s difficult for me to help you. However, since you’ve mentioned weight loss and fatigue, I’m going to order some blood work, just to rule out some common possibilities. We need to check your thyroid, your blood count, and your kidney and liver function. I’ll also order a stool test to rule out any internal bleeding, despite your assertion. I will also want to do a brief physical examination. Would you please allow me to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
