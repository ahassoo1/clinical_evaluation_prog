DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, um… my wife and I, we made an appointment for… the surgery? The weight loss surgery. It’s… it’s been on our minds for a while, I guess. I don't really remember all the details about why we scheduled it now, specifically. Just felt like the right time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re here to discuss weight loss surgery. That’s a big decision, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a little unsure about the specifics. Let me pull up your information… Okay, Bradlee Kochubey, age 38. I see here it’s a referral for bariatric surgery evaluation. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your weight history?
PATIENT: Um… my weight history… That’s a tough one. I’ve… always been bigger, I guess? It's been up and down, mostly up. I’ve tried diets before, you know, the usual stuff. Nothing really stuck for very long. I honestly can’t remember when I started noticing it was becoming a problem, exactly. It just… happened gradually. My wife helped me keep track of things more than I did, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. It’s common for weight to fluctuate, and it’s great that you have your wife’s support. Knowing when things started to become concerning is helpful, but it's okay if you don’t have exact dates. Can you give me a rough idea of your highest and lowest weights, even if it’s just an estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think… the highest I ever got was probably around 250, maybe a little more. And the lowest… probably around 180, when I was younger, playing sports. But that was a long time ago. These days, I’m… I think the scale said 235 last time I checked. But honestly, I try not to look at it too much. It just… makes me feel bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a highest weight around 250, lowest around 180, and currently around 235. Thank you. That gives me a good starting point. And you mentioned trying diets before. Can you tell me a bit about those?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, there was the Atkins diet, a long time ago. That was… hard. A lot of meat. And then my wife and I tried Weight Watchers for a few months. It was okay, but expensive, and it felt like a lot of work keeping track of everything. We also tried some of those meal replacement shakes, but I didn’t really like them. They didn’t keep me full for very long. Mostly, though, it was just… trying to eat less and exercise more. Which… didn’t always happen. I work a lot of hours, and it’s easy to grab fast food.
DOCTOR: Okay, Atkins, Weight Watchers, meal replacement shakes, and general diet and exercise. It sounds like you've tried a variety of approaches. It's very common for it to be difficult to maintain lifestyle changes, especially with a busy schedule. Now, I'd like to get a little more information about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My wife usually handles all the doctor stuff, so I don’t always remember. I think I’m okay. I haven't been told I have anything… serious. The doctor did mention my cholesterol was a little high last year, I think? But he said it wasn’t anything to worry about right away. And my blood pressure… I don’t know. I’ve never been told I have high blood pressure, if that helps. I do get tired easily, though. Really tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially elevated cholesterol, fatigue. It's good you mentioned the fatigue. We'll need to look into that. And have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think. They put a cast on it. And I had my appendix out when I was younger, maybe around ten years old? But other than that… not really. No serious illnesses, not that I remember. I get the occasional cold, but nothing bad. My wife might remember more details, honestly. She's got a better memory than me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and an appendectomy. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or obesity?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My dad… he had heart problems, I think. He had a heart attack when he was pretty young. And my mom… she had diabetes. Type 2, I think. And… um… my grandmother on my mother's side… she was pretty heavy her whole life. I think obesity runs in the family, yeah. On both sides, actually. It seems like a lot of health problems on both sides of the family, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. That's important information. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife always asks me that question too, and I always say no. I’m pretty lucky in that department, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bradlee. Thank you for that information. It gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to get a baseline and check your overall health. We'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just hop up on the table for me, that would be perfect. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. This will measure your blood pressure. Just relax your arm and try to breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. That's a little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly strong. Lungs are clear, but I can hear some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Pulse is 88 and regular. Reflexes are normal. Okay, Bradlee, overall your exam is fairly normal. Your blood pressure is a little high, and there's some mild tenderness in your abdomen, which we'll need to investigate further. Your heart and lungs sound okay, but we may want to do some further testing to rule out any underlying issues.
PATIENT: Okay. Further testing? What kind of testing? And what does the tenderness in my abdomen mean? Is it something serious? I… I'm getting a little nervous again. My wife is going to want to know all this, you know. She always worries so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bradlee. It's perfectly normal to be nervous when you hear things like that. The tenderness in your abdomen could be a number of things – indigestion, muscle strain, or something a bit more serious. That's why I want to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I'm thinking we should start with a complete blood count , a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a blood glucose test to check for diabetes. We might also want to do a liver function test and possibly an ultrasound of your abdomen to get a better look at your liver and gallbladder. These tests will help us rule out any underlying issues and determine the best course of action. And don't worry, we'll discuss the results with you and your wife in detail. Do you have any questions about the tests I've recommended?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s… a lot of tests. CBC, metabolic panel, lipid panel… I can’t even remember all those names. I guess it’s better to know, right? But I really don’t like being poked and prodded. And what if something is wrong? My wife… she’ll be really upset. Is it going to be expensive? We don’t have a lot of extra money for medical bills. I don't have insurance, so… I just don’t know what we’re going to do. This is all a little scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Bradlee. It is a lot to take in, and it’s completely understandable to be worried about the cost and what the results might show. Let’s break it down. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine if you’re a good candidate for bariatric surgery. We’ll also be able to identify any underlying issues that need to be addressed before we proceed. As for the cost, I’ll have my staff look into the costs of each test and see if we can offer any financial assistance or payment plans. We also have resources available to help you find low-cost testing options. We’ll do everything we can to make this affordable for you. I want to assure you that we’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll discuss the results in detail and help you make informed decisions about your health. And we’ll work with you to find the best possible treatment plan, regardless of your financial situation. Do you want me to go over each test again, so you have a better understanding of what they involve?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, please. That would be good. Just… explain it slowly. And if you could tell me approximately how much each one might cost… that would be really helpful. My wife is good with numbers, so I can relay it to her. She'll be able to figure out what we can afford. I'm just… not good with all that. Thank you, Doctor. You're being very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bradlee. It's my job. And please, don't hesitate to ask questions at any point. Okay, let's start with the Complete Blood Count, or CBC. This is a simple blood test that measures the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help us detect anemia, infection, and other blood disorders. This one typically costs around $80-$120. Next, we have the Metabolic Panel. This test measures the levels of different chemicals in your blood, such as glucose, electrolytes, and kidney and liver function tests. It can help us assess your overall health and detect problems with your kidneys, liver, and blood sugar levels. This one usually costs between $100-$150. Then there's the Lipid Panel, which measures your cholesterol levels – total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. This can help us assess your risk of heart disease and stroke. This one is generally around $70-$100. Finally, we have the Ultrasound of your Abdomen. This is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your liver, gallbladder, and other abdominal organs. It can help us detect problems with your liver, gallbladder, and other abdominal organs. This one is more expensive, usually around $300-$500, depending on the facility. These are just estimated costs, Bradlee, and the actual price may vary depending on the lab or facility. My staff will work with you to find the most affordable options. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Okay… So, the Ultrasound is the most expensive one. And the CBC is the cheapest. Got it. My wife said something about triglycerides before. Is that the one that's bad for your heart? She’s always telling me to cut back on fried food. And is the liver function test just to see if my liver is okay? I… I don’t drink much, so I don’t think that’s a problem. But I do eat a lot of sweets. Could that affect my liver? I’m just trying to figure out what’s really important here. And what happens if one of the tests shows something is wrong? Do we have to do more tests? This is a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: You’re asking all the right questions, Bradlee. It’s good you’re thinking critically about this. Yes, you are correct – triglycerides are a type of fat in your blood, and high levels can increase your risk of heart disease. Your wife is right to encourage you to cut back on fried foods – that’s a very smart move. And yes, the liver function test is to assess the health of your liver. While alcohol consumption can certainly affect the liver, so can a diet high in sugar and processed foods. It’s possible that your sweet tooth could be contributing to some mild liver inflammation, but we need to run the test to get a definitive answer. If one of the tests shows something is wrong, we would need to do further investigation. That might involve additional blood tests, imaging scans, or a referral to a specialist. It’s possible that we would need to address any underlying medical issues before we can proceed with bariatric surgery. But don't worry, we’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll explain everything to you in detail and help you make informed decisions about your care. Here’s a pamphlet that outlines the different bariatric surgery options and the pre-operative evaluation process. It might be helpful for you and your wife to review. Do you want me to schedule the blood tests for you now, or would you prefer to discuss it with your wife first?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Okay, Bradlee. It sounds like you need some time to discuss this with your wife. That’s perfectly understandable. Feel free to call the office anytime if you have any questions. And we’ll be here when you’re ready to schedule the tests. It was good meeting you, Bradlee. I wish you and your wife all the best.
