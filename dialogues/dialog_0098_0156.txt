DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Bombara, it’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good. Lots of… running to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… annoying, really. I can’t quite remember when it started, exactly. It feels like ages, but… maybe not? Sorry, I’m not very good at remembering dates.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when things started. “A bit now” is fine – we’ll try to narrow it down. And don’t apologize, it’s perfectly normal to not remember exact dates. So, this…running to the bathroom… is it more frequent than usual for you?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely more frequent. Like… a lot more. I… I think I had something similar before, years ago, and the doctor said something about… my insides not liking certain foods? I think it was something like that. But this feels… worse, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It’s just… constant. And it's messing up my work, you know? I have to keep cancelling things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more frequent than a previous episode you had some time ago. And it's impacting your work. That’s important to know. Could you describe what the…running to the bathroom… is like?
PATIENT: Um… well, it’s… watery. Really watery. And… a lot of it. Sorry to be graphic. It just… comes on suddenly sometimes, and I really have to go. It's not painful, exactly, just… urgent. And it happens several times a day, at least. Sometimes more if I eat something. I don't know… I just feel generally awful afterwards, weak and tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery, frequent, and causing you to feel weak and tired afterwards. No pain, which is good to know. And it seems to be related to eating. Do you notice any specific foods that trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I try to avoid things now, but… I think dairy? Maybe? And… bread, sometimes. It’s hard to tell, honestly. My husband tries to help me remember, but we just end up confused. I’ve been eating a lot of plain rice lately, because that seems safe. But even that sometimes… doesn't stay down, if you know what I mean. It's just… frustrating. Everything feels like a gamble.
DOCTOR: Okay, dairy and bread seem to be potential triggers, although it's not consistently clear. And even rice isn’t always well-tolerated. Let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Um… well, I've been really tired, like all the time. More tired than usual, even for me. And… my stomach kind of… hurts sometimes, but not like a sharp pain. It’s more of a cramping feeling, low down. And… I’ve lost a little bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t really weighed myself. Does that make sense? I feel… off, generally. Like something isn’t quite right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that all makes sense. Tiredness, cramping, and some weight loss… We're getting a clearer picture. Do you have any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And I don’t really feel sick to my stomach, not exactly. I just… don't feel like eating much, to be honest. Everything seems… unappealing. I'm not actively throwing up or anything, just… not hungry. And I've been really thirsty, actually. Drinking a lot of water. I just want this to stop, you know? It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds very frustrating. Alright, let’s briefly go over your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Um… well, the doctor told me a while ago I might have… something with my insides, like they weren’t absorbing food properly? I think that’s what he said. It was years ago, and I don’t remember all the details. He did some tests, and said I should be careful what I eat. And… I think he mentioned something about… inflammation? My husband says it's something called IBD, but I’ve never really understood it. I'm also married, and I have Medicare. Does that help? I'm sorry, I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Possible malabsorption and a mention of IBD – that's definitely something to investigate further. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… over-the-counter things sometimes, for headaches. And I take a multivitamin, just because my husband thinks it's a good idea. Nothing specific for my stomach, though. I tried something once, but it didn’t help. I don't even remember what it was called. Everything feels so… trial and error. It’s a mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional headache relief and a multivitamin. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat a lot of different foods, usually. Well, not lately, but… before all this started, I did. My husband is a good cook, and he likes to try new things. I’ve never had to rush to the hospital or anything, so… I don’t think I have any allergies. But I’m not completely sure, to be honest. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… well, my mum… she had a lot of stomach problems, actually. She was always complaining about being bloated and uncomfortable. And my dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. No one else, really. They're all… pretty healthy, I think. But my mum's stomach… it was always giving her trouble. It was just… something she always dealt with. I don't know if that helps. It feels like everyone has something, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. A family history of stomach problems, particularly your mother's. Alright, Jase, I think I have a pretty good understanding of what's going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listening to your stomach and feeling around a bit. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? I'm happy to do whatever tests you need. Just… please be gentle? My stomach’s been a bit sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just relax and take deep breaths. Okay. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, but they are a little…hyperactive. And it's a little tender in the lower abdomen, on both sides. Not acutely painful, but definitely sensitive. No masses that I can feel at this point. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a bit uncomfortable, yes. But not awful. It’s just… that’s where it feels the worst, usually. So, what does that mean? Is it… serious? I’m getting a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase. Based on what you've told me, your history, and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a flare-up of some sort of inflammatory bowel condition. The tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds suggest irritation in the intestines. Given your mother’s history and the previous mention of possible malabsorption, it’s likely this could be IBD – either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However, it’s important to remember this is just a preliminary assessment. To get a definitive diagnosis, we’ll need to do some further testing. I'm going to order a stool sample to check for inflammation and rule out any infections. I’d also like to order some blood work to check your levels of certain markers that can indicate inflammation, as well as rule out any deficiencies. And, I believe a colonoscopy and endoscopy would be necessary to visualize the lining of your intestines and get a biopsy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s a lot. A colonoscopy and… endoscopy? Are those… painful? I’m not very good with hospitals, and that sounds… scary. And blood work is fine, I guess, but… everything else sounds really intense. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe just try some different foods for a while? I'm just… a bit scared of all that.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension completely, Jase. It is a lot, and I apologize for overwhelming you. A colonoscopy and endoscopy are definitely more involved procedures, but we’ll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. You’ll be sedated during both, so you won’t feel any pain. It’s more of an uncomfortable sensation afterward, but we’ll manage that with medication. While we could try a food elimination diet, it’s often not very effective on its own, and it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact triggers. More importantly, it could delay getting you the proper diagnosis and treatment. Untreated IBD can lead to complications, so it’s important to rule out those possibilities. However, I completely respect your concerns. If you'd prefer, we can start with the stool sample and blood work first, and then discuss the colonoscopy and endoscopy again after we have those results. That way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be much better. Just the tests first, and then we can talk about everything else later. I just… need some time to process it, you know? I'm not very good with medical stuff. And I need to talk to my husband. He's always been good at understanding these things. So, yes, just the tests for now, please. That sounds much more manageable.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s perfectly reasonable. We'll start with the stool sample and blood work. I'll give you the orders for those now, and explain the process. The stool sample needs to be collected in a specific container, and you'll need to drop it off at the lab within a certain timeframe. The blood work can be done at any lab, and you can do it fasting or non-fasting, depending on which tests we order. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they come back. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week sounds good, I think. As long as it’s… not too early? My husband works mornings. Um… and thank you, Dr. Bombara. For explaining everything, and not making me feel… stupid. I really appreciate it. I just… I’m a bit scared, but I feel a bit better knowing we're getting to the bottom of it. I think that’s all for now? I’ll try to get the tests done as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all. And absolutely, call if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools. Here’s a pamphlet with some general information about IBD. It might be helpful for you and your husband. I think that’s all for today. Please take care of yourself, and I’ll see you next week. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Bombara. I will. I appreciate everything. .
