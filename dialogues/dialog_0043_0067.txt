DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just…pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s…hard to explain exactly where, though. Somewhere in my chest, I think. It's been happening for a little while now, but it feels worse today. I just want to get it checked out, if you don’t mind. I don’t like feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. Pain is never something you should just ignore. It’s good you came in to get it checked. You mentioned the pain worsens with deep breaths, and is located somewhere in your chest. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm…describe it… It’s not…sharp, not like a cut. More…dull? Aching, maybe? And kinda…tight. Like someone’s squeezing my chest a little. It doesn't go all the way through to my back, if that makes sense. I don't really remember if it comes and goes, or just stays. Old age, you know? Things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. Dull, aching, and tight – a squeezing sensation. And it’s primarily in the chest, not radiating to your back. It's perfectly alright that details aren’t crystal clear; we’ll work through it together. Now, about how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. A few weeks, maybe? Or was it longer? I’ve been so busy with…well, I can’t even remember what I’ve been busy with these days! It started small, just a little discomfort. Now it’s…noticeable. I really don’t keep track of time very well anymore. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Ruocco. It's very common for memory to shift as we get older. “A few weeks” gives us a starting point. Has anything specific made it worse over those few weeks?
PATIENT: Worse… Not that I recall, no. I’ve been doing pretty much the same things. Some light work around the house…nothing too strenuous. I used to do a lot of construction, you know, building things…but that was a long time ago. Maybe…maybe walking up the stairs makes it a little harder to breathe. But I always walk up the stairs, so I don’t know if that’s new. I just get tired easier now, I guess. It’s hard to say. Everything feels a little harder these days.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no specific event triggered it, and it seems to be somewhat consistent, perhaps slightly worsened by exertion like walking up the stairs. Now, Mr. Ruocco, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any cough, fever, or shortness of breath along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: No cough, no fever. Shortness of breath…sometimes. Not all the time. It’s more like…I get winded easier. Like I said, everything is harder. But I haven’t been feeling sick, if that makes sense. No chills, no stuffy nose…just this pain and feeling tired. I haven't been sleeping very well either, come to think of it. But I don't know if that's related. I toss and turn a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, no cough, fever, or significant shortness of breath, just increased breathlessness with exertion, chest pain, fatigue, and some difficulty sleeping. Now, have you ever had any medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… Oh, goodness…that’s a long time ago. I think…I think the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high, a long time ago. And something with my cholesterol, maybe? They gave me some pills for it, but I stopped taking them. Too many pills, you know? And…and my wife, she always took care of all the paperwork. After she passed…I just don't keep track of these things. I’m sorry, Doctor. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. It's understandable, especially after such a loss. High blood pressure and cholesterol in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Like I said, I stopped taking everything after…well, after my wife passed. Too many things to remember, and I didn't feel like keeping track of it all. I just try to take it easy, eat a little bit better…but honestly, it’s hard. I mostly just try to get through the day. I don’t like bothering people, so I don’t usually go to the doctor unless something’s really wrong. And this…this is starting to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember. I used to eat anything, everything. But my stomach's been a little sensitive lately…but I don’t know if that’s an allergy or just…old age again. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering these things. I just hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had heart problems, lung problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s…difficult. My wife's family, they were all pretty healthy, I think. But my side…we didn’t talk much about health. We were Hmong, you know? We didn’t really go to the doctor much. My father…he worked very hard, construction work, like me. He died young, from…something. I don’t remember what. And my mother…she lived a long life, but she always had…aches and pains. Just old age, I think. I don't really know if there was anything…serious. Sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It was a different time, a different way of life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It's alright. That gives me some information to work with. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your chest. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just…be gentle, if you could. My chest is a little tender. I’m ready when you are. I just want to know what's going on. And hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today. I’m listening to your heart now. I hear a regular rhythm, but there’s a mild murmur. This is something we’ll want to investigate further. Now, listening to your lungs…Your breath sounds are a little quiet in the lower parts of your lungs, and I hear a little wheezing when you breathe out. And finally, I’m gently feeling your chest…There is some tenderness when I press here in the lower part of your chest. Overall, Mr. Ruocco, your exam findings show elevated blood pressure, a mild heart murmur, slightly diminished breath sounds, and tenderness to your chest. Given your symptoms and these findings, I would like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and…EKG? What will those show? Is it something serious, Doctor? I just want to know what's going on. And…how much will it cost? I don’t have much money, you know. I’m on a fixed income. I just want to get this pain figured out, and I don’t want a big bill. I appreciate you checking me out, but I'm a little worried now. This is starting to sound expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. It’s completely reasonable to be worried about costs. Let me explain what these tests will show, and we can discuss the financial aspects afterward. An EKG – or electrocardiogram – is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It can help us identify any irregularities in your heart rhythm or signs of a heart attack. A chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart. It can help us identify any pneumonia, fluid buildup, or other abnormalities that might be causing your pain. These tests will help us determine the cause of your chest pain and guide the appropriate treatment. As for the cost, I understand you're on a fixed income. We do have a financial assistance program available for patients who qualify. I will have my staff speak with you after the consultation to discuss your options and explore any available discounts or payment plans. I will also write down some local resources for low-cost medical care. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done to get to the bottom of your pain. Do you have any other concerns about the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: Financial assistance…that’s good to hear. I appreciate that, Doctor. I really do. It's just…I don’t like surprises. No, I don’t think I have any other questions about the tests right now. If you think it’s important, then let’s do them. I just want to know what’s going on. And hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. When can I get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to know if I need to worry about something right away. I worry a lot, you know. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I can order the tests right away. The radiology department is located just down the hall. They’ll need a few minutes to prepare, and the tests themselves shouldn’t take long – maybe 15-20 minutes combined. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. Once I have them, I will call you immediately to discuss them and explain the next steps. If anything urgent comes up on the tests, we will let you know right away. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Before you go, I want to give you a written summary of our discussion and the tests I'm ordering. It will also include a list of warning signs to watch out for. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. I'll go down the hall and get the tests done now. And I'll be sure to call if anything feels worse. Thank you again. I guess I'll see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. We’ll be in touch soon. .
