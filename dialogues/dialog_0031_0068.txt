DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Sasha. It’s… well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up, you see. After the… the treatment. It’s not painful painful, but it’s… big. And it worries me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sasha. I understand. Your leg is swelling after some treatment, and that’s concerning you. Can you tell me a little more about this treatment?
PATIENT: It was for… the cancer. They said it was… in my breast. I had… lots of things. Pills, mostly. And then… the radiation. It was… a while ago now. Maybe… two years? It's hard to keep track, you know? I just want it to stop swelling. It makes it hard to wear my shoes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Two years post-treatment for breast cancer. That gives us a good starting point. And the swelling is primarily in one leg, making it difficult to wear your shoes. Has the swelling been gradual, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It started… little bit at the ankle. I thought it was just from walking too much. But it’s… gone up my calf now. It’s bigger in the mornings, usually. And if I sit for a long time. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Sasha. And don’t worry about explaining – you’re doing just fine. Swelling that’s worse in the mornings and after sitting is helpful information. Do you notice any changes in the color or temperature of your leg compared to your other leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… color… I don’t think so. Maybe a little… reddish? But I’m not sure. It’s hard to see. And… temperature? No, it doesn't feel different. Both my legs feel… like legs, you know? I am not sure if that helps. It’s just… puffy. Very puffy.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Sasha. The information you're providing is very helpful. "Puffy" is a good way to describe it. We're trying to get a clear picture. Have you experienced any pain in your leg – even mild pain or discomfort – alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, no pain pain. Sometimes it feels… heavy. Like I’m dragging it around. And… a little achy, maybe, if I’ve been on my feet all day. But not a sharp pain, or anything. Mostly just… annoying. It's more the swelling, really. I just want it to go down.
DOCTOR: Alright, no sharp pain, just heaviness and occasional achiness. And the primary concern is the swelling itself. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Besides the breast cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… I had a little bit of trouble with my blood pressure, years ago. But they gave me some pills for it, and it’s been okay since then. Nothing else, really. Just… getting old, I guess! And… I don’t have diabetes. I try to eat healthy, you know? Mostly. I do like my chocolate. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Chocolate is perfectly acceptable in moderation, Sasha. And it’s good to hear your blood pressure is managed with medication. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Names… I’m terrible with names. Let me think… It’s a little white pill. Small. I take it every morning. I get it… from the pharmacy, of course. They know me there, very well! I really don't know the name. I just ask for my pills, and they give them to me. Is that bad? I should probably write it down, shouldn't I? I'm always forgetting things these days.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Sasha. It's not uncommon to forget medication names. We can certainly look it up in our system – I'll check your medication list shortly. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past, other than those related to your breast cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had my tonsils out too. But that was ages ago. Nothing else. Just… the cancer things. And the appendix. And the tonsils. That's it, I think. Are we getting anywhere? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Sasha. This is all very helpful information. Appendix and tonsils removed long ago, and the cancer treatments are the most recent. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh my. Family history… That's a tricky one. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. And my brother… he had diabetes. But everyone in my family… they all just… get old! I don’t know if anyone had… leg problems, or anything like that. It's a big family, you know? I don’t keep track of everything. Sorry. Is this important? I'm getting a little tired now.
DOCTOR: It is alright, Sasha. We are making progress. Family history of heart trouble and diabetes is good to know. Don’t worry about not remembering everything – we’re just trying to get a complete picture. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Never. I can't stand the smell of it. My husband… he used to smoke, a long time ago. But he stopped, thankfully. I always told him it was terrible for his health. I’ve always been a healthy person. Well, mostly healthy. Except for the cancer, of course. And getting old. But no smoking, never!
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Sasha. And good to hear your husband stopped smoking. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little bit. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing fancy. Just… a little bit. I don't drink very often, really. Maybe once or twice a week. It helps me relax, you know? But it’s not a habit. I’m not a big drinker. Does that make sense? I just like a little bit of wine sometimes.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Sasha. Occasional, moderate wine consumption. Now, one final question about your lifestyle. How much physical activity do you typically get in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, not enough, I’m afraid. I used to walk a lot, before my leg started swelling. But now… it’s difficult. I try to do a little bit of gardening, but it’s tiring. Maybe… a little bit of walking on good days. But not much. I mostly sit, I’m afraid. I used to be very active. But… things change, you know? It’s hard getting old.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sasha. It’s completely normal for activity levels to change. Now, before we move on, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me think… The blood pressure pill, of course. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis. My hands get achy, you know? Just when it’s cold. It's a little blue pill. But I don't take it every day. Only when I need it. And… I think that’s it. Just the two. The blood pressure and the arthritis pill. Is that all? I’m trying to remember everything. It’s so much! And… my memory isn’t what it used to be. Sorry!
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Sasha. Two medications: blood pressure and an as-needed pill for arthritis. It’s perfectly alright that you’re not remembering everything perfectly. Now, would you mind if I examined your leg?
