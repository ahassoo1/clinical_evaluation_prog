DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my foot. This sore… it just won’t heal. Been at it for weeks now, and frankly, I’ve seen better. It’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent sore can certainly be a nuisance, especially when it interferes with your daily life. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Interferes? It’s more than interferes, young man. It prevents. I used to take my morning walks, you know. Every day, rain or shine. Now? Now I’m stuck inside, watching the dust gather. And it hurts. A sharp, burning kind of hurt. Not like a simple scrape, mind you. It's... complicated. I have the sugar, you see. My late husband, God rest his soul, he had it too. Runs in the family, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that, Mrs. Cannington. So, you’ve noticed a sore on your foot that’s been present for several weeks, causing a sharp, burning pain, and it’s impacting your ability to walk. And you mentioned a family history of diabetes, which you also have. That’s important information. Could you tell me where exactly on your foot the sore is located?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not just a sore, Doctor. It’s… on the bottom, mostly. Near the heel, but spreading, you see? It’s quite unsightly, really. And it’s not like those little cuts you get from new shoes. This is… deep. And red. Very red. I've tried everything, you know. Ointments, bandages… even that tea tree oil my niece recommended. Nothing seems to touch it. Honestly, I suspect it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. A sore on the bottom of your foot, near the heel, that is red and appears to be spreading despite your efforts to treat it with various ointments and remedies. That does sound concerning, Mrs. Cannington. To get a better understanding, could you describe the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: A scale? Really, Doctor? I don’t have time for scales. But, fine. If you must know… on a good day, maybe a six. But when I try to put any weight on it? Eight, easily. Sometimes nine. It feels like someone is sticking pins into it. And it throbs. Constant throbbing. It’s quite… distracting. It keeps me up at night, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Cannington. A pain level of six on a good day, increasing to eight or nine with weight-bearing, and constant throbbing. That’s very helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms associated with the sore?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? It hurts. Isn't that symptom enough? But… let me think. Well, my foot does feel a bit warm sometimes. Not feverish, mind you, just… warmer than my other foot. And it’s a little swollen, I suppose. Not terribly, but… noticeable. And the skin around it feels… funny. Sort of numb, but also… tender? It's a strange sensation, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm to the touch, some swelling, and a strange sensation of numbness combined with tenderness around the sore. That’s all very important information, Mrs. Cannington. To get a complete picture, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, as I said, the sugar. Been managing it for… oh, forty years now, at least. Mostly with pills, though I did try the shots for a while. Didn’t like them one bit. High blood pressure too, but that's under control with medication. Had my gallbladder out years ago. And a hip replacement, about fifteen years back. That’s the big stuff, I suppose. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious. I try to stay healthy, you know. I really do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Cannington. That’s helpful. So, you have a history of diabetes for forty years, managed with oral medication, high blood pressure controlled with medication, a previous cholecystectomy, and a hip replacement fifteen years ago. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see... besides the pills for the sugar and the blood pressure? I take a calcium supplement, for my bones. Doctor said I should. And… oh, yes. A little fish oil. My daughter swears by it. Says it’s good for everything. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, you know. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you are also taking a calcium supplement, fish oil, and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can’t stand shellfish, but that’s a preference, not an allergy. And I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s just a mild reaction. Nothing serious enough to require medication, you understand. I’ve never had a true allergic reaction, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Cannington. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to take a look at your foot, if that’s alright with you. Could you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Finally. About time you wanted to look at it. Honestly, young man, I thought you were just going to interrogate me all day. Yes, yes, I’ll take my shoe off. Be warned, it’s not a pretty sight.
DOCTOR: Please, take your time. And don't worry, we'll figure out what's going on. If you could sit on the examination table, that would be helpful.
PATIENT: Oh, my. This is a bit high, isn't it? There. Now, be gentle, Doctor. It’s quite sensitive, as you know. And don’t be alarmed by the smell. I've been trying to keep it clean, but… it’s not easy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Cannington. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And don’t worry about the smell, that’s perfectly understandable. Okay, I’m just going to take a look now. The sore is located on the plantar aspect of your heel, approximately two centimeters in diameter. There is significant erythema and edema surrounding the wound. Palpation reveals tenderness to the touch, and the wound appears to extend deeper than the surface layers of the skin. I also notice some purulent drainage. The surrounding skin is warm to the touch. Your pulses are present, but diminished in your left foot compared to your right.
PATIENT: Purulent drainage? Diminished pulses? Now you’re scaring me, young man. What does all that mean? Is it serious? I just want this thing to heal, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? And frankly, those words aren’t very reassuring.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mrs. Cannington, and I apologize if my terminology was alarming. Let me explain. Purulent drainage simply means there is some pus present in the wound, which indicates an infection. Diminished pulses mean the blood flow to your foot is slightly reduced, which can hinder the healing process, particularly with diabetes. It does sound like there is an infection present, and the reduced blood flow is something we need to address. It is serious, but we can manage it. This is not uncommon in patients with diabetes, and with appropriate treatment, we can work to get this wound healed. To determine the extent of the infection, I'd like to order some lab work, including a complete blood count and a wound culture. We will also need to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Lab work? An X-ray? Oh, goodness. This is getting more complicated by the minute. Well, I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I don’t like the sound of it, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. Though you’re not making me feel any better, I must say. What kind of treatment are we talking about? And will it be painful? I’ve had enough pain, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mrs. Cannington. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to minimize any discomfort. The lab work will help us identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, so we can choose the most effective antibiotic. The X-ray will help us rule out any deeper infection in the bone. Treatment will likely involve a course of oral antibiotics to fight the infection. We’ll also need to aggressively manage the wound with regular dressings and debridement – that means removing any dead or infected tissue. Depending on the severity of the infection and the blood flow, we may need to consider offloading the pressure on your foot, which could involve a special boot or cast. In terms of pain, the debridement can be uncomfortable, but we can use local anesthesia to numb the area beforehand. The antibiotics should also help reduce the pain and inflammation over time. We’ll manage your pain as needed with appropriate medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Anesthesia… antibiotics… special boots… It’s all so much. I just wanted a simple ointment, Doctor. But, alright. If you think it’s the only way. I suppose I have no choice. But please, be gentle. And explain everything to me, step by step. I don’t want any surprises. And how long is all this going to take? I have a garden to tend, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mrs. Cannington. I promise to explain everything to you every step of the way, and we’ll work at a pace that you’re comfortable with. The duration of treatment will depend on the severity of the infection and how well you respond to antibiotics. Typically, a course of antibiotics lasts for about one to two weeks, but we’ll need to monitor your progress closely. Wound healing can take several weeks to months, especially with reduced blood flow. We’ll also need to address the underlying factors contributing to the reduced blood flow, such as managing your diabetes and ensuring good circulation. I’m going to have my nurse draw some blood for the lab work and schedule an X-ray. Once we have the results, we can develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic to start immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A broad-spectrum antibiotic… Will it interact with my calcium supplement? And what about the fish oil? My daughter would have a fit if I stopped taking that. And will I need a special diet? Honestly, Doctor, it’s all so confusing. And what if it doesn’t work? What if this thing just keeps getting worse?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mrs. Cannington. Let's address them one by one. The broad-spectrum antibiotic we’re prescribing has a low risk of interacting with your calcium supplement or fish oil. However, it’s always best to be cautious. I’m going to recommend temporarily stopping the fish oil while you’re on antibiotics, as it can sometimes have a mild blood-thinning effect, and we want to ensure optimal wound healing. You can resume it after you’ve completed the antibiotic course. Regarding diet, there's no specific diet required for this infection. However, maintaining a healthy diet rich in protein and vitamins is always beneficial for wound healing and overall health. It's also crucial to control your blood sugar levels, as high blood sugar can hinder the healing process. Now, you asked about what if it doesn't work. It's important to be realistic, Mrs. Cannington. In some cases, the infection may not respond to initial antibiotics. If that happens, we may need to consider a different antibiotic, or in rare cases, hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics and further evaluation. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and if we don’t see improvement within a few days, we’ll re-evaluate the treatment plan. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get this wound healed, and I'll be with you every step of the way. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose not. But promise me, Doctor, you’ll explain everything. Don’t use those big words. And if I start feeling worse, I want to know right away. And please, be gentle. I’m an old woman, you know. My body doesn’t heal like it used to.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Mrs. Cannington. I will explain everything in plain language, and I’ll always be here to answer your questions and address your concerns. If you start feeling worse at any time, please don’t hesitate to call my office immediately. We are here to help. And you are right, your body doesn’t heal like it used to, and we’ll take that into consideration throughout the treatment process. We’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m going to have my nurse come in and draw your blood and get you scheduled for that X-ray. In the meantime, I’ll write you that prescription. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get it over with, I suppose. And thank you, Doctor. For being patient with an old woman.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Cannington. It was my pleasure. I'll have the nurse come in right away. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns after you leave today. We’ll take good care of you.
