DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. Uh… my sinus? It been… not good. Like, stuffy. And… a little pain, maybe? I don't remember exactly when it start. A while now, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I understand you've been experiencing sinus issues – stuffiness and some pain. When you say “a while now,” could you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh… specific… hmm. Maybe… two, three months? It hard to say. Things get… mixed up sometimes. It not so bad I had to come, but it not going away either. Just… there.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's often difficult to pinpoint the exact start date of an ongoing issue. So, it's been approximately two to three months of persistent stuffiness and some pain in your sinuses. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It come and go. More when… when the air is very dry, maybe? Or if I bend over. Not like a bad pain, Doctor. Just… a pressure. Like something is full in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pressure is intermittent, and seems to be worsened by dry air or bending over. And you describe it as a feeling of fullness rather than sharp pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the stuffiness and pressure?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Sometimes… my head feels heavy. Like when you have a cold, but not the cold itself. No fever. And… I think I cough a little more than usual? But maybe that just the dust. We live close to the oil fields, you know. It’s very dusty.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing some heaviness in your head and perhaps a slight increase in coughing, but no fever. You also mentioned living near the oil fields and the potential for dust exposure. That’s helpful information. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any recent colds or upper respiratory infections?
PATIENT: Recent… colds? Uh… I don’t remember being sick sick. Maybe a little sniffle here and there, but nothing bad. My husband, he get sick sometimes, but I think I just get a little tired. I don't usually catch what he has. It been a long time since I was really, really sick, I think. Maybe last winter? But I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been potentially since last winter since you experienced a full-blown cold. And you generally don’t get sick as easily as your husband. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as asthma, allergies, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… I don’t think so. I never been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups when I was young. My husband, he has some problems with his… his back. But me? No. No asthma, no allergies… I don't think I am allergic to anything. I eat all kinds of food. Never had a problem. I don’t take any medicine, either. Unless you count the pain pills sometimes for my… for when I pull something working. But not right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no known medical conditions and you aren't currently taking any medications regularly, except for occasional pain relievers. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, never. No surgeries. And no hospital… not really. When I had my babies, of course, but that not… that not a real hospital stay, is it? Just for a few days. But other than that, no. Never been sick enough for surgery or… a long hospital stay. I always been pretty strong.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. You’ve had your children, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, regarding your family history – do any of your close family members have any significant medical conditions, such as allergies, asthma, sinus problems, or other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Family… My mama… she had… problems with her stomach. Always hurting. But I don't know what kind of problems. She never went to the doctor much either. And my papa… he worked hard all his life. Strong man. He got sick when he was old, but it was just… old age. Nothing special. My husband's family… they all pretty healthy, I think. No one has allergies or… sinus problems that I know of. It been a long time since we talked about it. We just don't talk about sick things. It bad luck, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common in some families to avoid discussing health concerns. So, it sounds like there isn't a strong family history of allergies, asthma, or sinus problems. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me about any allergies you might have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I told you, I don’t think I have any. I eat everything. Shellfish, peanuts, all kinds of fruit. Never had a reaction. And no allergies to medicine… I haven’t taken much medicine in my life, so I wouldn’t know. I don’t wear perfume, and I don't use fancy soaps. Just plain soap. I don't think I am allergic to anything. But… if I touch poison ivy, I get a rash. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, a reaction to poison ivy counts as an allergy. It's good to know. So, no known drug allergies, food allergies, or environmental allergies other than a reaction to poison ivy. Okay, Ms. Boham, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam now to listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle? I get nervous when people touch my face.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Boham. I will be as gentle as possible. Your nasal passages appear somewhat congested, with mild swelling of the mucous membranes. Palpation of your sinuses reveals tenderness over your frontal sinuses. Your lungs sound clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Your heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits. Based on this initial examination, it appears you may be experiencing sinusitis, or inflammation of your sinuses. However, to rule out other possibilities and determine the best course of treatment, I would like to order a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Sinusitis… that sounds like… what I have? Okay. A blood test? Is that… painful? I don't like needles. But… if you think it is important, I will do it. I want to feel better. But… how much will it cost? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the needle. The blood draw itself will cause a brief pinch, but it’s usually very quick. Regarding the cost, a CBC typically ranges between $30 and $70, depending on the lab. Since you don’t have insurance, we can discuss options for payment or potentially find a lower-cost lab in the area. I’ll also document this on the order form so the lab can work with you on a price. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the CBC, and we can discuss the cost options further?
PATIENT: Okay… $30 to $70… I can manage that. Maybe. Yes, Doctor. Please order the blood test. And… thank you for thinking about the cost. It worries me, you know? I just want to know what is wrong and… get better. I have work to do. I am a rotary drill operator, you see. It hard work, and I need to be strong.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Boham. It's good to be proactive about your health, and I’m glad we can work together to find a solution. Alright, I've ordered the CBC. The lab is located just down the street – here's a requisition form and directions. They typically don’t require an appointment for routine blood work. The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. While we await the results, I recommend over-the-counter saline nasal rinses to help clear congestion and a warm compress applied to your sinuses to relieve pressure. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?
PATIENT: Saline nasal rinses… and a warm compress. Okay. Saline… like, salt water? I think I have some salt at home. And a warm compress… a wet cloth? Is that right? I think I understand. No, I don’t have any questions right now. Is just… waiting for the results? And hoping it is not too bad. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Saline rinses are simply salt water and a warm compress is a warm, wet cloth applied to your forehead and cheeks. And you are very welcome, Ms. Boham. I understand it can be stressful waiting for results, but we will review them together as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever. Here's my contact information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have been very helpful. I will call if I get worse. And I will try the salt water and the warm cloth. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. I hope you feel better soon. You have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
