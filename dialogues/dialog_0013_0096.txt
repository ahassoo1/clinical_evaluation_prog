DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Morenomartinez, good to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit strange, actually. I’ve been really bothered by the light lately. Like, really bothered. It feels like everything is too bright, even on cloudy days. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s making it hard to get anything done.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is strange, and definitely something we should look into. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about three or four weeks now. It started gradually, I thought I just needed to adjust my screen brightness or something. But it’s gotten worse, and it’s not just screens. Sunlight, even the lights in the grocery store… they just feel really intense. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: No, that's a good description, actually. Intense is helpful. And it's good you noticed it wasn't just one thing, like the screens. Does it cause you any pain, or is it more just discomfort?
PATIENT: It's not pain, thankfully. It's… discomfort is a good word. Like my eyes are really strained, and I get headaches sometimes after being in bright light for a while. Not terrible headaches, but enough to notice. And I find myself squinting a lot. It makes my eyes feel tired too, even after a good night's sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, strained eyes, headaches, squinting, and fatigue… That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any changes in your vision otherwise?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, I don’t think so. Everything still looks clear, as far as I can tell. I had my eyes checked a couple of years ago, and everything was fine then. I haven't noticed anything blurry or spots or anything like that. Just the brightness bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the check-up a couple of years ago. And no other vision changes. Have you had any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been feeling a bit more tired overall, but honestly, who isn’t these days? It’s hard to say if that’s connected. No rashes, no fever, nothing like that. Just the light sensitivity and the tiredness. Oh! And I guess… I've been a little more irritable than usual. My wife… well, my late wife used to always tell me when I was being grumpy, and I think I've been a bit like that lately. But again, could just be stress.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness and some irritability. It's good you’re able to connect that to a baseline—knowing how you normally are is helpful. And I appreciate you mentioning your wife; loss is incredibly stressful. Let's talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was pretty healthy, always have been. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. Just the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. I do have Medicare, so I’ve had regular check-ups over the years. As for allergies… I think I’m allergic to dust, but that’s about it. Nothing major. I haven’t had any surgeries or been hospitalised for anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know—a healthy history is helpful. And no known allergies beyond dust. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to stay away from medications if I can. I’ll take something for a headache if it’s really bad, like ibuprofen, but that’s maybe once or twice a year. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements, and I haven't been taking anything new lately. Just… trying to get through the days, really. It’s hard sometimes, without… well, never mind. It's not relevant.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Arbin, and I appreciate you sharing. Grief can manifest in many ways. Okay, so no regular medications. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your family history. Do you have any family members with eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family is… spread out, and we don’t talk as much as we should. I know my mother had cataracts when she got older, but that was pretty common, I think. I don’t know of anyone with glaucoma or macular degeneration, no. My father… he passed away when I was young, so I don’t really know much about his medical history. It’s all a bit hazy, honestly. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Cataracts are common with age, and it’s understandable you don’t have a full picture of your family history. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your vision, check your pupils, and look at the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It doesn’t hurt, just relax and look straight ahead. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you need me to. I’m just hoping we can figure out what’s going on. It’s just… really unsettling, this light sensitivity. Alright, let’s get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, your visual acuity is 20/25 in both eyes, which is slightly reduced, but not drastically so. Now, let me check your pupils… Your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, but they are a bit smaller than I would expect. The retinas appear normal with good blood vessel health, but I am noticing some mild pallor of the optic disc… which means it looks a little paler than it should. It’s subtle, but worth noting.
PATIENT: Okay… mild pallor, you said? What does that mean exactly? Is that… bad? I’m probably worrying too much, but it’s just… hard not to when you start talking about things being pale. And 20/25 isn’t great, is it? I used to have perfect vision.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Arbin. The pallor of the optic disc can indicate a few things. It means there’s less blood flow to the optic nerve, which transmits signals from your eye to your brain. It's not necessarily bad immediately, but it needs further investigation. As for the 20/25 vision, it's a slight reduction, yes, and a change from perfect vision is always something we want to look into. It could be many things, from simple fatigue to something more specific. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a blood test – a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a vitamin B12 level. Vitamin deficiencies can sometimes cause optic nerve issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests are fine. Anything that might help figure this out. Anemia and vitamin deficiencies… I don’t know much about that. Is that common? And… would those explain the light sensitivity? I’m just trying to understand what we’re looking at here. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a bit better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. It’s important to me that you understand what’s going on. Anemia – a low red blood cell count – and vitamin deficiencies can cause light sensitivity, fatigue, and even changes in vision. They don't always explain it, but they’re good places to start. While we wait for the blood test results, I’m also going to recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more comprehensive eye exam. They can do more specialized testing to rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable. An ophthalmologist, okay. More tests, more checking. It’s a bit overwhelming, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. And thank you, again, for being so patient and explaining everything so well. It really does help. When should I expect the blood test results? And how do I go about scheduling the appointment with the ophthalmologist?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad to hear that you feel comfortable with the plan. The blood test results usually come back within 2-3 business days. The nurse will call you with the results as soon as they are available. As for the ophthalmologist, I have a referral form here that I'll fill out. I'll give it to you along with a list of ophthalmologists in the area who accept your Medicare insurance. You can call their office directly to schedule an appointment. I recommend doing that sooner rather than later, just to get it on the calendar. In the meantime, if your light sensitivity worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms like blurry vision or eye pain, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I really appreciate it. I’ll call the nurse to check on the blood test results in a few days, and I’ll schedule the appointment with the ophthalmologist. Thank you again for your time and help. I feel a lot better knowing we’re getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you again soon.
