DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor. It’s this… well, it’s a bit o’ morning sickness, really. Not the kind the ladies get, mind ye, but that’s what it feels like. Been happenin' for a few weeks now, mostly right after I get up. Makes it hard to get goin’ in the mornin’, it does.
DOCTOR: Okay, “morning sickness” – nausea and vomiting, primarily in the mornings, for a few weeks now. And you said this is interfering with your ability to start your day?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Not proper vomiting every time, mind ye. More like a right bad churning in my gut and feelin' like I might be sick. But it’s enough to put me off my breakfast and… well, just generally feelin' dreadful. It’s been gettin’ a wee bit worse, if I’m honest. Been feelin’ a bit… weak along with it, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, nausea, sometimes with vomiting, worse in the mornings, and now some weakness as well. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I’ve been tryin’ to think on that. Not really, no. Seems to happen no matter what I eat the night before, or if I eat nothin’ at all. Drinkin' a cup o’ tea doesn’t seem to make it worse, but it doesn’t help much either. Layin' down for a bit sometimes settles it, but only after it’s already passed, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear dietary triggers, tea doesn't affect it, and resting helps after it happens. Do you have any other symptoms alongside the nausea and weakness?
PATIENT: Aye, well… now that ye mention it, my ankles have been a bit swollen lately. Not terribly, mind ye, but definitely puffier than usual. And I’ve been feelin’ a bit short o’ breath when I walk up the stairs. I just put it down to gettin' older, but… maybe that’s connected?
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling and shortness of breath… those could be connected. Let's go through a bit more of your history. Have you had any problems with your heart in the past?
PATIENT: Aye, I have. Years ago now, maybe… fifteen years? The doctor told me I had somethin' called “heart failure”, but it was… well, it was managed with pills for a long time. Stopped takin' 'em a few years back, thought I was alright. Been feelin' grand, mostly, 'til recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart failure, off medication for a few years. Do you remember what medication you were on, if you happen to know?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit tricky. I'm terrible with names o’ pills. I think it had a 'losartan' in it, maybe? And somethin’ else… a water tablet, I think they called it. Made me need the loo a lot! But I'm really not certain. I just took what the doctor prescribed, ye ken? It was a while ago now.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible losartan and a diuretic in the past. And you said this started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Aye, a few weeks. Started gradually, just a wee bit o’ queasiness in the mornin'. I just put it down to a bad stomach, but it’s been buildin’ up slowly since then. And the short o' breath has been gettin' worse along with it, I reckon. It’s not constant, mind ye, just when I exert myself a wee bit.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Changes in my… wee? Not that I’ve noticed, no. Seems… normal enough, I suppose. Maybe a wee bit paler than usual, now that ye mention it, but I’ve been drinkin’ more water tryin’ to settle my stomach, so… I didn't think much o' it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to bein’ poked and prodded, I suppose. Just… try not to make a fright o' me, eh?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160 over 90. I hear some crackles in your lungs, and your ankles do have significant pitting edema – meaning they hold fluid. Your heart rate is a little fast as well. I’m also noticing some mild swelling in your abdomen. Given your history of heart failure, and these findings, it’s concerning. I want to order some blood tests and an EKG to get a better picture of what’s going on. Also, we need a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Aye… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Heart failure comin’ back, eh? I suppose I shouldn’t have stopped takin' the pills. Right. Blood tests, EKG, and a chest X-ray. Whatever ye think is best, Doctor. Will I need to make another appointment for those?
DOCTOR: We can do the blood tests and EKG right here in the clinic today. The chest X-ray will require a visit to the imaging center down the street; I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you. While we wait for the results, I’m going to start you on a low dose of a diuretic to help with the swelling, and I’m going to have you restrict your fluid intake to 2 liters a day. I also want you to weigh yourself every morning and let us know if you gain more than 2 pounds in a day. Given your symptoms and history, it’s important to rule out a worsening of your heart failure, and we need to get a handle on this quickly.
PATIENT: Right. Two liters o’ water, weigh myself every mornin’, and tell ye if I gain more than a couple o’ pounds. And a water tablet again, eh? Aye, that all makes sense. It’s just… a bit overwhelmin', all at once. I'm glad ye’re takin' this seriously, Doctor. I’m not wanting to end up back in the hospital. How long will I need to wait for these tests? And… what happens if it is the heart failure comin’ back?
DOCTOR: It usually takes a couple of hours to get the results back from the lab. I’ll review them as soon as they’re available and call you with the findings. If it is your heart failure returning, we'll need to adjust your medication regimen to get it under control again. That could involve starting a different diuretic, adding a medication to help your heart pump more effectively, and potentially seeing a cardiologist for further evaluation. It’s manageable, but it’s important to take it seriously and follow the treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Aye… a cardiologist, eh? That sounds… serious. Hmm… I suppose I should ask… will I be able to keep drivin’ if I do need to see a cardiologist? I do a fair bit o' driving, takin' my sister to appointments, ye ken. And… will these medications have a lot o’ side effects? I’m tryin’ to avoid endin’ up feelin’ dreadful all the time.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Mr. Benic. Regarding driving, it depends on the severity of your condition and the specific medications you're on. A cardiologist will assess your heart function and advise you on whether or not it’s safe to continue driving. We'll discuss this thoroughly if that becomes necessary. As for side effects, all medications have the potential for side effects, but they vary greatly. We’ll start with the lowest effective dose and monitor you closely for any adverse reactions. Common side effects of diuretics can include frequent urination, dizziness, and fatigue. We can adjust the dosage or switch medications if you experience anything bothersome. We'll work together to find a treatment plan that effectively manages your condition with minimal side effects. I don’t want you to feel dreadful. And we will discuss all of this in detail if we do need to move forward with cardiology. Do you have any other concerns right now?
PATIENT: Aye… that’s… that’s reassuring, thank ye, Doctor. I suppose I’m just a bit scared, thinkin’ o’ goin’ back to bein’ reliant on pills again. And… the hospital. I dinna’ like hospitals. No, I dinna’ think I have any more questions right now. Just… just let me know as soon as ye have the results, eh? I’d rather know sooner than later. Thank ye for takin’ the time to explain things so clearly. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Benic. I understand your concerns, and I'll make sure you hear from me as soon as the results are available. The receptionist will schedule the blood tests and EKG now. I'll call you this afternoon. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before then. .
