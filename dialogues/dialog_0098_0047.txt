DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think? My daughter, she set this up. I don't really… remember all the details. Something about making sure I'm covered if… if things get hard. It’s a little confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, long-term care planning… That’s very thoughtful of your daughter. It is a bit of a complex topic, and it's perfectly alright if you're unsure of the specifics. We can definitely go through everything at your pace. Perhaps we can start with a general overview of your current health. Just to get a baseline, you understand. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah… I used to. Doc… Doc Miller, over in town. But he… he retired, I think. A few years back now. Haven’t really seen anyone steady since. Just when somethin' really hurts. I mostly try to take care of things myself. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. Many people prefer to manage things on their own for as long as possible. It’s good you’re proactive. But it is important to have a healthcare professional involved, even if it’s just for check-ups. Okay. So, in the absence of recent regular care, let’s talk about what's been going on right now. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or any new or worsening symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… my knees. They bother me. Especially when it’s cold, or when I’ve been on my feet a lot. I do a bit of… moving things around, for work. Freight, mostly. And my back… it’ll act up now and then. Nothing I can’t handle, usually. Just… aches, you know? Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Aches and pains… quite common with physical work, and certainly with age. We'll get to the bottom of things. Can you describe the pain in your knees a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache. Gets worse if I bend them too much, or walk a long distance. Sometimes they feel… stiff, like they’re gonna lock up. It eases up when I sit down and rest, mostly. I try not to push it too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, worse with activity, relieved with rest, and some stiffness. That gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned your back… is that pain similar to the knee pain, or is it different?
PATIENT: It’s… different. The back pain is more of a… pulling feeling. Like somethin’s strained. Happens when I lift somethin’ heavy, or twist the wrong way. It doesn’t really get better with just sitting, gotta lay down for a bit. And… sometimes it shoots down my leg, a little. Not always, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pulling sensation in your back, sometimes radiating down your leg… That's good information, Mr. Rover. We need to rule a few things out. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to assess your range of motion, check for any tenderness, and see how your reflexes are doing. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah… yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I guess I haven't really gotten checked out properly in a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your knees. Could you please point your toes, and then try to bend your knees as far as comfortably possible?
PATIENT: Okay. There we go… a little stiff, as you can see. Not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I see. There’s some tenderness along the joint line here, and here… and a bit of swelling. Not significant, but noticeable. Now, let's check the range of motion. Could you try to extend your leg fully, like you're straightening it out?
PATIENT: There... that’s about as far as I can go without too much discomfort. Feels… tight. Like somethin’s blockin' it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move to your back. Could you please stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can do that. A little slow getting goin' this mornin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax and breathe normally. Can you tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness as I press here?
PATIENT: Oof… yeah, right there. A little sore. Not all the time, but when you press on it… definitely feels it. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lumbar region… and some muscle spasm. Now, could you bend forward, and then backward, as far as comfortably possible?
PATIENT: There... that's about all I can manage. Feels kinda tight all over. Not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your legs. I'm going to test your reflexes now. And I'm just going to lightly touch your legs to see if you can feel that.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical exam, it seems like you have some degenerative changes in your knees, likely osteoarthritis, and some muscle strain and possible nerve irritation in your lower back. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact, which is reassuring. Now, I'd like to order some X-rays of your knees and lower back to get a better look at the underlying structures and confirm my findings. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays, huh? Yeah, okay. Sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Been achin’ for a while now, so knowin’ what's goin' on would be good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll get the orders sent to the radiology department, and they'll contact you to schedule an appointment. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage the discomfort. And gentle stretching and low-impact exercise, like walking or swimming, can help maintain your range of motion and strengthen your muscles. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. Taken all sorts over the years, never had a problem. Mostly just… things for a cold, or a headache. Oh, wait… my daughter says I got a little sensitive to shellfish once, a long time ago. But I haven’t eaten that in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible shellfish allergy, but that hasn't been an issue recently. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, regularly?
PATIENT: Nah. Not really. Just… when my knees are bad, I take some of that ibuprofen, like you said. Only when I need it, though. Not every day. I try to avoid pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. That’s very helpful. So, to summarize, we’ve discussed your knee and back pain, and I've ordered X-rays to get a better understanding of what's going on. I've also recommended over-the-counter pain relief and gentle exercise. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss a more specific treatment plan. This might include physical therapy, injections, or other options, depending on the severity of your condition. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Uh… not really, I guess. Sounds like you got a good handle on things. I appreciate you listenin’ and not brushin’ me off, like some doctors do. It’s just… gettin’ older is a pain, that's all. I just hope it doesn’t get too bad. I like bein’ able to… move around.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rover. It’s perfectly natural to worry about maintaining your independence. And you’re right, getting older comes with its challenges. But we'll do everything we can to help you stay active and comfortable for as long as possible. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the X-ray results are available, usually within a week. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Here’s a handout with information on managing knee and back pain. Do you have any difficulty reading this?
PATIENT: No, I can read it fine. Thank you. Appreciate it. Okay, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
