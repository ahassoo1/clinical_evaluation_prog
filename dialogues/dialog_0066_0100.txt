DOCTOR: Hi Lytisha, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Condray, was it? Um… well, it’s about a test, I think. Something about…checking for things? My… someone told me I needed to get it done. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Medicare sent something, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, Condray. And no worries at all about it being fuzzy, that happens! Medicare often sends out information about preventative screenings. Let me see… Lytisha Hughston, age 51. Okay. It sounds like you might be referring to a colonoscopy screening. Is that right?
PATIENT: A colon…oscopy? That doesn’t…ring a bell. I just know they said something about a test. Is it…bad? I don’t remember anyone explaining it to me. I’ve been a bit…scattered lately, you see. Lots on my mind.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be unsure, and it's good you're asking questions. A colonoscopy is a screening test to look for any abnormalities in the colon and rectum. It's a very common preventative measure, especially as we get older, to help catch things early. It's not necessarily bad – in fact, it's a really important tool for staying healthy. It involves a gentle look inside your colon with a camera. We usually recommend it starting around age 45, and you're at the age where it's a good idea to consider. Before we go any further, let’s get a better understanding of why you were sent the information. Do you remember who sent you the notice?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… the hospital? Maybe? I get a lot of mail. And honestly, my husband… he always took care of all that. Since he passed… it’s just been piling up. I really don’t recall anyone specifically telling me about this test. Just a lot of paperwork. Is it… is it something I have to do?
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must be incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable that paperwork and appointments might slip your mind right now. No pressure at all. A colonoscopy isn't mandatory, but it’s strongly recommended as a screening for colon cancer. Colon cancer is very treatable when caught early, and this test is the best way to do that. We recommend it because it can save lives. Okay, I see here that you do have a history of diverticulosis, which means small pouches have formed in the lining of your colon. That slightly increases your risk, and makes screening even more important. Before we decide anything, let me ask a few questions to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you experienced any of the following: changes in your bowel habits, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh… diverti…what was it? My husband always explained my medical things. I just… I just know I go to the doctor when things hurt. Let me see… changes in bowel habits… well, getting old, you know? Things change. Rectal bleeding… not recently, no. Abdominal pain… sometimes a little cramping, but nothing major. And weight loss… actually, I think I’ve gained a little, if anything. Lockdown didn't help with that!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We'll take things slow. Diverticulosis is very common, and usually doesn't cause any problems, but it's good to be aware of it. Okay, no recent bleeding, some cramping, and a little weight gain. That's helpful. Have you ever had a colonoscopy or any other similar tests done before, like a sigmoidoscopy?
PATIENT: Sigmoi… No, I don’t think so. Honestly, Doctor, I get all these words mixed up. Everything sounds the same after a while. I’ve had…regular check-ups, you know, blood pressure, things like that. But nothing… inside. Never anything like that. My husband handled all the… the specifics. I’m sorry, I’m not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re being perfectly helpful, Lytisha. Don’t apologize at all. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed with medical terms, and it's okay not to remember everything. And it’s perfectly alright that your husband handled these things previously. We’re just trying to get a clear picture of your health history. Okay, so no prior colonoscopies or similar tests. Let’s talk a little about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had colon cancer, polyps, or any other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Oh… family history… My mother… she had stomach trouble, I think. Something… ulcers, maybe? But she didn't… she didn't have cancer, not that I recall. My father… he was healthy as a horse, always working. No, I don't think anyone on either side had… the colon thing. Lots of heart problems, though. My brother had a bypass. But not… that. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. A history of stomach ulcers isn’t directly related to colon cancer, but heart problems and family history are important pieces of the puzzle. Okay, no direct family history of colon cancer or polyps. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! My husband smoked for a while, tried to get him to quit a hundred times. I always hated it. No, never touched a cigarette in my life. Good lungs, thankfully. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear about the smoking! And enjoying a glass of wine with dinner is perfectly fine for many people. It's important to be honest about these things, so thank you for sharing. Okay, no smoking history, occasional wine consumption. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’m pretty lucky that way. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s about it. My husband always said I was a tough old bird. No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Is that it? Are we done with the questions now? My brain is a little tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all the questions for now, Lytisha. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. Your brain is perfectly justified in being tired! It sounds like you're generally in good health, aside from the diverticulosis. Now, let’s talk about the colonoscopy. Given your age and the diverticulosis, it’s a screening test I strongly recommend. It allows us to check for any precancerous polyps or early signs of cancer. The preparation isn’t the most pleasant – it involves cleaning out your colon – but it's a relatively quick procedure. Would you like me to explain the procedure in a little more detail?
PATIENT: A procedure… cleaning out my colon… It doesn’t sound very appealing, I have to admit. My husband would have known all about this, what to expect, how to prepare… I… I guess I’d like you to explain it, yes. But please, go slowly. And don't use too many big words. My brain is already full! Is it… is it painful?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll go very slowly, and absolutely no big words. And you're right to ask about pain. It's a valid concern. The procedure itself is generally painless. You'll be given medication – a sedative – to help you relax and fall asleep. You won’t feel anything during the colonoscopy. A long, thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end is gently inserted into your rectum and advanced through your colon. The camera allows the doctor to see the lining of your colon on a monitor. If any polyps are found, they can be removed during the procedure. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. The most challenging part is the preparation, which involves drinking a special liquid to empty your colon completely. It can cause some cramping and diarrhea, but it's temporary. We can discuss different options to make the preparation as comfortable as possible. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Sedative… so I’ll be asleep? That’s good. And they just… look? And take things out if they find them? It doesn’t sound too bad, I suppose. But the… the cleaning out part… That sounds… unpleasant. Is there anything I can do to make it easier? And… how long would I have to be at the hospital? I don’t like being away from home for too long. And would I need someone to drive me?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll be given a sedative, so you’ll be asleep and won’t feel a thing during the procedure. And you’re right to ask about the preparation. It’s the least enjoyable part, but we can definitely make it easier. There are different types of preparation solutions, and we can discuss which one might be best for you. Drinking plenty of clear liquids before and after the solution can help, and some people find it helpful to sip ginger ale or broth. As for the hospital stay, you’ll typically need to be there for about 3-4 hours total. That includes time for check-in, preparation, the procedure itself, and recovery. You will need someone to drive you home, as the sedative will make you drowsy. After the procedure, you might experience some mild cramping and bloating, but that usually resolves quickly. We’ll give you detailed instructions on what to expect and how to care for yourself at home. Would you like me to go over the preparation instructions in more detail, or would you like some time to think about it?
PATIENT: It’s a lot to take in. Having someone drive me… that's not a problem, my neighbor is always willing to help. The neighbor, yes. I think… I think I’d like to hear more about the preparation, yes. What exactly do I have to drink? And how much? And when? And… does it taste awful? My husband always said I was a fussy eater.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to want more details. It is a lot to process. And being a fussy eater is perfectly valid – we can definitely try to make it as tolerable as possible. The preparation typically involves drinking a special liquid solution, usually split into two doses – one the evening before the procedure and one the morning of. The amount varies depending on the specific solution, but it’s usually around 8-16 ounces per dose. The taste… well, it’s not pleasant, I won’t lie. It’s often described as salty or bitter. But there are ways to make it more palatable. You can chill the solution, drink it through a straw, and chase it with clear liquids like ginger ale or broth. Some people even find it helpful to suck on lemon wedges or hard candies between sips. We’ll give you very specific instructions on how and when to drink the solution, and we can discuss different options to minimize the unpleasant taste. Would you like me to write down the preparation instructions for you, so you can look them over at your own pace?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Writing it down would be wonderful. That way, I can show my neighbor, and we can figure out the best way to do it. She’s very practical, that neighbor. And… is there anything I need to do beforehand? Any medications I should stop taking? Or foods I shouldn’t eat? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. It includes everything we’ve discussed, plus some additional tips and contact information if you have any questions. Regarding medications, it’s important to let me know if you’re taking any blood thinners, like warfarin or aspirin, as those may need to be temporarily stopped before the procedure. Also, you’ll need to be on a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the colonoscopy. That means no solid foods, milk, or anything red or purple. Clear liquids include water, broth, juice, and gelatin. We’ll also need to review your complete medical history to make sure you’re a good candidate for the procedure. I recommend scheduling a pre-procedure appointment with me to go over everything in detail and answer any further questions you may have. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Clear liquids… no red or purple… that sounds manageable. And no blood thinners… I don't think I take anything like that. I’ll have to ask my neighbor, she keeps track of my pills. A pre-procedure appointment… yes, that would be good. That way, I can make sure I understand everything. And my neighbor can come with me, if that’s alright? She’s very good at asking questions. This is… a lot. But I think I’m starting to feel a little better about it. Thank you for being so patient with me. And for not using too many big words!
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Lytisha. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and I’m happy to take things at your own pace. And your neighbor is more than welcome to join us for the pre-procedure appointment – having someone with you is always a good idea. Let me see… I have an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you and your neighbor?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00… yes, I think that would be fine. My neighbor usually has afternoons free. Let me double-check with her, just to be sure, but I’m pretty confident that will work. So… that’s it, then? We’re scheduled? And I’ll see you next Tuesday? Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it! You’re scheduled for a pre-procedure appointment next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Here’s your appointment card with all the details. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Lytisha. I look forward to seeing you next week. And remember, we’ll go through everything step-by-step. Have a good day!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And thank you again for being so patient with me. I think… I think I’m actually starting to feel a little less worried. Oh, and… tell your office… Lytisha Hughston, H-U-G-H-S-T-O-N. Just in case.
