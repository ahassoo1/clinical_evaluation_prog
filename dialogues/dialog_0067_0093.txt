DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, to be honest, I don’t really remember making an appointment. Something about… sleep, I think? And, uh, getting back into shape. Not that I’m out of shape, mind you. Just… not as sharp as I used to be. It's all a bit blurry, to be honest. Medicare sent something, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Chanz. Sometimes things get scheduled for us, and the details fade. And Medicare often prompts preventative care, which is good. Let's try to piece things together. You mentioned something about sleep and getting back into shape. Could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with your sleep?
PATIENT: Ugh, sleep. Right. It’s… not solid, you know? I wake up a lot. Not necessarily tired, just… aware. And then I’m thinking. About things. Old things. It’s annoying, mostly. My wife… she used to say I snored. Loudly. Not sure if that’s relevant. It’s just… not restful. I don’t feel… charged when I wake up. Like a phone that didn’t quite finish charging overnight. Is that making any sense? I’m not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Chanz. You’re describing what sounds like disrupted sleep, and that feeling of not being fully rested even after what should be a full night's sleep is very common. It's helpful that you mentioned your wife used to comment on snoring – that’s definitely something we should investigate. So, to clarify, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: How long… hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly? A while. Since… well, since she passed, I suppose. It’s all sort of… blended together. Probably at least a year. Maybe longer. It wasn't this bad right away. It's just… gradually gotten worse. I used to be able to just… push through it. But now… now it's affecting things. I'm a bit more… forgetful, for one. Not that I admit to being forgetful. But it's true. It’s… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. It sounds like this has been a gradual process, and understandably so, given your loss. Grief can absolutely disrupt sleep, and sleep is so important for cognitive function, memory, and overall health. We will certainly address that. You mentioned forgetfulness – can you give me a specific example of what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't ask me for specifics. That’s the point. It’s not like I forget important things, you understand. Just… details. Like, I was tuning a violin yesterday – a very nice Stradivarius, actually – and I… couldn’t remember the name of the customer. The woman. She was… older. Pleasant enough. I eventually remembered, but it was… embarrassing. And it’s happening more and more. Little things. Names, where I put my tools, what I had for breakfast… trivial stuff, really. Though, if I’m being honest, it’s irritating. I pride myself on being precise.
DOCTOR: It sounds frustrating, Chanz, especially given your profession and the importance of precision. Forgetting details like names or where you put things, especially when it's new, can be normal, but when it's happening more frequently, it’s good we're looking into it. It's good you’re aware of it. Now, let's move on to your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been… robust. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. My wife used to complain I wouldn't even take a day off when I had a cold. I eat alright, I guess. Mostly Syrian food, naturally. Lots of vegetables, some meat. I wouldn't say I exercise exactly, but I'm on my feet all day, working with instruments. That's got to count for something, right? I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I certainly don’t smoke. I’m not one of those people.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Chanz. It sounds like you generally lead a healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that either. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that was… a long time ago. A simple fracture. Healed up fine. Aside from that, nothing. I’ve always been remarkably… resilient. Though, to be honest, I haven’t been to a doctor in years. Decades, probably. My wife handled all that. I just… avoided it. I never liked hospitals. Still don’t, really. They smell… unpleasant. And the waiting rooms are full of… people.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And it’s perfectly alright to feel that way about hospitals; many people do. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a difficult question. My family… it's complicated. Lots of cousins, scattered all over. My father… he had some sort of heart trouble, I think. Eventually, he… passed away. But it was old age, mostly. My mother lived a long life, too. She had arthritis, I remember. Lots of aches and pains, but nothing serious. No one really talked about medical things much. It wasn’t… polite, I suppose. We just… dealt with it. As for anything inherited… I honestly couldn’t tell you. I’ve never really asked. And, frankly, I don’t think anyone would know. It’s not a particularly… communicative family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me something to work with. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, take anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, ever. I’ve always been… blessed with a strong constitution. Though, I don’t really take any medication. Aside from maybe a pain reliever for a headache, occasionally. But that’s it. I prefer to avoid those things if possible. They always have… side effects, don’t they? And I don’t like feeling… altered. I like being… myself. Which, admittedly, is getting harder to remember these days. But still. No allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz, that’s a very thorough history. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you've generally been very healthy, but the sleep disturbances and forgetfulness are concerning, particularly given their recent increase. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just a basic check of your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. It will help me get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. A physical exam… I suppose. I really don’t see the point, to be honest. I feel fine. But… alright. If you insist. Just… please be quick. And try not to… poke around too much. I’m not comfortable with… unnecessary touching. And I’d rather not hear a lot of medical jargon, if you don’t mind. Just tell me if something is… wrong. Plainly. No need for complicated explanations. Just… the basics. And can we do it quickly? I have a violin to tune, you know. A very important Stradivarius.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chanz. We’ll keep it quick and focused. I’ll explain everything as we go, and I promise to keep the medical jargon to a minimum. Just a routine check. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t squeeze it too tight. It’s sensitive. And please hurry. I really need to get back to work. This Stradivarius… it’s a masterpiece. It needs a skilled touch, you understand. Not a lot of poking and prodding. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's a little elevated, but not dramatically so. It can fluctuate, especially if you're feeling anxious, so we'll check it again later. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out... Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, normal breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to do a quick neurological assessment. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes... can you look to the left... and to the right... excellent. Now, can you squeeze my hands... both hands... good strength. Finally, I'm just going to check your reflexes… tapping knee with reflex hammer Okay. Reflexes are normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. But the elevated blood pressure and your reported sleep disturbances and forgetfulness warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Ugh, that was… startling. And honestly, I still don't see the point. “Unremarkable” means what, exactly? That I’m perfectly fine? Because I feel fine. Except for the sleep, of course. And the occasional lapse in memory. But those are… minor. So, what now? Are you going to prescribe me something? Because I really don’t want to take pills. And I don’t want a lot of complicated tests. I have a life, you know. A very important Stradivarius to tune.
DOCTOR: “Unremarkable” means there aren’t any obvious physical abnormalities that explain your symptoms, Chanz. It's good news in that it rules out some possibilities. However, your symptoms do need to be investigated. It sounds like you’re concerned about medication, and I respect that. Let’s start with some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your sleep problems and memory lapses – things like thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, or diabetes. We can also discuss a sleep study to get a more detailed assessment of your sleep patterns. Would you be open to those options?
PATIENT: Blood work… fine. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And no needles, if possible. Seriously. I faint at the sight of them. A sleep study… that sounds… intrusive. Do I have to… sleep in a hospital? With… wires attached to me? Ugh. Is there any other way? Can’t you just… tell me what to do? Eat more vegetables? Take a nap? I need practical solutions, not complicated tests. This is ridiculous. I have a Stradivarius to tune, you know. A very important Stradivarius.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Chanz. We can discuss options to minimize your discomfort. For the blood work, we can use a smaller needle and a skilled phlebotomist to make the process as comfortable as possible. And for the sleep study, there are now home sleep apnea tests available. It involves wearing a small device on your wrist and a sensor in your nose to monitor your sleep patterns in the comfort of your own bed. It’s much less intrusive than a traditional sleep study. As for practical solutions, eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep are important, but they may not be enough to address the underlying cause of your symptoms. We need to rule out other possibilities before we can determine the best course of action. Let's start with the blood work and discuss the home sleep study in more detail. It's a reasonable first step. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. A home sleep study… that sounds… slightly less awful. As long as it doesn’t involve a lot of… equipment. And as long as it doesn’t interfere with my work. And as for the blood work… promise me a small needle. And a gentle touch. Seriously. I’m not exaggerating. I faint. And… can I schedule it for later in the week? I have a concert to prepare for. A very important concert. With a very important Stradivarius. Can we just get this over with quickly? I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chanz. We'll schedule the blood work for later in the week, and I’ll make a note of your aversion to needles. I'll personally ensure the phlebotomist is experienced and gentle. I’ll have the nurse bring you information about the home sleep study, and we can discuss it in more detail after you’ve had a chance to review it. I'll also write you a referral for a basic vitamin panel, just to rule out any deficiencies. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Acceptable. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And as long as it doesn’t interfere with my work. Honestly, this is all very… disruptive. But… alright. Do what you have to do. But please, hurry. I have a very important Stradivarius to tune. And a concert to prepare for. Can we just get this over with? I have a life, you know. A very important life. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to make this process as smooth and efficient as possible. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork and instructions for the blood work and the home sleep study. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today. .
