DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. It’s… travel, I think. My wife… she wanted to go somewhere. Before… before everything. Now I gotta go, I guess. Somewhere hot. She liked hot places. Don’t really remember where exactly, though. Just… hot. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. It sounds like you're preparing for a trip, and it's bringing up a lot of emotions, especially given recent events. It's understandable you might be feeling overwhelmed or have trouble focusing on the details right now. To make sure I can help you prepare as best as possible for your travel, could you tell me a little more about when you're planning to go?
PATIENT: When…? Uh… soon. I think. The papers… the travel place said… August? Maybe September? It was all very fast after… you know. I just signed things. Didn't really look. Lots of dates and numbers. Sorry. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know the timeframe, yes. It helps me determine if you need any specific vaccinations or medications for your destination. Knowing when you travel allows us time to get those sorted if needed. Do you have any of the travel documents with you – perhaps a ticket or itinerary?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe. Let me see… Here… is this it? Kathmandu… that sounds right. She loved… mountains. Is Nepal hot? It looks… high up.
DOCTOR: Kathmandu, Nepal. Okay. And August 15th. Thank you. Nepal isn’t generally hot hot, especially not in August – it's monsoon season there, so it will be quite humid and rainy. It’s high altitude, though, so that's something we need to consider. Before we talk about altitude sickness, let's talk about why you’re traveling to Nepal. Is this a pre-planned trip with your wife, or something you're arranging now?
PATIENT: It… was her. She wanted to go. Always talked about seeing the mountains, and… temples. Before. I'm just… finishing what she started. Didn’t want her dream to go to waste, you know? I don’t really… do travel. She did all the planning. I just… pay for things. Now I gotta go. It’s complicated. Is that okay? I don’t like talking about this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Odell. You don’t have to share anything you're not comfortable with. It sounds like this trip has a lot of emotional significance, and it’s completely understandable that it’s difficult to talk about. We can focus on the practical aspects of travel preparation if that's easier for you. Just to be sure, have you traveled internationally before?
PATIENT: Not… really. A few places, with her. Thailand, once. India, maybe. It was all her doing, though. I mostly just… followed her around. Airports and hotels… it’s all the same to me. Never had to worry about… shots or anything. She always took care of that. Does Nepal need… special shots? I don’t want to get sick. It’s already… enough.
DOCTOR: Okay. Nepal does have some recommended and required vaccinations depending on your activities and length of stay. For most travelers, we'd recommend Hepatitis A and Typhoid, and a Tetanus booster if you haven't had one in the last ten years. Depending on where you're planning to go within Nepal, we may also discuss Japanese Encephalitis. We should also talk about malaria prevention. Before we proceed with recommendations, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Health… I’m okay. I think. I work. Lift things. It’s hard work, but… keeps me busy. No… nothing serious. Just… tired, all the time. And… my stomach. It doesn't always agree with things. Especially… new food. She always told me what was safe to eat. I’m probably allergic to something, but I never bothered to find out. Does that matter? I just… want to go and come back. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a sensitive stomach. Those are good things to mention. And it’s helpful to know you have some dietary sensitivities. We'll need to be careful about food and water safety during your travels, especially in Nepal. Do you have any known allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not that I remember. I haven’t really… taken much. Maybe a painkiller for my back once or twice. Food… She said something about shellfish once, but I don't really eat shellfish. Or, I didn't used to. I don't remember. Honestly, I just… eat what she cooks, or what she tells me is safe. I can't really say I'm allergic to anything, specifically. Does that make sense? I just… avoid trouble. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Odell. It's common to not be sure about allergies if you haven't experienced a reaction. We’ll proceed as if you have no known allergies, but we’ll be extra cautious. Now, just to get a baseline, let me ask a few quick questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I’ve always been… strong. Work hard, eat… okay food. Never been sick enough to go to the doctor, really. Until now. This is all a bit much, isn’t it? I just wanted to sign some papers and get it over with. Is there a way to just… get the shots and go? I don’t like talking about this.
DOCTOR: Odell, I understand this is difficult, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. It’s important to have a clear understanding of your health before traveling, especially to a place like Nepal, to ensure your safety. We can focus on getting you the necessary vaccinations. However, it's also crucial to discuss potential risks and how to manage them. Before we proceed with the shots, would you mind if I just quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don’t like being poked and prodded. But hurry, okay? I have things to do. And please… don’t ask me about my feelings. It’s not going to help. Just… do the check.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please have a seat here. I’ll just take a few quick measurements. It shouldn't take long.
