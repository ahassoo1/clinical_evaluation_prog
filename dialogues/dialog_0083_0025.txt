DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want… I want to find out more about where my family come from. My people, you know? I hear you can do… a test with spit? To see old, old family? I want that test.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You're interested in genetic ancestry testing, to learn more about your family's origins. That’s something we can certainly discuss. It is done with a saliva sample. Before we proceed, just to be clear, this test doesn’t provide medical information, it focuses on tracing your ethnic and geographical roots. It’s more about cultural heritage than health risks. Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: Cultural… heritage. Yes. That is right. I don't need to know about… sick things. Just where my people come from long time ago. My grandma, she tell stories… but stories not always true, you know? I want real. Spit test sound good. Is good test?
DOCTOR: Yes, stories can be wonderful, but it’s good to want to verify things. You’re right to ask about the test’s reliability. There are several companies that offer these tests, and they vary in their accuracy and the regions they analyze. We partner with a reputable laboratory – AncestryPath – that has a good track record, especially with populations in the Pacific Islands. They analyze your DNA and compare it to a large database of reference populations. It’s not perfect, of course – DNA analysis can have limitations – but it's generally considered quite informative. Before we order the test, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… okay. I try. My grandma, she from Majuro, the big island. My grandpa… I think he from Arno, small island close by. But that was long time ago. I was just small boy then. They speak Marshallese, of course. I speak some, but not so good now. I mostly speak English. Is that okay? Will that make test not good?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Scobie. Speaking mostly English won’t affect the test at all. The test analyzes your DNA, not the language you speak. Knowing your grandparents’ islands of origin – Majuro and Arno – is very helpful information. It helps narrow down the reference populations the lab will compare your DNA to. Do you know anything about your great-grandparents, or any other ancestors?
PATIENT: Hmm… Great-grandparents… that is hard. My grandma, she never talk much about them. Something about… war time. Sad time. She say they stay on islands, fishing, growing coconuts. Not much school, I think. Just… island life. I remember her making mats, very beautiful mats. She teach me a little, but I not so good with hands like her. I think… I think that is all I know. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s very common for family history to be incomplete, especially when recalling generations past. The fact that your grandmother was from Majuro and your grandfather from Arno is a good starting point. Knowing about the war time disruptions is also helpful context. Before we proceed with the test, let's quickly review your medical history, just as a standard precaution. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No sick things. I mostly okay. I get little tired sometimes, but old man tired, you know? I walk a little slow, but I still make my wood things. I see doctor before for… blood pressure, I think. He give me pills. I take pills. That is all. Mostly okay. No big problems. Medicare pay for pills.
DOCTOR: Good to hear you’re mostly doing well. And thank you for letting me know about the blood pressure medication. Do you happen to remember the name of the medication, or perhaps have a list with you?
PATIENT: Here. I think this is it. My neighbor, she help me write it down. I not so good with names. It say… Lisinopril? Is that right? I take one every morning with my breakfast. Oatmeal, mostly. Sometimes toast.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril. That’s a common medication for high blood pressure. And it’s good you’re taking it as prescribed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I eat everything. Fish, coconuts, breadfruit, taro… everything. I never get sick from food. Maybe little stomach ache sometimes, but not bad. I not afraid of anything. I live on island long time, you know? You gotta be strong. No allergies. Nothing.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No allergies are always good to know. Alright, Mr. Scobie, it sounds like you’re a good candidate for the genetic ancestry test. We can go ahead and collect a saliva sample right here in the examination room. It's a very simple process. It involves spitting into this tube until we reach a certain fill line. The lab will then analyze your DNA and provide you with a report in approximately 6-8 weeks. Do you have any questions about the process or the report itself?
PATIENT: Six to eight weeks… long time. But okay. Spit in tube, you say? Simple? I hope so. What kind of report? Will it tell me… what islands my people come from? Like, the real islands? And… will it tell me about other people? Like, people from other places? Will it be… confusing? I not so good with computers, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, six to eight weeks is the typical turnaround time. It takes a while to analyze the DNA and compare it to the extensive database. The report will provide an estimate of your ethnic origins, broken down into percentages. It will focus on regions in the Pacific Islands – including Micronesia, Polynesia, and Melanesia – and will give you the most detailed information possible based on your DNA. It can also identify connections to other regions, such as Southeast Asia or East Asia, but the primary focus will be on your ancestral roots in the Pacific. It will show you which islands have the strongest genetic match to your sample. It can also identify potential relatives who have also taken the test, but you're not obligated to connect with them. The report is presented online, but we can go over it together when it arrives. I can help you interpret the results and answer any questions you have. Don't worry, you won't be alone. We will go through it step-by-step, and I'll make sure you understand everything. Would you like to proceed with collecting the sample now?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Spit in tube. You help me, yes? I little nervous. I want to know… I want to know where I really come from. Long time I wonder about that. You help me understand, yes? That good. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. I’m happy to help. It’s a very simple process, and I’ll guide you through every step. No need to be nervous. We'll take our time. Here, this is a sterile tube and a funnel. Simply spit into the tube until we reach this line. Try to avoid eating or drinking anything for about 30 minutes beforehand, if possible. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No questions, Doctor. Just… do it. I want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, take your time, Mr. Scobie. Just relax and spit naturally into the tube. You're doing great. And remember, the more saliva you provide, the more accurate the results will be. It might take a few minutes to collect enough. Just let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Is this enough? It feels… strange. I not used to this. I hope it works. I really want to know about my people.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mr. Scobie, you’re doing very well. We’re almost there. Just a little bit more, until it reaches this line. It is a little unusual, I understand. But you’re almost finished! And I'm confident we'll get enough sample for accurate results. You’re doing a wonderful job.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Finished. That was… a lot. Now what? Will you… look inside?
DOCTOR: Perfect, Mr. Scobie! You did it. And no, we won’t look inside the tube, of course. It will be sent to the lab for analysis. They have special equipment to extract and analyze your DNA. It will take about 6-8 weeks to get the results. I'll have the lab send the report directly to the clinic. Once it arrives, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to go over it together. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that good. Six to eight weeks… I wait. You call me, yes? When report come? I not so good with… remembering things. You call. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for helping me find my people.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. I will personally call you as soon as the report arrives. You don’t need to worry about remembering anything. I'll make sure we schedule a convenient time to go over the results together. And you’re very welcome. I’m happy to help you on this journey. It sounds like it’s very important to you, and I'm honored to be a part of it. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you again. I go home now. I hope I find out… good things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I have a good feeling you will. You have a safe trip home, and I look forward to speaking with you in a few weeks. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
