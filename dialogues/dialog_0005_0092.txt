DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh. Doctor, right? Young fella. Well, I'm here 'cause... it's hard to breathe, see? Not like a big thing, just... gets harder. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too. Dry as anything. Been happenin' a little while now. Don't remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: "Old age," right. Well, things do change as we get older, that's true. But we still need to figure out why you're having trouble breathing and feeling so dry. “A little while now” isn’t terribly helpful, sir. Can you give me a better idea?
PATIENT: A better idea? Look, I told ya, it's been…weeks, maybe? Months? I don't keep track of these things. I used to work with traffic lights, not calendars! It just... got worse slowly. Not suddenly, nothin' dramatic. Just…ugh. Harder to walk up the stairs, that's for sure. And I gotta sip water all the time now. You know? Like a lizard.
DOCTOR: Right, “slowly.” Okay. And is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. Worse when I…when I move around. Like walkin'. Or... tryin' to fix things. I still tinker, you know? Old habits. But yeah, if I sit still, it's not so bad. Not great, but... livable. Mostly.
DOCTOR: So, it’s exertion-related. Alright. And are you experiencing any chest pain with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not really. A little...tightness sometimes. But not pain. Like someone’s sittin’ on my chest, maybe. But it goes away when I rest. Look, I'm an old man, Doc. Things ache. That don't mean it's somethin' serious.
DOCTOR: “Things ache” is exactly why we need to investigate, sir. Alright. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm...let me see. They look a little puffy, maybe? But I always thought that was just…old age again. I sit a lot, you know? Watchin' the baseball game. Don't get out much anymore. It's hot out there.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – heart problems, lung issues, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical history... Well, the doctor before... he said my blood pressure was a little high. Years ago. Gave me some pills. Stopped takin' 'em after a while, though. Didn't feel like I needed 'em. And... I think I had the flu once. A long time ago. Other than that? I'm a pretty sturdy guy, Doc. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just some aspirin sometimes. For my knees. And…a little somethin’ for sleep. Can’t sleep good, you know? Old age. That’s all. Don't take nothin' regular. Mostly just try to get by.
DOCTOR: “A little somethin’ for sleep”?
PATIENT: Well, my neighbor, Old Man Rodriguez, he gave me some pills. He gets 'em from his son, the pharmacist. Helps me sleep. Don't ask me what they are, Doc. I just take one when I can't doze off. They're little and blue. That's all I know. Don't want to bother his son with questions, you understand? It’s a favor.
DOCTOR: Sir, it is crucially important that I know what medications you are taking. “Little and blue” is not a medication name. We need to figure out what these pills are. Do you have any of them with you?
PATIENT: Let me see... Here. These are 'em. Like I said, little and blue. Rodriguez said they were good.
DOCTOR: These are…lorazepam. A benzodiazepine. A strong sedative. And you’ve been taking these without a prescription?
PATIENT: Lorazep…what? A sedative? Look, I just wanted to sleep, Doc! Old Man Rodriguez, he said they were safe. He's a good man. I didn't know I needed a...a prescription. I just take one when I can't sleep. You make it sound like I'm doin' somethin' wrong!
DOCTOR: Sir, taking medication without a doctor’s supervision can be very dangerous. Especially a drug like this. It can interact with other medications, cause side effects, and…well, it’s simply irresponsible. Now, let's move on to a physical exam, and then we'll discuss getting some blood work done. I need to understand what's going on. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Do what you gotta do, Doc. But I'm tellin' ya, it's just old age. I've lived a long life, seen a lot of things. A little shortness of breath ain't gonna kill me. But go ahead, listen to my ticker.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little irregular. And I can hear some…wheezing in your lungs. Your breathing sounds congested. I also notice some slight swelling in your ankles, which could indicate fluid retention. I need to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is… 92%. That's a bit low. We need to get a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other lung issues.
PATIENT: Pneumonia? Lung issues? Hold on now, Doc. I just have a little trouble breathin', that's all! I ain't sick, I'm just…old. And my ankles swell sometimes. It's the heat, I tell ya. And 92 what-now? Is that bad? I don't understand all these numbers. You're scaring me, Doc.
DOCTOR: 92% oxygen saturation is below normal, sir. It means your body isn’t getting enough oxygen. And the wheezing in your lungs, combined with the irregular heartbeat and fluid retention, is concerning. I'm not trying to scare you, but we need to take this seriously. The X-ray will help us determine the cause. We'll also need to do some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any infections. I'm also going to prescribe you a low-sodium diet and recommend you limit your fluid intake. Now, do you understand?
PATIENT: Low-sodium…no fluids? What am I supposed to drink, Doc? Water? I already told you, I gotta sip water all the time! And infections? What kind of infections? This is gettin' out of hand. I just wanted somethin' for my breathin', not a whole… a whole medical investigation. And I still don't understand why I gotta stop takin' the blue pills. Old Man Rodriguez said…
DOCTOR: Sir, you need to stop taking the lorazepam immediately. It’s masking symptoms and potentially making things worse. It also interacts with other medications and can cause dangerous side effects, especially in someone your age. As for the water, we'll monitor your fluid intake closely. You shouldn't drastically reduce it, but we need to manage it because of the swelling in your ankles. And as for the infections, we don't know yet. That’s what the blood work will tell us. We need to rule out pneumonia, a urinary tract infection, or something else. I'm ordering the X-ray and blood work now. The nurse will take you to the radiology department and then draw your blood. Then, we'll review the results and discuss a plan of action. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: X-ray…blood work…no blue pills…no water… I don’t… I don’t think I understand all this, Doc. It's too much. I just wanted to feel better, not… not become a science experiment. Can't you just give me somethin' for the breathin'? An inhaler or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Sir, I understand you're overwhelmed, but we need to be thorough. An inhaler might temporarily relieve your symptoms, but it won’t address the underlying cause. We need to find out why you’re having trouble breathing before we can provide effective treatment. I'm not dismissing your concerns, I’m trying to help you. The X-ray and blood work are essential. Once we have the results, we'll discuss a proper plan, which might include medication, lifestyle changes, or a referral to a specialist. I'll also have the nurse explain everything in more detail. For now, please just focus on following my instructions: no more lorazepam, and we'll get this sorted out. I’m going to order a stat oxygen test and, just to be safe, I want an EKG done as well. Do you have any questions right now before I call for the nurse?
PATIENT: An EKG? What's an EKG? Is that gonna hurt? Look, Doc, I'm an old man. I've lived a good life. I don't want to be poked and prodded and… and worried to death. I just want to be able to watch my baseball game. That’s all. Maybe... maybe it's just the heat. Maybe I should just stay inside.
DOCTOR: Sir, an EKG is a simple test that measures your heart's electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. We just attach a few stickers to your chest. It helps us determine if there's an issue with your heart rhythm, which could be contributing to your shortness of breath. I understand you're worried, but these tests are necessary to ensure we're providing you with the best possible care. I wouldn't recommend them if I didn’t think they were important. Look, I’m not trying to scare you. We’re just being cautious. I’ll be right here to explain everything every step of the way. And hopefully, once we have the results, we can figure out what's going on and get you back to watching your baseball game. Now, let’s get the nurse in here to start the oxygen test, okay?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Whatever you say. Get the nurse, I guess. Just… just try to be gentle, okay? And please… please explain everything. I don't understand all these fancy words.
DOCTOR: “Nurse Rodriguez, could you please come to examination room three?
PATIENT: .
