DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I been, uh... coughing a lot. For a long time now, I think. And tired. Really tired. And my nose… always blocked. Feels like it’s full of water, you know? Happens a lot. I don't remember exactly when it started… maybe months ago? My wife keeps telling me to come see someone.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tati. A persistent cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion – that certainly sounds bothersome. It's good that you're here today, and wise of your wife to encourage you to seek medical attention. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the cough?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s a wet cough, I think. Like, I got stuff coming up when I cough. Not… dry. And it’s worse in the morning, usually. Sometimes at night too, keeps my wife awake, she says. Not… bloody cough, if that’s what you’re thinking. Just… wet. Lots of… phlegm. I don’t know the proper word!
DOCTOR: "Phlegm" is perfectly fine, Mr. Tati. No need to apologize for not knowing medical terms. A wet cough, producing phlegm, is very helpful information. And it’s good to know it's worse in the mornings and sometimes at night. Now, regarding the fatigue – could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Just… tired all the time. Even after sleeping. I wake up feeling like I didn’t sleep at all. Makes it hard to work, you know? I fix tires all day, it’s hard work… but now it feels even harder. Like I have no energy. I just want to sit down. My wife does most of the housework now, I’m always too tired.
DOCTOR: So, persistent fatigue even after adequate sleep, making it difficult to perform your usual work activities… that's significant. It sounds like this is impacting your daily life, which is concerning. Now, let's go back a little bit. When you say it started "months ago," can you recall roughly how many months?
PATIENT: Ugh… maybe six months? Or seven? I really don’t know for sure. It started slowly, you know? Just a little cough here and there. Then it got worse. The tiredness came later, I think. And the blocked nose… always had a bit of trouble with my nose, but it’s been worse lately. I work outside a lot, maybe that’s it? Dust and everything. I don’t really keep track of dates, sorry.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Mr. Tati. It’s common to not remember precise timelines. Six to seven months of these symptoms is useful information. And you're right to consider your work environment; exposure to dust could certainly contribute. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… I don't think so. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but not like I’ve been sick with a fever. No chills, definitely not. And no… sweats at night. My wife would have noticed that, she always feels cold. I just… feel tired and blocked up. And cough a lot. That’s it, I think. Maybe a headache sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, right?
DOCTOR: No fever, chills, or night sweats, and occasional headaches… that's good to know. And you're right, headaches are very common. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, or allergies?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I used to get sick as a kid, like everyone does. Normal stuff. But never been to the hospital or anything. Never been told I have anything. Just… normal coughs and colds. My wife says I should have gone to the doctor sooner, but I always thought it would just go away.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tati. Many people delay seeking medical attention. So, no prior diagnoses of chronic conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. Never had any surgery, never been in the hospital. Just… work. And home. That’s it. My wife always takes care of me when I get sick. Gives me tea and lets me rest.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear that you have such a supportive wife. Alright, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or allergies?
PATIENT: Ugh… my mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he always smoked. A lot. He died when I was young, from… something with his lungs, I think. My wife says it was from the smoking. Nobody else… not that I remember. My wife’s family is healthy, I think. She doesn’t really talk about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tati. History of high blood pressure in your mother, and lung problems in your father related to smoking… that’s important information. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like smoking. My father smoked, and it made him sick. I always told myself I wouldn’t smoke. I drink… sometimes. A beer with my friends on the weekend. Not a lot. I don't do any other… things. Just work, home, and a little beer sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Tati. No smoking history and occasional alcohol consumption. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Uh… I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife gives me some medicine for headaches sometimes, the normal stuff… paracetamol, I think it’s called? Never had a problem with that. And I eat everything. I don't have any… special allergies. Maybe dust? But everyone gets sneezy with dust, right?
DOCTOR: No known medication, food, or environmental allergies. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just the headache pills sometimes, when I really need them. But I don't take them often. My wife says I should rest more instead of taking pills. She makes me herbal tea, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. Thank you for providing me with such detailed information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, okay. Sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to feel better. I hope it doesn’t take too long, I got some tires to fix later. But yeah, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tati. I’ll keep it as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and I'll listen with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds are normal, but I hear some wheezing in your lungs, especially on your lower lobes. This suggests some airway narrowing. Your sinuses are tender to the touch, and your throat is slightly red. Overall, your examination findings are consistent with a possible respiratory infection, potentially with some allergic component. I would like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is within the normal range. However, given your history of persistent symptoms, wheezing, and tender sinuses, I would like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pneumonia or other lung abnormalities. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Uh… is that… expensive? I don’t have… a lot of money. And I don’t like hospitals. But… if you think it’s important… okay. Do what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong. And I hope it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. I'll make sure to order the X-ray at the most affordable facility possible. We can also discuss potential financial assistance programs if needed. It’s not uncommon to feel anxious about medical costs, and we’ll do our best to work with you. The X-ray will help us rule out any serious underlying conditions and ensure we provide you with the most appropriate treatment. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe a course of antibiotics to address the potential bacterial infection. I'll also recommend a nasal saline spray and an over-the-counter decongestant to relieve your nasal congestion. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… are those… strong? I don’t want anything that will make me feel even more tired. And I don’t want to get sick from the medicine, you know? But… if you think it’s necessary… okay. What does it look like? A lot of pills? And how long do I have to take them for?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about potential side effects, Mr. Tati. The antibiotics I’m prescribing are generally well-tolerated, but it’s true that they can sometimes cause mild side effects like nausea or diarrhea. We can discuss ways to minimize those side effects if they occur. The course of antibiotics is for seven days, and it’s a relatively small number of pills – two pills twice a day. It’s important to complete the full course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished, to ensure the infection is completely eradicated. I will also write you a prescription for a nasal saline spray to help clear your nasal passages, and recommend you increase your fluid intake and rest as much as possible. To summarize, we’re prescribing a seven-day course of antibiotics, recommending a nasal saline spray, and encouraging rest and increased fluids. We’ll get the results of the chest X-ray as soon as possible, and we can discuss further treatment options based on those findings. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Seven days… okay. I can do seven days. And the nasal spray… that sounds easy enough. More tea, more rest… my wife will be happy to hear that. Okay, Doctor. Let’s do it. When will I get the X-ray results? And… will you tell me what they mean? I don’t understand all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Tati. I'm glad we have a plan in place. The X-ray results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. My office will contact you as soon as they are available, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. And absolutely, I will explain the results to you in plain language, without any medical jargon. It's my job to ensure you understand your condition and treatment options. Here are the prescriptions for the antibiotics and nasal spray. Please take them as directed, and don't hesitate to contact my office if you experience any side effects or have any questions. I'll also provide you with a handout outlining the potential side effects of the antibiotics and instructions for using the nasal spray. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not making me feel… stupid. My wife will be glad to hear this. And I hope the X-ray isn’t too bad. Will the antibiotics make me sleepy? I need to fix tires…
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tati. It’s my pleasure to help. I understand your concern about the antibiotics causing drowsiness. Some antibiotics can cause mild sedation, but it’s not a common side effect with the one I’m prescribing. If you do experience any drowsiness, please avoid operating heavy machinery or driving. It’s best to rest and allow your body to recover. If the drowsiness becomes bothersome, please contact my office, and we can discuss alternative options. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. I wish you a speedy recovery.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
