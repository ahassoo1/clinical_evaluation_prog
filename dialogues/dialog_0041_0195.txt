DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, it's a bit silly, really. My daughter, she insisted. Said I needed to… get a card. From you. A “get well” card, or an “encouragement” card, she said. Like I'm a child! But she worries so. It's just... she thinks a card from the doctor will cheer me up. It’s just a little… down I’ve been feeling, you see. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It sounds like you’ve been feeling a bit low, and your daughter is very thoughtful. It’s good she’s looking out for you. It's definitely not silly to come in and talk about how you’re feeling, even if it doesn't feel “serious.” A lot of things can make someone feel down. So, just to clarify, when did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I start? Hmm… It's not like a sudden thing, you see. It’s been… creeping up, I think. Maybe a couple of months now? It’s hard to say exactly. Things just… aren’t as bright, you know? Not like they used to be. My husband, bless his heart, he doesn’t notice these things. He's always busy with his garden. And my daughter… well, she tries to understand, but she's always rushing around. It just… feels a bit lonely, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a couple of months, gradually getting more noticeable. And you mentioned feeling lonely. That’s important to acknowledge. Can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… empty, really. Like… I used to have so many friends, you see? We’d meet for tea, chat about everything. But they’ve all… gone now. Passed away, moved away. And I don’t… I don’t really make new friends easily. I’ve lived here so long, everyone knows everyone. It’s not like it used to be. My husband, he has his garden club, so he’s alright. But I just… sit here. A lot. And it gets… quiet. And sometimes, quiet is just… too much.
DOCTOR: That sounds very difficult, Janeth. Losing friends is incredibly painful, and it's understandable that you'd feel lonely and isolated. It’s a big change, and it takes time to adjust. Besides the loneliness, have you noticed any other changes in how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I suppose I don't sleep as well anymore. I used to be able to fall asleep right away. Now I just… lie there. Thinking. And worrying. Mostly worrying, I think. About my husband, about my daughter, about… everything. And I don't… enjoy things as much. My husband, he keeps saying I should take up a hobby. Knitting, or painting, or something. But I just don't have the… energy for it, you see? It all seems so… pointless.
DOCTOR: Okay, so trouble sleeping, less enjoyment in things, and feeling a bit hopeless. That’s all very helpful information, Janeth. It sounds like these feelings are impacting your daily life. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… yes, that's been off, too. I used to love cooking, you see? Making all sorts of Nepali dishes. But now… I just don’t feel like it. My husband, he says I’m not eating enough. He tries to tempt me with his vegetables, but… it just doesn’t appeal. I eat a little, just enough to keep going, but… it’s not the same. Everything tastes… bland. Even my favorite momos.
DOCTOR: Okay, so loss of appetite, not enjoying food, even your favorites. And you mentioned feeling tired. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss since you've been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I think so. My daughter, she always comments on my weight. Says I'm getting too thin. I haven't weighed myself, but… my clothes are a bit looser, you see? I suppose I am losing weight. It's not like I'm trying to, but… it just seems to be happening. It worries my daughter, she keeps saying I need to eat more, but like I said, nothing tastes good anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that, Janeth. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms that have been going on for a couple of months now – low mood, trouble sleeping, loss of appetite and enjoyment, weight loss, and feelings of loneliness. These symptoms could be due to a lot of different things. Sometimes it's simply a reaction to life changes and loss, and we can work on coping strategies. Other times, it can be a sign of something else, like depression. I want to be thorough, so I’d like to ask a few more questions, and then potentially do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… depression? I don't know about that. That sounds… serious. I just thought I was getting old, you see? Losing my friends, not sleeping well… it’s just part of life, isn’t it? But… if you think it’s something else, then… I suppose I’ll answer your questions. A physical exam… alright, if you think it’s necessary. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: It's good you're open to exploring this, Janeth. It's not about labeling you with anything, it's about understanding what's going on and finding the best way to help you feel like yourself again. Many things can cause these feelings, and we'll rule things out one by one. This questionnaire is just a set of questions that helps me get a better picture of how you've been feeling emotionally. It’s completely confidential, and you can skip any question you're not comfortable with. Are you ready to start?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A questionnaire. Fine. I suppose it's better than nothing. Just… don't expect me to be very enthusiastic, you see? My mind isn’t what it used to be. And… don’t ask me about computers. I don't understand those things.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Janeth. Just answer honestly, and we'll take it one question at a time. It’s not a test, and I'll be here to help if you need it. Okay, first question: “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Oh, two weeks… Hmm. Well… most days, I think. Not every single moment, you see? But… a lot of the time. It's just… a weight, you know? A heaviness in my chest. It's not like a sharp pain, but… it's always there. It's just… how I feel now, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Next question: "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Oh… that one is easy. Almost every day, I’d say. Everything feels… pointless. My husband, he tries to get me to do things. Gardening, or going for a walk. But… what’s the point, you see? It doesn’t make me happy anymore. It just… feels like effort for nothing. Even my favorite Nepali cooking… I don’t enjoy it. It used to be my passion.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Janeth. Next question: "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, that one too. Most days. Like I said, I'm not eating much. And my daughter keeps saying I've lost weight. It's not like I'm trying to diet, you see? Just… not hungry. And even when I do eat, it doesn't taste good anymore. Everything is… bland. Even my favorite momos.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Janeth. Next question: “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Oh… every night, I’d say. I lie awake for hours. Thinking. Worrying. Sometimes I doze off for a little bit, but then I wake up again. It’s just… hard to quiet my mind. And even when I do sleep, it doesn’t feel restful. I wake up feeling tired. It's just… a constant struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Janeth, just a few more questions. "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling tired or having little energy?
PATIENT: Oh… every single day. Like a weight on my shoulders. Even getting out of bed feels like a huge effort. I just… don’t have the energy for anything. My husband, he’s always busy in the garden, he doesn’t understand. He says I should take a walk, but… I just don’t have the strength.
DOCTOR: Okay, one last question, Janeth. "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt?
PATIENT: Oh… sometimes. Not every day, but… often enough to bother me. I feel… useless, you see? Like I’m not contributing anything. My daughter works so hard, and my husband is always busy with his garden… and I just… sit here. I worry about being a burden. It’s silly, I know, but… that’s how I feel.
DOCTOR: Thank you for answering those questions so honestly, Janeth. That was very helpful. Based on your responses, and what you’ve told me today, it sounds like you’re experiencing several symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of depression. Now, that doesn’t mean it’s definitely depression, but it does mean it’s something we need to take seriously. Would you mind if I do a quick physical exam just to rule out any other medical conditions that could be contributing to how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… depression? I knew it. I just… didn't want to admit it. It sounds so… serious. My daughter will be so worried. A physical exam… alright, if you think it’s necessary. But I doubt it will show anything. It’s just… how I feel inside, you see? It's not a physical problem. But if you insist… go ahead.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to feel worried, Janeth. It’s a big word, and it’s good you're acknowledging it. And you're right, it's often how someone feels inside, but it's always good to rule out any other possibilities. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood pressure… Fine. I always worry about those machines. They never seem to get it right. My arm is a bit… thin, you know? It's hard to get a good reading. But… go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get a good reading, especially if your arm is a bit smaller. It’s just a precaution. Okay, blood pressure is 118 over 72. That's within a normal range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Deep breath. Like this? My heart is a bit… fluttery sometimes, you know? It’s probably nothing. Just old age. But… go ahead. Just be careful.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, although a little bit fast, which can be common with stress and anxiety. I'm just going to check your reflexes now. I'm going to tap on your knee with this little hammer. It might be a little surprising, but it shouldn't hurt. Okay… reflexes are a little bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon either. Everything seems within normal limits physically, which makes me more confident in considering emotional factors as the primary cause of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh… so it is just my feelings? I knew it. I just… wanted to be sure. My daughter will be relieved, I suppose. But what do I do about it, you see? Just feeling sad isn’t going to make it go away. Is there… a pill for this? My friend used to take pills for her nerves.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking that question, Janeth. And yes, there are several options we can explore. Medication can be very helpful for some people, and it’s something we can definitely discuss. Your friend’s experience is valid, and there are many different types of medications available. However, medication isn’t the only answer. Therapy, like talking to a counselor, can also be incredibly beneficial, and sometimes it's even more effective than pills. It can help you develop coping strategies, address any underlying issues, and learn how to manage your feelings. Lifestyle changes, like exercise and a healthy diet, can also make a big difference. I think the best approach would be a combination of things, tailored to your specific needs and preferences. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Oh… therapy? Talking to a stranger? That sounds… dreadful. I barely talk to my own daughter about these things. And exercise? I can barely get out of bed, let alone go for a walk. I suppose… a pill would be easier. But I don’t want to become addicted, you see? My neighbor took pills for years, and she couldn’t function without them. It’s just… a difficult decision.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel hesitant about therapy, and you’re right to be cautious about medication. It's good you're thinking things through carefully. It's not about forcing you into anything you're not comfortable with. Let’s address your concerns one by one. Therapy doesn’t have to be dreadful. There are many different types of therapists, and it’s important to find someone you feel comfortable with. It’s like finding the right doctor, it takes a bit of trial and error. And it's not about spilling your life story to a stranger, it's about having a safe and supportive space to explore your feelings. As for medication, there are many different types available, and not all of them are addictive. We would start with a low dose and monitor your progress closely. We can also discuss the potential risks and benefits in detail before making any decisions. Perhaps we could start with a smaller step?
PATIENT: Oh… a smaller step? Like what? I don’t want to spend hours talking to someone. And I certainly don’t want to become dependent on pills. My daughter would be so worried. Perhaps… a book? Is there a book about feeling sad? Something I could read in my chair? It’s just… I don’t want to make a big fuss.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful idea, Janeth. A book is a perfect starting point. It’s a low-pressure way to explore your feelings and learn some coping strategies. Here are a few books that might be helpful. “Feeling Good” by David Burns is a classic, it focuses on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. “The Happiness Project” by Gretchen Rubin is a bit more lighthearted, it’s about finding joy in everyday life. And “Reasons to Stay Alive” by Matt Haig is a personal memoir about overcoming depression. We can also explore some online resources, if you’re interested. There are many websites and apps that offer guided meditations and mindfulness exercises. Would you like me to write down these resources for you?
PATIENT: Oh… those titles sound… a bit optimistic, don’t they? “The Happiness Project”? I haven’t felt happy in months. But… I suppose it couldn’t hurt to look at them. Yes, please, write them down for me. And… perhaps that website you mentioned? If it’s not too complicated. I’m not very good with computers, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here you are. This website is very user-friendly, it has guided meditations for beginners. It's called Headspace. And don’t worry about feeling overwhelmed, just take it one step at a time. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you’re doing and discuss your progress. We can revisit the other options then, if you’re interested. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A follow-up appointment. Yes, I suppose that would be alright. Just… don’t expect miracles, you see? It’s taken a long time to feel this way, it’s not going to disappear overnight. But… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not making me take a pill.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janeth. And you're absolutely right, it won’t disappear overnight, and that's perfectly okay. It's about taking small steps and being kind to yourself. I’m glad I could listen. I’ll make a note to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about four weeks. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s my card, with the clinic’s phone number. Take care, Janeth. And remember, you’re not alone.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you again, Doctor. I suppose… I’ll see you in a few weeks then. Bye bye.
