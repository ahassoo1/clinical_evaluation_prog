DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brings me here. My husband, he… he was the one who made the appointment. Something about my speech? I’ve been a bit… off, I suppose. It’s just… difficult to explain, and even harder to remember when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common for things to develop gradually, and it’s good your husband noticed and brought it to our attention. It’s also helpful that you’re aware something feels different. Let’s try to unpack this a bit. “A bit off” can mean a lot of things. Could you describe what you’re experiencing with your speech?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, people have been… pausing, I think? Like they’re waiting for me to finish a sentence, even when I feel like I have finished. And sometimes… the words just don’t come out right. It’s not a stutter, exactly. More like… they get mixed up, or I can’t find the right one. It's really frustrating, to be honest. I work in construction management, you see, and clear communication is… rather important.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially with your line of work. Clear communication is vital. And it's good you've noticed it's impacting your job. So, it sounds like there’s some hesitancy, and occasional difficulty finding the correct words. Has this been happening consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. There are definitely days where it’s worse than others. Like, last week, at the site, I was trying to explain something to the foreman, and I just… couldn’t get the point across. It took ages, and he looked very confused! But then other days, I feel perfectly normal. It's very unpredictable, which makes it hard to explain. Do you… do you want me to try and remember any particular times it happened? I’m sorry, it’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, no apologies at all, Adyn. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble recalling specific instances, and that's actually helpful information – the inconsistency is important. We’ll take things at your pace. Now, apart from your speech, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me think… My husband says I’ve been a bit more… forgetful, generally. Not just with words, but with things. Like, leaving the keys in the fridge, or forgetting appointments. He just puts it down to stress, though. I have been quite busy with the new project. But… I don’t know. Everything feels a little… hazy, if that makes sense. Not constantly, just… sometimes. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Increased forgetfulness and a sense of haziness… we’ll definitely explore that further. It’s good that your husband is observant, and it’s important to consider both stress and other possibilities. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Um… well, I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses, as far as I know. I have Medicare, of course, but I haven’t used it much. I had the usual childhood things - measles, mumps, rubella… but nothing serious. Oh! And I had my appendix out when I was about ten, I think? But that was a long time ago. I'm married, and thankfully, my husband takes care of most of the paperwork. So, I don't really keep track of all that. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not a problem at all, Adyn. It’s perfectly common to rely on family for these things. And it's good to know you had the usual childhood illnesses and your appendix removed. We can always access those records if needed. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. Just the occasional paracetamol for a headache, but that's it. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. And my husband always makes sure I get enough vitamins, so I don’t need supplements. He’s very health-conscious. I don’t think he’d let me take anything without his approval, to be honest. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: It's good to have someone looking out for you! And yes, it's always good to know what you're taking, even if it's just occasional paracetamol. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never knowingly had a reaction to anything. My husband always checks the ingredients before I eat anything new, just in case. He’s very cautious. I remember being stung by a bee when I was little, but I didn’t have a bad reaction. Just a bit of swelling, I think. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A mild reaction to a bee sting doesn't seem to be a significant allergy. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as dementia, stroke, or other neurological problems?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult one. My mother passed away a few years ago, and she had… some problems with her memory towards the end, but we didn’t really know what it was. And my father… he’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s not very forthcoming about his health. He always says he's "fine," even when he's clearly not. I think my grandmother had something with her heart, but I’m not sure. Honestly, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. My husband says it’s not something we need to worry about, but… I feel like it might be important?
DOCTOR: It’s very common to have limited knowledge of family medical history, and it's not always easy to obtain. It’s good that you’re thinking about it, though. Knowing about potential risks can be helpful. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? What do you mean exactly? I mean, I’m married, as I said. And I work in construction management. I don’t really have much time for hobbies, to be honest. Work keeps me quite busy. We don't drink much, and definitely no smoking. My husband is very strict about healthy living. We have a small garden, and we enjoy spending time with our family when we have the chance. Is that… the kind of thing you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly the kind of thing I mean. It’s helpful to understand your lifestyle and habits. So, you work in construction management, you maintain a healthy lifestyle, and you don't smoke or drink excessively. That's excellent. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you’d like to tell me?
PATIENT: Um… well, I’ve been feeling… a bit more stressed lately, with the new project. It’s a big responsibility, and I’m worried about making mistakes. And… sometimes, I feel like my thoughts are a little… scattered. It’s hard to explain. Like I’m trying to remember something, but it’s just out of reach. And it’s getting… frustrating. I suppose that's all. It’s just… a lot of little things, really. I don’t know if it’s anything serious. I just wanted to get it checked out, to be on the safe side.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Adyn. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of stress, some cognitive difficulties, and increased forgetfulness. It’s good you’re getting it checked out, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs, a neurological assessment – which will test your reflexes, balance, and coordination – and a quick cognitive screening test. This will help me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just want to find out what’s causing these problems, and hopefully, get it sorted out. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your vital signs. I’m going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, let's move on to the neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me, and then I’ll check your balance. Gait is slightly unsteady, but stable. Balance is good. Now, for the quick cognitive screening test. I’m going to ask you to repeat three words after me, and then I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, pencil. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, pencil. I think I’ve got them. It’s… a little difficult to concentrate, but I’m trying my best. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Adyn. You repeated them correctly. Now, I'm going to ask you a few other questions, and then I'll ask you to recall those three words again. Now, can you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Um… apple… and… table… I can’t… I can’t remember the third one. It’s on the tip of my tongue… pencil? No… it wasn’t pencil. Oh, dear. I’m so sorry. I know I heard it, but I just can’t recall it. It’s… very frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Adyn. It’s not uncommon to have difficulty recalling things, especially when you’re feeling stressed. The fact that you remembered two out of three words is good. Based on this brief examination, you're presenting with some cognitive difficulties, including some difficulty with short-term memory and some mild unsteadiness. I also noted your increased stress levels and reports of scatterred thoughts. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I’d also like to schedule a brain MRI to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a brain MRI…? A brain MRI sounds… quite serious. Is it something you think is necessary? I mean, couldn't it be just stress? I’ve been working very hard lately, and I’m quite worried about the new project. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes, I suppose I’m comfortable with it. I just… I’m a little nervous, to be honest. What are you looking for, exactly? And what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Adyn. It's natural to feel nervous about medical tests, especially an MRI. The MRI is not necessarily an indication that something is seriously wrong. It’s simply a way to get a more detailed look at your brain structure and rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, such as a stroke, tumor, or other neurological condition. The blood tests will help us to rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. If something is wrong, we will discuss the results with you in detail and develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs. We have excellent specialists available if you require further evaluation or treatment. I want to assure you that we will be with you every step of the way. Now, would you like me to explain the MRI procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I think… I think I would feel better if I knew what to expect. What does it involve? Is it painful? And how long does it take? I’ve never had one before, and honestly, it sounds a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-like machine. It’s important to lie very still during the scan to ensure the images are clear. It’s not painful, but some people find it a little claustrophobic, being inside the tunnel. We can provide you with headphones to listen to music or a guided meditation to help you relax. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on the type of scan we need. We will also have a technician in the room with you at all times, and you’ll be able to communicate with them throughout the procedure. Before the scan, we will ask you about any metal implants you may have, as metal can interfere with the magnets. Do you have any metal implants, such as a pacemaker, metal screws, or any other metal in your body?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. I had my appendix out when I was little, but I don’t remember them using any metal. And I haven’t had any other surgeries. I do have some fillings in my teeth, but I assume that’s okay? My husband says they're safe for MRIs. Is it… is it very loud? I’ve heard it can be quite noisy.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct, the fillings are generally safe for MRIs. And you are right to ask about the noise – it can be quite loud. The machine makes a series of knocking and buzzing sounds during the scan. We will provide you with earplugs or headphones to help reduce the noise. Okay, so no metal implants, and we'll take care of the noise. Now, let's schedule the MRI and blood tests. The blood tests can be done here in the clinic today. As for the MRI, we have an appointment available on August 9th at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: August 9th… Yes, that should be fine. 10:00 AM… Okay. So, blood tests today, and MRI on August 9th… And you said you'll provide earplugs and headphones for the MRI? That’s… reassuring. Is there anything else I need to do to prepare for the MRI?
DOCTOR: Yes, we will provide both earplugs and headphones. For the MRI, there’s not much preparation needed. You can eat and drink normally before the scan. Just avoid wearing any metal jewelry or clothing with metal zippers or buttons. We’ll have you fill out a safety questionnaire before the scan to ensure it’s safe to proceed. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood for the tests. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and review the plan for the MRI. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, and for being so patient with me. I was… quite worried at first, but I feel a lot better now. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I understand your concerns, and I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and I’ll see you on August 9th. .
