DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s… frankly, a bit embarrassing to have to discuss this, but I’m 51. And I want a baby. Not a complicated birth, not twins, just… a healthy baby. Is that even possible? I don't want any fuss.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, it is possible, Ms. Shteynberg, though we certainly need to discuss the realities of conceiving at your age. It's good you’re thinking about this proactively. First, let's get a complete medical history. Have you had children previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, it’s none of your business why not. But that’s irrelevant, isn’t it? I want one now. But, to answer your question directly, no children. Perfectly healthy otherwise, as far as I know. I exercise, I eat… reasonably. What do you need to know, exactly? Let’s just hurry this along, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand your… eagerness, Ms. Shteynberg. However, a thorough medical history is essential, even – and perhaps especially – in your situation. It's not about being nosy; it's about ensuring your health and the potential health of a pregnancy. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, autoimmune diseases, anything at all?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, perfectly healthy. I go to the doctor when I have to. A yearly check-up, maybe. Nothing major. No… autoimmune… things. My blood pressure is always… normal. I don’t even like going to the doctor. Honestly, this is already taking too long. Are you going to tell me if it’s even possible or not? Because if it’s not, I’d rather just leave now. Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I assure you I am not trying to waste your time. But even a generally healthy individual can have underlying conditions that could impact pregnancy. And at your age, those risks are significantly increased. Alright. Let's skip the detailed past medical history for now, though I strongly recommend revisiting that later. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just… a hysterectomy. Years ago. That’s it. A perfectly routine one. Honestly, it’s all rather… unpleasant to discuss. I was… dealing with things. Is that going to be a problem? Because if I’d known I'd be grilled like this, I wouldn't have bothered. It was a simple procedure. No complications. I assume. What does that even matter if I want a baby? It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A hysterectomy… Ms. Shteynberg, with all due respect, a hysterectomy means the surgical removal of the uterus. That makes natural conception… impossible. We need to discuss this realistically. Are you perhaps considering other options, such as in vitro fertilization with a donor egg, or adoption?
PATIENT: Don't be ridiculous. I didn’t come here for a lecture on… reproductive biology. I thought I explained myself clearly. I want a baby. I've heard things. Medical advancements, you know? I assumed… you would know about them. Some sort of… procedure. I don't know. I saw an advertisement. They said it was possible. I don’t need to discuss donor eggs or… adoption. That’s preposterous. I want my baby. Are you saying it's utterly impossible? Just tell me yes or no. And stop looking at me like that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your desire. However, to be perfectly clear: a hysterectomy removes the uterus, which is where a baby grows. There is no medical procedure that can restore a uterus. Therefore, carrying a pregnancy yourself is not possible. Now, there are options, as you mentioned, such as IVF with a donor egg and a gestational carrier – a surrogate. But these are complex, expensive procedures with significant emotional and physical considerations. I can provide you with referrals to specialists who can discuss those options with you in detail. But I need to be honest: it is not a simple undertaking, and success is not guaranteed. Before we proceed further, I need to confirm you understand what a hysterectomy entails. Do you recall the reason why you had the surgery?
PATIENT: This is… insulting! I came here for a consultation, not a… a history lesson. I do not need to relive unpleasant memories! I explained myself perfectly well. And I'm perfectly capable of understanding medical procedures, thank you very much. I've heard enough. I’m wasting my time here. You’re clearly not going to be helpful. Forget it. This was a complete waste of my day. I’ll find someone else. Someone who actually understands modern medicine. .
