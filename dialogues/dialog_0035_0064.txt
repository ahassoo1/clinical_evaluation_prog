DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels… tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain is definitely something we want to take seriously. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? Around July 10th, I think. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little discomfort. But it’s been getting worse, little by little.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks. And you said it’s a squeezing tightness. Does anything specific bring it on?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When I walk, especially uphill… or if I carry something heavy, like groceries… that's when it really hurts. Even just walking quickly to catch the bus sometimes. If I stop and rest, it gets better.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it sounds like it’s related to exertion. And how long does the pain last when it happens?
PATIENT: Usually, maybe five minutes? If I sit down and take a few deep breaths, it goes away pretty quick. But it makes me nervous, you know? I don't like feeling like I have to stop all the time. My husband, Ricardo, he worries too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're listening to your body. Five minutes with exertion... Okay. Have you noticed any pain radiating anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Yes! Sometimes, my left arm feels… numb. Not all the time, but when the chest hurts really bad, the numbness comes. And… maybe a little bit in my jaw, but I’m not sure about that. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information. Numbness in the left arm and possible jaw discomfort along with the chest pain. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness when this happens?
PATIENT: Sometimes I get a little dizzy, yes. Not falling-down dizzy, but… lightheaded. And… oh! Yes, I have been a little more short of breath. Just when I'm walking uphill, like with the chest pain. No nausea, though. Never any nausea.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think... I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. I take a pill for it, every morning. And… no diabetes, I don’t think. I had my check-up last year and everything was okay. Ricardo reminds me to take my pills, so I always do!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you're consistent with your medication. What is the name of the medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see... Ricardo keeps the bottles. It's… Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril. Little white pill. I take one every morning with my coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had any problems with allergies. I eat everything! Ricardo sometimes jokes I eat too much, but I like my food. No, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Years ago, when I was younger, I had my tonsils out. But that was a long time ago, maybe fifty years? And… no hospital stays, not really. I had a bad flu a few years back, but I just stayed home and rested. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or grandparents – who have had heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes... my father, he had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was older, maybe in his seventies. And my mother, she had high blood pressure too, just like me. My brother, he has diabetes. So, yes, it runs in the family, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. Ricardo used to smoke, but he quit a long time ago. He says it was the best thing he ever did. We both like fresh air.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Sherion, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just do a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. I hear a slight murmur, but it’s not new based on your records. Lungs sound clear, but you're breathing a bit faster than normal. No tenderness to the chest wall. And finally, I’ll check your pulse. Pulse is 88, a little fast, but regular. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, your symptoms and family history suggest a possible cardiac issue. We need to investigate this further. I’m going to order an EKG and some blood work, including a cholesterol panel and cardiac enzymes. We’ll also schedule a chest X-ray. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear… cardiac issue? That sounds… serious. EKG and blood work… and a chest X-ray? I… I don’t understand all these tests. What are cardiac enzymes? And what will these tests tell us, exactly? Will they tell me what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Sherion. Let me explain. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, records the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us see if there are any irregular heartbeats or signs of damage. The blood work will give us a picture of your cholesterol levels and check for cardiac enzymes. Cardiac enzymes are proteins released into your blood when the heart muscle is damaged. Elevated levels can indicate a heart attack or other heart problems. The chest X-ray will help us look at your lungs and heart size to rule out other possibilities. These tests will help us determine what’s causing your chest pain and the best course of treatment. It doesn't necessarily mean there is something serious, but we want to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. So, the tests will see if my heart is damaged? And the blood work… that’s to see about cholesterol, like my mother had? That makes a little bit of sense. But… what if they do find something wrong? What happens then? I'm getting a little nervous, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be nervous, Sherion. We'll take things one step at a time. If the tests do show something concerning, it doesn't always mean immediate, drastic intervention. It could be something we can manage with medication and lifestyle changes. If it's more serious, we would discuss all your options thoroughly, including potential procedures or referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist. I want to assure you that we have excellent cardiologists in the area. I would never rush you into any decision and would be here to answer all your questions. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. The nurse will draw your blood, and we can get the EKG done right here in the office. Do you have any allergies to latex or iodine, as those are used in some medical equipment?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. No latex or iodine. Okay… tests. I can do tests. The nurse will get the blood… and the EKG here? Is it… does it hurt? That machine… is it safe? My neighbor, Maria, she said she had a bad experience with a machine once…
DOCTOR: No, the EKG is completely safe, Sherion. It doesn't involve any radiation or needles. Small stickers are placed on your chest, arms, and legs to measure the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't hurt at all – you won't even feel it. It's a very quick and painless procedure. The nurse will explain everything to you before she starts. I understand your concern after what Maria told you, but this is a routine test, and we take every precaution to ensure your comfort and safety. Once the tests are completed, we will review the results and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any transportation arranged to get home, or will you need assistance?
PATIENT: No, I can drive myself. Ricardo always worries, but I’m a good driver. I just get tired sometimes. So, the nurse will come get me… and do these stickers? Okay. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have to get home and make Ricardo dinner. He likes my empanadas.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. The nurse will be in shortly. It shouldn't take long, maybe 15-20 minutes for the EKG and blood work. And I’m sure Ricardo will appreciate those empanadas. I’m going to have the nurse give you a list of warning signs to watch out for after your tests, just in case. Things like worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or unusual fatigue. If you experience any of those, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Sherion?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. I'm still a little worried, but I feel better knowing what’s happening. I'll just… wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. Just try to relax and take things one step at a time. The nurse will be with you shortly. And please, don't hesitate to let us know if you have any concerns at all. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
