DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Let’s get this over with. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this… burning. Happens mostly after I eat. And sometimes stuff just… comes back up. Not a pretty sight, believe me. I’m a busy man, you know. Emergency Management doesn’t wait for indigestion.
DOCTOR: Burning, you say. After eating. And regurgitation. Right. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… well, probably six, maybe seven months ago. It comes and goes, you understand. Not every meal, thank heavens. But often enough to be a nuisance. And frankly, I haven't got time for nuisances.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months. And how would you describe the burning, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Like… like fire, naturally. Starts right here, in my chest. Goes up a bit, but mostly stays centered. It’s not… a sharp pain, more of a slow burn. And it gets worse when I lie down. Makes it difficult to sleep, which, as you can imagine, isn't ideal when you're responsible for… well, everything.
DOCTOR: And does anything relieve the burning?
PATIENT: Well, sitting up helps. And those… antacid tablets. The chalky ones. They work, sort of. But I find myself taking more and more of them. Which can't be good, can it? I mean, everything in moderation, that's what my wife says. She’s usually right, but she doesn’t have to deal with… everything.
DOCTOR: “More and more,” you say. How many “more and more” are we talking about, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Honestly? I stopped counting. Maybe… three, four a day when it’s bad. Sometimes five. Look, I don’t see the point in dwelling on the exact number! It’s enough to say it’s too many, alright? It’s a problem, that’s what I’m here to fix. I’ve got a town to run, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Not intentionally, no. I haven’t been trying to lose weight. But now that you mention it… my trousers are a bit looser than they used to be. Maybe a pound or two. But I wouldn't say it's significant. I still eat like a horse, believe me.
DOCTOR: And any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… no, not really. Food goes down. It just… doesn’t stay down, if you catch my drift. It’s the coming back up that's the problem, not getting it down. Honestly, I feel like I'm explaining everything twice.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine, let’s listen to your chest. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. And again. Seems clear enough. Anything else you haven't mentioned?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Look, I appreciate you seeing me, but I've got a meeting in an hour. If you could just tell me what I need to do to get this sorted, that would be great. I don’t have time for a long investigation.
DOCTOR: Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD. The regurgitation, burning sensation, and relief with antacids are all consistent with that. However, given your age and the potential for other issues, I'm going to order a basic blood panel to rule out anything serious. And I want you to try an eight-week course of a proton pump inhibitor – something stronger than those chalky tablets. Here are your orders. And I suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment in two months to see if this is working. If things don't improve, or if they get worse, we'll consider a referral to a gastroenterologist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A… proton pump inhibitor? Sounds complicated. And a gastroenterologist? That sounds expensive. Look, is this something serious? Because I really don’t have time for serious. And the blood work… is that going to take long? I’ve got… things. .
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be serious, Mr. Altine. But it's best to rule things out. The blood work shouldn't take long. And yes, a gastroenterologist is more expensive, but that’s why you have insurance. The proton pump inhibitor is a medication to reduce stomach acid. It’s fairly standard treatment. Take it as directed. If symptoms persist after the eight weeks, then we discuss further options. Is that clear?
