DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I told the nice lady on the phone. My hand… it shakes. It’s bothersome, really. Just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you mentioned a tremor. And how long has this… bothersome tremor been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, ages. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. A while. Since… well, since my wife passed, I suppose. Though, it might’ve started before. It comes and goes, you know? Not a constant thing. Mostly when I try to… do something precise. Like eating soup. That's a disaster.
DOCTOR: “A while” isn’t terribly helpful, Mr. Baide. But alright. So it’s worse with activities requiring fine motor skills, like using utensils. Is it just your hands, or does it affect other parts of your body at all?
PATIENT: Fine motor skills? What is this, a test? Look, it’s my hand. The right one, mostly. Don’t think it’s gone anywhere else. I haven’t noticed, anyway. And frankly, I don't go poking around looking for things to be wrong with. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Better? Worse? Look, coffee makes it a little better. Used to drink a lot of it, back in the business. Now… not so much. Stress makes it worse, naturally. But who doesn’t get stressed? It’s the world we live in. Honestly, I doubt anything really makes it better. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a look at your hands. Could you please extend both of your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. Now I have to put on a show. Fine, fine. There. Happy now? Don’t expect a performance, I’m eighty years old, not a circus performer.
DOCTOR: I see a resting tremor in your right hand, as you mentioned. It’s subtle, but present. And I notice some rigidity as well. Could you try to tap your thumb against your fingers, and then quickly alternate between making a fist and opening your hand?
PATIENT: Rigidity? What am I, a robot? There. Done. Honestly, this is all very… unnecessary. I'm a producer, not a lab rat.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see some slowness and decreased range of motion. And a slight pill-rolling tremor when you attempt to make a fist. Mr. Baide, have you ever been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, or has anyone in your family had it?
PATIENT: Parkinson's? Good heavens, no! My wife’s cousin, maybe? A very distant cousin. A bit of a hypochondriac, that one. Always something. No, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I’m a perfectly healthy man, for my age. It’s just a tremor! A little shake. People shake.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, the tremor, the rigidity, and the slowness of movement… it’s certainly possible. However, we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. And I’d like to schedule you for a neurological consult with Dr. Rossi. He’s the best in the area. It’s better to be thorough, even if it turns out to be nothing.
PATIENT: Blood work? A neurologist? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Look, I don't need a fancy doctor poking around. It's a tremor! I’ve lived a long life, I've made important films, I’ve seen things. A little shake isn’t going to ruin it. But fine, do your tests. Get it over with. Just don't expect me to come back if it's a wild goose chase. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk. And I’ll have my assistant schedule the consult with Dr. Rossi. In the meantime, try to avoid caffeine and manage your stress levels as best you can. And if the tremor worsens or you develop any other symptoms—difficulty walking, balance problems, stiffness—please contact the office immediately. It’s important to rule out anything serious, Mr. Baide. Even a “little shake” can sometimes indicate a larger problem. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: Allergies? No! I’m not some delicate flower. Just get it over with. Look, I’ve had a few shots in my life, no problems. Honestly, you’re treating me like I’m a child. Just… do the tests, send me on my way, and let me get back to my life. I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. The lab order is sent, and my assistant will contact you about the neurological consult. Here’s a requisition form for the blood work. Please take it to the lab across the street. If you experience any unexpected symptoms, or have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call. Otherwise, I’ll see you if the results warrant further discussion. Have a good day, Mr. Baide. And please, try to be a little more forthcoming with information in the future. It helps me help you.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Goodbye. And don’t bother calling. I doubt I'll be back. Honestly, what a waste of time. A tremor… they make such a fuss.
