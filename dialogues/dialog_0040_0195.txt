DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Micucci, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not really bringing me in, you know? I just… well, my niece, she said a proper doctor should write a little card. A “get well” card. Or an encouragement one. It's for my cousin’s husband. He’s got a bit of… the sniffles. Not serious, mind you. But she says it’s the principle of the thing. People need cheering up, even for a little cold. It’s good manners, really.
DOCTOR: Right. A card. For…the sniffles. And you're here for me to write it?
PATIENT: Well, yes! I mean, you are the doctor, aren’t you? A proper one. Not like those…internet doctors. It needs to be handwritten, you see. Shows you care. And honestly, I haven't the knack for these things. All my cards end up sounding like I'm…scolding him for being unwell. Which isn't the point, is it?
DOCTOR: Look, I have patients with actual medical concerns. People who are genuinely ill. I don't typically…compose encouraging notes for minor ailments. But alright. Tell me, is there anything more to this “sniffle”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Just a sniffle. He complains a bit, says his back aches, but he always complains. He used to be a porter, you see. Heavy lifting. Now he mostly sits and watches cricket. Probably a bit of damp getting to him, honestly. They live in a very old house, very…atmospheric. And he does like a good lie-down. It’s just…my niece is very particular. She says a doctor’s note has weight. More weight than anything I could write.
DOCTOR: “Weight,” right. And how long has this…episode of sniffles and backache been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…it must be…close to a week now. Maybe a little longer. He started grumbling about it after the big cricket match. England won, you see. He gets terribly excited. Screams at the television, he does. I think it strained something. It’s not like he’s ill ill, you understand. Just…a bit under the weather. And my niece thinks a card from you will cheer him up immensely. Honestly, the things people expect these days…
DOCTOR: Alright. Has he had a fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Oh, I don't believe so. He hasn’t mentioned it. He’d definitely mention it. He’s very vocal about anything that bothers him, you see. Always has been. And I haven't felt his forehead, if that's what you mean. Honestly, I wouldn't dream of it. It's a bit…improper. He's a grown man. He’d think I was fussing.
DOCTOR: Right. Any cough?
PATIENT: A bit of a cough, yes. Not a dreadful one. More of a…tickly cough, really. He hacks a bit when he’s watching the cricket. Especially when England scores. It's probably from cheering too loudly. Honestly, I think he enjoys being a bit unwell, gets extra attention from my niece. She fusses over him something terrible.
DOCTOR: Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, he says his appetite’s been a little off. But he always says that when it rains. He’s very sensitive to the weather, you see. And he’s been a bit…grumpy, maybe? But honestly, he’s always a bit grumpy. It’s his nature. He’s a retired man, what do you expect? He misses his work, I suppose. Lifting heavy things.
DOCTOR: And does he have any medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, yes! He's got…his knees. They bother him, especially in damp weather. And he’s got a bit of…trouble sleeping, sometimes. He snores something terrible, keeps my niece awake all night. She says it sounds like a walrus. And he takes a bit of…something for his blood pressure, I think. A small, white pill. But honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things. My niece handles all that.
DOCTOR: Right. Allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies? Now that you mention it… I think he sneezes a bit when the roses bloom in the garden. My sister-in-law grows them, terribly fragrant ones. But it’s only a little sneeze, not a dreadful allergy. More of a…polite sneeze, you could say. He always apologizes afterwards. Honestly, he's a very considerate man, even when he's unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay. I suppose…I can write a card. But it will be brief. And it will state that I have examined him and found no evidence of anything serious. Perhaps recommend rest and hydration. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, yes, that’s perfectly acceptable! Brief is good. Very good. I don't want it to be too…flowery. Just a proper, doctor’s note. And rest and hydration! Yes! She’ll be thrilled. Absolutely thrilled. And thank you, Doctor. Honestly, you’re a lifesaver. My niece will be so pleased.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just…compose something. Just to be clear, you understand this isn’t a full medical assessment?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely! I understand completely. It’s just…a little note. A gesture. To cheer up my cousin’s husband. A proper doctor’s gesture. And my niece…well, she’s a very discerning woman. She believes in proper things. And thank you again, Doctor. Really, you’re very kind.
DOCTOR: Here. “To Mrs. Micucci’s cousin’s husband: Examined patient, findings unremarkable. Recommend rest, hydration, and a positive attitude. – Dr. Osga.” There. That should suffice. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! Yes, that’s…absolutely perfect. “Unremarkable”! Lovely word. Very professional. And "positive attitude"! She'll love that. No, no, that’s all. Thank you so, so much, Doctor. You’ve been a wonderful help. Honestly, you’ve saved me a great deal of trouble. And my niece will be ecstatic.
DOCTOR: Alright then. Glad I could…assist. Have a good day.
