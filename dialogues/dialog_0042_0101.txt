DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been having. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been bothering me for a little while now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come… oof. It’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head that comes and goes. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It’s not like a throbbing pain, not really. More of a… a pressure, like a tight band squeezing. And it sometimes goes down my neck a little bit, the back of it. It doesn’t make me sick or anything, no dizziness, just… uncomfortable. I find it worse when I’m tired, or if I’ve been bending over a lot, like when I’m doing nails. I’ve had it for maybe three weeks now, I reckon. It started gradually, didn't just pop up one day.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Popova. A pressure-like headache, mostly at the back of the head, radiating into the neck, worse with fatigue or bending, and gradually increasing over three weeks. No nausea or dizziness, which is good to know. Now, to get a better understanding, could you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But at my age, who isn't, eh? My wife keeps telling me I should slow down, but I like keeping busy with the nails. No fever, no trouble seeing, no weakness in my arms or legs. Nothing like that. Just the headache and a bit of extra tiredness. Oh! And sometimes my shoulders feel a little stiff, especially on the right side. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts, Mr. Popova. The extra tiredness and stiffness in your right shoulder are helpful information. So, to summarize, you’re experiencing a pressure-like headache at the back of your head, radiating to the neck, with associated tiredness and right shoulder stiffness, developing over three weeks. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, all my life. Had the usual childhood things, measles and such, but nothing serious. I had a bit of high blood pressure years ago, maybe twenty years back, but that went down with diet and exercise. I don’t take any medication for it now, haven’t for a long time. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. I've always been a fairly active man, even now.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Popova. So, a history of high blood pressure that’s now well-controlled with diet and exercise, and otherwise generally good health. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always avoided them if I could. Didn't like the idea of being cut open, to be honest. Just the usual things, like getting my tonsils out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. No major operations, nothing like that. And I’ve never been in the hospital for anything serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or significant hospitalizations. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother, she had arthritis in her hands when she got older, real bad. She couldn't do much with them towards the end. My father, he had a weak heart, passed away when he was in his seventies. And my sister, she had high blood pressure too, like me, but she managed it with medication. Nothing else too remarkable, I don’t think. My grandparents, they lived to a good age, but I don't really know much about their health, to be honest. It wasn’t something we talked about much back then.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Popova. History of arthritis in your mother, heart problems in your father, and high blood pressure in your sister. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I’m married, been with my wife, Delores, for fifty-two years now. A lovely woman. I work as a manicurist and pedicurist, been doing it for… oh, goodness, almost forty years! Keeps me busy, keeps me meeting people. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a small glass of wine with dinner now and then. Don’t smoke, never have. I try to eat healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables, but Delores does most of the cooking, so it depends on her mood! As for exercise… well, the work keeps me moving, bending and stretching all day. Not much else, to be honest. I do enjoy gardening, when I have the time.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Popova. A long and happy marriage, a busy career as a manicurist and pedicurist, moderate alcohol consumption, and a generally active lifestyle with some gardening. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t taken any medication in years, so haven’t had a chance to be allergic to anything! My wife always asks me if I’m allergic before she lets me try a new food, but I always tell her “no.” I'm a pretty simple man, really. No allergies, no special needs.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Popova. No known allergies. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your neck and shoulders. It shouldn't take too long.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I've always believed in listening to the experts.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 88. Not drastically so, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to feel your neck and shoulders. I notice some tenderness in your right shoulder and some tightness in the upper back muscles. Is that where you feel the stiffness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly it, Doctor. That right shoulder has been bothering me for a while now. And that tightness you feel in my back, that’s it too. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a constant ache. I hadn't really thought much of it, just put it down to getting old and working with my hands all day, but I’m glad you noticed it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Popova. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly related to muscle tension in your neck and shoulders. The elevated blood pressure is also a factor we need to consider. To rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These will help us assess your overall health and ensure there’s nothing else going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it will help figure things out, I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. Blood tests are no bother. Just tell me where to go and what I need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Popova. I’ll write you a lab requisition with the necessary tests. You can go to the lab at Aldine Medical Center, it’s just down the road. They’re open Monday to Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM. You don’t need to fast before the tests, but please drink plenty of water beforehand. While we wait for the results, I recommend a few things to help manage your headaches. Try to practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or gentle stretching. Applying a warm compress to your neck and shoulders can also help relieve muscle tension. And I’d like you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I can show you how to use a home blood pressure monitor, and I’ll provide you with a blood pressure log to record your readings. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very manageable, Doctor. Deep breathing, warm compresses, monitoring my blood pressure… I can definitely do that. And showing me how to use the monitor would be very helpful, thank you. I haven't really used one before. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Popova. Here’s the blood pressure log. Try to take your blood pressure twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening – for the next week. Bring the log with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant to help ease the tension in your neck and shoulders. It’s not a long-term solution, but it can provide some temporary relief while we address the underlying cause. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I'll get the tests done and start monitoring my blood pressure as you instructed. And I’ll see you for the follow-up appointment. Thank you again, Doctor Vodzak.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Here’s a summary of our discussion and the instructions for the tests and medication. I’ll see you in a week. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
