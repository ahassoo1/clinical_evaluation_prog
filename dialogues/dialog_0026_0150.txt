DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Yes, lovely to meet you as well, I suppose. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get straight to it. I want a baby. A healthy baby. And I want to make sure… well, that everything works before I even bother trying. I’m not getting any younger, you know. Fifty-one isn’t exactly prime baby-making age, and I’d like to avoid any unpleasant surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Angelle. That's a very sensible approach. We want to make sure you’re in the best possible condition, and a full assessment is the right way to go. To start, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history. Where to begin? I mean, I’ve lived a life. Divorced, as you probably saw on the paperwork. That was… stressful. Lots of worrying. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing major. Broken arm once, falling off a bicycle – ironic, given my profession. And a hysterectomy… oh, about fifteen years ago. For… fibroids, I think. Yes, fibroids. Is that going to be a problem? Because frankly, if it is, I don’t even want to bother. I haven’t got time for complications.
DOCTOR: <stage>I pause, tapping my pen against the chart, trying to recall the implications of a hysterectomy for fertility. It's… significant, isn't it?
PATIENT: Right. A hysterectomy… that is a problem, isn’t it? I knew it. Honestly, sometimes I think it’s just not meant to be. All this running around to doctors… it's such a waste of time. So, just to be clear, you’re saying there’s absolutely no chance? Don't sugarcoat it. I prefer direct answers. And don't start suggesting adoption, either. I want a biological child. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Angelle, let's take a moment. You are right to ask these direct questions, and I appreciate your honesty. A hysterectomy, unfortunately, does mean you are unable to carry a pregnancy. However… it doesn’t automatically rule out having a child. There are options we can explore, like using a gestational carrier, or… egg donation. I see here in your records the hysterectomy was fifteen years ago – do you recall if your ovaries were also removed at that time?
PATIENT: Ovaries? Honestly, I barely remember what they took out, let alone if they left anything behind. The doctor just kept saying “fibroids, fibroids, fibroids”. I was so relieved to be rid of the pain, I didn’t bother with the details. I suppose… I think they left one ovary? Maybe? Is that important? If I don’t have any ovaries… well, then it’s just a lost cause, isn’t it? Don't bother with explanations, just tell me straight. And frankly, a gestational carrier sounds… complicated and expensive. Is that even feasible at my age?
DOCTOR: Okay. It appears here, and this is based on the notes from fifteen years ago, that one ovary was preserved. That is good news, Angelle. It means you might still be producing eggs, although we’d need to test that to be certain. Now, regarding feasibility… it’s true that pursuing a pregnancy at 51 does come with increased risks. But it’s not necessarily impossible. We would need to do a thorough assessment of your overall health, including hormone levels and a cardiac evaluation. And yes, gestational carriers can be expensive, and involve legal considerations. But let’s not dismiss anything yet. Before we talk about options, let’s get a clearer picture of your current situation. Would you be comfortable with some blood work and a possible ultrasound?
PATIENT: Blood work and an ultrasound… fine. Whatever it takes, I suppose, though I’m not optimistic. But don’t expect me to jump through a lot of hoops. I have a business to run, you know. People need their bicycles fixed. And I don't do well with needles. Just try to be quick about it. And I want those full records from the previous hospital. I need to know exactly what was taken out, and what, if anything, is still functioning. This is all very inconvenient, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Angelle. I’ll make sure to prioritize getting those records for you. And I assure you, we’ll be as quick and efficient as possible with the blood work. It’s a standard set of tests, and we have a skilled phlebotomist. Now, let’s get you set up for those tests, and I'll have the nurse come in to explain the process. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and your options in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And tell the nurse not to jab me repeatedly. I have a low tolerance for incompetence. Honestly, the whole thing is rather undignified. I should be fixing bicycles, not poking and prodding at my insides. Very well, let’s get on with it. And make sure the results come to me directly. No delays. I'm a busy woman.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Angelle. I’ll personally ensure you receive the results promptly, and we’ll discuss them together. I’ll also speak with the nurse to ensure a smooth and comfortable experience for the blood draw. She is very experienced. Here she is now. Nurse Ramirez, could you please assist Angelle with the blood work?
PATIENT: Right. Let’s just get this over with, then. I'm not fond of hospitals, or nurses, or needles, but if it gets me closer to knowing whether this is even remotely possible… fine. Just… be quick about it. And don't expect me to be chatty. I don't do small talk with strangers.
