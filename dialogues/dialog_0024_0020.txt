DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Benites. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is this for the… the talk on the computer? My… my daughter, she made the appointment for me. I don't usually… do this computer talk. Just wanted to make sure it is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is indeed the appointment scheduled through the patient portal. Your daughter clearly felt it prudent to utilize modern technology. However, we are here to discuss your health concerns, Mrs. Benites, not to debate the merits of electronic scheduling. Perhaps you could simply state the reason for your visit?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Well, my back… it is not so good lately. It hurts when I… when I bend. And sometimes when I sit for too long. I work on cars, you know? It is… hard work. But I like it. It just… it hurts more now. Is that… is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Benites, that is a starting point. "Not so good" is rather vague. Can you describe the nature of the pain?
PATIENT: Nature? It… it is a dull ache, mostly. Like… like a heavy weight. Sometimes… sometimes it is sharp, when I really move wrong. But mostly… dull. And it goes down my… my leg a little. Not all the way, just… part of the leg. Is that… nature enough? I don't know medical words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is… sufficient, though imprecise. And it goes down which leg, Mrs. Benites?
PATIENT: Oh! Right. Sorry. The… the right leg. Yes, right leg. Down the back of it, mostly. Not the front, the back. It… it does not go all the way to the foot, just… stops about halfway down the calf. Is that better? I am trying to explain… but it is hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is… marginally more helpful. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… not suddenly, you know? Slowly. Maybe… three months ago? It was just a little ache then. But now… now it is… more. Especially after a long day at the shop. Three months, I think. Maybe a little longer. It is hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: And have you attempted any treatments for this… discomfort?
PATIENT: Treatments? Well, I take some… some pills sometimes. My daughter gives them to me. For… for the pain. They help a little, but not much. And… and I try to stretch. But it hurts to stretch, you know? So I don't do it very often. Just when it is… really bad. I used to use a heating pad, but… I can't find it anymore. Not much, really.
DOCTOR: What is the name of the medication your daughter provides?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Let me see… Here. It says… Ibuprofen. Is that… right? I think so. My daughter always gets it for me. She says it is good for… aches.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. An over-the-counter analgesic. Adequate for minor ailments, but clearly insufficient in your case. Now, Mrs. Benites, I need to perform a brief physical examination to assess the source of your discomfort. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… okay. Physical examination. I… I hope it does not hurt too much. Just… be gentle, please? My daughter said something about my back being… old. I don’t know what that means, but… it sounded bad.
DOCTOR: "Old" is a relative term, Mrs. Benites. And I assure you, I will proceed with due caution. Please lie face down on the examination table. We will begin with palpation of the lumbar spine. Now, if you could just loosen your clothing…
PATIENT: Okay. This… this is not so easy anymore. Is this… good enough? It is hard to move. And… and cold. This table is very cold. Please… just be quick? I don’t like being cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, tell me, Mrs. Benites, does this… hurt?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! That… that hurts. Not… not terrible, but… uncomfortable. There. Right… there. On the left side. Does that… does that tell you anything, Doctor? It feels… tight. And sore. Please… not so hard?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness localized to the left paravertebral musculature. Some palpable spasm. Auscultation unremarkable. Now, does this cause any discomfort in your leg?
PATIENT: No… not really. A little… a little tingle, maybe, when you press there. But not… sharp pain. Just… a tingle. Like… pins and needles. And… and it feels… cold. Is my leg cold, Doctor? It always feels cold now.
DOCTOR: Your temperature is within normal limits, Mrs. Benites, despite your subjective sensation of coldness. The tingling sensation suggests possible mild nerve irritation. Based on my brief examination, it appears you are suffering from a lumbar strain, likely exacerbated by your… occupation. Now, I recommend a course of physical therapy and continued use of over-the-counter analgesics, although Ibuprofen is… suboptimal. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… what does that… involve? Is it… going to hurt? And… suboptimal? What does that mean? Is Ibuprofen… bad for me? I just want to be able to work again, Doctor. I don’t want to… stop working.
DOCTOR: Physical therapy involves exercises designed to strengthen the supporting musculature of your lumbar spine and improve your range of motion. It may cause some initial discomfort, but it is necessary for long-term improvement. "Suboptimal" simply means it is not the most effective medication available. It is not inherently harmful, but there are superior options. I will write you a referral for physical therapy. I also suggest a more potent anti-inflammatory. However, I am hesitant to prescribe anything stronger without further imaging to rule out any underlying pathology. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Imaging? You mean… like pictures? Of my back? Will it… hurt? And what about the… the pathology? Is that… is that bad? My daughter said something about… scans. I don’t like scans. I just want the pain to go away, Doctor. I don’t want any… pathology.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Benites, imaging involves taking pictures of your back. A simple X-ray. It is not painful. And "pathology" simply means any underlying disease process. It does not necessarily indicate anything serious. But it is prudent to rule out any structural abnormalities before initiating a more aggressive treatment plan. Here is a referral for an X-ray. Schedule an appointment with the radiology department at your earliest convenience. Once you have the results, bring them back to me, and we will discuss the next course of action. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay… an X-ray. My daughter… she can help me with the appointment, I think. She is good with… with computers. I… I don’t know what to say. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… I hope it is not too bad. Is it… is it okay if I take my time getting dressed? I am a little… stiff.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Benites, take your time. I have other patients waiting. Just remember to schedule the X-ray promptly. And try to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. Good day.
PATIENT: .
