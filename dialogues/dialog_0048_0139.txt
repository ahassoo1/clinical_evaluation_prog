DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Shanor, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. I need… check for referee. For sports. Fitness check. I think that is right? I want to make sure I'm… strong enough. I do running a lot.
DOCTOR: A “referee check”?
PATIENT: Yes. To be a referee. Or maybe umpire? Coach, too. They want me to get checked by doctor first. For… you know. Not get hurt. Is that okay? I don't know what they call it exactly.
DOCTOR: So, you're requesting a physical examination to ensure you're fit to begin working as a sports official or coach. It’s… unusual phrasing, but I understand. Let’s get some details. You mentioned running – how often and how far do you typically run each week?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Physical… check. Okay. Running… hmm. Usually, three times a week. Maybe… five kilometers each time? Sometimes more, sometimes less. Depends. I also do… some stretching. Not much.
DOCTOR: Three times a week, around five kilometers. And stretching… infrequently. Do you experience any pain during or after your runs?
PATIENT: No… not really. Sometimes my knees feel a little… old. But it goes away. Just a little bit. Old knees. I'm not very young, you know?
DOCTOR: "Old knees," alright. And how long have you been experiencing this knee discomfort?
PATIENT: Uh… a long time. Maybe… a year? Or two? It comes and goes. Not every time I run. Mostly when I run downhill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other injuries, past or present?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I broke my arm when I was little. A long time ago. And… my wife… she passed away last year. Does that count? Not an injury, but… difficult.
DOCTOR: We're focusing on physical ailments, Mr. Shanor. Regarding your arm, was that a complete break, and did it require surgery?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. Yes, it was… broken all the way through. And yes, they had to… fix it with metal. A long time ago, I told you. It doesn't bother me anymore. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Metal… alright. Any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: No, no. I don't think so. I had a check-up a few years ago. Everything was… normal. I eat pretty healthy, I think. Not too much sugar. My wife… she always made sure of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… sometimes I take something for the knees. When they really bother me. But it's just… ibuprofen, I think? Or something like that. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, as needed. And you’ve never been formally diagnosed with arthritis or any other joint condition?
PATIENT: No. Never diagnosed. Just… old knees. They get stiff sometimes. That's all. I don't know what it is. Just… knees. Can we just check if I'm good to go? I don't want to hold up your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please step onto the scale. I'll need your height and weight confirmed, and then we’ll check your range of motion and assess your joints. It’s standard procedure, even with… “old knees.”
PATIENT: Okay. Scale. Yes. I hope it's not too heavy.
DOCTOR: 134 pounds. And your height is listed as 174 centimeters. Now, if you'll follow me to the examination table, please. We'll start with your knees. Please lie down, and I’ll assess your range of motion.
PATIENT: Okay. My knees are… not very good. But I can still run. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm checking the range of motion and looking for any crepitus or swelling. Do you feel any pain with this movement?
PATIENT: A little bit. Just… a little pinch. On the inside. Not too bad. Like… old hinges. You know?
DOCTOR: Slight discomfort with flexion and extension, localized to the medial aspect of both knees. Crepitus present. Now, I’m going to palpate your knee joints. Please let me know if any of this is particularly painful.
PATIENT: Uh… yes. There. That's a little sore. Not too much. But… yes. Right there.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation on the medial joint line of the right knee. No effusion noted. Now, can you stand and slowly squat down, keeping your back straight?
PATIENT: Oh… that's… difficult. It's hard. And… it clicks.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with squatting, accompanied by crepitus. I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… tapping? It doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs clear to auscultation. Alright. Based on this brief examination… and your history… your knees are showing signs of mild osteoarthritis. It’s not surprising given your activity level and the discomfort you’ve described.
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis? Is that bad? Can I still be a referee? That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: It’s a degenerative joint condition, Mr. Shanor. It’s common as we age. It can be managed, but it will require some modifications to your activity. As for being a referee… it depends on the demands of the position. Constant running and quick changes in direction could exacerbate the condition. I recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen the muscles surrounding your knees and improve your range of motion. And, frankly, you may need to consider a less physically demanding role. I can write you a referral, but I also suggest consulting an orthopedist for a more thorough evaluation. I’m hesitant to clear you for a position that could significantly impact your joint health without further investigation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… and maybe… not running so much? I don't want to stop. Being a referee… it's important to me. Okay. A referral. Yes. Please. I… I understand. I guess. I just… I need to be doing something.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m generating a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, an excellent orthopedist in the area. She’ll be able to provide a more detailed assessment and recommend a personalized treatment plan. I’m also prescribing a course of over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed for pain relief, but do not exceed the recommended dosage. And I strongly advise against any strenuous activity until you’ve been evaluated by Dr. Vance. Here is your referral. I’m also providing a handout detailing exercises you can do to strengthen your knees. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I hope I can still do something. I'll see Dr. Vance. That’s good. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow up with Dr. Vance promptly. And remember, moderation is key. .
