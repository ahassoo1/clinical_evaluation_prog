DOCTOR: Hi Larin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor Georgiou, nice to meet you too. Um… my back. It really hurts. Bad. It’s been getting worse for maybe a week now, I think. It’s… hard to explain, but it feels like someone is pushing on my spine all the time. And it makes it hard to… well, everything, really. I’m a little scared ‘cause… you know… with the cancer and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, I understand. Back pain that’s getting worse is definitely concerning, and it’s completely understandable you're feeling scared given your history with cancer. We’ll get to the bottom of this, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that makes me feel a little better, thank you. I worry a lot. It just… feels different this time. Before, the pain was… somewhere else, and it came and went. This is… always there. Even when I’m just sitting.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me that. It's good you're noticing the difference and bringing it to my attention. “Always there” is important information. Can you tell me a little more about where specifically the pain is?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it’s… low, in my back. Like, right here. And it… it feels like it goes around a little, to my side. Not all the way around, but… kinda. And when I try to stand up straight, it gets really bad. Like a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, low back pain, mostly on the left side, radiating around a bit, and worsened with standing. That gives me a clearer picture. Does anything relieve the pain at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I lie down, it’s not gone, but it’s… less. And if I… bend over a little, like this… …it feels a little bit better for a minute. But not for long. And sitting is… the worst. Especially hard chairs.
DOCTOR: Alright, so lying down helps, bending forward provides temporary relief, and sitting, especially in hard chairs, makes it worse. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no tingling either. My legs… they feel okay. Strong, I think. I can walk, and climb the stairs… it just hurts when I do it. It doesn't feel weak, exactly. More like… tired. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Larin. "Tired" is a helpful description. And no numbness or tingling is good. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. I see here you’ve had some cancer treatment in the past. Can you tell me a little about that, and when it was?
PATIENT: Yes. Um… it was… breast cancer. About five years ago, I think. Maybe six. I had… surgery, and then… pills. For a long time. They said it was… stage two? I don't remember all the details. It was scary. They said the pills would help keep it from coming back, and I’ve been taking them ever since. I go to the cancer doctor every six months for checkups. Everything has been… okay. Until now, I guess. It’s just… this back pain is new. And I worry it’s… related.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Larin, and it’s very wise to consider a potential connection, especially with your history. We will explore that possibility. And it's good you're keeping up with your cancer doctor's appointments. Now, aside from the breast cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I get a little tired sometimes, but… that’s just from work, I think. I work at the factory, you know? Packing boxes. It’s hard work. And sometimes my back… a little sore, but nothing like this. No high blood pressure, no sugar problems, nothing. I used to have problems with my shoulder, but that was years ago and it’s all better now. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat good food, and I walk when I can. But work… work is hard on my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No other significant medical conditions, and the shoulder issue is resolved. Now, let’s talk about medications. You mentioned pills for the breast cancer. Can you tell me the names of those medications and the dosages you take?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. Okay, this one… it’s Tamoxifen. Twenty milligrams, one in the morning. And this one… Letrozole. Two and a half milligrams, every other day. That's what the doctor told me. I think. I'm pretty good about taking them, but sometimes I forget. But I try my best. And sometimes I take… Tylenol, for headaches. But not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tamoxifen 20mg daily and Letrozole 2.5mg every other day, and occasional Tylenol for headaches. I'm noting all of this. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food, latex, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I can eat anything. I can touch anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother… she was allergic to bee stings, but I’m not. So, no allergies. I’m pretty lucky, I think. It’s been a long time since anything has made me sick, except for this back pain.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Larin. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Not really my thing. And no drugs, no. Never been interested in that. I used to… when I was younger… but that was a long time ago. Now I just… work, and try to take care of my family. And sleep when I can. It's a pretty quiet life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. That’s all very helpful information, Larin. Now, finally, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members have a history of back problems, arthritis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had arthritis in her hands, I think. It hurt her a lot when she got older. And my grandmother… on my father’s side… she had cancer, too. Lung cancer, I think. But that was a long time ago. And… my brother… he sometimes gets pain in his back, but it’s not bad. Just from working, he says. Nothing like this. So, yeah. Arthritis and lung cancer, but nothing else that I know of. It’s hard to remember, you know? It’s been a long time since I talked about all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and lung cancer in your grandmother. Thank you for sharing all of that, Larin. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam if that’s okay with you. I’ll need you to change into a gown, and we’ll start with a quick assessment of your back. I’ll check your range of motion, feel for any tenderness, and do some neurological tests to make sure everything is working properly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… good. I guess. I’m a little nervous, but… I want to know what’s going on. I just… where do I change? And… will it hurt? I worry about moving it too much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Larin. It's okay to be nervous. There's a changing room just over there, behind the curtain. And I will be gentle during the exam. I won’t force you to do anything that causes significant pain. We'll move slowly and stop if you feel uncomfortable. I'll explain everything as I go. Just change into the gown, and I'll meet you back here. How about you take your time, and when you’re ready, just let me know.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better. I’ll… I’ll go change now. Just let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Larin. I'll be right here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m ready, I think. But… it looks scary. And I worry about falling. Could I… could I have a chair nearby, just in case?
DOCTOR: Of course, Larin. Absolutely. That’s a very reasonable request. Having a chair nearby will give you some extra support and peace of mind. Now, if you could lie down on your side first, that would be great. We’ll start slowly and gently. I'll be guiding you through everything, and you can tell me to stop at any time. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that’s better. Thank you. It hurts a little to lie on this side… but… okay. I’m trying to relax. Just… tell me what to do. Slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, I’m just going to gently feel around your lower back. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Just let me know. And I notice some mild muscle guarding on your left side. That means your muscles are tightening up to protect your back. Now, can you point to the exact spot where you feel the most pain?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s… it’s a deep ache, mostly. And when I move… it gets sharp. It feels like… a knot. Like something is… stuck. And it… radiates a little down my side. Not all the way to my leg, but… kind of.
DOCTOR: Okay, right here, a deep ache with a sharp component when you move, and radiation down your side. I'm noting all of that. Now, I'm going to gently straighten your leg and check your reflexes and sensation. This will help me rule out any nerve involvement. Can you tell me if you feel any pain or tingling down your leg as I lift your leg?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! That hurts! Right down my leg… not all the way to my foot, but… almost. It’s… like an electric shock. It’s… bad. Please stop. It's really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, I'm stopping right away. I'm so sorry, Larin. That was a positive straight leg raise test, which means there’s likely some irritation or compression of a nerve in your lower back. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes on both sides. Just relax your legs, and I’ll tap on your knees. Everything appears normal on the right side. On the left side… the reflex is a little bit diminished. That's also consistent with nerve involvement.
PATIENT: Diminished… what does that mean? Is it bad? Is something… broken? I’m getting really scared now, Doctor. It sounds really serious. Is it the cancer? Is it back?
DOCTOR: Larin, it’s okay to be scared. It’s completely understandable. "Diminished" just means the reflex is a little bit weaker on that side, which, as I said, suggests some nerve irritation. Now, it doesn't necessarily mean something is broken, and it doesn't automatically mean the cancer has returned. A diminished reflex can be caused by a number of things, like a pinched nerve, a muscle spasm, or even inflammation. However, given your history, we need to rule out anything serious. Right now, it sounds like you likely have a radiculopathy—that’s just a fancy term for a pinched nerve. But to be absolutely sure, I'm going to order an MRI of your lower back. That will give us a detailed picture of the nerves and discs in your spine, and help us determine the exact cause of your pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds scary. But… okay. If it will help figure out what’s wrong… yes. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? And… will I have to lie still for a long time? I get claustrophobic sometimes. I just want this to be over. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Larin. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about an MRI, especially if you're prone to claustrophobia. Now, the MRI itself doesn't hurt at all. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large machine. It’s a bit noisy, but you'll be given earplugs. You will need to lie still for about 30 to 45 minutes, while the machine takes pictures of your spine. We can absolutely address your claustrophobia. We can give you a mild sedative to help you relax. And we can keep the machine open as much as possible during the scan. The technicians are very experienced in helping patients with anxiety, and they’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the entire process. I'll write the order for the MRI now, and the radiology department will call you to schedule an appointment. While we’re waiting for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and some anti-inflammatory medication to help relieve your pain and reduce the inflammation. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Okay. Sedative… that sounds good. And the medication… yes, please. I just want to be able to sleep. I haven’t been sleeping well since the pain started. And… will the medication make me sleepy so I can’t work? I need to go to work. I don’t want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about work, Larin. We'll start you on a low dose of the muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory medication, and we’ll see how you tolerate it. The goal is to relieve your pain and help you sleep, without making you excessively drowsy. We can adjust the dosage if needed. It's important to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you feel drowsy, but most patients are able to continue their daily activities with minimal side effects. I'll also give you a note for work explaining your condition and any limitations you may have. We’ll be cautious and monitor your response to the medication closely. For now, let's focus on getting you comfortable and managing your pain. I'll get the prescriptions sent to your pharmacy, and the radiology department will call you to schedule the MRI. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You’ve been very kind. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on. And thank you for the note for work. That means a lot. I just hope it’s not… serious. I just want to get back to my life.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. It's perfectly normal to be scared, and I’ll be here every step of the way to support you. Remember, we're taking things one step at a time, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. We’ll review the MRI results as soon as they’re available and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, focus on resting, taking your medication as prescribed, and avoiding any activities that aggravate your pain. Here’s a copy of the prescriptions and the note for work. If you have any questions or concerns between now and then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Take care, Larin, and I'll see you soon.
