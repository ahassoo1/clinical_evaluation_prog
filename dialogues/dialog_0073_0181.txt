DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Korrell. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, as the chart says, I requested a general wellness check. I just turned seventy-four, you see, and my wife, Elena, insisted. She’s a very sensible woman. I feel quite alright, truthfully, but she worries, and a check-up puts her mind at ease, and by extension, mine. I like to know what’s going on under the hood, so to speak.
DOCTOR: Sensible wives are a blessing, Mr. Mombrun. A proactive approach is always wise, even when feeling well. Seventy-four is a good milestone. Now, let’s start with a bit of your history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… nothing major, not really. When I was a boy, back in Venezuela, I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing that required a stay in the hospital. Later, in my thirties, I broke my wrist falling off a ladder while building a roof – that needed a cast for a few weeks, but again, nothing serious. And about ten years ago, I had my appendix out. That was a bit unpleasant, I must admit, but the doctor here in the city was very good. Other than that… no, I can’t recall anything substantial. I’ve always been a fairly robust fellow, I suppose. Do you need dates, Doctor? I can certainly try to recall them if it's important.
DOCTOR: Dates aren't critical at the moment, Mr. Mombrun. Just a general overview is sufficient. You mentioned your appendix was removed…was there any follow-up care required after that?
PATIENT: No, not really. The surgeon – Doctor Ramirez, a very good man – he monitored me for a few days after the operation to make sure the incision healed properly, and that was it. No complications, no lingering pain, nothing of the sort. I had a follow-up appointment a month later, just to be certain, but he said I was as good as new. He told me to watch for any unusual pain, of course, but I never experienced any. It was quite straightforward, actually. I was back at work within a few weeks, though Elena insisted I take it easy for a while! She’s always looking out for me, that woman.
DOCTOR: Very good. And has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – experienced any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… my father, he suffered from high blood pressure in his later years. He managed it with medication, but it certainly affected his quality of life. And my mother, she had arthritis, mostly in her hands and knees. She was in quite a bit of pain towards the end. My older brother, Ricardo, he has diabetes, type 2, I believe. He’s doing alright, though, keeps a close eye on his diet and takes his medication regularly. I have two children, a son and a daughter, and thankfully, they both seem to be in good health. No major issues with either of them, as far as I know. Is that the sort of thing you were looking for, Doctor? I'm happy to provide more detail, if needed.
DOCTOR: That's sufficient, Mr. Mombrun. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I've never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I haven't taken much in the way of medication over the years, either. A painkiller for a headache now and then, maybe an antibiotic if I caught a bad cold, but nothing regular. I don't have any known allergies to food, plants, or insects. Elena always checks the labels carefully, just to be sure, but I've never had a problem. I consider myself quite fortunate in that regard. Is there anything specific you're concerned about, Doctor? Perhaps a common allergy I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: No, not particularly. Just covering all the bases. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single one. Elena suggests I take a vitamin D supplement, with the winter months being so long here, but I haven’t gotten around to it. I’ve always been a bit skeptical of those sorts of things, to be honest. I believe in a good diet – plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables – and getting enough sunshine when possible. And, of course, a good night's sleep. But no, I don't take any prescribed medications, over-the-counter drugs, or vitamins. Nothing at all. I pride myself on being a rather…natural fellow. Would you recommend I start taking something, Doctor? Perhaps the vitamin D?
DOCTOR: We can discuss supplements later, Mr. Mombrun. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. If you’ll just step onto the scale, please. And then we’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Standard procedure, you say? Quite right, of course. I haven’t weighed myself in some time, I must confess. Elena keeps track of these things, but she hasn’t mentioned anything recently. Hopefully, I haven't gained too much weight. It's difficult to resist a good meal, you see. Go ahead, Doctor, I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: 193 centimeters, 90 kilograms… alright. Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, if you'll just breathe deeply for me… Lungs are clear. Heart sounds…regular, but slightly stronger than ideal. Do you experience any shortness of breath, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. No shortness of breath. I walk up and down the stairs at home every day – three flights, mind you – and I have no difficulty whatsoever. I even help my neighbor with some heavy lifting occasionally. I am a construction laborer, you see, and have been for many years, so I remain quite active, despite my age. A slightly stronger heartbeat, you say? Perhaps it's just the exertion. Is that something to be concerned about, Doctor? I do appreciate your thoroughness. It's reassuring to know you're paying such close attention.
DOCTOR: It warrants further investigation. We'll need to run some blood work to get a better picture. And I think an EKG would be prudent, just to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. We'll schedule those tests for you, and then we can discuss the results at a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG… alright. Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A thorough investigation is always best, I agree. Well… I suppose I was hoping for a quick reassurance that everything was in order, but that was perhaps unrealistic. The slightly stronger heartbeat… is that something that could be related to the work I do? I lift heavy materials, climb scaffolding… it’s quite physical, you see. And I do drink coffee, perhaps a little too much, if I'm honest. Could that be a factor? I just want to understand what's going on, Doctor. And, of course, I trust your judgment implicitly. What sort of timeframe are we looking at for the tests? And will Elena be able to accompany me to the follow-up appointment? She worries, you see.
DOCTOR: The workload and caffeine intake could certainly be contributing factors, Mr. Mombrun. But we need to rule out anything more serious. The lab results should be back within a week, and we can schedule the EKG for tomorrow. As for the follow-up, yes, your wife is welcome to attend. However, I will primarily address my concerns directly to you. Now, let me just input the orders for these tests… It's standard protocol.
PATIENT: Standard protocol, yes. I understand. It’s good to be thorough, I suppose, even if it means a little extra inconvenience. A week for the results, you say? Very well. And tomorrow for the EKG. Perhaps you could explain a little more about what the EKG involves, Doctor? I’ve never had one before. Is it painful? And will I need to avoid anything beforehand, such as caffeine, as you mentioned? I wouldn't want to inadvertently skew the results. Elena will be pleased to hear she can accompany me to the follow-up. She always appreciates being kept informed. Thank you, Doctor. I trust you will let me know as soon as the results are available.
DOCTOR: The EKG is a non-invasive procedure, Mr. Mombrun. Small sensors are placed on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It’s painless, but you’ll need to lie still for a few minutes. And yes, avoid caffeine for 24 hours beforehand. It can interfere with the readings. The nurse will provide you with detailed instructions before you leave. Now, if that’s all, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. No caffeine for 24 hours. I can manage that. The nurse will provide instructions. I understand you have other patients. Thank you for your time, Doctor Korrell. I appreciate your attention to my health, and I look forward to discussing the results with you at the follow-up appointment. Perhaps a little less coffee is a good thing anyway. .
