DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're 64 years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need a… a paper signed. Something about gettin’ somethin’ done. A… a fixin’ up, you understand? My… my associate said I needed clearance. Don’t rightly recall all the details. It's cosmetic. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: An associate sent you here for a “clearance” without a proper explanation?
PATIENT: Well, he’s a… a businessman. Knows these things. Said somethin’ about… risks and such. I just need the doctor to say I’m okay to… proceed. I ain’t got time to be explainin’ every little thing to you. It's a simple matter. You do these things all day, don't ya?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, a medical evaluation requires more than simply stating you need a paper signed. I need to understand what this “fixin’ up” entails, and why your associate believes you need medical clearance. It is my professional responsibility to ensure your safety. Could you perhaps describe what procedure this involves?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t recall. It’s somethin’ for… my appearance. Makes me look… younger. He said it involves… needles. And… somethin’ bein’ put under the skin. That’s all I know! Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I thought doctors just did things. Not ask a million questions! Is this somethin’ you can do or not? I ain't got anythin' to hide, just no patience for this.
DOCTOR: “Needles and something being put under the skin…” That sounds like an injectable cosmetic procedure, such as dermal fillers or Botox. While these are relatively common, they are not without risks. I need to know the specifics. Do you recall where on your body this would be done?
PATIENT: Ugh… the face, I think. Around… the eyes and… the lines. Look, I barely remember what I had for breakfast, you want me to recall the exact location of a procedure? He showed me pictures, somethin’ about “lifting” and “smoothing”. It was a… a sales pitch, honestly. Just tell me if I’m healthy enough or not. Is that so much to ask? I ain’t a complicated man.
DOCTOR: Very well. To assess your suitability for such a procedure, I will need to conduct a brief physical examination and review your medical history. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I eat whatever’s put in front of me. Dust bothers me sometimes, but that’s it. Never had a problem with… medicines or nothin’. I’m a strong man. Always been healthy. Don’t waste time with that stuff, Doctor. Let’s just get this over with. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, even if you believe you are “strong,” a proper medical assessment is crucial. I need to check your vital signs, examine your skin for any pre-existing conditions, and rule out any contraindications. Please allow me to conduct a basic examination. It will only take a few minutes. First, may I check your blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Fine, fine! Do whatever you gotta do. But hurry it up, will ya? I got appointments, you know. Important ones. Just… don’t poke me too much. And please, no talkin’ about my… my complexion. It's sensitive. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 145 over 90. That is somewhat elevated. And your pulse is 88. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Skin is somewhat dry and shows signs of sun damage. I see some wrinkles around the eyes and forehead, as you mentioned. There is some loss of elasticity. Mr. Honcoop, given your elevated blood pressure and the presence of a heart murmur, I am concerned about proceeding with an elective cosmetic procedure at this time.
PATIENT: What? What’s wrong with my blood pressure? I feel fine! A little murmur… everybody’s got somethin’. Don’t tell me I can’t get a little fixin’ up just because I’m gettin’ older! My associate said this clinic was reputable. He said you could handle anything. I need this done. Is it going to cost me extra because you're makin' a fuss? I ain't got money to waste.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, it is not a matter of “fussing.” Your elevated blood pressure significantly increases the risk of complications during and after an injectable procedure, such as bruising, hematoma formation, or, in rare cases, even more serious cardiovascular events. The heart murmur also requires further investigation. It would be irresponsible of me to proceed without addressing these underlying health concerns. I recommend you consult with a cardiologist to evaluate your heart condition and a primary care physician to manage your blood pressure. Until those concerns are addressed, I cannot, in good conscience, perform this procedure.
PATIENT: Well, that’s just great! A waste of my time, a complete waste! I come here for a simple thing, and you tell me I need more doctors? My associate is going to hear about this. You know what? Forget it! I’ll find someone else. Someone who understands… business. Don't bother sending me a bill. I won’t be payin’ it. .
