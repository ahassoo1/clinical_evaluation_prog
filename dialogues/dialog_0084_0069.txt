DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiò. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I think. Medicare sent me a notice saying it was time for one, or maybe a few? I wasn't quite sure which one, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Medicare does send out a lot of those notices. Let’s take a look at your records here… Ah, yes. It looks like you're due for your updated COVID-19 vaccine, and also a booster for your Tdap – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Do you have any allergies to vaccines, or have you had any reactions to them in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always gotten my shots when they were recommended, and I don’t remember ever having a problem with any of them. I think everything went okay before. It's been a while though, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: It has been a while. Okay, good. And just to confirm, no fever, rash, or anything unusual after any previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I always felt a little tired maybe, after, but that’s about it. Just normal, I thought. Like how you feel after a long day, you know? Is it normal to feel tired? I always wondered if it was the shot or just me being tired.
DOCTOR: It is normal to feel a little tired or achy after a vaccine – that means your immune system is responding, which is a good thing. It usually goes away within a day or two. Now, let’s quickly go over your medical history, just to make sure everything is up-to-date before we proceed. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to eat well and walk when I can. My mother had high blood pressure, but I haven't had any trouble with that so far. I had my blood checked a couple of years ago and the doctor said everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, playing football, but it healed up fine. No hospitals since then, thankfully. I try to avoid those places if I can. Is everything alright so far? I just want to make sure I'm giving you all the information you need.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is all very helpful, thank you. Just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes I’ll take a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that’s about it. Just the usual stuff, like ibuprofen when needed. And a multivitamin sometimes, but I haven’t taken one in a while. It slipped my mind, honestly. Do you need to know exactly which ibuprofen? I have a bottle at home if you need the brand name.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, the generic is fine. So, no regular medications. Now, just to finish up the history, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month or so. Definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a pretty boring guy, I'm afraid! I like to keep things simple. Are we almost done with the questions? I'm ready for the shot, if you are.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Paguiò, we’re almost there. Just one last thing. Have you had any unusual symptoms recently, like fever, chills, weight loss, or anything else that’s concerning you?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been feeling pretty normal, all things considered. Maybe a little tired, like I said, but that's just life, isn't it? Everything else feels alright. No fevers, no chills, no losing weight. I'm eating okay, sleeping okay... I think I’m good. Can we get this over with, please? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Everything sounds good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to be sure. Then we can get you vaccinated. Please take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breath… Like this? Is that okay? I always worry I'm not breathing right when someone asks me to.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. And again… good. Everything sounds clear. Now, are you comfortable with getting both vaccines today – the COVID booster and the Tdap?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. If you say it’s okay, then I’m comfortable. I just want to get it done, to be honest. The sooner it’s over, the better, right? Can we do them both in one arm, or is that not good? I don't want to get two shots if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: We can do them both in the same arm, yes. Sometimes it can feel a little more tender, but it’s perfectly safe. Okay, this might sting for a moment… just try to relax your arm. Here we go… All done.
PATIENT: Ouch! That did sting a bit. But it's over now, right? How long do I need to wait here? And should I be worried about anything afterwards? I usually get a bit nervous after shots, just in case. Will I feel really sick?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s all over now. You might feel some soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site for a day or two. Some people also experience mild fatigue, headache, or muscle aches, but it's usually mild and goes away on its own. We’ll have you wait here for 15 minutes, just to make sure you don't have any immediate reaction. Just relax in that chair, and if you feel anything unusual, let the nurse know immediately. I'll be back to check on you shortly. Do you have any questions right now?
PATIENT: Okay, 15 minutes. I can do that. So, just mild stuff, mostly? Nothing serious? And the nurse is here if I feel bad? That's good to know. I don’t think I have any questions right now, but I’m always a bit of a worrier, so I might think of something later. I'll sit down over there. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paguiò. It's my job. The nurse will be by to check on you in a few minutes. I'll be back to discharge you shortly. Just try to relax. I have another patient waiting, so I’ll let you settle for a bit. If anything comes up, don't hesitate to call out.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I will. I'll just sit here quietly and try not to think about it too much. Thank you again, Doctor.
