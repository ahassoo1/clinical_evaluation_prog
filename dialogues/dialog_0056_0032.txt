DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Krok, welcome. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s a… delicate matter. An unpleasantness, really. I’m not accustomed to discussing such things, you understand. It’s… a discharge. From… down there. It’s been going on for a bit now, though I can’t precisely say how long. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? My wife noticed, thankfully. She has a… keen eye.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. These things happen, and it's good you're addressing it. It's also good your wife noticed; it's helpful to have someone else's perspective. "A bit now" is okay—roughly, would you say a week, a month, longer than that?
PATIENT: A month… perhaps a bit more. It’s difficult to say, truly. I’ve been preoccupied with the tractor, you see. The carburetor… a constant battle. I suppose it could be longer. Longer than a month, certainly. But not… years. Definitely not years. Though, honestly, Doctor, I wouldn’t put it past time to be playing tricks on me. It feels like just yesterday I was fixing Old Man Hemlock’s combine… but that was… well, never mind. It’s a month-ish, I suppose. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: "Month-ish" is fine, Mr. Krok. Don't worry about being precise. And yes, time does have a way of slipping away. Now, can you describe the discharge to me?
PATIENT: Describe it… Goodness. It's… not pleasant, Doctor. It’s… a fluid. A yellowish… tinge, I believe. Not terribly copious, thankfully. A bit sticky, perhaps. And… there’s an odour. Not a strong odour, mind you. But noticeable. It stains the undergarments, of course. My wife was most displeased. It's simply… not dignified. Is that helpful? I feel rather foolish discussing this.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Krok. You're not foolish at all. It's important information, and I appreciate you being open with me. A yellowish fluid with a slight odor… Okay. Has there been any pain, burning, or itching associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain… not precisely pain. More of a… discomfort. A mild irritation, after… use, shall we say. And… a slight burning sensation sometimes. Not constant, mind you. Only occasionally. And a bit of itching, yes. But nothing… debilitating. It's more of a… persistent annoyance, really. Like a pebble in one’s shoe. Does that make sense? It's hardly worth mentioning, but you asked.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Krok. And it is worth mentioning. Okay, so mild irritation after urination, and occasional burning and itching. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary stream – like difficulty starting, stopping, or a weaker stream than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… a weaker stream… now that you mention it… perhaps. It's not something I consciously observed, but now that you ask… yes. It’s not as… forceful as it once was. And… sometimes it takes a moment to… begin. Not a significant delay, mind you. But a moment. A hesitation, perhaps. It’s rather embarrassing to discuss these details, Doctor. I pride myself on… functionality. This is most unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your embarrassment, Mr. Krok, but this is all very helpful information. It sounds like we're dealing with something that needs to be investigated. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An examination… I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? I was hoping to avoid such… intrusions. But if it’s necessary… very well. Just… please be expeditious, Doctor. And discreet, if you would be so kind. My dignity is already rather frayed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I'll be as quick and discreet as possible. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I'll need to take a look and possibly collect a small sample. We'll start with a visual examination, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see… No, I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of. A bit of hay fever in the spring, perhaps, but nothing… serious. My wife insists I take something for it. She worries, you see. I’ve always been a robust individual. Not prone to… sensitivities. Just… be gentle, Doctor. That is all I ask. This is… most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. I'll be as gentle as possible. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright, Mr. Krok, I'm just going to have a look now. I do see some mild redness and a small amount of yellowish discharge, as you described. Your abdomen feels soft, but there's a bit of tenderness in the lower region. No masses or significant swelling. I'm going to need to collect a urine sample, if you're able. I'll give you a container. Do you think you'll be able to provide a sample?
PATIENT: A urine sample… yes, I suppose I can manage that. Though, I must confess, it’s been a while since I’ve… performed such a task with… clinical precision. My wife usually handles such matters when I’m unwell. Where is this… container? Just… please be quick about it, Doctor. This is… most undignified. I feel rather foolish.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Here you go. Take your time. There's a private bathroom just over there. I'll give you a few moments. I’ll be just outside if you need anything. Don’t worry about making it “clinical,” just do your best.
PATIENT: Old Man Hemlock’s combine… at least that had a purpose… This… this is simply dreadful.
