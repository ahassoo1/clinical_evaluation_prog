DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this cough. It just won't quit. Been going on for… oh, I’d say close to a month now. And it feels worse when I lie down, you know? It wakes me up at night. My heart isn't what it used to be, and the nurse said to come in if it got bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for close to a month that’s worse when you lie down… and you mentioned your heart isn’t what it used to be. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. It’s not a dry cough, exactly. It brings up… well, a little bit of phlegm. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes it's a little… yellowish. Not much, though, you understand. And it doesn't hurt, not really. Just… tiring, always coughing. It feels like something’s tickling my throat, even when there’s nothing there there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A productive cough with clear or yellowish phlegm, no pain, but tiring… okay. And when you say it’s been a month, has it been steadily getting worse, or has it been more up and down?
PATIENT: Hmm. I'd say it's been… up and down, yes. Some days it’s just a little tickle, and I barely notice it. But then other days, like yesterday, it was awful. I had to sit up most of the night. It feels worse after I eat, sometimes. Especially if I have anything with… cream in it. Or a lot of salt, I think. My daughter says I shouldn’t have so much salt, anyway. She worries about my swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, up and down, worse after eating, especially with cream or salt, and your daughter has noticed some swelling… Do you notice any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I get a little short of breath, sometimes. Especially when I walk up the stairs. I used to be able to run up those stairs, you know! Now… not so much. And my ankles do swell up a bit at the end of the day. That's what my daughter worries about. She's a good girl, that one. Always looking after me. Oh, and I get tired easily, I suppose. But at my age… isn’t everyone tired easily?
DOCTOR: That's fair. Short of breath with exertion, ankle swelling, and fatigue… it's helpful to know all of this. Now, have you had a fever at any point with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I've noticed, anyway. I haven't been feeling hot or anything like that. My daughter checks my temperature sometimes, but it’s always normal. She’s very careful. I think she worries too much, but it’s sweet of her, really. Just a little overbearing sometimes! But no fever. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever. Good. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, the main thing is my heart. I have… what was it now… congestive heart failure, that’s it. The doctor told me years ago. I take some pills for it. Water pills, mostly, and something else… I can’t quite remember the name. I have all my medicines in a little box at home. And I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But I recovered from that. Oh, and I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands. It doesn’t bother me too much, though. Does that cover it? I'm a little forgetful sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Congestive heart failure, water pills, pneumonia in the past, and some arthritis. Do you remember the name of the other heart medication you take, besides the water pills?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… It’s a little white pill… and the name starts with an… L? No, maybe a D… Oh, dear. This is terrible, I really should remember these things. My daughter helps me keep track of everything. I think it’s something to keep my heart from beating too fast, but I can’t remember the name for the life of me. I apologize. It’s right there on the bottle, I'm sure. Would it be easier if my daughter called the pharmacy? She's very good at these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Nadene. It's understandable to forget these things. No need to apologize at all. We can certainly have your daughter call the pharmacy if that's easier. In the meantime, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to any of my pills, thankfully. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a child, but I haven’t been stung in years. And I don’t use any creams or anything like that, so I wouldn’t know about those. I’m very careful about what I put in my body, you know. My mother always told me to be careful. So, no, no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my… social history? What does that mean? I mostly stay home, you know. I used to love to dance, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I have my daughter visit every week, and my grandson comes by sometimes. I enjoy watching the television and listening to the radio. I don't drink alcohol, and I haven't smoked in over fifty years. Does that cover it? I’m not a very social person, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Nadene. You stay mostly at home, haven’t smoked in years, don’t drink alcohol, and enjoy visits with family. Alright. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles to see if there's any swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Go right ahead. I always trust doctors, you know. My mother always said they were the best people in the world. I’ll just sit here and try not to wiggle.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m hearing some congestion in your lungs, which is consistent with a cough. Your heart sounds a bit… irregular. And yes, I can see some swelling in your ankles. Just a little more information for documentation…
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? My heart’s always been a little… funny, you know. The doctor told me it skips a beat sometimes. Is it bad? Should I be worried? My daughter’s going to be so upset if she finds out. I try not to tell her everything, you know. She worries too much as it is.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Nadene. The congestion in your lungs and the irregularity in your heart rhythm, along with the swelling in your ankles, do need to be addressed. It doesn't necessarily mean anything terrible, but given your history of congestive heart failure, it’s important to rule out a few things. It's good that we're taking a look at it now. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better picture of what's going on. Do you have any trouble breathing right now?
PATIENT: Oh, an X-ray and an EKG… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. No, I don’t have trouble breathing right now, not exactly. But like I said, I get a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs. Or if I try to carry something heavy. Just a little… winded, you know? Not a panic or anything. Just… out of puff. It’s probably just my age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to describe that, Nadene. Feeling short of breath with exertion is important information. Given your symptoms and your history, I’m concerned about a possible flare-up of your congestive heart failure. We need to rule that out. I'm also going to order a blood test to check your kidney function and a BNP level, which is a marker for heart failure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, more tests… alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. Yes, that's alright. A blood test… I don’t mind that. Just try not to poke me too much, please? My veins aren’t very good, you know. The nurse always has trouble finding them. I get a little nervous around needles. But if it helps, then I’ll do it. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the needles, Nadene. We’ll take our time, and I'll let the nurse know to be gentle. Okay. Once we have the results from the X-ray, EKG, and blood tests, we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on and can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity and limit your salt intake as much as possible. And if you experience any worsening of your shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No strenuous activity, limit salt, and go to the emergency room if things get worse. I understand. My daughter will be happy to hear me promise to limit the salt, she's been telling me that for years! Will you tell me what the X-ray and blood tests are for, exactly? I like to know what’s happening, you know. My mother always said knowledge is power. Just a little explanation, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nadene. The chest X-ray will help us see if there’s any fluid buildup in your lungs, which can be a sign of heart failure. The blood tests will check your kidney function, as your kidneys play a role in regulating fluid balance, and the BNP level specifically tells us how stressed your heart is. A higher BNP level usually means your heart is working harder than it should. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense. Fluid in the lungs, check my kidneys… and the BNP level is how hard my heart is working. So, if there’s a lot of fluid, and the BNP is high… that means my heart is getting worse? Is that what you're saying?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Nadene. It could mean that your heart failure is worsening, yes. But it’s important not to jump to conclusions until we have the results. There are other things that can cause fluid buildup and elevate the BNP level. That’s why these tests are so important – to get a clear picture of what’s going on. We’ll discuss all the results together and come up with a plan that’s best for you. In the meantime, try to rest and focus on limiting your salt intake. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Rest, limit salt, wait for the results… Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. You’re a very kind doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Just one last thing… how long will it take to get the results? Will I have to come back again soon?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. I'm glad I could help. The results should be back within a couple of days. The lab usually prioritizes these tests, so we can likely schedule a follow-up appointment within a week to discuss them. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly acceptable. A week is fine. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease. I think that's everything. I should probably get going now. I don’t want to take up any more of your time. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. It was my pleasure. Get some rest, and remember to limit your salt intake. We’ll be in touch soon. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms before then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too. And thank you again for everything.
