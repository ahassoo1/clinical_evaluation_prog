DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… things haven't been right for a little while now. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I don’t eat much. It feels full really quickly, you know? Like after just a few bites. It’s… uncomfortable. I’m not sure what’s causing it. I just feel…off.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite distressing to be feeling sick to your stomach and full so quickly. “Off” is a good way to describe it, I suppose. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s… a good question. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It feels like it’s been a few months, maybe? Or longer? I really can’t pinpoint it exactly. It came on slowly, I think. Not all at once. It's just been getting worse little by little. Does that make sense? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly understandable, especially when things have come on gradually. “Little by little” is helpful information. So, a few months, perhaps longer, with a slow progression of symptoms. Could you describe what the sickness feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like a bad flu feeling, not exactly. It's more… a queasy feeling. Like something’s just… unsettled in my stomach. And it doesn’t always lead to actually being sick, just feeling like I might. Sometimes it happens right after I start eating, and sometimes it’s just… there. It’s hard to explain. And like I said, even a little bit of food can make it happen. It doesn’t seem to matter what I eat, either. I used to enjoy my meals so much… but now, it’s just a worry.
DOCTOR: I see. A queasy, unsettled feeling, sometimes with and sometimes without nausea, and triggered by even small amounts of food, regardless of what you’re eating. And it’s impacting your enjoyment of meals, which is certainly concerning. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… other symptoms… Hmm. I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, more tired than usual. And… I don’t know if this is related, but I haven’t been as hungry as I used to be. I suppose that makes sense, if I’m feeling sick all the time. I’ve also… lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. But honestly, I haven’t weighed myself recently. My daughter usually keeps track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so alongside the queasiness and nausea, you’ve also been experiencing increased fatigue, decreased appetite, and some unintentional weight loss. That’s helpful information. Now, Ms. Kelder, may I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh my… medical history… That's a long story, Doctor. Well, I was diagnosed with… well, my daughter tells me it’s a type of cancer a few years back. It’s in my… abdomen, I believe? I've had treatments, of course. Chemo, mostly. It helped for a while, but… things seem to be coming back, I suppose. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I'm under the care of another doctor for that, but I just thought this stomach trouble was… something else. Is that okay? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Ms. Kelder. Thank you for sharing that with me. Knowing about your prior cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy treatment is very important. It certainly puts this current situation into a clearer context. And it’s understandable why you might think this stomach trouble is something separate. To clarify, you're currently under the care of another oncologist for this abdominal cancer, and this recent onset of nausea, fullness, and weight loss is what prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly right, Doctor. That other doctor… Dr. Alvarez, her name is… she's a very good woman. But this is different, I think. The cancer treatments have side effects, of course, but this… feels new. It’s a different kind of sick. It’s hard to explain, but it feels like something else is going on along with the cancer. I hope that makes sense. I just want to feel a little bit better, if that's possible. I miss being able to enjoy a good meal with my family.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Kelder. You’re very articulate about this, and I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. It's important to investigate any new symptoms, even in the context of an existing illness like cancer. And wanting to regain some quality of life and enjoy meals with your family is a perfectly valid goal. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your abdomen and feel for any changes. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. Please, go right ahead. I trust your judgment. My abdomen… it’s been a little tender lately, I suppose. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. I just hope it’s not too serious. I'm a bit worried, to be honest. But I'm trying to stay positive. My grandmother, she was Cherokee, and she always said to face things with courage. It’s just… hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful sentiment, Ms. Kelder, and courage is definitely needed. I’m glad your grandmother instilled that in you. I’m going to gently press on your abdomen in different areas. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. Okay, Ms. Kelder. I’m noticing some tenderness in the upper right quadrant, and a slight fullness throughout. There’s no rebound tenderness, and no guarding, which is good. I do feel a slight enlargement, but it’s difficult to assess the size precisely at this point. Your bowel sounds are present, but a bit diminished. Based on what you've told me, and the findings of the physical exam, I think it would be wise to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests. I’d also like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and other structures. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best to figure out what's going on. Blood work and an ultrasound… alright. I don't mind. I just want to know what's happening, and hopefully, there’s something that can be done. I’m a bit nervous about the ultrasound, I’ll admit. But I trust you. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening to me, and for taking the time to figure things out. It means a lot. Sometimes, I just feel so… lost.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s my job to listen, and I’m glad I can help. I understand your nervousness about the ultrasound, but it’s a non-invasive imaging test and will give us a lot of valuable information. I'm going to have my nurse draw the blood for you now, and we'll schedule the ultrasound for as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I just… I’ll try not to worry too much. And I'll let you know if anything changes. Thank you again. You've put my mind a little bit at ease. I appreciate your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I’m glad I could offer some reassurance. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I'll see you back when the lab results and ultrasound are available. Have a good day, Ms. Kelder.
