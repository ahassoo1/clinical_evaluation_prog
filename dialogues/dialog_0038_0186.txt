DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Um, well, I’m trying out for a team… a sports team. Need a checkup, I guess. Physical, right? Just gotta make sure I’m okay to go. Don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Right, a sports physical. Good idea to get checked out beforehand. Absolutely. We'll do a thorough exam. Before we get started, can you tell me a little more about the team you're trying out for and what sport it is?
PATIENT: It’s… Mongolian wrestling. Not a big thing here, but there’s a local club starting up. I used to do it when I was younger, back home, but haven’t really… kept it up. Just thought I’d see if I still got it, you know? It’s pretty rough on the body, though. That's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling, fantastic! That is a physically demanding sport. It’s good you're thinking ahead. Okay, so you used to wrestle, but haven't been active recently. That's helpful to know. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Honestly? Not much. I’ve been pretty lucky. No major surgeries or anything. I broke my wrist once, when I was a kid, falling off a horse. Healed up fine. Other than that… just the usual colds and flu. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Don’t like it, if I’m being honest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. It’s good you haven’t had any major medical issues. Okay, so a broken wrist as a child, which healed completely, and generally healthy otherwise. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. My family… we’re all pretty healthy, as far as I know. My mother had some trouble with her knees when she got older, but that’s about it. I try to eat okay… mostly. And I walk a lot. Just… not wrestling. You know? Is this… is this what you need to know? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, Mr. Kingan. It's good to hear about your family history - that’s helpful. And walking is good! Alright, let's talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not really. I mean, I get hay fever in the spring, if that counts. Nothing serious. And I don’t take any medications. Not even aspirin. I try to avoid them if I can. I'm… a bit wary of putting things in my body, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. No allergies to medications, just seasonal hay fever, and you don’t currently take any medications. Excellent. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone. I work… doing some media stuff, it’s a bit complicated. Mostly I just… try to keep busy. Walk a lot, like I said. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink… maybe a beer or two on the weekend. Nothing crazy. I try to get enough sleep, but sometimes work gets in the way. It's… pretty boring, honestly. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, Mr. Kingan. No smoking, occasional alcohol, and generally try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Okay, let's move on to the physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs. We’ll also do a basic musculoskeletal exam to check your joints and muscles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind? I got some stuff I need to get back to. Not a big fan of being poked and prodded, to be honest. But I understand it needs to be done. Let’s just get it over with, I guess.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kingan. I'll be as efficient as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, that's 140/90. A little elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… deep breath. . Is that okay? It’s just… this air in the city isn’t the best, you know? I’m probably just out of shape. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I hear some slight wheezing, as you mentioned. It's common with city air and could be related to mild asthma or irritation. We’ll discuss that further. Now, I'm going to check your pulse. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let’s move on to the musculoskeletal exam. I'll need you to do a few simple movements for me. Can you raise both of your arms above your head?
PATIENT: . Oof… a little stiff. I haven't done that in a while. It's… not painful, just… tight. Like I need to stretch more. And maybe lose some weight. Is that what you're looking for? Problems? I got plenty.
DOCTOR: I see. Some stiffness, which is not uncommon with inactivity. No pain, which is good. Now, can you try bending over and touching your toes?
PATIENT: Ugh… Nope. Not happening. I used to be able to do that. My back… it’s not what it used to be. I think I pulled something a few years ago, gardening. Never really got it checked out. Just… worked through it. Is this bad? Tell me straight. I don't need coddling.
DOCTOR: Okay. It does seem you have some limited range of motion in your lower back. It’s not necessarily bad, but it's something we should be aware of, especially considering you're planning to start wrestling again. It's good you're being upfront about it. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Ow! Okay, okay! That was… a bit surprising. I don’t like surprises. Everything feels a bit… sore now, to be honest. Look, can we just… wrap this up? Tell me if I’m okay to wrestle or not. I got things to do. I'm not getting any younger, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, you seem generally healthy, but I'm noting some stiffness in your back and some mild wheezing. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated as well. Based on this exam, I wouldn't recommend jumping straight into intense wrestling training. It's important to gradually recondition your body to avoid injury. I think some physical therapy would be very beneficial to address the back stiffness and improve your range of motion. We should also investigate the cause of the wheezing and address your blood pressure. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… more appointments… look, I told you I should have just stayed home. This is exactly what I didn’t want. But… alright. Fine. If that’s what you think. But I don’t have insurance, so… how much is this going to cost me? And can I at least do some light training while I’m doing this… therapy? Just to see if I still got it? I’m not going to sit around doing nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kingan. It's not ideal, but it's better to be cautious. We can discuss options for affordable physical therapy – some clinics offer sliding scale fees, and there are exercises you can do at home. As for light training, we can talk about a very gradual reintroduction, focusing on stretching and low-impact exercises. But it’s essential to listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. Regarding cost, I can give you a list of local clinics and their estimated fees. We can also explore resources for financial assistance. I’ll write you a referral for physical therapy and a note outlining your exam findings. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… make it quick. I just want to get this over with. And try not to give me too many appointments, okay? I'm a busy man. Write down the names of those clinics, and… that's it. I guess. Thanks… I think. I’ll… see you around. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Take it easy, and remember to listen to your body. If you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Have a good day, and good luck with the wrestling!
