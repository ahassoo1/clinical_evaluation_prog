DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I'm a Family Medicine physician here. It's August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. I’ve been having trouble, you see. It’s hard to… to get things going when I need to pee. It takes a while, and it’s not a strong stream, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Yadao. So, difficulty initiating urination and a weak stream. Can you tell me how long you’ve been experiencing these issues?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe three months ago? It wasn't too bad at first, just a little bit of waiting. But it’s gotten worse each week, slowly. Now it’s… quite bothersome, to be honest. I find myself having to go back to the bathroom after a few minutes, sometimes. It’s a nuisance.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's been a gradual onset over the past three months, progressively worsening. And you mentioned having to return to the bathroom shortly after urinating – is that because you don't feel completely emptied, or is it a feeling of needing to go again soon after?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly that I don’t feel completely emptied, I think. Like there's still something left in there, even after I've tried. And then, a little while later, I really need to go. It's not painful, thankfully, just… incomplete, and then urgent. It's a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, incomplete emptying followed by urgency. Have you noticed any other changes in your urination, such as straining to start, a sense of burning, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no burning at all. And thankfully, no blood. I do have to… push a little, sometimes, to get things started, yes. Not a lot of pushing, but a bit more than usual. It's not painful, just… effortful. It’s like… needing a little encouragement, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Yadao. Thank you for being so descriptive. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my tummy… my lower tummy feels alright. No pain, no aches. Just the bother with the waterworks, really. I haven't felt sick in any other way, to be honest. I’ve been eating normally, sleeping alright… just this. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a broader picture, have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that healed fine. And I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad, mostly just a little stiff in the mornings. Otherwise… I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been a strong woman. I don't take many medicines, just a little something for the arthritis now and then. Nothing regular, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago and some arthritis in your hands. You mentioned you don’t take many medications. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your arthritis, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it's… Naproxen, I believe. Just a small dose when my hands are especially achy. It's over-the-counter, you can buy it at the pharmacy. I don’t take it every day, just when I need it. It helps a little with the stiffness, that's all. It's not a strong medicine, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen as needed for arthritis. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Not to medicines, not to foods, not to anything that I know of. My mother always said I was a sturdy girl, and I seem to have kept that reputation. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. It’s one of the few things I can be grateful for these days.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Yadao. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother lived to be 92, a very strong woman like me, but she did have some trouble with her kidneys when she was older. My father, he… he passed away when I was young, heart problems. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing else that I can recall, really. They weren’t big on talking about illnesses, to be honest. More the practical sort, my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had kidney problems later in life, your father passed away from heart problems, and your brother had high blood pressure. Thank you for sharing that. Now, to get a better understanding of your situation, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a typical day… Well, I live alone, you see. I wake up, have a cup of tea, usually with a little something sweet. I used to work at the post office, for many years. Now I keep busy with gardening, mostly. I have a small vegetable patch, and I like to tend to my flowers. I walk to the store most days, to get what I need. I read a lot, and I listen to the radio. It’s a quiet life, but I like it. I try to stay active, even with… all this. I suppose that’s a typical day. Not very exciting, but it keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life with gardening, walking, reading, and staying active. That sounds very pleasant. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social habits. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a puff. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I never had the inclination myself. I’ve always been careful about what I put into my body, even if I do enjoy a little sweet with my tea. It’s just never appealed to me. I've always preferred fresh air and good food.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very rarely. Maybe once a month, or even less. It’s not something I particularly enjoy, to be honest. I prefer a nice cup of tea. A little something to relax, but I don’t rely on it. It’s just… not my thing. I’ve never been one for strong drinks.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional wine. Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Yadao. Now, I'm going to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the exam table. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen and checking your lower back, and then I’ll do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not a fan of doctors, but I trust you’re doing your best to help. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie down on your back on the exam table, and I’ll begin with listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally. I'm listening now… sounds are normal. No bruits or murmurs. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. No tenderness to palpation. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Everything seems to be structurally normal on the initial exam. Now, I’d like to get a urine sample to check for infection or other abnormalities. Do you have a clean catch sample with you, or would you like me to provide a container?
PATIENT: No, I don't have a sample with me. I didn't know I’d need one. Could you give me a container, please? I’ll go to the restroom and try to collect one now. I hope I can manage, with… everything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. Here is a container. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. It’s best to use a “clean catch” method - wipe from front to back with the provided wipe before collecting the sample, and try to collect a mid-stream sample. Just relax and take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you. Here you go. I think I managed it alright. It took a little effort, but I believe it's a good sample. I hope so, anyway. It’s not always easy these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. I’ll send this off to the lab for analysis. We’ll check for signs of infection, blood, and glucose levels. It will take a few days to get the results back. While we wait, based on your history and the initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, even though you are female. It's less common in women, but can happen, where the muscles in your bladder and urethra weaken, causing difficulty emptying and urinary urgency. However, we need the urine analysis to rule out other possibilities like a urinary tract infection or other underlying issues. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Benign… what did you call it? BPH? In a woman? That sounds… odd. I thought that was something men got. What does that even mean, exactly? And what would cause that in me? I've never heard of such a thing. I always thought my waterworks were perfectly fine, until recently. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You are right to be surprised, Ms. Yadao. It is much more common in men, as it involves the prostate gland. However, women can experience similar issues due to weakening of the pelvic floor muscles, changes in the bladder neck, or other factors that affect bladder function. Essentially, BPH-like symptoms in women mean the muscles controlling your bladder aren't working as efficiently as they once did. This leads to difficulty starting urination, a weak stream, and the feeling of not completely emptying your bladder. It's not necessarily a dangerous condition, but it can significantly impact your quality of life. The cause is often multifactorial—aging, hormonal changes, previous pregnancies, and even obesity can contribute. We’ll need the urine analysis results to be certain, but that's my leading thought at this point. Does that explanation make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… weakening muscles. I suppose that makes a bit of sense. I have always been active, but I'm not as young as I used to be. And I did have a couple of children, many years ago. I suppose everything starts to… sag a little, eventually. But if it’s not dangerous, what can be done about it? I don’t want to live with this feeling all the time, running to the bathroom constantly. Is there anything I can do to… strengthen those muscles, or something? Or is it just something I have to accept? I’m not one to complain, but it is rather bothersome.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Yadao, and thankfully, there are things we can do to help. Often, the first line of treatment involves lifestyle modifications and pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These exercises can help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and urethra. I can provide you with instructions on how to perform them correctly. We can also discuss bladder training techniques, which involve gradually increasing the amount of time between bathroom visits. In some cases, medication may be helpful to relax the bladder muscles or reduce the urge to urinate. Finally, if conservative measures aren’t effective, there are more advanced treatment options available, like pelvic floor physical therapy or, in rare cases, surgical intervention. However, let's start with the simpler approaches – the exercises and bladder training – and see how you respond. We’ll re-evaluate after a few weeks and adjust the plan accordingly. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. Exercises… I can manage exercises. I used to do a little stretching, years ago. I suppose I can get back into it. And bladder training… well, that just means being patient, doesn't it? Could you show me how to do these… Kegel exercises, properly? I don’t want to be doing them wrong and making things worse. And perhaps a little pamphlet with instructions I can take home? I’m a bit forgetful, you see, and I don’t want to miss any steps.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. To perform a Kegel exercise, imagine you’re trying to stop the flow of urine midstream. Squeeze the muscles you would use to do that – these are your pelvic floor muscles. Hold the squeeze for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat this exercise 10-15 times, several times a day. It’s important to isolate the pelvic floor muscles – you shouldn’t be squeezing your abdomen, thighs, or buttocks. It can be helpful to practice these exercises in a quiet place, lying down or sitting comfortably. Here’s a pamphlet with detailed instructions. It also includes tips on bladder training and a diary to track your progress. It's important to be consistent with these exercises, and it may take several weeks to see improvement. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about four weeks to re-evaluate your symptoms and adjust the plan if needed. Do you have any questions about the exercises or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Squeeze the muscles, hold for a few seconds, don't squeeze anything else… And practice regularly. And a diary to track it. That’s a good idea, actually, to keep me motivated. Four weeks… alright. I can manage four weeks. I’m just glad there’s something I can do about it. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I think that’s everything for today, isn’t it? I’ll get started on the exercises right away. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Yadao, that is everything for today. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or experience any worsening symptoms. Remember to be patient with yourself, and consistent with the exercises. We'll see how you're doing in four weeks. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you then.
