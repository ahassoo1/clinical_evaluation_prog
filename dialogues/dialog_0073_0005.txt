DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Korrell. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here today to be cleared for a move to the Meadowbrook Senior Living Facility. My niece, she thinks it’s time, and I… well, I suppose I agree it might be a good idea. Just need everything in order, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A pre-placement physical… standard procedure. Now, let’s get some background information. I see here you’re 81 years old. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Significant? Hmm. Let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my knee a few years back, but that’s mostly settled now. Mostly just aches a bit in cold weather. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, as you can plainly see. But nothing… major, I wouldn’t say. I’ve been fairly lucky, all things considered. I bake every day, you know. Keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Baking… that’s good. Activity is important. And the knee pain, when did that start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It must be… seven years ago now, maybe eight? I was helping my niece move some furniture – foolish of me at my age, I know. It swelled up something awful. Doctor gave me some pills, and after a bit of rest and physical therapy, it calmed down. Now it just bothers me when the weather changes, or if I overdo it. Not enough to stop me from baking, though!
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the one. My appendix, when I was a young man. A long time ago. Back in ‘66, I believe it was. Everything went well, no complications. Haven’t had a need for any since then, thankfully. Is that something I should be concerned about now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tkac, an appendectomy from 1966 shouldn't be a concern at this point. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. That’s a difficult one. My mother, she lived to be 93, strong woman she was. Never seemed to ail much, but I don’t recall her mentioning any specific illnesses. My father… he passed when I was young, a bit of a weak heart, I think, but it wasn’t properly diagnosed back then. And most of my siblings… well, they’ve all passed on now, and I don’t rightly recall much about their health, if I’m honest. It was a long time ago. Does that help you any, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Fair enough. We can move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not even bee stings. I eat just about everything. Though I don’t care much for beets, but that’s a matter of taste, not allergy. My niece always tries to sneak them into my stew… a constant battle, I tell you. But no, no allergies to report, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Just one thing, really. A little something for my joints, helps with the aches and pains. It’s called glucosamine, I think? Comes in a little bottle. I take two every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if I’m really hurting, I’ll take an ibuprofen. But not often. Mostly just the glucosamine, Doctor. It’s a brown bottle, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Glucosamine… alright. Now, Mr. Tkac, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a baseline and ensure you're fit for your move. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I’m happy to cooperate. I understand it’s important. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I haven’t had a proper physical in… well, a long time, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Not necessarily cause for concern at your age. Lungs are clear, but a little… diminished breath sounds as well. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is regular, 78. I’ll also check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for someone your age. Now, let’s take a look at your joints. Some mild crepitus in the knees, as expected. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no acute inflammation. Overall, your physical exam is consistent with your age and history. But the elevated blood pressure warrants some attention.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, you say? Is that… serious, Doctor? I feel alright, most of the time. I eat reasonably well, I think. Mostly just baking, you know. Not much processed food. Should I be worried? And what does “crepitus” mean, if you don’t mind me asking? I like to understand what’s going on, if possible.
DOCTOR: “Crepitus” is just a fancy word for a cracking or popping sound in your joints, Mr. Tkac. It’s common with age and doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. As for your blood pressure, it’s not immediately alarming, but it does require monitoring. It’s likely a combination of factors – age, genetics, perhaps a little salt in your baking. I’d like to order a basic blood panel to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol. And an EKG to rule out any heart irregularities. Then we’ll discuss a plan to manage your blood pressure – likely lifestyle modifications and possibly a low-dose medication if needed. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. I don't mind some tests, if it will give us a clearer picture. Blood and… an EKG, you said? I suppose I trust your judgment. Lifestyle modifications… what does that entail? Less salt in my baking? That might be the hardest part! But I'm willing to try. And if a little pill will help, well, so be it. Just so long as it doesn’t interfere with my baking, you understand. That’s very important.
DOCTOR: We can certainly discuss minimizing any interference with your… hobby, Mr. Tkac. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll get you scheduled for the EKG. In the meantime, I’d like you to start keeping a log of your blood pressure readings. I’ll give you a simple monitor to take home. And try to reduce your salt intake as much as possible. It's often hidden in processed foods, even things you wouldn't expect. And we’ll discuss the results and formulate a comprehensive plan at your follow-up appointment next week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. A blood pressure log… I can manage that. And I’ll do my best with the salt, though I make no promises! I appreciate you being so understanding. It’s reassuring to have someone explain things so clearly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe the nurse is ready for my blood. I’m ready when she is. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tkac. The nurse will be right with you. We’ll discuss everything further next week. .
PATIENT: .
