DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor…Petrimoulx, was it? It’s nice to meet you as well. Um… well, honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here, to be perfectly truthful. Something about a test, I think? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Something the insurance wanted, maybe? Medicare, I have.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. Medicare does sometimes request routine screenings or tests. Let’s see if we can figure it out together. Do you recall receiving a notice or a call from Medicare specifically mentioning a particular test or check-up?
PATIENT: Hmm… a notice… a call… I get so many of those things, you know? Bills, mostly. And things for… well, for old people, I guess. I think there was something about drugs? Not that I take any drugs, mind you. Just… a test for them? It was a bit confusing, to be honest. All the paperwork…it just piles up.
DOCTOR: Yes, paperwork can certainly be overwhelming. Let me just pull up your record here… Ah, yes. It appears Medicare requested a comprehensive medication review and potentially a toxicology screen as part of a routine wellness check for patients over 50. It's to ensure there aren't any unintentional interactions with over-the-counter medications or supplements you might be taking, or to rule out any unexpected substances. Does that ring a bell at all?
PATIENT: Oh! Now that you say it… yes, vaguely. Something about making sure I wasn’t… mixing things. I don’t mix anything, though! I mostly just drink tea, you know? Earl Grey, usually. And… well, sometimes a little glass of wine with dinner. Nothing fancy. So, a… toxicology screen? Is that like, for… illegal things? Because I assure you, Doctor, I haven't done anything illegal in decades! It just sounds… serious.
DOCTOR: It does sound serious, doesn't it?
PATIENT: It's really quite routine, Ms. Hughston. It's not necessarily about looking for anything "illegal" as you say. It's more about ensuring your safety and making sure any medications you are taking—even over-the-counter ones or supplements—aren't interacting with anything else in your system. Sometimes things can happen that you wouldn’t expect. It's just a precaution, really. It involves a simple urine sample, that's all. Do you have any questions about the test itself? Or about why we're doing it?
DOCTOR: Before we proceed with that, though, let's just do a quick review of your medical history. I see you're 51 years old. Are you currently experiencing any health issues or symptoms that are bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, well… Fifty-one, yes. Seems like yesterday I was younger! Health issues… hmm. My knees bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And my back… being on my feet all day with the equipment… it takes a toll, you know? Paving is hard work. Nothing a little ibuprofen doesn’t fix, usually. And… I get a bit tired, I suppose. But who doesn't at my age? Nothing serious, really. Just…old age creeping in, I expect.
DOCTOR: Knee and back pain with a physically demanding job is certainly common, Ms. Hughston. And fatigue can be caused by many things. Let’s talk a little more about that fatigue. Would you describe it as just general tiredness, or is it more debilitating?
PATIENT: It's not… debilitating, exactly. I still get up and go to work every day. I can still do my job. But… at the end of the day, I’m just worn out. Like all the energy has been sucked out of me. And sometimes, even on my days off, I just want to… lie on the couch. It’s not like I’m… depressed or anything, I just… feel depleted. It's hard to explain. It’s just… more than just being tired. It’s… a heavy tiredness, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A "heavy tiredness" – that's a helpful way to describe it. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me see…Well, sometimes I feel a bit…foggy. Like I can’t quite concentrate. I forget things easily, of course, but I always have. Maybe it's just getting older… And I've been a little more irritable than usual, my neighbor says. She's always telling me to slow down. She's probably right, though. Oh, and sometimes my hands feel a little…tingly. Not numb, exactly, just…tingly. Does that make sense? I don't know if those things are related. I just figured it was…life.
DOCTOR: Yes, that all makes sense, Ms. Hughston. Foggy thinking, increased irritability, and tingling in your hands… those could be related to several things, including fatigue, or something else entirely. To get a better understanding, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your hands. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle with my knees, okay? They’re a bit sensitive. And my back… well, you heard. It’s just an old woman’s body, I suppose. But I’ll cooperate. Do you need me to… take off my shoes or anything?
DOCTOR: No need to take off your shoes just yet, Ms. Hughston. And I will definitely be gentle. Your pulse is a bit elevated, 82 beats per minute. Normal range, but slightly higher than ideal. Heart sounds are regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Skin is dry, and I notice some mild swelling in your knuckles. Do you experience any pain in your hands with movement?
PATIENT: Well, yes, actually. Especially in the mornings. They feel a bit stiff and achy, and it takes a while for them to loosen up. Not terrible pain, but… uncomfortable. Like arthritis, maybe? My mother had arthritis in her hands, so I figured it might be that. It flares up when it's cold, you know? Makes it hard to grip things sometimes. I still manage, though. I have to. I have a job to do. They've seen a lot of hard work, these hands. But they're still good for something.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds consistent with osteoarthritis. I also notice some mild redness on the knuckles, and a slight limitation in range of motion. We can discuss some potential treatment options for that. Any pain with pressure here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Just there. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. It’s been bothering me more lately, especially after a long day on the job. It clicks sometimes when I bend it, too. I try to ignore it, but it's hard. I take ibuprofen, like I said, and that usually helps, but it doesn’t always take it completely away. It’s just… old age creeping in, I suppose. I’m not complaining, though. I’m still able to work, and that’s what matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. I’ve completed the exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it seems like you’re dealing with a combination of things. You have some likely osteoarthritis in your hands and knees, as well as fatigue that’s impacting your energy levels and potentially your cognitive function. The tingling you’re experiencing could be related to the inflammation in your hands, or something else entirely. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. We'll also check your inflammatory markers to assess the severity of the arthritis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best to do some tests, then I trust your judgment. I just want to… feel better, you know? I don’t want to be a burden to anyone, and I want to be able to keep working as long as I can. So, if blood work will help figure things out, then absolutely. When can I get that done? And will it take long? I have to get back to work eventually, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hughston. We can get the blood work done right here in the clinic today. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. The lab technician will draw a few vials of blood, and we’ll send it off to the lab for analysis. It usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Two to three business days… I can manage that. And you said you’ll call me when the results are back? I don’t have to keep calling you, do I? Because, like I said, my memory isn't what it used to be, and I'm afraid I'd forget. Just call me when you have something to tell me. That's all. What about the… the urine test? Should we do that today too?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ms. Hughston. We will definitely do the urine test today as well. It's a simple test, and we can collect the sample before you leave the clinic. And rest assured, we will call you with the results, no need for you to worry about remembering. My staff will also send you a reminder call a few days before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today, or any questions you may have?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. And for not making me feel like an old, silly woman. It's… reassuring to have someone take me seriously. Okay, let's get those tests done, then. Where do I go for the urine sample? And…is there anything special I need to do to prepare for it? Because, like I said, I drink a lot of tea. I wouldn't want to contaminate the results, would I?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It’s my pleasure. And no, you don’t need to do anything special for the urine sample. Just drink your usual amount of fluids—tea is perfectly fine—and try to collect a mid-stream sample. My nurse will give you instructions and a collection cup, and she’ll show you to the restroom. She’s just down the hall. After you've collected the sample, she’ll label it and send it off to the lab with the blood work. Just let me know if you have any trouble, and we’ll be happy to assist you. Let's go ahead and get those tests started, then.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. Lead the way, then. And thank you again. You've put my mind at ease. Hopefully, we can figure out what's going on and get me back to feeling like myself again. Let's get those tests done.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. That’s what we’re here for. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. And please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s Susan, our wonderful nurse. She’ll get you started with the urine sample and answer any questions you may have.
