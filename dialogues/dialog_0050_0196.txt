DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Licano. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, to be honest. It's been a while, though. A long while. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is a good starting point. “Always tired” is rather broad, Ms. Licano. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate… right. It’s just… like I haven’t slept, even when I have slept. You know? I wake up feeling… drained. And it doesn't get better throughout the day. I just… push through. I used to… do a lot more. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling unrefreshed despite adequate sleep is certainly concerning. And the decline in your activity level is worth noting. To get a clearer picture, Ms. Licano, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… hmm. Well, I wake up… around 7, usually. Sometimes later. I have a little breakfast, toast, maybe. Then… I mostly stay home. I watch TV. I try to do a little cleaning, but… I get tired quickly. My husband… he used to do a lot of it. Now… it just feels hard to… keep up. I eat… whenever. Not much of an appetite, really. Then… more TV, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Licano. It sounds as though your energy levels are significantly impacting your daily routine. And the decreased appetite is something we’ll need to address. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other symptoms? Let me see… Sometimes I feel a little… achy. Not like a bad pain, just… everything feels sore. And… I've been forgetting things more lately. Not important things, usually, but… names, mostly. And where I put things. It’s frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches and increasing forgetfulness… those are pertinent details, Ms. Licano. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing… Oh dear. Well, my husband… he always handled the doctor things. I… I don't really know. I think I had… high blood pressure, maybe? Years ago. He gave me pills for it. I still take them, I think. I think. And… I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure, potentially managed with medication, and a previous wrist fracture. It's alright if you're unsure of specifics; we can verify everything. Do you recall the name of the medication you're taking for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I really don’t. Little white pills, I think. Or maybe they were yellow? I get them refilled at the pharmacy, of course, but… I just tell them my name and they give them to me. I don't pay attention to the names. I’m sorry. I really wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That is quite alright, Ms. Licano. We can obtain a list of your medications directly from the pharmacy. Now, have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, either intentional or unintentional?
PATIENT: Changes in weight… hmm. I think… I’ve lost a little. Not much, but my clothes feel a bit looser. I haven’t been eating much, like I said. I don’t really weigh myself anymore, either. It just… didn’t seem important.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. My mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired too. And my father… he had diabetes. I don't… I don't really know much about it. They both passed away a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. That gives me some helpful information. Now, Ms. Licano, do you currently take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Just the blood pressure pills, I think. Sometimes I take… something for my knees. They ache, too. It’s… an over-the-counter thing. I can’t remember the name, either. It comes in a little bottle. You know, for aches and pains. I buy it at the drugstore. That’s all, I think. I really wish I was better at remembering things!
DOCTOR: That is alright, Ms. Licano. We are gathering information, and it is alright if you do not recall everything. Now, to complete the picture, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I stay home mostly. Watch TV. I used to garden, but… it's hard now. I don’t really… go anywhere. I used to travel with my husband, but… that was a long time ago. I don't drink or smoke, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That is helpful information, Ms. Licano. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s agreeable to you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a general assessment of your overall well-being. It’s important to rule out any obvious physical causes for your fatigue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it's necessary. I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It will be quite brief. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out, just as you normally would. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, and there appears to be a slight murmur. It’s not immediately concerning, but we'll need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. Your abdomen is soft, but I detect some tenderness in the upper quadrants. Your reflexes are within normal limits. I’m going to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. I also recommend an electrocardiogram to assess your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot of tests. Is it… serious? I just want to know what’s wrong with me, you know? I just feel so tired all the time. If you think it’s necessary, I guess so. As long as it doesn’t take too long to get the results.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Licano. It does seem like a lot, but these tests will help us determine the underlying cause of your fatigue and ensure we address any potential issues promptly. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to rule out several possibilities. These tests will give us a much clearer picture. I'll order them now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It typically takes 3-5 business days to get the results. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. Given your fatigue, muscle aches, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend that you avoid strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… when will I know something? Three to five days… that seems like a long time to feel this bad. And… will it hurt? The tests, I mean. I’m just… worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Licano. Three to five business days can feel like a long time when you’re not feeling well. The lab will do their best to expedite the results. Regarding the tests, the blood draw will cause only minimal discomfort - a brief stinging sensation. The electrocardiogram is completely painless; sensors will simply be attached to your chest to record your heart's activity. I want to reiterate that we're being proactive here, and it’s better to rule out potential issues. I am also going to prescribe a low-dose multivitamin to help address any potential nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to your fatigue. I will send the prescription to your pharmacy now. In the meantime, please rest as much as possible and stay hydrated. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we conclude our consultation today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… trying. It's just… hard to remember things. I hope I didn't forget anything important.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Licano. It’s perfectly understandable to be overwhelmed, and it’s not your fault if you’ve forgotten something. We have documented everything, and we will address any concerns that may arise during follow-up. My nurse will be in shortly to review the instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Please do not hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
