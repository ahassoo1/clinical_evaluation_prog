DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh... cough. Yeah, I got this cough. Been a long time, I think. And tired a lot. Also, my nose... always blocked, then runny. Happens often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and a stuffy, then runny nose. And you say this has been going on for a while – could you give me a little more detail about how long “a while” is?
PATIENT: Hmm... long time. Maybe... six months? Or more? I dunno exactly. It comes and goes, but it always comes back. Feels worse in the morning, usually. And when it rains, it's really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months or more, with it coming and going, but consistently returning. Worse in the mornings and with rainy weather. That's helpful to know. Besides the cough, fatigue and nasal symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms – perhaps a fever, body aches, sore throat, headache, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes, I think. Not high, just warm. Body ache… yeah, a little, when the cough is bad. Sore throat… not really. Headache… sometimes, yeah, at the back of my head. Short of breath… no, not really. I just… tired, you know? Like no energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent low-grade fever, some body aches with the cough, occasional headache at the back of the head, and significant fatigue. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, such as asthma, allergies, or chronic bronchitis?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. Never been to the doctor much. Just for… small things. When I cut myself, things like that. I don’t know about those things… asthma, allergies… no, I don't think so. Maybe when I was little, I had a bit of allergy to… something. But I forgot what.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic medical conditions. And a possible childhood allergy, but you don't recall what to. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never been to hospital. Just… clinic, for the cuts and scrapes. My wife takes me sometimes when I have a bad flu, but nothing serious. She gives me medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Your wife provides you with medication for the flu. Do you recall what medications she gives you?
PATIENT: Uh… little white pills. And… syrup. Orange syrup. I don’t know the names, sorry. She buys them from the shop. The one near the market.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can look into that later if needed. Now, let's talk about your family. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings – have any medical conditions like asthma, allergies, chronic cough, or lung problems?
PATIENT: My mother… she had cough sometimes, when she was old. But she lived in the village. Very different air there. My father… he was strong, never sick. I have one sister, she’s okay, I think. Lives in Kuala Lumpur. We don’t see each other much. She never told me about sickness.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some cough when she was older, and your father and sister appear to be generally healthy. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoke. My wife doesn't allow it. Bad for health, she says. I drink… sometimes. With friends, after work. Not much, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and occasional alcohol consumption. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don't think so. Sometimes I get itchy when I eat prawns, but my wife says it’s not allergy, just prawns. Nothing else I can think of.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible sensitivity to prawns, but no known medication or food allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Tati. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please take a deep breath in… and out… very good. Now, could you please lean forward?
PATIENT: Like this? Is it okay? I feel a bit silly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Take some deep breaths in and out for me, please. Okay, thank you. Your lungs sound a bit wheezy, especially on the right side. There’s some decreased air entry there as well. Your heart sounds normal. I’m also going to take your temperature and blood pressure. Your temperature is slightly elevated at 37.8 degrees Celsius. Your blood pressure is 130/85, which is a little on the higher side. I also notice your nasal passages are quite congested, and your throat is slightly red.
PATIENT: Okay… Wheezy? What does that mean, Doctor? And high blood pressure… is that bad? I feel okay, mostly tired.
DOCTOR: “Wheezing” means there’s a whistling sound when you breathe, which usually indicates some narrowing in your airways. It's like air is being forced through a small space. It's often associated with inflammation or constriction of the airways, like in asthma or bronchitis. High blood pressure, or hypertension, means the force of your blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. It doesn’t always have symptoms, which is why it’s often called a “silent killer.” Over time, it can strain your heart and increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. Your reading isn't critically high, but it's something we should monitor. Given your symptoms – the chronic cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, wheezing, slightly elevated temperature, and borderline high blood pressure – it's possible you are experiencing a lower respiratory tract infection, potentially bronchitis, or perhaps asthma exacerbated by an infection. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be agreeable to a chest X-ray and a blood test to check for infection and inflammation?
PATIENT: X-ray… and blood test? Uh… okay. If you think it’s necessary. Is it expensive, Doctor? I don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Tati. Let me check the approximate costs for you. The chest X-ray will be around RM150, and the blood test will be approximately RM200. We can discuss options if that is a financial burden. The clinic does have a social worker who may be able to assist with finding financial assistance programs. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure we provide the most appropriate treatment. Would you like me to proceed with ordering them, and we can discuss payment options afterwards?
PATIENT: RM350… that’s a lot. I don’t know… Maybe just the blood test? The X-ray… can we skip that one for now? I really don’t want to spend too much money. If the blood test shows something, then we can think about the X-ray, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. We can certainly start with the blood test. It will give us some valuable information about the presence of infection and inflammation. However, please be aware that without the chest X-ray, it’s more difficult to get a complete picture of what’s going on in your lungs. Alright, I've ordered the blood test. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. They'll need a sample of your blood, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. After the test, they'll send the results to me, and I’ll review them as soon as they arrive. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a saline nasal spray to help with your congestion and a cough suppressant to relieve your cough. I will also recommend you get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. Once I have the blood test results, we can discuss further treatment options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good, Doctor. Saline spray and rest… I can do that. And cough medicine. Thank you. Where is the lab, then? Down the hall… which way?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's just down the hall to your left. You'll see a sign that says "Laboratory." The staff there are very friendly, and they'll guide you through the process. They'll need a sample of your blood, and it's best if you haven't eaten or drank anything for at least two hours before the test, if possible. Here’s the prescription for the nasal spray and cough suppressant. Please bring it to the pharmacy after you’ve had your blood test. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you very much for your help. I will go to the lab now. I hope the blood test doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. I hope the blood test goes smoothly and quickly as well. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns. Get well soon.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
