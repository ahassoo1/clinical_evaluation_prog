DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Pfennig, you say? Lovely name. Hmm… what did bring me in? Now, that’s a good question. Let me think… it has to do with… blood. Yes! Someone mentioned I should find out my blood type. Just to… be sure, you know? It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, wanting to know your blood type is a perfectly good reason to come in. It's good to be proactive about your health. Just to clarify, is there a specific reason you’re thinking about your blood type now, or was this more of a general check-up item?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific reason… hmm. I don’t rightly recall. My son, I think… he might have said something about it before a trip? Or perhaps it was the hospital… years ago. Everything gets a bit mixed up, you see. It wasn't urgent, not at all. Just thought it would be a good thing to know, that’s all. Do you think it is important to know? I wouldn’t want to bother you for nothing.
DOCTOR: It’s never a bother to discuss your health concerns, Darl. And knowing your blood type is a good idea, even if it’s not an emergency. It can be helpful for a variety of reasons, should you ever need a transfusion or if you're planning on donating. Let’s start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Surgeries… well, let me see. There was… something with my knee, a long time ago. I used to work as a rigger, you see, and it got a bit banged up. Nothing too serious, I don’t think. Just a little fix-up. And… I had my gallbladder out, decades ago. That was a bit unpleasant, but I recovered well enough. As for illnesses… I’ve had the usual colds and flu, I suppose. Nothing major that I can recall. I always considered myself quite healthy, for my age. Though these old bones do creak a bit these days!
DOCTOR: Okay, knee surgery as a rigger and gallbladder removal. And generally good health otherwise, with the typical colds and flu. That's helpful to know. Do you remember roughly when you had those surgeries, Darl?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When exactly… That’s the tricky part, isn’t it? The knee… must have been in my fifties, I think. So… maybe thirty, forty years ago? It feels like a lifetime ago. And the gallbladder… oh, goodness. Perhaps twenty-five years ago? I truly can't be certain. Time just slips away, you see. I wasn’t one for keeping track of dates. I was always too busy working, hoisting things up and down. It was a good life, though. A very good life. Do you need a precise date, or is a general idea enough?
DOCTOR: A general idea is perfectly fine, Darl. It’s more important to understand the overall picture. Now, thinking about your family, has anyone in your family had any significant health problems – things like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family… now that's a question. My parents… my mother lived to be quite old, thankfully. She just… wore out, I suppose. No real illnesses, as far as I recall. My father… he had a bit of trouble with his heart in his later years, I think. But I don't know the details. And my brother… he had some sort of trouble with his stomach, but that was many years ago. We weren’t terribly close, you see. I’m not really sure what happened to him, to be honest. It’s dreadful, isn’t it, forgetting things like that? Is it important I remember specifics?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that details can be difficult to recall, Darl. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t have specifics. Knowing about a family history of heart trouble is helpful, though. We'll note that down. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… let me think. Just a little something for my arthritis, you know, to ease the aches and pains. It's a small white pill, I believe. I take it every morning. As for allergies… I don't think so. I’ve never really had any trouble with food or anything. Perhaps a little sniffle with pollen in the spring, but nothing serious. My skin gets a bit itchy sometimes, but I just put some cream on it. I’ve always been quite resilient, I think. Nothing bothers me for long. Are you writing all this down? It’s quite a lot, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am, Darl. It's good to have a complete picture. And it’s helpful to know you take something for arthritis and don’t have any known allergies. Do you know the name of the arthritis medication you're taking?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The name… that’s a tricky one. Let me see… It’s a small white pill, as I said. The bottle… my son usually fills it for me. He’s very good like that. It begins with an ‘A’, I think. Or perhaps a ‘B’? No… I'm afraid it’s slipped my mind. I apologize. I really should write these things down, shouldn’t I? It's just… life gets in the way, you see. Perhaps if you have a list of common arthritis medications, you could show me, and I might recognize it? I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Darl. It’s common to not remember medication names. Let me show you a few common ones, and hopefully, you'll recognize it. Do any of these names or the pills themselves look familiar?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, those pictures… let me see. Ibuprofen… that sounds vaguely familiar, yes. I think my son has given me that one before, when I've had a particularly bad ache. But it’s hard to say for certain. Naproxen… no, doesn’t ring a bell. Celecoxib… definitely not. And methotrexate… goodness, that sounds rather serious! I don’t think I’ve ever taken anything like that. I think it’s probably ibuprofen, yes. A small white pill… it sounds right. But honestly, I wouldn’t bet my life on it. It’s all so blurry, you see. Are you sure it’s important I remember the exact name? Perhaps it’s just a general pain reliever?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a general idea, Darl, and "possible ibuprofen" is a good starting point. Now, just to finish up with some background information, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, at my age, it’s rather… quiet, I’m afraid. I live alone, since my husband passed away many years ago. I don’t have any pets, and I don’t do much traveling anymore. Mostly, I just enjoy reading, and watching a bit of television. I try to stay active, but my bones don’t always cooperate. I enjoy a bit of gardening when the weather is nice, but I have to take it easy. I don’t smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a bit of chocolate now and then! Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I need to know, Darl. It gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, to get back to your original concern – your blood type – I'm happy to order a blood test to determine it for you. It's a simple procedure, and we can get the results back quickly. Would you like me to go ahead and order that test for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, dear. Yes, please do. Just to have it on record, you know? It’s probably nothing, but it’s good to be sure. And thank you for being so patient with my… forgetfulness. It’s a bit embarrassing, sometimes. But you’ve been very kind, Dr. Pfennig. Very kind indeed. Will it be a painful test? I don’t like needles very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Darl. And don't worry about your memory at all – it’s perfectly normal as we get older. As for the test, it’s a very quick and generally painless procedure. A nurse will simply draw a small amount of blood from your arm, and you won’t even feel it much. It’s similar to getting a flu shot. I'll write the order for the blood test now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw the sample. After the results come back, we'll discuss them with you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, dear. A quick little prick, you say? I suppose I can manage that. As long as it doesn't take too long, and as long as you're sure it won’t hurt too much. Thank you again for your kindness, Dr. Pfennig. You've put my mind at ease. I appreciate it very much. Should I stay here, or can I go and sit in the waiting room while you write the order?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Darl. It really is a quick and simple procedure. You can absolutely go and sit in the waiting room while I write the order, if you'd prefer. It will only take me a few minutes. The nurse will come and get you when she’s ready. Feel free to relax and make yourself comfortable. I’ll let you know when it's time.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds lovely, dear. Thank you. I think I will go and sit down for a bit. My old bones are starting to ache. And I’ll try not to worry too much. You've been very reassuring, Dr. Pfennig. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Darl. Take your time, and please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns.
