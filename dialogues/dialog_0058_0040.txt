DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly. And… the waterworks troubles. They keep coming back, you see. It’s been happening for a while now, on and off. I suppose it’s the kidneys, the doctor before said so.
DOCTOR: Right. And this "doctor before," do you remember their name or which practice they were with?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. Let me think… It was Dr. Sharma, I believe. Yes, Dr. Sharma. He was at… the City General Hospital, I think. It was a few years back now. Before he retired, I reckon. I’m not very good with names, you see. It’s the pain that sticks in my mind, not the doctors!
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Sharma at City General. Good to know. And this pain… can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a dull ache, mostly. Right here, on my side, lower down. Sometimes it gets sharper, like a cramping feeling, especially when I’m trying to… well, when I need to go to the bathroom. And it seems to come and go, doesn't last all day, thankfully. It's just… bothersome, you see. And then the burning when I do go… that’s not pleasant at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned “waterworks troubles.” Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I have to go quite often, even if I haven’t had much to drink. And sometimes… it feels like I haven't emptied my bladder completely, you see? And then, of course, the burning when I go. It’s uncomfortable, and I worry about getting an infection again. I’ve had a few of those, the doctor before said it was linked to my kidneys. It’s just… a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, has this burning sensation been constant, or does it come and go with the frequent urination?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s worse when I need to go, you see? And it’s definitely worse when I’ve been waiting a bit too long. It’s not all the time, thankfully, but when it happens… it’s quite noticeable. It's not a constant ache, more like a sudden discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a better picture of things. Have you had any fever, chills, or nausea recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills. And my stomach’s been alright, haven’t been sick at all. Just this side pain and the… waterworks trouble. It’s been that way for a while, off and on, as I said. I'm generally a good eater, so my stomach's usually not the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I still eat pretty much the same as always. I like my food, you see. A bit of everything, really. No loss of appetite at all. Perhaps a little less when the pain is particularly bad, but that’s just because I don’t feel up to it, not because I don’t want to eat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. Sharma, the doctor I mentioned before, he told me I had something wrong with my kidneys. Polycystic… something. He explained it, but I'm not very good with remembering those medical terms, you see? He said it meant I had lots of little… pockets of fluid on my kidneys. And that's what caused the pain and the trouble with my waterworks. Other than that… I'm generally a healthy man, for my age.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… okay. And do you know if anyone else in your family has had kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Now let me think… My mother, she was always a bit frail, but I don’t recall her ever having any specific kidney trouble. My father… he passed away when I was quite young. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents. We weren’t very close, you see. I don’t think so, but I couldn’t say for certain. It’s a bit of a blurry memory, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve never had any bad reactions to any medicine. I haven't taken much over the years, thankfully. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, that’s about it. Nothing serious, you see. Never had to go to hospital for an allergy, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, you see? I believe in letting my body heal itself, as much as possible. I don’t take any vitamins, any painkillers, nothing at all. Just plain water and good food, that’s what I believe in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. I think I have a good understanding of what’s been going on. I’d like to perform a physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your flanks for tenderness, and a quick check of your vital signs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’ve been having this pain for a while now, so if you can find out what’s causing it, that would be wonderful. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m a bit stiff, you see, so take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now. Just breathe normally. Okay… sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. I’ll be pressing gently, just to check for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not yet. Just a little pressure, that’s all. It's a bit tender here… Just a little bit, when you press. Not too bad, but I can feel it. It’s where the pain usually is, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, there is some tenderness there, yes. And it seems to be localized. Now, I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78 and regular, temperature is 98.6. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing too concerning at the moment. I'm just checking for any masses or enlarged organs. Still feeling some tenderness in your right flank. Okay. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Everything feels alright to me. Just a bit of pressure when you press on my side, as you said. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a flare-up of your polycystic kidney disease. The tenderness in your right flank suggests possible inflammation or a kidney infection, although the lack of fever is reassuring. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which can be associated with kidney disease. However, to be certain, I’d like to order some tests. A urinalysis to check for infection, a complete blood count to assess your overall health, and a kidney function panel to see how well your kidneys are working. We may also need to consider an ultrasound or CT scan of your kidneys to get a better look at their structure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s causing this pain, and what can be done about it. Tests are fine. Ultrasound, CT scan, whatever you need. Just please let me know the results when you have them. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to write the orders for those tests now. The lab will draw blood, and we’ll schedule the imaging separately. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to collect a urine sample. Here are the lab orders and the form for the urine sample. The nurse will come in shortly to explain everything. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out your system. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. And if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Drinking more water, avoid caffeine, and go to the emergency room if things get worse… I understand. Thank you very much for your time and your attention. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’ll see what the tests say, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you with the urine sample and schedule the imaging. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. If anything changes or you become concerned before then, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it very much. You too. Goodbye.
