DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I've been having some pain… down there. In my… well, in the groin area. It’s been on and off, and I wasn’t quite sure who to see about it. It just felt… strange. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Noelani. It's good you came in to get it checked out. “Down there” is perfectly fine – we deal with all sorts of things here. And it’s not uncommon for pain to be difficult to explain. Okay, so pain in the groin area, on and off. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, really. Sometimes it feels heavy, like something is… weighted down. And it does seem to come and go. I can’t pinpoint anything specific that makes it worse, or better, though. I wish I could be more helpful! It’s just… been happening. It’s been a few weeks, I believe. Perhaps longer? It's difficult to recall exactly.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Noelani, it’s common to not have a precise timeline. A dull ache and a heavy feeling for a few weeks… that gives us a starting point. And you said it doesn’t seem to be related to anything specific?
PATIENT: No, that’s correct. I’ve tried to think about if it happens after… exertion, or certain movements, or even after sitting for a long time, but I haven’t noticed a pattern. I do a fair bit of woodworking, you see. It keeps me busy. But I haven’t injured myself recently, not that I recall. It just… started. I’m rather puzzled by it, to be honest. Is it… something serious, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It's perfectly understandable to be concerned, and it's good you're asking questions. And woodworking is great – good for the hands and the mind. We’ll try to figure this out. Okay, so no recent injury, and the pain isn't clearly linked to any specific activity. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. I… I try to stay as healthy as possible. I eat a balanced diet, mostly. Lots of fruits and vegetables. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I do get a bit tired easily, though. And my knees aren’t as strong as they used to be. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. And… well, I live alone. Just me and my cat, Luna. I suppose that’s the important part. I don't have any major health problems that I know of. I see a doctor for regular check-ups, but nothing significant has come up recently.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Noelani. A healthy lifestyle is wonderful. And Luna sounds lovely. It is relevant that you have Medicare, thank you. Okay, so you don't smoke, drink rarely, eat well, and generally feel healthy aside from some fatigue and knee issues. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. I haven't lost any weight, that I know of. My bowel movements are… regular. No trouble urinating. I suppose… sometimes I feel a little bit… bloated, but I often do, honestly. It’s hard to say if that’s connected. And… this might sound silly, but I’ve been feeling a bit more anxious lately. Just a general sense of unease. But I attribute that to… well, to life, I suppose. Is that helpful? I’m trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Noelani. It is helpful to know what you're not experiencing, as well as what you are. No fever, chills, weight loss, or changes in urination – that’s all good information. And it's not silly at all to mention the anxiety – emotional and physical health are connected. Okay. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or major medical illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a very long time ago. And I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was in my twenties, but I recovered fully. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing significant, at least. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing that required hospitalization or surgery. My mother had… well, she had some heart problems, but that was many years ago, and I don't believe it’s relevant to this. I hope I’m not forgetting anything. It's a bit like trying to piece together a puzzle with missing parts, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Noelani. Tonsil removal as a child and pneumonia in your twenties. No major health issues since then, and a family history of heart problems. Okay. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin, occasionally. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re particularly achy. But not regularly. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. Nothing else, I assure you. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I try to manage things naturally. I have a friend who swears by herbal remedies, but I haven’t tried them yet. I'm a bit cautious about those sorts of things. Is that alright? I’m afraid I’m not a very complicated patient, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. Multivitamin occasionally and ibuprofen as needed. You are not a complicated patient at all. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. My knees aren’t what they used to be, and I’m a bit… sensitive. I apologize for being such a worry. I hope it isn’t anything serious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. And don't worry about being a worry – that's what I'm here for. Okay. If you don’t mind, I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. After that, I’ll do a quick external examination of the groin area. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright. Abdomen, then the groin area. I understand. Just… let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, please. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I trust you. I’m ready when you are. Just… take your time, Doctor. I don’t want to rush you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Noelani. We'll take our time. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable at all. Okay. I'm listening to your abdomen now. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants. No unusual noises. Now I’m gently feeling your abdomen. I don't feel any obvious masses or tenderness… are you feeling any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain with that… just a little bit of pressure, but nothing uncomfortable. It feels… normal, I suppose. It’s a bit like when you get your blood pressure checked, just… more thorough. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It helps me feel a bit less anxious. I’m just… relieved it doesn't seem to be anything immediately alarming. Though, of course, I trust your professional opinion. You’re the expert.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s reassuring. Now, I’m going to gently feel your groin area… I’m checking for any swelling, tenderness, or lumps. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay. I don't feel any obvious swelling or lumps in your groin area. There is some mild tenderness on the left side, but it's not significant. Your reflexes are normal, and I don't detect any hernias. Overall, the exam is largely unremarkable. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing your pain. It could be a muscle strain, referred pain from your hip or lower back, or even something related to your anxiety. However, given the persistent nature of the pain, it’s best to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: That’s… a bit of a relief, to be honest. Not alarming, you say? A muscle strain… that sounds plausible. I do tend to tense up when I’m anxious. But the anxiety… could that really cause pain like this? It seems… odd. What sort of possibilities do you mean, Doctor? Do you think I need… tests? I’m not terribly fond of tests, if I’m being honest. Though, I understand they may be necessary. I just… I’m a bit worried about what you might find. I’m afraid of bad news, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, Noelani. And yes, anxiety can absolutely cause physical symptoms, including pain. It’s often referred to as psychosomatic pain, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less real. Muscle tension, nerve sensitivity, and even changes in pain perception can all be triggered by anxiety. To rule out other possibilities, I would recommend a couple of simple tests. A complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation, and a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. We could also consider an X-ray of your hip to assess for any underlying joint issues, but given your age and the nature of the pain, it may not be necessary at this point. Would you be comfortable with the CBC and urinalysis?
PATIENT: A CBC and a urinalysis… those don’t sound too dreadful. Not like surgery, at least. Those are… relatively simple, aren’t they? Just blood and… a sample? Yes, I suppose I’m comfortable with those. If it helps rule things out… then it’s worth it. I’d rather know, even if the news isn’t good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You think those are sufficient to start with? No X-ray right away? I’m… relieved to hear that. Though, of course, if you change your mind, I’ll cooperate. What happens next? Do I need to make another appointment? Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Perhaps rest? Or… are there any over-the-counter medications you’d recommend for the pain?
DOCTOR: Yes, a CBC and urinalysis are relatively simple blood and urine tests. They can give us a good baseline and help rule out some of the more common causes of groin pain. For now, let's start with those tests. We can always consider an X-ray if the results are inconclusive or if your symptoms worsen. Okay, I’ve ordered the tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. You don’t need an appointment, just let them know you’re here for Dr. Sieh’s orders. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. You can also take over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen for the pain, following the dosage instructions on the label. If the pain is severe, you can alternate between the two. Heat or cold packs may also provide some relief. I’d also like you to keep a pain diary, noting the severity of the pain, what makes it worse or better, and any other symptoms you experience. This will help us track your progress and make a more informed decision about further treatment. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of the tests. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. One week. I can certainly do that. And a pain diary… alright, I’ll try my best to keep track. It’s a bit of a hassle, but if it helps… then I’ll do it. Ibuprofen and naproxen… I’ll stick to what I know. So, just go to the lab, tell them about the tests, and then… come back next week? Is there anything else I should do? Any specific instructions for the lab? I don’t want to mess anything up. I always worry about doing things correctly. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. It’s… comforting to have someone listen. I was starting to worry I was imagining things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. And no, there are no specific instructions for the lab. Just let them know you’re here for Dr. Sieh’s orders, and they’ll take care of everything. You’re not imagining things at all – it’s always best to get things checked out, and I’m glad you came in. I’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for next week, August 9th at 10:00 AM. The nurse will contact you to remind you. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, rest, avoid strenuous activity, and keep track of your pain. It was a pleasure meeting you, Noelani. I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Sieh. Thank you again for everything. August 9th at 10:00 AM. I’ll make a note of that. I’ll see you then. And… thank you. Really.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
