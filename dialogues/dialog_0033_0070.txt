DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Szmyd, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Kile. Just Kile is fine. Is… is good here, yes? Nice and… clean. Not like some places I’ve seen.
DOCTOR: Very well, Kile. Let’s not dwell on the cleanliness of other establishments. I have a rather full schedule today, so if you could just tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Brings me in? Hmm. Well… the lady at the… the place… said I had to come. New to area, you know? Medicare… they want me to see someone. Something about… checking? I don’t remember all the details. Old man problems, I guess. Everything gets… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: “Old man problems,” as you put it. Right. And what specifically are these… fuzzy problems?
PATIENT: Fuzzy… like… I forget things. Important things, sometimes. Not… like, where I put my keys, but… names. Faces. What I was just saying. It happens more now, you see? Used to have a good memory. Very good. For makeup, you need to remember things. All the colors… all the… faces.
DOCTOR: Makeup?
PATIENT: Yes! Makeup. I am… was… a makeup artist. For the theater. And… performers. Big names, sometimes. Not now, of course. Retired. Mostly. It’s hard work, you know? Standing for hours… holding the little brushes. But I was good. Very good. People paid me to make them beautiful.
DOCTOR: Right. So, the memory issues are… relatively new?
PATIENT: Relatively… yes. Maybe… six months? A year? Time… it slips away. It's not like it was sudden, you understand. Just… slowly getting worse. Hard to say exactly. My ex-wife… she complained about my memory years ago. But she complained about everything.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the memory loss?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No. No cough. No fever. Just… the forgetting. And sometimes… a little tired. But who isn’t tired? I’m an old man, after all. Always tired.
DOCTOR: Let's review your medications. According to the system, you're not currently taking anything. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Medications? No. No pills. Never liked them. Mess with your stomach, you know? Always said, if you feel bad, rest. Drink some tea. That’s what my grandmother always said. She lived to be ninety-eight, so she must have known something.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. No… I don’t think so. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes when I use cheap face powder? But that’s not an allergy. Just bad powder. The good stuff doesn’t do that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline. I’d like to check your reflexes, coordination, and blood pressure, if you don’t mind. It will be quick.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Like… hitting your knee with a hammer? I’ve seen that in movies. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? My first wife… she had problems with her blood. Always worrying. Just hurry, please. This table isn't very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Neurological… is that something serious? It’s… hard to focus. The light in here is very bright. And I had a late night… watching a very old movie.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date? Oh… dear. Is it… July? No, wait… I think it's… August. Is that right? The second, maybe? I really should write these things down. My ex-wife… she always had a calendar. Very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this brief examination and your history, it sounds like you’re experiencing some mild cognitive impairment, possibly related to age. However, it’s too early to say definitively. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also like you to have a brain scan, just to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Brain scan? A scan? Like… those machines? Are they safe? I don’t like being… poked and prodded. And blood work? Oh dear. I haven't had blood drawn in… years. Is this going to be expensive? Medicare does cover this, right?
DOCTOR: The scan is perfectly safe, Mr. Szmyd. It’s a standard procedure. And yes, Medicare should cover it, but it's best to confirm with your insurance provider to be certain. As for the blood work, it’s routine. We just need to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any deficiencies. I'll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They specialize in these types of issues. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More doctors? This is… a lot. Will they… give me pills? I really don’t want pills. And what if… what if something is wrong? Is it… serious? I just came in for a little check-up.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I understand your concerns. However, it’s important to rule out any serious causes for your memory loss. That’s why I’m recommending these tests and a specialist referral. It doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong, but we need to be thorough. As for pills… that’s something you would discuss with the neurologist if medication is deemed necessary. I'm not going to speculate on a diagnosis without proper workup. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any other immediate questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… a lot to take in. I suppose… I suppose I have no choice, do I? It's just… I wish my ex-wife was here. She always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will explain the blood work process. I’ll have the referral to the neurologist ready for you before you leave. Try not to worry unduly, Mr. Szmyd. We're just being cautious.
