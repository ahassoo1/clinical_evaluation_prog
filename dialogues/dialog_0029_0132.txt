DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s this heat, really. Can’t stand it anymore. Never used to bother me, but now… just awful. Makes me feel right weak, you know? Like I’m gonna pass out just walking to the shed.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness with the heat… I understand. And this is a new thing, you said?
PATIENT: New? Well, not brand new, but it’s gotten worse this summer. Last year I felt a bit warm, sure, but nothing like this. This year, it hits me like a wall. I’m a painter, construction mostly, so I’m used to being outside. But I can’t do much anymore before I have to sit down. It’s embarrassing, really. Used to be the strongest man on the job site. Now look at me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's progressively worsened over the past year. And it’s impacting your ability to work… that’s important to know. Besides the weakness, are you experiencing anything else when it gets hot?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Not really… I get a bit dizzy sometimes, I suppose. And awfully thirsty, always thirsty. But that’s just common sense in this weather, isn't it? I'm not a small man, you know, need my fluids. Don't get me started on these young lads, barely drink anything all day. No, dizziness and thirst, that’s about it. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and increased thirst along with the weakness. Have you noticed any headaches, nausea, or changes in your urination – like more or less frequent, or a different color?
PATIENT: Headaches… no, not really. Maybe a little ache sometimes, but I get those anyway. Old age, you know. Nausea? No, haven’t been sick a day in my life, and I don't intend to start now. And as for my… urination, well, that’s a bit personal, isn’t it? It’s normal, alright? I go when I need to. Don’t see what that’s got to do with the heat.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No nausea, headaches are minimal, and urination is normal. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Goodness, no. I eat a good, solid diet. Lots of rice, lentils, good meat when I can get it. I’ve never been sick enough to need a doctor, 'til now, of course. My father lived to be 90, strong as an ox, and he never saw the inside of a clinic. Good genes, I reckon. Never had heart problems either, although my wife... well, she had a bit of a flutter now and again, but that was years ago. No, I’m a healthy man, always have been. This heat is just… unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, and a strong family history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Never. Surgeries? Absolutely not. I fix things, I don't need fixing! Had a few scrapes and bruises over the years, working on roofs and all, but nothing a bit of bandage couldn’t handle. My wife… she had her gallbladder out once, but that’s beside the point. I’m talking about me. This isn't about other people’s ailments. I’m a practical man, doctor. I get things done. I don't sit around waiting for problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? You think I need medications? I eat properly, work hard, that’s all a man needs. No, I don’t take anything. Vitamins? Maybe a bit of cod liver oil in the winter, for the joints, but that’s it. Don’t believe in all those fancy pills, just making you weaker. My wife used to take all sorts, never did her any good. No, nothing. I’m a simple man, doctor. Simple needs.
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, insect stings, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies? Now you’re just asking silly questions. I’ve lived a long life, been bitten by plenty of bugs, eaten all sorts of things. Never had a problem. A bit of a sniffle now and again, but that’s just the dust. No, I'm not allergic to anything. Honestly, doctor, I think I’m wasting my time here. I just need something to help me get through this heat, not a list of things I’m supposedly allergic to.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. I want to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I’ve told you, I’m a healthy man. I don’t need you poking and prodding me like some… some delicate flower. Blood pressure, pulse… what good will that do? I feel fine, apart from this blasted heat. Everything in here is working just dandy, thank you very much. Honestly, I’m starting to think this whole thing is a waste of time. I just want something for the heat. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration, and I respect your feelings. However, even if you feel generally well, a quick exam can help me rule out any underlying issues that might be contributing to your weakness, especially with the heat. It’s a standard precaution. It will only take a few minutes. We can start with your blood pressure; it's a quick, non-invasive check. If you’re truly not comfortable, we can skip it, but it will make it harder for me to give you the best advice. What do you say?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! But don’t go poking around too much. And don’t tell me I’m allergic to everything under the sun. Just… get it over with. Blood pressure, you say? Alright. But be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know. Other things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm… excellent. Blood pressure is 150/90. A bit elevated, but not drastically so, and could be from being a bit anxious or the heat. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are… a little muffled, but I can hear a regular rhythm. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Mr. Coby, your blood pressure is somewhat high, and the heart sounds are a little faint. These findings, combined with your weakness, suggest that this may not just be the heat. I want to run a few blood tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be willing to have some labs done?
PATIENT: Blood tests?! Now you're just trying to get more money out of me! I told you, I'm a healthy man. What for? To find out I’m allergic to sunshine? Muffled heart sounds... that’s probably just because I’m a bit out of breath from all this poking and prodding. No. Absolutely not. I’m not having any blood drawn. I came here for something for the heat, not a whole medical workup. If you can’t help me with that, I’ll just have to manage on my own. A glass of water and a bit of shade is what I need, not a needle. You're wasting my time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your reluctance. However, dismissing these findings without investigation could be detrimental to your health. I’m not trying to waste your time or money; I’m trying to provide you with the best possible care. Given your strong objection to blood work, and your insistence that you are otherwise healthy, I will not force you to have it done. However, I strongly recommend that you consider seeing a cardiologist for a proper evaluation of your heart sounds. For the heat exhaustion, I can recommend frequent hydration with electrolyte-rich fluids, avoiding strenuous activity during peak hours, and wearing light-colored, loose-fitting clothing. If you experience dizziness, confusion, or vomiting, seek immediate medical attention. I'm going to give you a handout with those recommendations, and a referral to a local cardiologist. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
