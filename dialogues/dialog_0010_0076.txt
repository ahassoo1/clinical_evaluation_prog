DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Please, call me Clarke. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs… my shins, mostly. They’re really bothering me, kinda painful, you know? Red and… well, bumpy. Been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. Bumps on your shins, red and painful… and you said this has been going on for a little while. Can you tell me a bit more about how long?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe a couple of months now? It started with just one or two, and I didn’t think much of it. Thought I maybe bumped them on something. But then more kept showing up. It’s not getting worse fast, but it’s definitely not going away, either. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months. And they started small, after a possible minor injury, and haven't significantly worsened, but also haven't cleared up. Do you remember when they first appeared – like, around what time of year was it?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… I think it was around springtime, maybe March or April? It was starting to get warmer, you know? We were doing a little bit of gardening, cleaning up the yard after the rain. I was wearing shorts a lot more then, so I noticed them easier, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Clarke. Springtime, gardening, wearing shorts… that gives me some ideas. Are the bumps itchy at all?
PATIENT: Not really itchy, no. Mostly just… sore. Like a bruise, if you press on them. Sometimes they feel a little warm, too. But not itchy, no. My wife asked if I’d been bitten by something, but I haven't felt anything bite me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sore, occasionally warm, not itchy, and no sensation of being bitten. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I can think of. No fever, no swelling in my feet or ankles. No tiredness or anything like that. Just the bumps, really. I sleep okay, eat okay... everything feels normal except for my legs. They just look angry, you know? And kinda ache sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. No systemic symptoms, just localized pain and appearance. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of – like diabetes, problems with your circulation, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I'm an old man, Doc, so a few aches and pains here and there! But seriously, nothing major. I had high blood pressure for a bit, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been under control for years. And my knees are starting to go, but that’s just age, I think. Other than that… no, nothing really. I'm on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Clarke. Controlled high blood pressure is important. And yes, Medicare information is helpful. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Always been lucky that way, I guess. Just the usual doctor’s visits for checkups and whatnot. My wife keeps me going, makes sure I don't skip those! She worries a lot, that woman. But she's a good egg.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family… my mother, she had some problems with her legs when she got older. Swelling, mostly. The doctor said it was just circulation, I think. My father was pretty healthy, lived to be 85. My wife's side… her mother had arthritis, bad in her hands. But nothing really like this, you know? Just the usual old-age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. Swelling in your mother, arthritis in your wife’s mother… helpful to know. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just the pills for the blood pressure, Doc. One in the morning, one at night. And sometimes I take something for my knees if they're really acting up, but that's just ibuprofen, over-the-counter stuff. Nothing regular. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Just the blood pressure medication and occasional ibuprofen. Now, Clarke, I'd like to take a look at your legs. If you don't mind, could you sit on the examination table and we’ll have a look?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem, Doc. Happy to. They’re right here, on my shins, you can't miss 'em. They’re kinda ugly, aren't they?
DOCTOR: Alright, Clarke. I see what you mean. They are a bit raised and reddish. There isn’t significant swelling, which is good. I'm going to gently palpate them… Okay, they’re firm, and a little tender to the touch. No bleeding or drainage. Based on the appearance and your history, these look like stasis dermatitis. It’s common in people with circulation issues, even if well-controlled, and can be triggered by minor injuries or prolonged standing, like gardening. It’s essentially inflammation of the skin due to blood pooling in the legs.
PATIENT: Stasis... what did you say? Something about blood? My wife always tells me to put my feet up, says it’s important for the circulation. Is it… serious, Doc? Should I be worried? I've been gardening a bit lately, trying to keep busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Stasis dermatitis, Clarke. It means inflammation caused by blood pooling in your legs. Your wife is right to encourage you to put your feet up - elevation is very helpful. It’s not usually serious, but it can become uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can lead to skin breakdown or infection. Gardening is fine, but we need to manage the symptoms and prevent it from getting worse. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense, Doc. So, it's not like, a disease or anything? Just… my legs getting tired and angry when I stand too long? And putting my feet up will help? That’s good. My wife will be happy to hear that. What else can I do? Cream or something? And is there anything I should be worried about? Like, is it contagious?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Clarke. It's not contagious, and it's not a disease. It's more a consequence of how your circulation works, and it's made worse by standing for long periods. We will start with topical treatment. I'm going to prescribe a corticosteroid cream to reduce the inflammation and itching – even though you don’t have much itching right now, it can help prevent it. We’ll also use a moisturizing cream to keep the skin hydrated. As for what to be worried about, keep an eye out for signs of infection: increased pain, redness spreading rapidly, pus or drainage, fever. If you notice any of those, call the office immediately. We may need to consider antibiotics. Also, continuing to elevate your legs when you rest is very important, and wearing compression stockings can help with circulation. Would you like me to write you a prescription for both the corticosteroid cream and compression stockings?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doc. A cream and some stockings… I can handle that. And yeah, I'll keep an eye out for those signs of infection. My wife is good at noticing things, she'll probably catch it before I do. You think the gardening is okay if I wear the stockings and put my feet up when I'm done? I don't want to give up on that completely.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clarke. Gardening is perfectly fine as long as you take precautions. Compression stockings will help with circulation while you’re working, and elevating your legs afterward is crucial. Think of it as being proactive – protecting your legs so you can enjoy your hobby. I’ll write you a prescription for both the corticosteroid cream – use it twice daily for two weeks, then as needed – and a pair of compression stockings, medium strength. I’ll also give you a handout with instructions on how to apply the cream and put on the stockings. Do you have any other questions for me today, Clarke?
PATIENT: No, Doc, I think that covers everything. You've been a big help. Thank you. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. My wife will be glad to hear all of this. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if things don’t improve. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your gardening!
