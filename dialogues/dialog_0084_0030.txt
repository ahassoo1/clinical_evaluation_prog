DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I'm Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s…different than it usually is. I can’t really explain it, just not the same. It started maybe a week or so ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. A change in body odor can be a lot of things, so it's good you're getting it checked out. A week ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week ago. Maybe a little longer, honestly. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. I usually don’t even think about it, you know? But I noticed it a few times this week and it just…didn’t smell like me. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, actually. And it’s good you’re aware of changes. Now, can you describe the odor?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s tricky. It’s not a bad smell, not like sweat or anything. It’s…sweeter, I guess? And a little…musky? Not like perfume musky, but…different. It’s hard to explain. I’ve tried different deodorants, but nothing seems to really help.
DOCTOR: Okay, sweeter and musky. And you've tried different deodorants without much change. Have you noticed it all over, or is it concentrated in a specific area – underarms, for example?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my underarms, yes. I haven’t really noticed it anywhere else. And it’s not like it’s strong, just…different. I don't usually have any issues with body odor at all, so that’s why I was a little concerned. I thought maybe it was something with the laundry detergent, but I switched back to my usual and it’s still the same.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, mostly underarms, not a strong odor, just a change from what's normal for you, and you've ruled out a detergent change. Have you noticed any other changes – like sweating more or less than usual, or any skin changes in your armpits?
PATIENT: No, no more sweating than usual. Actually, maybe a little less if anything. And my skin feels normal, no rash or irritation. It doesn’t itch or anything like that. That’s why I’m so confused. It’s just…this weird smell. I’m starting to wonder if it’s just me imagining things!
DOCTOR: No, it’s good you're paying attention to your body. Let's rule some things out. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, or kidney or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my usual check-up last year, and everything was fine. I’m on Medicare, so they usually catch things. I don’t have diabetes, and I’ve never been told I have any kidney or liver problems. I do have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s it. I take medication for that, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And what medication are you taking for your arthritis?
PATIENT: I’m taking methotrexate, and a low dose of celecoxib. I’ve been on them for about five years now. The doctor keeps an eye on me with blood tests every few months. I take them exactly as prescribed. Could that be it? Could the medication be causing this?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Kerriann. Methotrexate can sometimes cause changes in body odor, although it's not a common side effect. Let’s take a look at your EHR to review your recent labs and see if anything stands out. Okay, your last labs from six weeks ago were generally within normal limits, but your creatinine was slightly elevated. It's still within range, but slightly higher than your previous test. We should probably repeat that test just to be sure.
PATIENT: Okay. I figured something like that might be it. I know they check my kidneys with those blood tests, since the methotrexate can affect them. So, you want to do another blood test? That’s fine with me. Is that all we need to do right now? Or is there anything else we should check?
DOCTOR: Good. While we repeat the creatinine, let's also do a complete metabolic panel - that will give us a broader picture of your kidney and liver function. And just to rule out anything else, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, focusing on your armpits. I'll just check for any skin changes or unusual swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam is fine, no problem. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s just…unsettling, you know? Not knowing. So, just a quick look at my armpits? That's all?
DOCTOR: Yes, a quick look at your armpits and a listen to your heart and lungs - just a standard quick check. Okay, your lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling. Skin looks normal, no rashes or irritation. Heart and lungs sound clear. I don’t feel anything concerning. So, let's get those blood tests ordered, and we’ll go from there. It's likely related to the methotrexate, but we want to rule out anything else.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Voytek. That makes me feel a little better. So, just go to the lab, and they’ll know what to do? I don’t need to schedule anything else right now?
DOCTOR: Yes, just head to the lab and tell them Dr. Voytek ordered a complete metabolic panel and a repeat creatinine. They'll take care of the rest. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available. We'll call you with the results, and discuss the next steps. If the results come back normal, we can discuss other possibilities or a referral to a dermatologist. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Voytek. I really appreciate you listening to me and taking this seriously. It’s good to know it might just be the medication, even if it is a little annoying. I’ll go to the lab today. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come in. Have a good day. .
