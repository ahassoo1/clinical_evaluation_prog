DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back. It's been botherin' me for a while now. Lower back, mostly. Feels…old, you know? Like it’s gonna break if I bend too much. Not sharp pain, just…constant. It's been worse lately, that's why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, "old" is a good way to describe it, I understand. Constant discomfort is definitely something we need to look into. And you said it’s been worsening recently – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, used to be I could work in the garden all day, no problem. Just a little ache at night. But now? Maybe ten minutes and I gotta sit down. Even gettin' out of a chair is hard sometimes. And…my daughter, she says I'm gettin' shorter. I don't know about that part, but she worries. She made me come, actually.
DOCTOR: It’s good of your daughter to look out for you. Changes in height can sometimes be related to back problems, so it's worth noting. So, to clarify, the pain limits your ability to garden now, and you've noticed it's becoming harder to get up from a chair?
PATIENT: That's right, exactly. Gardenin' is my favorite. I used to grow tomatoes, peppers…everything. Now I just look at it and feel sad. And yeah, standin' up…it's like somethin' clicks in my back and I gotta hold onto somethin'. It's not every time, but more often now than it used to be. And…oh! Bendin' over to put on my socks is the worst. Really the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, putting on socks is a good specific example – that tells me a lot. It sounds like bending forward, and activities that require sustained bending or lifting, are particularly difficult. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. No tingle-y feelin's, and the pain stays in my back. Sometimes it goes into my hips a little, but mostly just…right there in my lower back. It doesn't shoot down my legs, thankfully. I get enough trouble with just the back part! My daughter keeps tellin’ me I gotta be careful not to fall, too. She’s always worried about me fallin'.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know the pain isn’t radiating. And your daughter is right to be mindful of falls. Let's talk a little about your overall health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, osteoporosis, or any other conditions affecting your bones or joints?
PATIENT: Osteo…osteoporosis. That sounds familiar. I think the doctor said somethin’ about that a few years ago, when I broke my wrist. Not a bad break, just a little fall in the kitchen. He said somethin' about my bones bein' thin. I don’t remember much else, to be honest. I was pretty shaken up. Never had arthritis, not that I know of. I mostly just get old aches and pains, you know? Like everyone else my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know about the wrist fracture and the mention of thinner bones. It sounds like you may have osteopenia or osteoporosis, which can contribute to back pain and increased risk of fractures. Do you currently take any medications, or have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take nothin’ regularly. Just an aspirin now and then for a headache. And no surgeries, thankfully. Never had any need for ‘em. I always try to avoid doctors if I can, to be honest. But this back thing…it’s gettin’ harder to ignore. My daughter…well, she practically dragged me here! She said I needed to get it checked out properly. She's a good girl, that one. Always lookin’ out for me.
DOCTOR: She sounds wonderful. And it's good you came in, even if it took a little encouragement. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll check your range of motion, posture, and feel along your spine to see if I can pinpoint any areas of tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just…be gentle, okay? This back is a little sensitive. And if it hurts real bad, you gotta tell me to stop. I’m an old man, I break easy!
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible, and we'll stop immediately if anything is too uncomfortable. First, I’m going to have you stand and I’ll just observe your posture from behind and the side. Then, I'll have you bend forward, backward, and to each side. Okay, bending forward... and backward... and to the side... I notice some limited range of motion with forward bending, and you do have a slight curvature to your lower back. There is tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, particularly at the L4-L5 level. No signs of radicular pain with leg raising – that’s good. Your reflexes are normal, and strength is intact in both legs.
PATIENT: L4-L5…what does that mean? Is that bad? And…what’s radicular? You’re usin’ a lot of words I don’t understand, Doctor. I just know it hurts when I bend over!
DOCTOR: You're right to ask for clarification, and I apologize for using jargon. L4-L5 refers to specific vertebrae – the bones in your lower back. It’s a common area for discomfort. The tenderness there suggests some inflammation or irritation. “Radicular pain” means pain that radiates down your leg, like sciatica. The fact that you don't have that is a good sign, it suggests the nerves aren’t being compressed. Based on the exam, it seems likely you have lumbar strain – a sprain or strain of the muscles and ligaments in your lower back, possibly aggravated by some underlying degeneration or thinning of the bones. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a simple X-ray of your lumbar spine. That will help us assess the bone density and rule out any fractures or other structural problems. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-ray…hmm. I don’t like radiation. Is it safe? I mean, I’m an old man, I don’t want to glow in the dark! And…how much will it cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know. My daughter helps me out, but…still.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Mr. Vankampen. The amount of radiation from a lumbar X-ray is very low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the small risk. It’s a standard procedure, and the technology has improved a lot to minimize exposure. We use the lowest dose necessary. As for cost, I understand your concern about being on a fixed income. We do have a financial assistance program for patients who qualify. Let me have my nurse check your insurance status – or lack thereof – and see what options are available. She can also give you a clear estimate of the cost before you proceed. We will not do anything without your full understanding and consent. Would you like me to have her come in?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. My daughter handles most of that stuff, but she’s at work. I just…I don’t want any surprises. And I really appreciate you explainin’ things so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel better, knowin’ what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. That's exactly what I'm here for. Nurse Patel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
