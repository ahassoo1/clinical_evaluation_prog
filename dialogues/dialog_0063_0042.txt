DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kammann. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good afternoon to you too, Dr. Jules. I appreciate you seeing me. I guess you could say I'm here for a bit of a check-up, a "men's health optimization" visit, like the paperwork said. Truth be told, I just turned 69 and figured it's a good time to make sure everything’s still… ticking like it should. My wife, God rest her soul, always said I needed to be better about these things.
DOCTOR: “Optimization,” is it?
PATIENT: Heh, yeah. That’s what the nice lady on the phone called it. Sounds fancy, doesn’t it? I mostly just want to make sure I’m not falling apart. And maybe get some advice on staying… active, you know? I like to spend time out in the garden, but it's gettin' harder on my knees these days.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with a brief history. Have you been experiencing any specific complaints?
PATIENT: Specific complaints… hmm. Not really complaints, exactly. Just… things slowin’ down. Like I said, the knees ache after a bit of work in the garden. And I get tired a little quicker than I used to. Nothing that stops me from doin’ things, but… noticeable. Oh, and sometimes I have to get up once or twice a night to… well, you know. Use the restroom. It’s just part of gettin' older, I reckon. Is that what you mean by “complaints”?
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, knees… a general slowing down. And how long have you been experiencing these… changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the knees have been botherin' me more for maybe the last year or so. The gettin' up at night, that's probably been six months, I'd say. And the tiredness… that’s crept up on me gradually. Hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I'd guess it’s been noticeable for the last few months. I used to be able to work in the garden all day, now I gotta take breaks. It's not a sudden thing, just… a slow decline. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, a gradual decline. We’ll need to explore this further. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago – probably close to 30 years now. Other than that, I've been pretty lucky. No heart trouble, no diabetes, no high blood pressure… at least, not that I know of. My regular doctor always said I had a strong constitution. My wife always said it was the Cherokee blood. We always took pretty good care of ourselves. Ate well, stayed active… as much as we could.
DOCTOR: Past surgical history: cholecystectomy thirty years ago. Very well. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, not a one. I don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it. Always figured if you could live without 'em, you should. I might take an aspirin now and then if I got a bad headache, but that's about it. I do take a vitamin D supplement, though. The doctor said my levels were a little low last year, so I've been takin' one of those every day. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D… adequate. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. My wife was the one with allergies, mostly pollen. I always teased her about sneezin' through spring. But me? I can eat anything, take anything, pretty much. I’ve got a pretty strong stomach, I guess. Does that include things like… latex or anything like that? I haven’t had much exposure to that sort of thing. Mostly just workin' with my hands, etchin' and engravin'.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother had arthritis, real bad, towards the end of her life. She was mostly bedridden for the last few years. My father… he died young, heart attack, I think. But he didn’t take care of himself, always smokin’ and drinkin’. On my wife’s side, her mother had diabetes, and her brother had some sort of lung trouble. That's about all I can remember, to be honest. It's been a long time, and we didn’t really talk about medical history much. More focused on the present, you know?
DOCTOR: Social history then. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, not a drop. Never liked the taste of alcohol, and smokin'… well, my father smoked, and I saw what it did to him. No thank you. And recreational drugs? Goodness, no. Never been interested in any of that. I've always been a pretty quiet fella, content with my work and my garden. And, well, my wife and I were both pretty devoted church-goers. It just wasn’t something we ever considered. I guess you could say I lead a pretty simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm not as nimble as I used to be, so bear with me. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything. Is there anything special I should be doin' while you check my blood pressure? Like…breathin' a certain way?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142/88. Heart rate is regular at 76. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to know it's not alarmingly high, just a little. And no, no recent weight loss or gain. I've pretty much stayed the same weight for years. Maybe a pound or two here and there, but nothing significant. I do notice my clothes feel a little tighter sometimes, but that's probably just age creepin' in. I used to be able to eat anything without gainin' an ounce, but those days are long gone.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are slightly diminished, which is not uncommon for someone your age. Now, I would like to check your prostate. It's a standard part of a men's health exam.
PATIENT: Oh. Now, hold on just a minute… I… I wasn’t really prepared for that part. Is that… absolutely necessary? I mean, I’m here for an "optimization" visit, not… Well, I just wasn’t told about that. Is there something specific you’re lookin’ for? I’m not particularly fond of that idea, if you don't mind me sayin’ so.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammann, a digital rectal exam is a crucial part of assessing prostate health, especially given your age. It's essential for detecting any abnormalities. While I understand your discomfort, it’s a necessary step. We can proceed quickly and professionally. However, if you insist on forgoing it, we can proceed with a PSA blood test, but it’s far less reliable. It will require a follow-up appointment regardless.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… that’s not what I was expectin' at all. A blood test… that sounds a little better, honestly. I just… I’ve never had one of those done before, and it just feels…invasive. Is the blood test a lot less accurate, though? Like, would I have to come back anyway? I'm just tryin' to understand what my options are. And if the blood test means I gotta come back for the other thing later, I suppose I might as well just get it over with now. But I’d really prefer to avoid it if I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the PSA blood test. However, I must strongly advise you that a negative result does not rule out prostate issues. A follow-up examination, including the digital rectal exam, will be required in six months. I will order the lab work now. You can go to the lab downstairs. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: Alright, six months… I understand. I'll keep that in mind. It's just… I don't like the idea of putting it off if it's important. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… tell me where to go downstairs, and I'll get it done. And maybe you could tell me a little bit about what I should expect from the blood test? Like, do I need to fast beforehand, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: The lab is just downstairs, follow the signs. You do not need to fast beforehand. They will simply draw a small sample of blood. It shouldn't take long. The results will be sent to me, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I think that's everything. Thank you for explaining everything… even the parts I wasn't thrilled about. I appreciate your patience. I guess I’ll see you in six months, then. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day to you, Mr. Kammann. .
