DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Dr… Glazewski, was it? Yes, well, I don’t really need anything, you understand. My daughter just thought… she thought I should get “checked out.” You know how they are. Always fussing. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just… curious, I suppose. It’s a very nice office, though. Very modern.
DOCTOR: Yes, daughters often have good instincts. It’s good of her to encourage you to come in. And thank you, we try to keep things comfortable. “Perfectly fine, mostly” is a good starting point. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I get a little… tired, I suppose. But who doesn’t? I’m 64, you know. And my hands… they ache sometimes. But I used to work with them all day, scrubbing, you see. Surgical tech, for… oh, a long time. Decades. So it’s probably just that. It’s nothing, really. I just thought I’d… see what all the fuss is about. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon later.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to get a sense of things, even if it is just to put your mind at ease. A surgical tech for decades – that's quite a bit of physical work. And no, I don’t anticipate this taking excessively long. Let’s start with the tiredness. When did you start noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness… Honestly, it comes and goes. It’s hard to say exactly when it started. A few months ago, maybe? Or was it last year? It’s… well, it’s just old age, isn’t it? I used to be able to go all day, and now I need a little nap in the afternoon sometimes. Nothing major. My daughter keeps saying I should get my blood checked for… something. I don’t even remember what. All these things sound so… alarming.
DOCTOR: It can be alarming to hear about potential things, you’re right. Your daughter is likely thinking about things like iron levels or vitamin deficiencies, just to rule out simple causes for fatigue. We can certainly do some blood work. And it’s good you mentioned the afternoon naps; that's helpful information. Besides the tiredness and the hand aches, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes… hmmm. Let me think. Well, my memory isn’t what it used to be, that’s for sure. But who’s memory is these days? I forget names, mostly. And where I put things. Oh, and sometimes I feel a little… dizzy when I stand up too quickly. But that only happens occasionally. It’s probably just my blood pressure. My husband used to have trouble with that. Though, he had… other problems, of course. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don't think there's much to it. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. It's important to get a complete picture, and you're helping me do that. Memory lapses and dizziness when standing – those are both good things to mention. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations – a feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Nothing like that. My heart is perfectly fine. I mean, I get a little anxious sometimes, if I think about things too much. But that’s just… me. Shortness of breath? No. Chest pain? Absolutely not. Pal… pal-what-did-you-say? No fluttering. Just… normal old age anxieties. Honestly, I think my daughter is overreacting. She worries about everything. She’s a very… sensitive girl. But a good girl, of course. I just don’t want to waste your time with… nothing.
DOCTOR: It's not a waste of time at all, Ms. Calvery. We’re simply gathering information. It's good to know you're not experiencing chest pain or shortness of breath. Now, just to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. Let me see… Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And I broke my arm once, falling off my bicycle. A long, long time ago. My husband had… well, he had a lot of problems. Diabetes, I think. And a bad heart. But I’ve always been healthy. Relatively. I mean, I’ve had the usual things – colds, the flu. And I had a hysterectomy, I suppose it was… decades ago. But nothing serious. I don’t really… go to doctors much. Never have. I find they just worry you unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tonsils as a child, a broken arm, hysterectomy… and your husband’s health history. Do you remember around what year you had the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a question. Let me think… It must have been… oh, goodness. Before my daughter was born, certainly. And she’s… 42 now. So… let me see… That would make it… well, a long time ago. Maybe… the early 80s? Or was it the late 70s? I really can't be certain. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember all the details. It was just… something I had to do. My daughter was very small then. It’s all rather blurry, if you don’t mind. Are we getting anywhere? I have that luncheon, you know.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ms. Calvery. It’s perfectly alright that the details are blurry; we’ll piece things together. Early 80s is helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, no, not really. I mean, I don’t think so. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just my skin being… sensitive. I don’t eat shellfish, but that’s because I don’t like it, not because I’m allergic. And I can take most medications without any problems. I used to take ibuprofen for my aches and pains, but I stopped because it upset my stomach. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Honestly, I’m a very… robust person. I don’t have many sensitivities. It’s just my daughter… she worries about everything.
DOCTOR: No, stomach upset isn't an allergy. It's good to know you don't have any known drug or food allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Well, I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I thought it was a waste of money, honestly. And I take a little calcium for my bones, but that’s about it. Nothing else. Just calcium. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little… chamomile tea. But that’s not a medication, is it? Honestly, I try to avoid taking too many pills. I don’t like the way they make me feel. Are we finished now? I really must get going. That luncheon…
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, I think we’ve covered everything for now. Just to summarize, you're generally feeling well, experiencing some fatigue and hand aches, with occasional dizziness and memory lapses. You have a history of a hysterectomy in the early 80s, no known allergies, and you currently take calcium occasionally. Given your age and symptoms, I’d like to order some blood work just to get a baseline and rule out any deficiencies. It will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work. Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But I really don’t like needles. And I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have that luncheon, you know. And my daughter will be furious if I’m late. She’s very… particular about punctuality. But, alright. Blood work. As long as it doesn’t take long. And as long as it doesn’t show anything… alarming. Honestly, I think I’m perfectly fine. It's just my age. But if you insist… Where do I go? And when can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery. It won't take long, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. They’re expecting you. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. The lab will send them directly to us, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Here is a lab requisition. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Three to five days. That’s… acceptable, I suppose. And my nurse will call me? What’s her name? I like to know who I’m talking to. And what if I forget? My memory… well, you know. And… no, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… don’t let it be anything alarming, alright? Honestly, I think I’m perfectly fine. It’s just my age. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I should go get this blood work done. And I really must hurry, that luncheon… .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. Your nurse is named Sarah, and she's very kind and helpful. She will remind you about the results. And I understand your concerns, and we’ll do our best to get you answers quickly. Please don’t worry. We’re just being thorough. Have a pleasant luncheon, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. . .
PATIENT: . Yes, well. Thank you. I suppose. I really must go now. That luncheon, you know. .
