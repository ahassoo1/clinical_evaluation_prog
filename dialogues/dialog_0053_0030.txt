DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s… different than usual. I can’t really describe it, just that it’s not me. And it started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Different how, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's not stronger, not more… sweaty, exactly. It's just… a different smell. Almost… sweet? I don’t usually smell sweet. And it’s not like perfume or anything, it’s just… there. It’s hard to explain. I’ve been using the same deodorant for years, and I shower every day, so I don’t know what’s going on. I thought maybe it was something I was eating, but I can't figure out what.
DOCTOR: A sweet odor… interesting. And you say this started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks, maybe four or five? It wasn't sudden, more like I slowly noticed it. At first I thought maybe I was imagining things, but it’s definitely there now. It's enough that I've started to worry about it. I don’t want people to think I’m not keeping myself clean, you know? It's a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, changes in body odor can be caused by a number of things. Sometimes it’s nothing, sometimes it requires a little investigating. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No weight loss or gain, I've been eating about the same. No fever or anything like that. My energy levels are normal, I guess. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I have been sweating a little more at night. Just a little, not soaking the sheets or anything, but enough to notice when I get into bed. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That does matter, yes. Night sweats can be significant. And you said you haven’t changed anything in your diet?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have – lots of vegetables, some chicken or fish, injera a couple of times a week. Maybe a little more fruit in the summer, but nothing drastic. I haven’t started any new medications either. I’m only on a vitamin D supplement, and I've been taking that for years. I really can't think of anything that’s changed. It's just… this smell and the little bit of extra sweating. It's just…odd.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we need to rule out some possibilities. I'm going to ask a few more questions, then I'll do a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any lumps or bumps anywhere?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I do regular self-checks, you know, and I haven’t felt anything unusual. I had a mammogram last year, everything was normal then. I haven't had any other major health issues, really. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age. Is this something serious, Doctor? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re proactive about your health, Ms. Purtee. And it’s always best to get these things checked out. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to rule things out. We’ll start with a physical exam – I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and just do a general assessment. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Nothing at all. Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. I’ve never had anything like this happen before. It's just… unsettling, feeling like my body is changing without me knowing why.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound good. No abnormalities there. Now, I'm just going to check your lymph nodes. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, actually. A little. I hadn't noticed it before, but now that you're pressing… yes, a little bit tender on this side. Not a lot of pain, just… sensitive. Is that bad? It's never bothered me enough to mention to anyone before.
DOCTOR: Okay. A slightly enlarged and tender lymph node. It’s not significantly large, but it warrants further investigation. I'm going to check your thyroid gland now.
PATIENT: Okay. I don't think there's anything there… I've never had any problems with my thyroid, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Everything appears normal otherwise. Now, to be on the safe side, I’d like to order some blood work. It’ll give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and some inflammatory markers. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood work sounds good. Will that tell you what’s causing the smell and the night sweats? And the swollen lymph node? Is it… could it be something serious? I know you said it probably isn’t, but… I’m a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: Those tests will help us rule out a number of possibilities, Ms. Purtee. They can identify infections, inflammation, and thyroid issues, all of which can cause changes in body odor and night sweats. The swollen lymph node could be a sign of infection or inflammation, but it’s often caused by something minor. It's important to investigate, and that's what we're doing. We'll start with the blood work, and then we can discuss the results and determine the best course of action. I’m going to give you a lab requisition now. You can go to the lab at your convenience. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little bit better, just knowing we're looking into it. When should I expect to hear back about the results? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, avoiding certain foods or… anything?
DOCTOR: The results usually take about 3-5 business days. The lab will contact you directly when they're available, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, there’s nothing specific you need to do. Just continue your regular hygiene routine and try not to worry too much. We’re going to figure this out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Pitmon. I appreciate your time and your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
