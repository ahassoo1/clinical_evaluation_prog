DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste any time, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I have a rather busy schedule myself, so if we could get straight to the point, that would be appreciated. It's… a bit embarrassing, really, to be here for this.
DOCTOR: “Embarrassing” is not a medical term, Mr. Schieber. However, I understand your desire for efficiency. Please, tell me what brings you in today. Be concise, if you would.
PATIENT: It’s… a white coating in my mouth. It’s uncomfortable, makes eating a bit difficult. It's not like a serious illness, I’m sure. I’ve never had anything like it before, and my wife insisted I come. Honestly, I suspect it's nothing. Just a… temporary irritation, perhaps. I don’t even know what causes these things.
DOCTOR: Very well. And how long have you observed this… “coating,” as you call it?
PATIENT: About… three days, I believe. It started subtly, and has gradually worsened. I haven’t been feeling particularly unwell otherwise – no fever, no significant pain, just the… inconvenience. And a bit of a bad taste, now that I think about it. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Three days. And no other symptoms to report?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I eat reasonably well, though my wife does try to get me to eat more vegetables. She's always fussing about my diet. It’s… stressful, frankly. But no, no other ailments. Just this… mouth problem. I assure you, Doctor, I'm generally a very healthy man.
DOCTOR: Stress is a factor in many ailments, Mr. Schieber, though I doubt it's the primary cause here. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Well, yes, now that you mention it. It's not that I'm not hungry, precisely, but… food doesn't taste quite the same. Everything is a little… bland. And the texture is… off. It's hard to explain. It’s more discouraging than anything. It’s making me lose interest in eating, which my wife will definitely hear about.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite and altered taste. Very well. And are you experiencing any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s not painful to swallow, just… uncomfortable. It feels like there’s something… there. A coating, as I’ve said. It's more of a sensation than actual pain. It's just… unpleasant. I can still manage to eat, but it’s not enjoyable. Honestly, I’m losing weight, and my wife is starting to worry unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: “Unnecessarily” is a subjective assessment, Mr. Schieber. Now, let’s move on. Do you smoke or consume excessive alcohol?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I find both habits rather distasteful. I’m a man of… moderation. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps, but nothing beyond that. And smoking? Never touched the stuff. My father smoked, and… well, it wasn't a pleasant experience for anyone. I pride myself on my health, Doctor. This is quite out of character.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. I haven't needed any medication in… well, decades. I generally avoid them if possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself naturally. I maintain a healthy lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned. This is… perplexing. I simply don’t understand what could be causing this.
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose we should have a look. Please open your mouth for me, Mr. Schieber. And try to relax.
PATIENT: There. Quickly, if you please. I have a meeting this afternoon. It’s rather important. I assure you, Doctor, it’s probably nothing. Just a little irritation.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see… a whitish coating on the tongue and buccal mucosa. Not particularly inflamed, though. No obvious lesions. Palate appears normal. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, absolutely none of those. Perfectly normal temperature, as far as I can tell. I haven’t even felt unwell, aside from the… discomfort in my mouth. Frankly, I suspect it’s something I ate. Perhaps a bad oyster? Though I haven’t had oysters recently. This is… incredibly frustrating. I’m wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Mr. Schieber. Oral thrush, though less likely without other symptoms. A simple irritation, as you suggest, or possibly a reaction to something. I'm going to order a basic blood work panel to rule out any underlying issues. And I’d like a scraping of the coating for a fungal culture, just to be certain.
PATIENT: A blood test? A scraping? Honestly, Doctor, this seems rather… excessive for a little white coating in my mouth. I assure you, my wife is overreacting. Is this absolutely necessary? I have a very important business meeting this afternoon. And I don’t enjoy needles. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I am the physician. These tests are standard procedure to rule things out. We do not practice guesswork here. The lab is just down the hall. It will take very little of your time. If you insist on dismissing it as “nothing,” then I will document your refusal of recommended testing. However, I will not be responsible for any complications that may arise. And frankly, it’s becoming clear that a thorough assessment is being obstructed by your… reluctance. Do you wish to proceed with the testing, or shall I document your refusal?
