DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Paulino, you say? A… Ukrainian name, isn't it? Well, to be frank, it's a bit of an embarrassment, really. A… a leakage. Yes. A rather bothersome leakage. It's been… present for a time now. Not something one discusses easily, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, discretion is certainly understood, Mr. Krok. It’s my profession to hear about these things. When you say “leakage,” could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. How to put this delicately… it’s… discharge. Yes, that’s a more… clinical term, isn’t it? A rather unpleasant sort of… fluid. It’s not… copious, thankfully. Just… there. And it smells… well, not pleasant. I assure you, I maintain excellent hygiene, so it’s quite unsettling. I haven't a clue why it’s happening. It wasn’t like this when I was a young man, I can tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Alright, discharge. And you said it’s not copious, and has an unpleasant odor. How long has this been going on, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Let me think. It’s been… several weeks, at least. Perhaps a month? It’s difficult to say precisely. My wife, bless her heart, noticed it first. She’s quite observant, you see. I tend to… not notice these things. It wasn’t sudden, it just… appeared. I've not been with anyone other than my wife for… well, a very long time. So I assure you, it isn't that sort of trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand. Several weeks. And it gradually appeared, not a sudden onset. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not precisely pain. A slight… discomfort, perhaps. A sort of… tenderness. But nothing alarming. Itching? A little, occasionally, but nothing I’d consider bothersome. It’s more… irritating than painful. And, if I may say so, rather… degrading. A man doesn’t like to be… leaking, you understand. It’s simply not dignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Krok. It’s certainly reasonable to feel that way. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I've been a bit… tired lately. But at my age, one is always a bit tired. And my… waterworks haven't been quite as… forceful, shall we say? It takes a bit longer to… commence. But again, that could simply be age. I haven’t a fever, if that’s what you’re asking. And no… unusual lumps or bumps. Just the… leakage. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. A perfectly good body, failing me now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, a slightly decreased urinary stream, and the discharge. And no fever or lumps. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Prostate problems… hmm. Now that’s a thought. The doctor years ago… oh, it must have been twenty years ago now, mentioned something about an enlarged prostate. Said it was common for men my age. He wanted to… monitor it, I believe. But I didn’t see him again after that. As for diabetes or high blood pressure… I don’t think so. I've always been quite careful with my diet. My wife prepares very healthy meals, you see. Mostly vegetables and lean meats. No sugary drinks or excessive salt. She’s a wonderful woman, truly. But this prostate… yes, I vaguely remember something about that.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of a possibly enlarged prostate twenty years ago. That's helpful. Any surgeries or hospitalizations that you can recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh, yes. When I was a young man, I had my appendix removed. A rather nasty bout of appendicitis, that was. And… and when I broke my arm, falling off a horse, many, many years ago. A simple fracture, nothing complicated. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing major. A few stitches here and there over the years, working on the farm, but nothing that required a hospital stay. My wife would certainly remember if there was anything more significant. She has an excellent memory for these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and a broken arm years ago. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had heart trouble, towards the end of his life. A rather weak heart, you see. He wasn't a strong man, never did much physical labor. My mother… she lived to be a very old age, thankfully. But she had… arthritis, I believe. A lot of pain in her joints. As for my siblings… my brother was perfectly healthy, until he caught a bad cold and… well, he didn’t recover. A shame, really. Other than that… nothing particularly noteworthy, as far as I know. They weren't a family that discussed such matters openly, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your mother. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a small blue pill for my… waterworks, as I mentioned. It helps me… empty completely. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And… and sometimes, when my joints ache, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I believe. But that’s only occasionally. Otherwise, no. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. They always seem to have unpleasant side effects, you understand. My wife insists I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that’s hardly a medication.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medication for your urinary issues, ibuprofen as needed, and Vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. My wife has a bit of a sensitivity to shellfish, but I don’t. I’ve always been able to eat anything put in front of me. I wouldn’t say I’m a particularly adventurous eater, mind you, but I haven’t encountered anything that caused me a problem. My skin is a bit sensitive to the sun, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I always wear a hat and long sleeves when I’m working outside.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Krok, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick examination of the area where you’re experiencing the discharge. It’s important to rule out any other potential causes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: An examination… yes, I suppose so. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of being… poked and prodded. But I understand it’s necessary. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. And try to be as… discreet as possible. It’s rather embarrassing, you understand. My wife isn’t here with me today, and I’d prefer not to be… unduly exposed. I trust you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Discretion is paramount. And I will be as gentle as possible. Now, if you could please lie down on the examination table, we’ll begin. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur. Not particularly concerning at your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. I notice some mild redness around the opening of your urethra, and a small amount of discharge is present. No obvious swelling or lesions. Alright. Based on the preliminary examination, it seems likely that you are experiencing urethritis, which is inflammation of your urethra. The most common causes are bacterial infections or, less commonly, sexually transmitted infections. Given your history and age, a bacterial infection is more probable, but we need to run some tests to confirm. I’d like to collect a urine sample for analysis, and possibly a swab to test for any infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Urethritis… a rather unpleasant sounding name. And tests, you say? A urine sample… yes, I can manage that. Though a… a swab? That sounds… rather intrusive, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, given my age and… my history, wouldn't a simple urine sample suffice? I’m not a young man anymore, and I’m not particularly keen on… further indignity.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. A swab would provide a more definitive answer and allow us to determine the specific cause of the infection, which is important for choosing the correct antibiotic if one is needed. However, given your concerns, we can start with a urine sample. It's not as precise, but it will give us some indication if an infection is present. If the urine sample is inconclusive, or if your symptoms don’t improve, we may need to consider the swab. Does that sound like a reasonable compromise?
PATIENT: A compromise… yes, that sounds… acceptable. A urine sample to begin with. And then… we'll reassess. Very well, Doctor. Let's proceed with the urine sample. Though I must warn you, it may not be… a particularly large sample. I’ve been drinking plenty of fluids, you see. Trying to flush things out, so to speak. But I’ll do my best. Where do I… administer it, shall we say?
DOCTOR: Right this way, Mr. Krok. There’s a private area just over there. Please collect a sample in this cup, and then hand it to me when you’re finished. I’ll leave you to it. Just let me know when you’re done. And please try to collect mid-stream – that’s the most accurate part of the sample.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll… endeavor to comply. Mid-stream, you say? I believe I recall something about that from years ago… It’s been a long time. Just… give me a moment. .
