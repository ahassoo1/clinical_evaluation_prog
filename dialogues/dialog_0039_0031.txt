DOCTOR: Hello Nixon, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because my left leg has gotten rather swollen, and I’ve been told it’s… something to do with my heart, I think? They said it was ‘atrial fib-ri-lay-shun’ last time, but I don’t quite understand all that. It’s been getting worse over the last few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in the left leg, and you were told it might be related to atrial fibrillation… that is something we need to look into. It’s good you came in. It's alright if you don't remember everything they told you – medical terms can be tricky! Just to be clear, when did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe about a week ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a little bit bigger than my right leg, I thought. But it’s definitely gotten worse since then. I noticed it mostly when I was getting ready for work this morning. It feels… tight, too, not just big. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tightness is a good way to describe it. And it's been progressively worsening over the last week. Okay. Now, is the swelling just in your leg, or does it extend up into your foot, or even your thigh?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my lower leg, I’d say. Like, from my ankle up to just below my knee. My foot’s a little puffy, but not nearly as bad as my leg. And my thigh feels alright, thankfully. I haven’t noticed any swelling up there at all.
DOCTOR: Good, good. That helps me narrow things down a bit. Now, have you noticed any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: There’s not much pain, exactly. It’s more of a… ache. A dull ache, mostly when I stand for a long time. And it feels a bit warm to the touch, if that makes sense? Not feverish, just… warmer than my other leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, an ache, warmth… I want to take a look at your leg, if you don’t mind. And I’ll listen to your heart, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’d appreciate it if you could tell me what you’re hearing, or seeing, if that’s not too much trouble. I don’t understand a lot of this, so explaining it simply would be very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. I do detect some swelling, as you mentioned – moderate pitting edema in your lower leg. That means when I press on it, it leaves a dent for a little while. And I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm with your heart. It's not dramatically fast or anything, but it is irregular, which is consistent with what you were told about atrial fibrillation. Your leg does feel a bit warmer than your right one, too. Now, do you have any other symptoms – shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t had any chest pain, no. And I haven't felt dizzy. I have been… a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I thought that was just from working. I teach all day, and then I usually have to grade papers in the evening. Shortness of breath… not really. Maybe a little out of breath after climbing the stairs, but nothing major. I do get a bit… fluttery in my chest sometimes, but it doesn’t last long. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very relevant, Nixon. The “fluttery” feeling in your chest – that’s called palpitations, and it can be a symptom of atrial fibrillation. Alright, so we have swelling in your leg, an irregular heartbeat, fatigue, and palpitations. Now, just to get a full picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized or had any major surgeries. My family history is… unremarkable, I think. My parents both lived long lives, and didn’t have any heart problems, as far as I know. I’m really not sure. I don't really keep up with my family's medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. No significant past medical history, no surgeries, and unremarkable family history. Do you take any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medications. I try to eat healthy and get enough sleep, so I haven’t felt the need. I don’t really believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I do sometimes take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, since it’s so cloudy in Scotland, but that’s it. And I stopped taking that a few months ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently. Alright, Nixon, based on what you've told me – the swelling in your leg, the irregular heartbeat, the fatigue, and the palpitations – it sounds like your symptoms are consistent with atrial fibrillation, as you were previously told. Now, to confirm this, and to rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to order a few tests. An EKG – that's a simple test to record the electrical activity of your heart. A blood test to check your thyroid function and rule out any other underlying conditions. And an echocardiogram – that's an ultrasound of your heart, which will give us a better look at its structure and function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it will help figure out what's going on, then please do. I'm a bit nervous, but I understand it's necessary. When will I be able to have these tests done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to teaching next week, so I need to know if I need to arrange for a substitute.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon, that’s perfectly understandable to be nervous. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The EKG we can do right here in the clinic today. The blood test, I'll write you a requisition form, and you can go to the lab whenever it’s convenient for you. The echocardiogram… I’ll refer you to the cardiology department at the local hospital. They usually have appointments within a week or so. As for the results… the EKG and blood test results should be back within a few days. The echocardiogram report will take a bit longer, maybe a week to ten days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have all the results, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience chest pain, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, or feel very weak – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… a great deal better than I expected, actually. Thank you, Doctor. Getting the EKG done today is good, and knowing it won’t be weeks before we have some answers is very reassuring. I will be sure to go to the hospital for the echocardiogram as soon as possible. And I will keep an eye on my symptoms, and go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate your help. Is there anything else I need to do, or any questions you have for me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. I think we've covered everything for now. Just focus on getting those tests done, and keep me updated. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s the requisition form for the blood test, and I’ll get the nurse to schedule your EKG.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
