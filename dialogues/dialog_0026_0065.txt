DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Finco. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m…concerned about my weight. It's been steadily increasing, and I haven’t changed my eating habits or activity level. It’s quite puzzling, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re addressing this now. Weight changes can be puzzling, and it's always best to investigate when something feels off. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me roughly how long you’ve noticed this weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I believe it began around… November of last year, perhaps? It was gradual at first, only a pound or two, but it’s been more noticeable these last few months, especially in my hips and…well, all over, truthfully. I can recall the exact date I noticed my trousers feeling snugger – November 14th, if you’d like to know. I do have a rather good memory for dates.
DOCTOR: That is a good memory for dates! Very helpful. And thank you for being so precise. So, November of last year…and it’s been progressive since then. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not particularly, no. My energy levels are…normal, I suppose. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to simply getting older. My sleep is consistent, and I haven't experienced any changes in my appetite—still enjoy a good plate of cepelinai as much as ever. I haven’t noticed any swelling, skin changes, or anything like that either. It really is just the weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable sleep, normal appetite, no swelling or skin changes… That’s good information. Now, sometimes changes like this can be related to underlying medical conditions, so I'd like to ask a few more general health questions. Do you have any known medical problems – things like diabetes, thyroid issues, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I've always been quite healthy, or so I thought. My family doctor always said my check-ups were excellent. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything of that nature. I do get a bit anxious, generally, but that’s more a…personality trait, I suppose. No high blood pressure or anything like that, to my knowledge. My husband always monitors things at home, and he hasn't expressed any concerns.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring. No prior medical diagnoses, and your husband hasn't noticed any changes at home. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Only a tonsillectomy when I was a child, Doctor. And a rather minor procedure to remove a mole on my back about ten years ago. Both were uncomplicated, and I recovered fully. It wasn't anything…significant. I’m starting to wonder if there’s something truly wrong if I have to recall such minor things.
DOCTOR: It’s good you recall those details, Reneisha. It's helpful for me to have a complete picture. And don’t worry, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. It’s simply part of the process of figuring things out. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to eat and take most things without issue. No hives, no swelling, no difficulty breathing…nothing of that sort. Though, I do find that dairy sometimes…upsets my stomach slightly, but it’s not a true allergy, more of an… intolerance, I believe. But I manage it, and haven't had any serious reactions.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a slight dairy intolerance. And you manage that well. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No prescription medications, thankfully. I do take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one from the pharmacy. And occasionally, if my joints are aching, I’ll take ibuprofen, but that’s…infrequent, perhaps once or twice a month. Nothing else, Doctor. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my mother had…high cholesterol, I believe. And my father had diabetes, type 2. He was diagnosed quite late in life, though, around seventy years old. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know, though we don’t see each other often. No history of thyroid issues or heart problems on either side of the family, thankfully. And no early-onset weight gain or anything like that. It seems… odd, given my father’s diabetes.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal high cholesterol, paternal type 2 diabetes diagnosed later in life. No thyroid or heart problems. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. Never have. My husband smoked for a time, but he quit twenty years ago. We both prioritize our health, as much as possible. Though, I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Does that…count?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you prioritize your health. And a glass of wine with dinner is perfectly fine. Now, how about alcohol consumption besides that – on average, how many drinks do you have in a typical week?
PATIENT: Well, aside from that glass with dinner… perhaps one or two additional glasses throughout the week. Usually on a Saturday evening, with my husband. So, three or four at most, Doctor. Never more than that. It’s more of a social thing, really. We don't drink to excess. I’m hoping this isn't sounding too…bad. I really do try to be mindful of these things.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Reneisha. That's very reasonable. And it's good you're mindful of it. One last thing before we do a quick physical exam. What’s a typical day like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a orderly at the local hospital, so my days are quite active. I’m on my feet most of the time, making beds, assisting patients, things like that. I walk quite a bit. I usually get home around 5:00 PM, prepare dinner, and spend the evening with my husband. We enjoy reading and watching television. It's a rather…routine life, truthfully, but a comfortable one. Not particularly stressful. I do enjoy my work, and I get plenty of exercise, or so I thought. That’s why this weight gain is so perplexing.
DOCTOR: Active job, regular routine… I understand. It is perplexing when things change without an obvious cause. Alright, Reneisha, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. Please, do whatever you deem necessary. I want to get to the bottom of this. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take your blood pressure and check your thyroid. I'll also palpate your abdomen, and take a look at your reflexes. It’ll just be a quick assessment. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 135/85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Alright, everything seems within normal limits physically. Your thyroid feels normal to the touch. Your reflexes are good, lungs sound clear, and heart sounds are regular. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we can monitor, but it isn't a major concern right now. Given your weight gain, family history, and normal physical exam, I think we should order some blood work.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, in a way, to hear everything else seems normal. But frustrating, of course, that the cause remains elusive. Blood work sounds sensible, Doctor. What exactly will the blood work entail? And what are you looking for, specifically? I appreciate you taking the time to be so thorough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. I understand your frustration. It’s good to rule things out. We’ll check your basic metabolic panel – that includes things like your blood sugar, electrolytes, kidney function. We’ll also check your thyroid hormone levels - TSH, T4. And we’ll do a lipid panel to look at your cholesterol levels, given your family history. It's important to rule out thyroid issues or diabetes as a cause for the weight gain. The lipid panel will give us a better idea of your cardiovascular risk. We'll also check your Vitamin D levels, as deficiency can sometimes contribute to weight gain and fatigue. It’s a fairly standard panel, and the results should be back in a few days. I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I suggest you maintain your current diet and activity level. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… comprehensive. And perfectly reasonable. TSH, T4, lipid panel, Vitamin D… Yes, I understand. Maintaining my current routine makes sense. I'm relieved you're taking this seriously, Doctor. Hopefully, we can pinpoint the cause soon. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary adjustments I should consider, or anything I should be watching out for?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t want you to drastically change anything right now. We need a baseline to work from. Just continue with your normal habits. However, it’s always a good idea to stay hydrated - aim for 8 glasses of water a day. And, while we're waiting for the results, if you notice any new symptoms – like excessive fatigue, hair loss, changes in your skin, or any difficulty breathing – please contact the clinic immediately. These would be red flags, but I don't want to cause unnecessary worry. I’ll also send you a handout with information on healthy eating habits and the importance of regular exercise. It’s a general guide, nothing restrictive. The goal is to be proactive and support your overall well-being. We’ll discuss the results in detail once they are back, and create a personalized plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. Eight glasses of water, watch for new symptoms, and await the results. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much more reassured now, and I appreciate your thoughtful approach. I shall contact the clinic immediately if anything changes. I believe that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment. The lab results should be back within a few days, and my receptionist will contact you to schedule a follow-up. Take care of yourself, and have a good day. Stop by the front desk on your way out.
PATIENT: I shall, thank you. And you have a good day as well, Doctor Finco. I appreciate everything. Goodbye.
