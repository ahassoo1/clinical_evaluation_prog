DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather…delicate. I’ve begun seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to ensure everything is…in order, shall we say? One doesn't want unpleasant surprises cropping up, does one? I’m a very practical woman.
DOCTOR: I see. A check-up, then, for preventative care related to a new relationship. That's…sensible, I suppose. Though usually people come in with actual medical complaints. Still. Let's get some details then. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, with all due respect, “sensible” is an understatement. It’s essential. And yes, I had a perfectly thorough examination with Dr. Henderson last year. All the usual things. Blood work, the…you know. Everything was quite satisfactory, I assure you. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. One simply must be diligent.
DOCTOR: Right, Dr. Henderson. I’ll make a note of that. Still, it's our policy to update everything, especially with a new partner. It's best to be comprehensive. Now, are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Doctor, are you implying…something is wrong? I assure you, I feel perfectly fine. Perhaps a touch of fatigue, but that’s merely from managing my schedule. I find the question rather…presumptuous, to be frank. But no, I am not experiencing any symptoms. I came for peace of mind, not to be treated as though I am falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s simply standard procedure to ask about current symptoms when evaluating a patient’s health. It doesn't mean I think you are "falling apart," as you put it. It simply helps me get a complete picture. Even fatigue can be a sign of something. Let’s move on then. Have you noticed any changes in your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Changes in my…cycle? Doctor, with all due respect, I find that question exceedingly personal. And frankly, a bit…unprofessional. I came to discuss preventative care for a new relationship, not to divulge the intimate details of my womanhood to a physician I’ve just met. I would appreciate it if we could stick to matters of general health and wellness. I certainly don’t need to be questioned on such things.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Pandolfi. I apologize if my questions offended you. I was attempting to be thorough, but I understand your discomfort. Let's discuss your medical history then. Do you have any pre-existing conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: I am quite pleased you’ve reconsidered your line of questioning, Doctor. As I mentioned previously, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. No, I have no pre-existing conditions. None whatsoever. My blood pressure is excellent, my cholesterol is exemplary, and I do not, and have never, suffered from diabetes. My mother lived to be ninety-seven, you know, and she was remarkably spry for her age. Good genes, I suspect, combined with diligent self-care.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. Really. One has lived a full life, naturally there have been a few…adjustments. I had my tonsils removed as a child, of course, and I underwent a rather minor cosmetic procedure – a brow lift – about fifteen years ago. But nothing significant, I assure you. Certainly nothing that would impact my…current situation. I keep myself in excellent condition, you see. It's all about preventative maintenance.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. A rather lengthy and, frankly, unremarkable tale. My father had high blood pressure, unfortunately, but it was managed with medication. My maternal grandmother suffered from arthritis, but that was likely due to her fondness for gardening in damp weather. Nothing particularly alarming, I assure you. No history of…serious illnesses, or hereditary conditions. We’re a rather robust family, overall. Good stock, really. I believe I’ve made myself quite clear on that point.
DOCTOR: And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you quite finished with the interrogations? As I’ve repeatedly stated, I maintain excellent health. No, I do not take any medications. Not a single one. I believe in natural remedies, a balanced diet, and a vigorous exercise routine. Prescription drugs are simply unnecessary in my case. I find them…rather barbaric, frankly. And quite unnecessary. Perhaps we could move on to discussing preventative measures for my…new companionship? I am starting to feel as though I’m attending a medical examination rather than a sensible consultation.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Pandolfi. I understand your frustrations. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, please. Do I look like someone who would engage in such a…vulgar habit? Absolutely not. I find the very notion offensive. I maintain a pristine lifestyle, as I’ve repeatedly emphasized. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but smoking is simply out of the question. It’s detrimental to one’s health, to one’s appearance… frankly, it’s simply uncivilized. Is there anything else you require, or may we finally proceed to the purpose of my visit?
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding alcohol consumption…how many drinks per week would you say you consume?
PATIENT: Doctor, I answered that question. Occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner. Perhaps two, on a particularly convivial evening. Certainly no more than that. I do not engage in excessive drinking, or any sort of…debauchery. I maintain a refined lifestyle, as I've made abundantly clear. I find your persistent questioning…rather insulting, frankly. I came here for a consultation, not an inquisition. I trust that is sufficient? Shall we finally discuss the preventative measures relevant to my new relationship, or are you planning on interrogating me about my entire life history?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. However, it’s my professional responsibility to gather a complete health history. I assure you, I’m not attempting to be insulting. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re apologizing? How…convenient. Well, I suppose a modicum of professionalism is better than none. As for allergies…no. I have no allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, as far as I am aware. I have a rather robust constitution, you see. I do not react to insect bites or pollen, and I am not sensitive to any known substances. Good genes, I suspect. And diligent self-care, of course. Is that satisfactory? Are we finally going to address the reason for my visit, or are you intent on cataloging every aspect of my existence? Frankly, my time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. Yes, let’s discuss the preventative measures regarding your new relationship. You mentioned wanting to ensure everything is “in order.” Are you concerned about sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, really! Do I look like someone who would be so…indiscriminate? The very suggestion is… appalling! Of course, I am concerned about sexually transmitted infections! One doesn't simply…leap into a new relationship without taking appropriate precautions. I expect a certain level of…discretion and responsibility from my companion, naturally, and I am simply being prudent. I would like to discuss appropriate testing, preventative measures, and…well, let's just say ensuring a…healthy dynamic. Is that clear enough? I trust we are finally on the same page. It's simply a matter of being sensible, you see. And maintaining a certain standard.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is clear. Alright. Given your concerns, I recommend STI screening for both you and your partner. We can test for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes. Would you like me to order those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Finally, some sense. Yes, Doctor, please do. Order the tests. All of them. Comprehensive testing, as you suggested. I want to be absolutely certain. And, if you don't mind, could you also recommend a reputable laboratory? I prefer discretion, you understand. One doesn't want to be seen frequenting…certain establishments. And could you provide me with a list of preventative measures? Perhaps some information on safe…practices? This is simply a matter of being prudent, you see. A sensible woman takes all necessary precautions.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m ordering the full STI panel for you now. As for a laboratory, I recommend LabCorp; they have several locations and are known for their discretion. I’ll print out a requisition form for you. Here you go. As for preventative measures, I’ll have the nurse provide you with a brochure on safe sex practices and condom usage. It's important to remember consistent and correct condom usage is the most effective way to prevent the spread of STIs. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Condom usage, you say? Well, naturally. One wouldn’t simply…neglect such a basic precaution. But I’m quite capable of reading a brochure, Doctor. And I trust my companion is equally…enlightened. As for questions… no, I believe I have all the information I require. Just ensure the laboratory is reputable, and the nurse’s brochure is…informative. I expect a certain level of sophistication, you understand. I trust that is clear. Now, is there anything else you require of me, or may I finally conclude this…consultation? My time is valuable, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pandolfi, I believe that is all. The nurse will be in shortly with the brochure, and you can take the requisition form to LabCorp at your convenience. We will follow up with you once the results are available. If you experience any unusual symptoms in the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate your…assistance, though I must say it was a rather protracted process. I expect the results will be satisfactory. And I trust the nurse’s brochure is…tasteful. Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. And I trust we shall not be requiring another consultation quite so soon.
