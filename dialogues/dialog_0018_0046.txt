DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’ve been experiencing some… well, pressure on my bladder, and it’s been bothering me enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s not painful, exactly, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent bladder pressure is certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels…full, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. And I find myself needing to go quite frequently, more often than I used to. It’s been going on for about two weeks now, I’d say. I haven't noticed any changes in my urine – the color or smell is normal, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Frequent urination and the sensation of fullness even after emptying your bladder are important details. About two weeks is a reasonable timeframe to start looking into this. Let me just review your chart quickly... I see you're 31 years old, and your height and weight are documented as 165 centimeters and 64 kilograms, respectively. You are covered by Medicare. Now, back to your symptoms. Have you noticed any other changes along with the frequent urination and persistent pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that information is correct. And no, not really… although, now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired lately. But I assumed that was just from work – I’ve been putting in some long hours recently. I haven’t had any pain, fever, or any trouble actually going when I need to, just the feeling like I haven’t fully emptied. Also, no blood in my urine, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Fatigue alongside these urinary symptoms is worth noting. The absence of pain, fever, and difficulty urinating, and no blood in the urine are also good indicators. Ms. Creagh, have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is entirely new to me. I’ve always had pretty regular bathroom habits, so this has been… unsettling, honestly. I usually drink a fair amount of water throughout the day, but I haven’t changed my intake recently, so I don’t think that’s it. I haven’t had any accidents or leakage either, just the constant feeling of needing to go.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern; it’s good you’re addressing this now. A change in established habits is always something to investigate. Let’s move onto some general health questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any past medical history – any chronic illnesses or significant health conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing major. No surgeries, no serious injuries. I do have seasonal allergies, which flare up in the spring, but other than that, I'm pretty good. My family has a history of high blood pressure, but I’ve been careful about my diet and exercise. I had my annual checkup last year and everything was normal then.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, a clean medical history is very helpful. And good that you're proactive about diet and exercise, especially given the family history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I try to avoid medications as much as possible. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s about it. And even then, it’s only when absolutely necessary. I don’t take any vitamins or herbal supplements regularly. I'm generally very careful about what I put into my body. I prefer to handle things naturally, if I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That simplifies things. Before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a graphic designer, so I spend most of my day sitting at a computer. It’s a fairly stressful job, deadlines and all. I’m married, and my husband and I live in the suburbs. We enjoy gardening when we have the time. I try to exercise a few times a week – usually walking or yoga – but it’s been harder to keep up with it lately due to work commitments. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I’d say I have a pretty healthy lifestyle overall, despite the stress from work.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Creagh. The details about your work, stress levels, and exercise habits are all valuable. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and a simple pelvic exam, if you are comfortable with that. We can, of course, proceed at your pace. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable. A pelvic exam… well, it’s not my favorite, but if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’d prefer to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, so yes, let’s proceed with the examination. Just please… be gentle?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Creagh. I understand your apprehension, and I assure you I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. We will take things at your pace and stop if you feel any discomfort. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll be using a stethoscope to listen for any unusual sounds. ...Your abdomen is soft, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. No tenderness to palpation. ...Your external genitalia appear normal. The vaginal walls are pink and moist. I don’t feel any masses or tenderness in the pelvic region. Your uterus is normal in size and position. The cervix appears normal. Everything appears normal on the physical examination, which is reassuring. However, given your symptoms and the duration, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to rule out any infection. We should also check your kidney function with a basic metabolic panel. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. If everything appeared normal on the examination, then checking for an infection or issues with my kidneys seems like the logical next step. A urinalysis and the metabolic panel… yes, please. I’m happy to provide a sample whenever you're ready. I’d like to know what's causing this, and I trust your judgment on what tests are needed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the nurse come in to provide you with a sterile container for the urine sample. Please try to collect a midstream sample, as instructed. We’ll also draw some blood for the metabolic panel. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. It's possible this could be a simple urinary tract infection, though the absence of pain is slightly atypical. It could also be related to stress or dehydration, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. If you experience any fever, back pain, or increased discomfort, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That all makes sense, Doctor. I will definitely increase my fluid intake and lay off the caffeine. And I will contact you immediately if anything worsens. Actually… yes, I do have one question. Is it possible this could be something to do with my age? I know things change as you get older, and I'm just wondering if this is…normal for someone my age? Perhaps my bladder is just starting to weaken? I apologize if that sounds silly.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Ms. Creagh, and not silly at all. It’s good you’re thinking proactively. While changes can happen with age, bladder issues at age 31 are less common and typically linked to other factors. It's unusual to experience significant bladder weakness at your age without a prior history like childbirth or specific medical conditions. That’s why we're running these tests – to rule out those less common causes and understand what’s specifically going on with you. While we can't rule anything out completely without the results, it’s less likely to be simple age-related changes and more likely to be something else, such as a mild infection, stress, or possibly a slight functional issue. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers everything. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit, Doctor. Knowing that it’s less likely to be something serious is very comforting. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. Thank you for your time and expertise, Dr. Stilaire. I’ll wait to hear from the clinic about the test results. And I’ll be sure to drink plenty of water!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Creagh. It was my pleasure to meet you, and I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before we receive the results. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. Have a lovely day!
