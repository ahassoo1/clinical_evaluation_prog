DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit strange, actually. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve been looking quite yellow, my daughter tells me. It started after I ate some fava beans. I love fava beans, but now… well, it seems like they’re the problem. I just don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Haggar. Feeling tired and noticing a yellowing of the skin are certainly things we need to investigate. And the connection to the fava beans is particularly helpful information. It sounds like we should explore the possibility of a condition called favism, although we’ll need to rule out other possibilities as well. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It was… about a week ago, I think. I had fava beans with dinner, and the next day I just felt… off. A little weak, you know? I didn’t think much of it at first, just thought I hadn’t slept well. But then the next day I was even more tired, and my daughter, Elena, she said I looked… pale, and then yellow. She’s a nurse, so she noticed right away. It's been getting worse since then, slowly, but definitely worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so approximately one week ago after consuming fava beans, you began to feel weak, and your daughter, Elena, noticed a change in your skin tone a few days later, which has been progressively worsening. That's very helpful. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and yellowing of your skin?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. I’ve been feeling a bit short of breath sometimes, like I can’t quite get enough air. And my urine… it’s been much darker than usual, almost brown. I thought it was just from not drinking enough water, but maybe it's connected? Also, I’ve felt a bit nauseous, but no vomiting or anything. It’s just… generally feeling unwell, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important details, Ms. Haggar. Shortness of breath, darker urine, and nausea… These symptoms, along with the fatigue and yellowing of your skin, certainly raise concerns. It sounds like we’re on the right track considering the connection to the fava beans. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t really have any major medical problems. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. And I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. I take a small pill every morning. Other than that… nothing really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. I eat reasonably well, I try to walk when I can… nothing serious to worry about, I thought. Until this, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of appendectomy and well-controlled hypertension. That’s good to know. And what medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it’s… Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. My family doctor prescribed it a few years ago. I usually get it refilled without any problems. I always make sure to take it, it’s important, you know? Elena reminds me, sometimes. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Haggar. Lisinopril 10mg daily. That’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve tried different things over the years, different foods, different creams… nothing. Elena always asks me, before I try something new, "Are you sure you're not allergic?", but I always say no. I’ve been very lucky, I think. I don’t have any known allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Haggar. Now, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a bit difficult. My parents are both gone now, and I wasn’t really close to my extended family. My mother had some problems with her stomach, I think, but I don’t know exactly what. And my father… he had a heart condition, I believe. He died quite young, actually. But beyond that, I don’t really know much about anyone else’s medical history. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My family wasn’t really one for talking about such things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Haggar. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing what you do know is helpful enough. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone in a small house in the countryside. I used to work as a receptionist, but I retired a few years ago. I mostly keep busy with gardening, I love flowers, and reading. I don’t really do much exercise, to be honest, other than walking around the garden. I used to smoke a few cigarettes when I was younger, but I quit about twenty years ago. I don’t drink very much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, but I do enjoy a bit of chocolate now and then. I’m pretty simple, really. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Haggar. That gives me a good sense of your lifestyle. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and examine your skin more closely. It will help me to assess your current condition. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I hope it’s not too bad, but I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Haggar. I appreciate your trust. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, but slightly faint. Your lungs are clear, but your abdomen is tender to the touch, especially in the upper right quadrant. And as you mentioned, there's noticeable jaundice – yellowing of your skin and eyes. I also notice some palmar yellowing. I’m going to order some blood tests to help us understand what’s going on. Specifically, I want to check your liver function, complete blood count, and G6PD levels, given your report of consuming fava beans. This will help us determine if you have favism or another cause of your symptoms. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Liver function… and G6PD? What exactly is that? I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that before. And what does it mean if it’s… not good? Is it serious? I’m a bit worried now, Doctor. Is there anything I should be doing right now? Besides, of course, not eating fava beans!
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Haggar. Let me explain. G6PD stands for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. It's an enzyme that helps protect your red blood cells. Some people have a deficiency in this enzyme, which means their red blood cells are more vulnerable to damage, especially after exposure to certain things like fava beans, certain medications, or infections. When someone with a G6PD deficiency eats fava beans, it can trigger a breakdown of their red blood cells, which causes the symptoms you’re experiencing – fatigue, jaundice, shortness of breath, dark urine. This is what we call favism. The blood tests will help us confirm if you have a G6PD deficiency and how severe it is. Right now, it's too early to say for sure. In the meantime, the most important thing is to avoid fava beans and any other triggers that could worsen your condition. We’ll also want to rule out other causes of jaundice, such as gallbladder problems or liver disease. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or severe abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And the abdominal pain isn’t severe, just… uncomfortable. More of a dull ache, really, mostly on the right side. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. And it doesn’t really radiate anywhere. So, if I understand correctly, it’s possible I have this… favism thing, because of the fava beans? And the blood tests will tell us for sure? What happens if it is favism? Is there a cure? Will I be sick forever? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, I’m just… anxious. And a little scared.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Haggar. It's perfectly normal to be anxious and scared when you're facing something uncertain. And yes, the blood tests will help us determine if favism is the cause of your symptoms. If you do have favism, there isn't a direct “cure,” but it's generally manageable. The main treatment is to avoid triggers like fava beans, certain medications, and infections. In some cases, a blood transfusion may be needed if the anemia is severe. Most people with G6PD deficiency can live normal, healthy lives as long as they avoid these triggers. Right now, we need to get those test results back to have a clearer picture. I'm going to write you a prescription for the blood tests and also a note for the lab explaining the reason for the tests. Do you have any difficulty getting to the lab, or would you like me to arrange for someone to help you with transportation?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. Elena can take me. She’s already offered. She worries, as I said. I just… I’m glad it’s manageable. That’s a relief. So, I just need to avoid fava beans, and… what kind of medications? Should I stop taking my blood pressure pills? I don’t want to do anything that might make things worse. And… are there any other foods I should avoid? Or anything else I should be careful about? This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Haggar, it is a lot to take in. Let's go through this systematically. Regarding your Lisinopril, do not stop taking your blood pressure medication without consulting with your family doctor first. We need to make sure your blood pressure remains controlled. However, some medications can trigger a reaction in people with G6PD deficiency. I’m going to send a list to your family doctor with medications to avoid, but it’s always best to review any new medication with them before starting it. As for other foods, there aren't typically any other dietary restrictions with G6PD deficiency, besides avoiding fava beans. I'm also going to provide you with a handout explaining G6PD deficiency and favism in more detail. It includes a list of common names for fava beans, as they can sometimes be hidden in certain dishes. Finally, if you experience any of the following symptoms – fever, chills, severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath, dark urine, or yellowing of your skin worsening – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a little bit, even though I'm still worried, of course. I’ll make sure Elena takes me to the lab, and I’ll show her the list of medications to avoid. And I'll definitely read this handout carefully. You've been very kind and patient with me. I really appreciate it. I guess… I'll just wait for the test results now. Thank you again, Doctor Glowka.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I'm glad I could help. It was my pleasure to meet you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. I hope you and Elena have a good day, and please take care.
