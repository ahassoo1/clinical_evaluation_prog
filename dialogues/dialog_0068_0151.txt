DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tingling, you see? In my hands and feet. It’s been going on for… a little while now, I guess. Not terrible, but annoying. I just want to figure out what it is, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, tingling… a little while now. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s not constant. Comes and goes. Mostly in the fingers, and sometimes my toes. Feels like… pins and needles, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as bad. And it doesn’t really hurt, just… weird. I noticed it more after walking my route, I think. But maybe that’s just coincidence. I do a lot of walking for my job, you see. Postal work.
DOCTOR: Pins and needles, comes and goes, worse with walking… postal work, right. Okay. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me think... Maybe three or four months now? It started slowly, just a little bit now and then, and I figured it was just tired feet. But it hasn't really gone away completely. It comes and goes, like I said. Not every day, but… often enough to bother me. I don’t pay it much mind usually, but I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Three or four months… alright. Do you notice anything else that seems to bring it on, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. It doesn’t seem to be worse with cold, or hot… nothing specific that I've noticed. Sometimes, if I’m standing for a long time, it gets a little bit more noticeable. But I stand a lot at work, so… it’s hard to say if that’s the cause. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for noticing small things. I just know it’s there, and it bothers me. Is it something serious? I hope it’s not.
DOCTOR: We'll see. Just to get a better picture, let's go through some other things. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, not really. I can still carry all my mail, and I can still do everything around the house. I haven’t dropped anything, or had trouble with… buttons, or anything like that. I mean, I’m not as young as I used to be, but I haven’t lost strength, if that makes sense. I just get tired sometimes, but that's to be expected, right?
DOCTOR: No loss of strength… alright. Now, any numbness?
PATIENT: Numbness… well, sometimes it feels a little… dull. Like my fingers aren't quite as sensitive. But it’s not like they’re completely asleep, or anything. It’s hard to explain. It’s more of a… lessened feeling. Like wearing gloves, maybe? But thin gloves. I don’t know if that makes sense. Is that numbness? It’s just… not as sharp as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Lessened sensation… okay. And have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Changes in my skin? Um… I don’t think so. I haven’t looked, really. I’m not one for looking at my skin. Just the usual, I guess. A little dry in the winter, but that’s about it. I do try to put lotion on, but… I don’t pay much attention to it. I’m not one for… fancy things like that. Is something wrong, Doctor? You’re asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Just trying to gather information, Ms. Uzarski. It’s important to rule things out. Okay. Let’s talk about other medical problems. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Never been told I have it, anyway. My mother had something with her sugar, I think, but I don’t know what. I’ve never had any tests for it, as far as I remember. I try to eat a normal diet, you know? Not too much sweets, but… I do like my pastries sometimes. Is that bad? I’m not insured, Doctor, so I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any problems with your thyroid?
PATIENT: Thyroid? Oh, my goodness. Now you're asking things I don't even know about! No, I don't think so. Never been told anything about my thyroid. I had a little trouble with my weight a few years ago, but that's about it. I lost some weight after my husband passed, you see. Is that what you're asking about? I really don’t keep track of all these things, Doctor. It’s all a bit much for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Uzarski. Let’s see… before we move on, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Never been much of a medicine person. Just a little pain reliever sometimes, for my arthritis, but that’s about it. And even that, I don’t take very often. I just try to tough it out, you know? I don't want to get hooked on anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven’t had any trouble with… pollen, or anything like that. I used to help my husband in the garden, and I never had any problems. I think I’d remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? Is this going to take much longer, Doctor? I have to get back to sort the mail. It piles up quickly, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your reflexes and sensation. It won't take long. Can you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If it won't take long. . I hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor. I really don’t have time for… complicated things right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. Let’s start with your reflexes. Please relax your leg. I’m going to tap just below your knee. And now the other one. Alright, both seem normal. Now, I’m going to test your sensation. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Okay, alright. . I’m a little nervous, Doctor. . Yes, I’m ready. Just tell me when.
DOCTOR: Can you feel that vibration?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel it. It's… a little tingly, actually. Funny, isn't it? Considering what I came in about. But yes, I feel it. Now, what does this mean, Doctor? Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And now the other leg. Can you feel that one?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. A little weaker, maybe? I don’t know… it’s hard to say. It’s just a little… duller, I think. Is that bad, Doctor? I really don’t like feeling like something’s wrong. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's check your hands now. Can you squeeze my fingers?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here you go, Doctor. Just tell me if something feels wrong. I'm a little worried now, to be honest. Is that strong enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. And now the other hand. Alright. Your strength seems normal in both hands. Ms. Uzarski, based on what you've told me, and this quick exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing the tingling. It could be something simple like a nerve being compressed, or it could be related to other issues. Given your age, and the fact you're not insured, I recommend we get some blood work done to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like diabetes or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work… . That sounds… expensive. I really don’t have much money, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, if it’s just a pinched nerve, can’t I just… wait and see? I don’t want to get into a lot of debt over something that might go away on its own. I just want to know if it’s something serious, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Uzarski. It's true, it could be something minor. However, it's important to rule out anything serious. I can write you a prescription for a referral to a lab that offers a sliding scale fee based on income. That might make it more affordable. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Oh… a sliding scale… . That… that would be helpful, yes. If it’s not too much trouble. I really appreciate that, Doctor. I just don’t want to get into debt, you see. I have to be careful with my money. So, you think it could be something simple, then? And the blood work will tell us for sure?
DOCTOR: It's possible it's something simple. And the blood work will give us a clearer picture. I’ll write the referral now. It’s to the Community Lab on Elm Street. They have good rates, and they are very helpful. I’ll also give you a list of things to watch out for – any worsening weakness, numbness that spreads, or changes in your balance. If any of those happen, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before I finish?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good. Elm Street… I think I know where that is. Weakness, numbness… yes, I can remember that. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I really appreciate you helping me out. . I’ll make an appointment at the lab as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. If you have any concerns before your appointment, don't hesitate to call the office. And please, don’t delay getting the blood work done. Take care now. .
