DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be… going to the bathroom rather frequently. More than usual, I believe. It's been on my mind for some time now, and I thought it best to have it checked. Though, truthfully, I struggle to recall exactly when it began.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to not have an exact timeline. Frequent urination can be caused by a lot of different things, so we'll figure it out. Let's start with the “more than usual” part. Could you describe what a typical day looks like for you in terms of how often you're going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Hmm… a typical day. That’s… a good question. I live a rather quiet life, you see. I work from home, mostly – environmental engineering, as I mentioned, reports and such. I suppose… during the day, I’d say every couple of hours, perhaps? It’s not constant, mind you, but it’s enough to be… inconvenient. And at night… well, I’ve been waking up once, sometimes twice, to use the restroom. It’s not a strong urge, but it's enough to disturb my sleep. Though, I do have a large glass of water before bed... Perhaps that's it? I truly don't recall when this started. It feels like it's always been this way, but I suspect that isn’t accurate.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Waking up at night to urinate is something we definitely want to investigate. And you’re right to consider the water before bed – that can certainly play a role. Let’s try to pinpoint if anything changed around the time this started becoming more noticeable. Were you under any particular stress recently?
PATIENT: Stress… that's… a difficult one. My work is fairly demanding, though I wouldn't describe it as stressful. It requires concentration, certainly, and sometimes long hours… But no, I can’t recall any significant events that would cause undue stress. My social life is… minimal. I enjoy my own company, you see. I did have a rather persistent issue with a neighbour regarding a tree… but that was resolved months ago, I believe. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is… rather unreliable these days. I apologize if I’m being vague. It feels like things just… gradually became this way, without a specific cause.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Verbos. It’s perfectly normal for things to develop gradually, and memory can be tricky. Let's move on to other symptoms. Besides the frequent urination, have you noticed any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning… no, thankfully not. No discomfort either. It’s not painful, not at all. Just… frequent. And… a bit disruptive, as I mentioned. I have noticed… a certain weakness, perhaps? A general feeling of being… tired, more so than usual. But I attribute that to my age, mostly. I'm not one to complain, you understand. But… now that you ask, perhaps it’s more pronounced lately. Still, no burning or pain, thankfully. I’ve always prided myself on a robust constitution, though I suppose even a robust constitution has its limits.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the lack of burning or pain. The fatigue is worth noting, though. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me see. I believe I had a bout of pneumonia many years ago, but that was fully resolved. Otherwise… nothing significant, as far as I recall. I do take a daily multivitamin, and occasionally an over-the-counter medication for… well, for aches and pains. Nothing prescribed, mind you. My doctor – Dr. Novák, he retired last year – always said I had a remarkably clean bill of health for my age. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, as far as I know. I haven’t had a thorough check-up in… well, I can’t recall precisely. It's been some time, I admit. My Medicare covers things, of course, but I've been… reluctant to bother the doctors unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about Dr. Novák and your general health history. We'll definitely get a current check-up done today. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – diabetes, kidney problems, prostate issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a difficult one. My parents… both passed away some time ago. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I believe. Nothing specific, as I recall. My father… he was a robust man, lived a long life. I don't recall any major illnesses on either side of the family, honestly. No diabetes, no kidney problems… My aunt, on my mother’s side, had some trouble with her bladder… but that was many years ago, and I don’t recall the details. It wasn't a serious issue, as far as I know. The family wasn't particularly forthcoming about medical details, you see. They preferred to avoid such conversations. So, I’m afraid I can’t offer much in the way of a detailed family history. I apologize for being unhelpful. My memory… it's a constant source of frustration.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Verbos. It’s common for family medical histories to be incomplete. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always considered it a rather foolish habit. My parents were both staunchly opposed to smoking, and I suppose I inherited their views. No, Doctor, I don’t smoke. And I rarely drink alcohol, either. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but that’s it. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, you see. I find it far more… satisfying than indulging in such vices. So, no, I don't smoke. A healthy lifestyle is important, you know, even at my age. Though, it seems all the good habits in the world can't prevent the occasional… inconvenience. But, I digress. No, I do not smoke.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Verbos. And a quiet life with a good book sounds very pleasant. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don't believe so. I've never had any adverse reactions to any medications, as far as I can recall. I once had a mild rash after eating some shellfish, but that was many years ago, and I simply avoided shellfish thereafter. No allergies to penicillin, no allergies to any common medications… Nothing springs to mind, Doctor. I pride myself on being quite resilient, you see. My wife – she passed away some years ago – always said I was remarkably robust. So, no, I don't believe I have any allergies. Though, I suppose it's always best to be cautious. It's just… difficult to remember everything these days. I apologize for being… vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Verbos. You’ve been very helpful. Okay, with all that information, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your abdomen and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly. I understand these things are necessary. I may not remember everything, but I do appreciate a thorough examination. Please, do as you need to do. I’ll simply relax and try to… cooperate. I do hope it won’t take too long, though. Not that I’m in a rush, mind you, but… one never knows. Proceed, Doctor. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally – I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Normal tympany throughout. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And finally, I’ll just quickly assess your gait. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you are. Not as spry as I once was, I confess. But I believe my gait is… reasonably normal. Perhaps a little unsteady, but that’s to be expected at my age, wouldn’t you agree? I trust you found everything satisfactory? I do hope I haven’t made a fool of myself. It's been some time since I was last assessed, you see.
DOCTOR: You haven’t made a fool of yourself at all, Mr. Verbos. Your gait is slightly slow, as you mentioned, but stable. Everything appears normal on the physical exam. Given your symptoms – the frequent urination, fatigue, and the fact that you wake up at night – and given your age, I’d like to order some lab work to rule out a few possibilities. We'll do a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. We'll also check your prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, to assess your prostate health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Thorough, certainly. I appreciate your diligence. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a urinalysis… and the prostate test, you say? Yes, I believe that is wise. I trust your judgment implicitly. Please, proceed with whatever tests you deem necessary. I understand these things are important, even if I don't fully grasp the details. Please, let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare. I’ll simply follow your instructions. I trust Medicare will cover everything, of course. And… when might I expect the results? I understand these things take time, naturally. But a rough estimate would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Medicare should cover everything without issue. As for preparation, just drink your normal amount of water before the test. Nothing special. The lab work will take a few days to process, so I anticipate having the results back sometime next week – around August 7th or 8th. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’d recommend keeping a fluid diary – just write down how much you drink throughout the day, and when you urinate. That can be very helpful when we review the results. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A fluid diary… yes, I believe that is manageable. A little tedious, perhaps, but certainly not insurmountable. I have a notepad and pen readily available. I can certainly keep track of my fluid intake and urination frequency. August 7th or 8th, you say? Very well. I’ll make a note of that. And I shall await your call with… anticipation. It's reassuring to know you're taking this seriously, Doctor. I do appreciate your thoroughness. A fluid diary… yes, I’ll begin that immediately. It may not be the most exciting task, but it’s the least I can do. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Any specific symptoms I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. Just watch out for any blood in your urine, fever, or severe pain in your lower back or abdomen. If you experience any of those symptoms, please contact me immediately – don’t wait for my call. Otherwise, just continue with your normal routine and keep the fluid diary. I'll be in touch next week with the results. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything admirably. No blood in the urine, fever, or severe pain… I shall certainly be vigilant. And I shall await your call with… a degree of trepidation, I confess. But also, with hope. You've been most reassuring, Doctor Asami. Thank you for your time and your diligence. I believe I'm quite prepared to face the next week, armed with a notepad and a keen eye for unusual symptoms. No, I don't believe I have any further questions at this time. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if anything changes before then.
