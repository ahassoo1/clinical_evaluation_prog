DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's… it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. And… something else. Something silly, really. I don't even want to talk about it. But the tiredness is bad. Really bad. Just get this over with, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds frustrating to be dealing with this persistent tiredness, and you're absolutely right, we'll get to the bottom of it. There's no such thing as a silly concern when it's affecting your well-being. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? I’m just… sleepy. All the time. Doesn't matter if I sleep eight hours, ten hours… I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all. It’s been… well, a while, I guess. Months. Maybe longer? Honestly, I lose track. And then… I just… I feel like I need to eat dirt sometimes. I know, it sounds crazy. Don’t look at me like that. It's just… a craving. I don’t do it all the time, thankfully. But when it hits… it's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Ms. Cantoran. It doesn’t sound crazy at all, and I'm not judging you in any way. It’s important to tell me everything, even things that feel strange or embarrassing. So, you’ve been feeling persistently tired for several months, despite getting adequate sleep. And you’ve also been experiencing unusual cravings for dirt. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's... pretty much it. Look, I just want to know what’s wrong with me and how to fix it. I got things to do. I don’t have time for… whatever this is. Is it something serious? 'Cause I really don’t want to hear about something serious. I'm too old for serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick answer and your worry about something serious, Ms. Cantoran. We’ll certainly try to figure this out as efficiently as possible. The tiredness and the cravings are definitely something we need to investigate. To help me narrow down the possibilities, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, good grief. That's… a long time ago. Let’s see… I had the usual childhood stuff. Measles, mumps… nothing exciting. Then… my husband, he… he passed away five years ago. That was… rough. Other than that? Not much. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, ages. I really don't like doctors. I try to avoid them. I'm generally… fine. Or I was fine, before this whole tiredness thing. Does that help? Honestly, I don't remember details. I'm terrible with dates and things. And names, for that matter.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Cantoran. We'll take it one step at a time. It sounds like you’ve been through a difficult time with the loss of your husband, and it's understandable that you haven't been focused on your own health. Just to clarify, you haven't been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, and you haven't had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old. I used to work with computers… programming those… machines. It was… a lot of sitting. Maybe that’s it? Maybe I’m just… worn out. I don’t know. Honestly, I’m starting to get a headache. Can we just… get to the part where you tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do? I have an appointment later this afternoon. I need to know if I need to reschedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran, and I apologize if I'm taking too long. We're getting there. The prolonged sitting with computer work could certainly contribute to some discomfort, but it doesn't fully explain the tiredness and cravings you're experiencing. To help me rule out other possibilities, could you tell me a little bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… Now there's a depressing topic. My mother had… something with her stomach, I think. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago. And my father… he had high blood pressure. That's all I really remember. We weren’t a close family. Lots of… disagreements. Honestly, I don't even like thinking about them. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re just fishing for information. I just want a quick fix, not a family therapy session.
DOCTOR: I apologize for bringing up a difficult topic, Ms. Cantoran. It's understandable that you wouldn’t want to dwell on unpleasant memories. Knowing a little bit about your family history can sometimes help us identify potential underlying causes for your symptoms, but we can certainly move on if it's too distressing. Let’s shift gears then. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that stuff. My husband tried to get me to take vitamins once. Said I looked pale. I told him I was naturally pale. He didn't bother me about it again. I get everything I need from my food. Though… I haven’t been eating much lately. No appetite, you know? Just tired all the time. Everything tastes… bland. But definitely no pills. No vitamins. Nothing. I like to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Cantoran. So, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. And you've noticed a decreased appetite and a change in your sense of taste. Before we move on, I want to ask about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm... I don't think so. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but that's just the pollen. Everyone gets that. And... I think I broke out in a rash once after eating shellfish, but that was ages ago. I haven't eaten shellfish since. Other than that, no. I'm pretty tough. I don't react to much. Honestly, I’m starting to feel really lightheaded. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get home and lie down.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling lightheaded, Ms. Cantoran, and I apologize for any discomfort. We're almost finished with the questions. Let's just get a few more details and then we can do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good grief. Really? Now you’re asking about that? Look, I'm a respectable woman. I don’t do any of those things. Never have, never will. My husband… he used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but I always preferred water. I find it… refreshing. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I came here because I’m tired and I have a strange craving, not because I have a secret life of vice. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Are you going to check me, or what? I'm starting to feel very faint.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the personal questions, Ms. Cantoran. I assure you, I’m asking these questions to get a complete picture of your health. It's important to rule out any contributing factors. And you are right, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. And please let me know if you feel any discomfort during the exam. Breathe deeply for me, Ms. Cantoran.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I don't like being touched. And please, be quick. I really don't feel well. This whole thing is… unsettling. Is there anything wrong already? You're making a face.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. However, I do notice some mild tenderness in your abdomen when I press here. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that… that hurts a little. Not a lot, but… uncomfortable. It’s always been a bit sensitive. I just… ignore it. It’s nothing. Probably just indigestion. I haven't been eating much, remember? And… I think I'm a little constipated. Sorry, that’s… personal. But that's probably what it is. Just… everything is a little backed up. Don't make a face. It’s normal. Everyone gets constipated sometimes. Just… leave it alone. Please. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Cantoran, and I apologize for causing you any pain. It's not embarrassing to mention these things, and it's important information for me to have. Your extremities look normal, and your skin is within normal limits. Given your persistent tiredness, unusual cravings, decreased appetite, constipation, and abdominal tenderness, I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. These tests will check for things like anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid problems. We’ll also check your electrolytes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Of course. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. But I warn you, I faint easily. And I don't like needles. Don't expect me to be cooperative. Honestly, this whole day has been awful. And if it turns out to be something serious… I don't even want to know. Just tell me what I need to do and let me go home. I just want to lie down and sleep. Are you going to give me a paper to tell me where to go? And how long it will take? I have an appointment later this afternoon. I really need to reschedule. This is a disaster.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cantoran, and I’ll do everything I can to make this as smooth as possible. The blood draw shouldn’t take too long—about 15-20 minutes—and the results should be back in 2-3 business days. Here’s the lab requisition. The lab is located just down the street at 123 Main Street. Let the phlebotomist know you are here for the tests I ordered. They will take care of you. And here is the lab information. If you start to feel faint during the blood draw, please let the phlebotomist know immediately. Based on your symptoms, I also want to recommend a stool test to check for any abnormalities. The lab will also provide you with instructions. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and trying to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t have a big appetite. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I need to lie down. And if it's anything serious, don't bother calling. I'm too old to deal with it. Just… leave me alone. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Please take care of yourself. And don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms. Here's a card with our contact information. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
