DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I need some papers signed, actually. Just some health forms for… well, it doesn’t really matter. They need a notary, and I figured coming here would be easier than finding someone else. I just want to get it over with, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can definitely help with those forms. Just to be thorough, even though you’re primarily here for paperwork, I do like to briefly check in with new patients. It helps me get a general sense of your health, just in case anything comes up while I’m reviewing the forms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose that's alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a… a thing later this afternoon. Just a quick check-in is fine, though. Really quick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Quick is my middle name today, Melvenia. Let's start with a few basic questions. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Mostly. My knees bother me sometimes, you know, getting older. And I get a little tired easier than I used to, but… that's just part of getting old, I think. Nothing major. I haven’t been sick sick, if that makes sense. No cough, no fever, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And the knee pain – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly when I’ve been on my feet too long. Or if it’s cold and damp out. It’s not terrible, just… annoying. I try not to complain too much. It's just… old lady problems, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. And is it in both knees, or just one?
PATIENT: Just one, my right knee. The left one is okay, thank goodness. It’s the right one that gives me trouble. It’s been that way for… oh, goodness, I don’t even know how long. Years, anyway. It just gets worse sometimes and better other times. I don't really pay it too much mind unless it’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the knee pain, have you noticed any other aches or pains anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my back sometimes aches, but I think that's just from bending over too much in the garden. I love my garden, you see. But it doesn’t last long, just a little twinge now and then. I wouldn't say it's a problem problem, just… something I notice sometimes. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is… okay, I guess. Maybe a little less than it used to be, but I don’t eat as much as I used to, either. And yes, I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not intentionally, just… it seems like my clothes are a little looser. But I’m not worrying about it. I've never been one to hold a lot of weight anyway. Can we just get to the papers now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We can definitely get to the forms. However, I do want to acknowledge that unintentional weight loss can sometimes be a sign of something else going on, even if it’s minor. Just so you know, I do have a scale here if you’d be comfortable stepping on it quickly. It would just give us a baseline. But if you’d rather not, that’s perfectly fine too. We can proceed with the paperwork. It's your choice.
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, no scale, please. I really don't like scales. I know I’ve lost a little weight, but it’s not like I’m disappearing! It’s probably just… getting older. And I haven't been eating as much red meat lately, trying to be a little healthier. I’m fine, really. Let's just do the papers, please. I promise I'll come back if something really starts bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. No problem at all. Let's focus on the paperwork then. Can you tell me what forms you need signed and notarized?
PATIENT: Okay, wonderful. Here… It’s these health forms, for the senior center. They need a notary to say I filled them out correctly. And… I think that’s it. It was a bit of a hassle getting them, to be honest. The lady at the center wasn’t very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. These are standard health questionnaires. Do you have any questions about any of the information on the forms before I begin reviewing them for the notary signature?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I filled them out the best I could. It's just… a lot of questions. I just need someone to sign them and say I did it right. I don't understand half of it, honestly. Just… the usual stuff, I guess. Medical history and all that. I hope you can do it quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m happy to help. I’ll just verify the information and ensure everything is complete for the notary signature. It shouldn't take too long. Can you confirm your date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: May 12th, 1949. But hurry, please. I really do have that thing later. I promised my niece I'd be there. She's making a cake, and I'm supposed to taste-test it. It's very important.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Just a few more minutes, and we’ll have this all taken care of. I'm noticing you’ve indicated you have no known allergies. Is that still correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Never had any allergies. Not even as a child. I can eat anything. Which is probably why I like cake so much. But please, let's focus on these papers. I appreciate you helping me with this. It’s just… a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything looks complete and in order. I’ve verified your information and can officially notarize these documents for you. Here you go. These are all signed and notarized. Please keep them in a safe place. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Wonderful! Oh, thank goodness. No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've been very helpful. And quick, like you promised. I really appreciate it. I need to get going now. That cake isn't going to taste-test itself! .
