DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won't stop. It's been...oh, goodness, let me think...more than two days now. It's really quite annoying, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, more than two days of hiccups – that is annoying! Let me just pull up your chart here... Alright, Ivette Redeye, age 50. So, these hiccups started over two days ago. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started…Tuesday, I think. I was having lunch with my friend, Fatima, and I drank a fizzy drink. Not a huge amount, just one can. And then, hic!…they started. At first, I thought nothing of it, you know? Hiccups happen. But they haven't gone away. They come and go, but they're always there, lurking, ready to…hic!…strike again. It's interfering with my sleep, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they began Tuesday after a fizzy drink with Fatima, and they’ve been pretty consistent since then, even disrupting your sleep. That does sound frustrating. Have you tried anything to get rid of them already?
PATIENT: Oh, you name it! My niece, Layla, told me to hold my breath, that's the usual one, right? And I tried drinking water upside down. And…oh, and someone suggested a spoonful of sugar. Nothing seems to work for very long. It might stop them for a minute or two, but then…hic!…they’re back. I even tried scaring myself, which was silly, honestly. Didn't do a thing.
DOCTOR: You’ve certainly covered all the bases! Holding your breath, water, sugar, even a little scare tactic… good effort! Okay, so we've ruled out the simple remedies. Now, just to get a better picture, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. Not really, no. I haven’t felt sick or anything. No fever, no stomach pain. I’m a little tired, but that’s probably just because the hiccups are keeping me up at night. Hic! …Oh, and I’ve been a bit…jumpy, I suppose. Because they just come out of nowhere! But that's probably the hiccups making me nervous, not the other way around.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no stomach pain, just a little tired and jumpy, which you attribute to the hiccups themselves. That’s helpful. Have you had hiccups that lasted this long before?
PATIENT: No, never. Usually, they go away after a few minutes, maybe an hour at most. I've never had them go on for days like this. It's really quite worrying, to be honest. I mean, is it something serious? Hic! …I keep thinking it must be something, because they just won't stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ivette. Hiccups lasting this long are unusual, and it’s good we're looking into it. While most cases are harmless and resolve on their own, persistent hiccups can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. To rule anything serious out, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. First, do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. Other than that…no, not really. I’m generally quite healthy, actually. I try to eat well, and I walk every day. Hic! …When I can, that is. It’s hard to walk when you're hiccuping!
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago and some arthritis in the knees. That's good to know. And you generally consider yourself healthy, which is great. Have you had any other surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the gallbladder. And I haven’t been in the hospital since I was a child. I had the chickenpox when I was little, but that was a long, long time ago. I haven’t needed to see a doctor much over the years, thankfully. Hic! …Until now, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good. Now, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to avoid them if I can. Just over-the-counter pain relievers for my knees sometimes, when they're really bothering me. But I don’t take anything every day. Just when I need it. Hic!… Honestly, I'm more worried about what is causing these hiccups than taking pills!
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional over-the-counter pain relievers for your knees. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and I've never broken out in a rash or anything like that. Hic!… I’m usually pretty lucky, health-wise. But these hiccups… they’re something else!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Okay, Ivette, based on what you've told me, it sounds like these persistent hiccups are a bit of a mystery. Given the duration and the fact that they're interfering with your sleep, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want them to stop. Hic! …I’m happy to do whatever I need to do. A physical exam sounds good.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your abdomen. It's a quick check. Please take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen feels soft, no tenderness or masses that I can feel. Everything seems normal there as well. Okay, physically, everything appears normal. Given the lack of any obvious cause, and the fact that these hiccups are continuing, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests can help rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to the problem. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests…yes, that sounds sensible. If it can help find out what's causing them, then yes, definitely. Hic!… I just hope it's not something serious. What kind of things are you looking for? I don't want to worry unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question. The blood tests will check your electrolyte levels – things like potassium and sodium – as well as your kidney and liver function. We'll also check your complete blood count to make sure everything is as it should be. It's just a routine check to rule out any imbalances or issues that could be causing the hiccups. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's always best to be thorough. I’ll write up the order for the lab now. They'll need a small sample of blood, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication called baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help stop hiccups. It’s a low dose, and we’ll see if it helps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Baclofen… a muscle relaxant. Okay. That sounds… okay. If it might help. I’m willing to try anything. Hic!… I just want this to stop. How long will it take to get the results back, exactly? And what are the side effects of the baclofen? I like to know these things, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you have every right to know. The lab results usually take 2-3 business days to come back, so we should have them by the end of next week. As for the baclofen, the most common side effects are drowsiness and dizziness. It can also cause some nausea in some people, but that’s usually mild. It’s important not to drive or operate heavy machinery if you feel drowsy, and we’ll start with a low dose to minimize any side effects. We’ll also talk about any other medications you might be taking, just to make sure there are no interactions. Here’s the prescription for the baclofen, and this is the order for the blood tests. You can take the prescription to any pharmacy, and you’ll need to go to the lab to have your blood drawn. Do you have any questions about the instructions or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. 2-3 business days for the blood tests, baclofen for the hiccups, watch out for drowsiness… Okay. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Hic! …I really appreciate it. Hopefully, this will finally put an end to this… this misery. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any positions I should try? Any foods I should avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could explain everything clearly. As for what you can do in the meantime, there isn't a huge amount of evidence to support specific remedies, but you can certainly continue trying some of the things you've already done – holding your breath, drinking water slowly, etc. – if they provide any temporary relief. Avoid carbonated beverages and large meals, as those can sometimes trigger hiccups. And, most importantly, try to get as much rest as possible, even though it's difficult with the hiccups. If the hiccups worsen significantly or you develop any new symptoms – like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe abdominal pain – please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. We'll see how the baclofen works, and we’ll review the blood test results next week. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your help. Hic! …I really do appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood tests done and pick up the prescription. Hopefully, things will start to improve soon. Thank you. .
