DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is... a pleasure. I have been... having trouble. Finding the right words, you see. It is… frustrating. I do not always know what I wish to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frustrating is a good way to put it, I can imagine. When did you first start noticing this trouble with finding the right words?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a… difficult question. It feels like it has been some time now. Perhaps… a few months? It is not sudden, not like a switch. More… slow. It comes and goes, you understand? Some days are worse than others. I apologize, I am not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Gyamfi. That's perfectly alright. "Slow" and "coming and goes" is helpful information. So, a few months of this…difficulty with word finding. Has this impacted your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Yes. A little. I… work with numbers, benefits. Compensation, yes. And I need to speak with people, explain things. It is… difficult when the correct word escapes me. I find myself… repeating myself. Or… changing what I wish to say, because I cannot recall the proper phrasing. It is… embarrassing. I do not wish to be a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be very frustrating, especially in your line of work. It's good you’ve noticed it and are bringing it to my attention. Besides the difficulty with words, have you noticed any other changes – any problems with your memory, or perhaps difficulty with tasks that used to be easy?
PATIENT: Hmm. Memory… sometimes I forget where I place things. Keys, mostly. Small things. And… I sometimes feel… a little slow to understand. Not often, but it happens. Tasks… no, I do not think so. The work itself… is still manageable. But I do require… more concentration, perhaps. It is… tiring. My wife… she would always remind me of things. Now… it is just me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Forgetting keys and needing more concentration... We're building a good picture. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes alongside these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No headaches. No dizziness. And my vision… is as poor as ever, but that is… just age, I believe. I have had glasses for many years. It has not… worsened recently. Just… blurry. The trouble is with the words, mostly. It is a strange feeling. Like… they are on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot grasp them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I have… high blood pressure. The doctor gives me pills for it. For many years now. And… my knees. They are not good. Arthritis, I think. Very painful sometimes. Other than that… I am generally healthy, for an old man. I had a… a small surgery, many years ago. On my shoulder. But it is fully healed now. I do take… Medicare, for insurance. My wife… she handled most of the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, arthritis in your knees, and a past shoulder surgery. And you are covered by Medicare. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a good question. My wife… she would fill the prescription. I… believe it is a small white pill? No, perhaps a light blue. I truly do not recall the name. I take it every morning, with breakfast. I apologize. I am not very good with remembering these things. Perhaps the pharmacy knows? They have a record, yes?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Gyamfi, don’t worry about it at all. The pharmacy record would be very helpful, and we can certainly look that up. We'll get there. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not believe so. Not that I know of. I have taken many pills over the years for my knees, and the blood pressure. I have never had a… a reaction. No rash, no difficulty breathing. Nothing. My wife always asked me before giving me anything new. She was very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no known allergies. And just a few more quick questions to get a better picture. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I do not care for the smell of it. My wife… she disliked it as well. It is… unhealthy, you understand? I prefer a good cup of coffee, in the morning. And… sometimes, a small piece of cake.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking history. And do you drink alcohol, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Very occasionally. A glass of wine, perhaps, with dinner. On special occasions. Not every week. Not even every month. My wife… we would share a glass sometimes, on a Friday. But since… since she has been gone… I have not had much appetite for it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, very occasional alcohol use. Last question for now: Are there any family members who have had any similar memory problems, or any neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a… difficult question. My sister… she always said my mother was a little forgetful, as she got older. But it was just… age, she thought. Nothing serious. My father… he was very sharp, right until the end. No, I do not recall anyone having… a proper disease. No Alzheimer’s, no Parkinson’s. Just… normal age-related memory lapses. I apologize. My family… we do not speak often. I am not very close to them.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there is anything… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Finally, I'm going to do a very quick cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to see how your memory and thinking are functioning. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… quite alright. I understand. A few questions… I will do my best. I hope I can remember them, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Hmm… August… I believe it is the second. Yes, August the second. The year… that is… 2025, I think. Yes. August the second, 2025. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gyamfi, that is perfectly correct. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a difficult question. I… I do not always remember these things. It is… a suburban area, is it not? I… I believe it is… Oak Haven? No… perhaps River Bend? I apologize. It escapes me. I know I live here, but the name… it is on the tip of my tongue.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. That's alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I will say them slowly, and then ask you to remember them. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Three words… I will do my best to remember them. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Apple… Table… Penny. Now, can you repeat those three words back to me?
PATIENT: Hmm… Apple… yes, I remember Apple. And… Table. Yes, Table is there. But… the third one… it escapes me. It was something small… shiny… I… I cannot recall. Apple… Table… and… and something… I apologize. It is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot grasp it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Don't worry about it. Based on your history and the brief examination we've done today, it seems you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with memory and word recall. It's important to investigate this further. There are many potential causes for these symptoms, and we need to rule them out. I would like to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other possible medical issues. I also recommend a brain scan, an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a brain scan… yes. If you think it is necessary, Doctor. Then yes, please. I wish to know what is happening. It is… unsettling, not remembering things. I trust your judgment. Whatever you recommend, I will do. It is just… frightening, not knowing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is frightening, and you’re right to want answers. We'll get to the bottom of this together. I will write the orders for the blood work and MRI now. The blood work can be done at the lab across the street. The MRI will require an appointment; my assistant will schedule that for you. In the meantime, I would also like you to keep a log of any episodes of memory loss or difficulty with words. Note the date, time, and what happened. It will be helpful for me to review when you come back for your follow-up appointment. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nervous system disorders. They will be able to provide a more detailed assessment and help determine the best course of treatment. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Blood work… MRI… neurologist… a log… Yes. I can do that. I will write down everything. A log… yes, that makes sense. I want to be as helpful as possible. You are very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. And your kindness. I am a little overwhelmed, perhaps, but I will do everything you ask. Please, just… let me know when and where to go for these things.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m glad I could explain everything clearly, and you are welcome. It's my job to ensure you get the best possible care. My assistant, Sarah, will come in shortly to schedule the MRI appointment and provide you with all the necessary paperwork. She’ll also explain the blood work instructions. I would like to see you back in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests and make a plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Two weeks… that is fine. I will mark it on my calendar. Thank you. I appreciate your time, and your… careful attention. I feel… a little better now, knowing we are taking steps to understand this.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Gyamfi. I will leave you in Sarah’s capable hands. If anything comes up before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today. Take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you to you. I will. I appreciate everything. Goodbye. .
