DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… Alcorta, actually. Delano Alcorta. And frankly, it’s about my eyesight. It’s been… deteriorating. Not rapidly, mind you, but noticeably so. I used to have quite the sharp vision, and now… well, now things are rather blurry. I suppose I should have come sooner, but one tends to put these things off, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, people often do. It's good you're here now. “Deteriorating” is a good way to describe it. And thank you for clarifying your name, Mr. Alcorta – I apologize for the mistake. Could you tell me a little more about how it's deteriorating?
PATIENT: Well, it's not as if I woke up one morning completely blind, Doctor. It’s… a gradual dimming, I suppose. Things at a distance are the first to go. Street signs, for instance. And reading… reading is becoming quite a strain. I find myself holding the paper further and further away just to make out the words. It's… inconvenient, to say the least. I used to enjoy a good newspaper with my coffee, but now it's a chore. It's hardly a life, squinting at everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual dimming and difficulty with distance and reading – that gives me a good starting point. You mentioned it's been happening gradually. Roughly how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. I’d say… at least six months, perhaps longer. It started subtly, and I dismissed it as fatigue, you understand. Working with people all day… it does strain the eyes, doesn’t it? But it's definitely worsened in the last three months, I'd wager. I’m not one to dwell on such things, so I didn't keep close track. I truly should have, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It's very common to dismiss things like this at first, especially with a demanding job. No need to feel bad about not keeping track. Three months of noticeable worsening is helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other changes with your vision besides the blurriness and difficulty reading?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… yes. Sometimes, when I look at something, there are… spots. Little flecks, really. They drift across my field of vision. They don’t last long, and they're not terribly frequent, but they’re… disconcerting. I assumed it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. Old age, perhaps. Though I hardly feel old. And occasionally, everything seems… dimmed. Like looking through a dirty window. But that passes quickly. It's difficult to explain. Do you understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Those “flecks” – what you’re describing sounds like floaters. And the dimmed vision – that’s good information as well. Have you noticed any flashes of light, or a curtain or shadow coming down over your vision at any point?
PATIENT: Flashes of light… no, I haven’t experienced anything like that. And thankfully, no curtains or shadows. It's not that severe, Doctor. I just want to be able to read my newspaper again. This blurry vision is… frankly, it’s undignified. I'm a man of letters, you see. I pride myself on my intellect, and it's difficult to concentrate when one can barely make out the words. Are you quite sure there isn’t something simple I can do to rectify this? Perhaps a stronger pair of spectacles?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's good to hear there are no flashes or shadows. While stronger spectacles could help, given the floaters and the general dimming you've described, it would be best to do a thorough eye exam to determine the cause. I’d like to check your visual acuity, examine your pupils, and take a look at the back of your eye. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose that’s sensible. I wouldn't want to waste my time on mere spectacles if there’s something more… serious at play. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of having things… poked and prodded. But if it's necessary, I suppose I can endure it. Just please be gentle. And explain what you’re doing as you go along. I prefer to be informed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your apprehension, and I will explain everything as I go and be as gentle as possible. It’s a fairly straightforward exam. First, we’ll test your vision with the eye chart. Just read the smallest letters you can see on each line. We’ll do one eye at a time, wearing your current glasses if you have them. Then I’ll use a few different instruments to check your peripheral vision, and I'll examine the front of your eyes with a special light. Finally, I'll dilate your pupils with some eye drops – this will allow me to get a better view of the back of your eye. The drops will sting slightly and cause some temporary blurring, so you won't be able to drive for a few hours afterward. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Dilate my pupils, you say? Cause temporary blurring? And I won’t be able to drive? Hmm. That’s… inconvenient. I had planned on running a few errands this afternoon. Are you certain this dilation is necessary? Perhaps we could skip that part? I’m not keen on being incapacitated. I have… responsibilities, you see. And I rather pride myself on my independence. Still, if it’s the only way to get to the bottom of this… I suppose I can reschedule my errands. But I trust you’re not being overly cautious? I don’t wish to undergo unnecessary procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Alcorta. The dilation is the most important part of the exam, unfortunately. It allows me to thoroughly examine the retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels at the back of your eye – all crucial for diagnosing the cause of your symptoms. Things like floaters and the dimming you're experiencing could be caused by a variety of issues, some of which are serious and require immediate attention. Skipping the dilation would limit my ability to rule those out. It's not about being overly cautious, it’s about ensuring I have all the information I need to provide you with the best possible care. The drops wear off relatively quickly, usually within a few hours, and I can provide you with a dark pair of sunglasses to minimize light sensitivity afterward. I will document your transportation needs and we can discuss rescheduling if you do not have a driver available. Would you like me to proceed with the exam and dilation?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed. But I must reiterate, I do not appreciate being inconvenienced. And if this dilation reveals nothing of significance, I expect a thorough explanation. I’m not one to be trifled with. Let’s get this over with, shall we? Perhaps we can discuss the logistics of my transportation afterward? I live a considerable distance from here, you understand. And I'm quite particular about who drives me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I will explain everything thoroughly, regardless of the findings. I will also document your transportation needs. First, let's test your vision with the eye chart. Please sit comfortably, and keep your glasses on for now. I'll ask you to read the smallest letters you can see on each line, one eye at a time. Ready?
PATIENT: Very well. Let's get on with it. Though I suspect my vision is perfectly adequate, despite what I’ve told you. I’m quite accustomed to reading fine print, you see. It's part of my profession. E… F… P… T… Now, are you certain this chart is calibrated correctly? The letters appear rather… small.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, the chart is calibrated according to standard Snellen chart measurements. It's quite common to have some difficulty with certain letters, even with good vision. Just read the smallest letters you can comfortably identify on each line. Don’t strain yourself. We'll record your results and move on from there. Okay, thank you. Now, let’s cover your left eye. Can you read the first line for me?
PATIENT: Very well. C… P… T… L… D… H… These letters are… ambiguous, Doctor. Quite ambiguous, indeed. And the lighting in here isn’t optimal. Is it possible to adjust the illumination? I’m not accustomed to reading under such… adverse conditions. F… P… C…
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ve adjusted the lighting. How is that?
PATIENT: Marginally better, I suppose. But still… rather indistinct. T… V… P… F… Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to question the accuracy of this entire procedure. I’ve always had excellent vision. Perhaps you should recalibrate the chart? Or perhaps you’re simply not positioning it correctly? C… H… P… D…
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your skepticism. However, the chart is properly calibrated and positioned. It's important to note that even slight changes in vision can be detected with this exam. It’s also possible there’s some strain contributing to your difficulty. Now, let's try the right eye. Cover your right eye, please. We’ll see how that compares.
PATIENT: Very well. Let us proceed with this… charade. C… P… T… V… D… H… Honestly, Doctor, this is… most peculiar. I distinctly recall being able to read far smaller letters than this. Are you certain you haven’t mixed up my chart with someone else’s? This is quite… disconcerting. F… P… C… L… I cannot decipher these letters. It's… simply impossible.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. That was helpful. Based on these results, it appears there is a noticeable difference in your visual acuity between your left and right eyes. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to check your peripheral vision and then dilate your pupils. This will allow me to examine the back of your eyes more thoroughly. Do you have any known allergies to eye drops?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve never had any allergies in my life. I’m a remarkably robust individual, you see. But I still maintain that this entire procedure is… unnecessary. And the thought of having my pupils dilated… frankly, it’s rather unpleasant. Very well. Proceed, if you must. But I trust you’ll be as gentle as possible. And I expect a full explanation of your findings afterward. A comprehensive explanation, mind you. I’m not one to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I assure you I will be as gentle as possible, and I will provide you with a comprehensive explanation of my findings. Now, I’m going to put one drop in each eye. It may sting slightly for a few seconds, and your vision will be blurry for a few hours. I will provide you with dark sunglasses to minimize light sensitivity. After the drops have dilated your pupils, I will use an ophthalmoscope to examine the back of your eyes. This won’t be painful, but it may be slightly uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Proceed with your… procedure. But be warned, Doctor, if I experience any undue discomfort, I will not hesitate to express my displeasure. Get on with it, then. And please be swift. I have… responsibilities, you see. And I'm not one to waste time. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’ve put one drop in each eye. It may sting slightly for a few seconds. Try to relax and keep your eyes closed. It will take about 15-20 minutes for your pupils to fully dilate. During this time, I'll review your medical history and ask you a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Stinging… yes, that’s quite unpleasant. Though I suppose it’s bearable. As for medications… no. I take no medications. I pride myself on my excellent health. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and a strong constitution, you see. That’s my secret. Now, what sort of questions do you intend to ask? Let’s get this over with, then. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other chronic medical condition?
PATIENT: Chronic medical conditions? Absolutely not! I've never had a day of illness in my life, Doctor. As I mentioned, a healthy lifestyle, a strong constitution... Diabetes? High blood pressure? Preposterous! I am the picture of health, a testament to good living. My family has always been remarkably robust. No, I assure you, I have no medical conditions of any sort. And please, let's not dwell on such… unpleasant topics. It's quite depressing, you know. Now, what's next? Is this procedure nearing completion? I have… commitments, you see. Important commitments.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any eye injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: Eye injuries? Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I’ve always been exceedingly careful. A prudent man, you see. I avoid risks of all kinds. I wouldn't dream of subjecting my eyes to any sort of trauma. They are far too valuable, you see. I need them for… important things. Now, are we nearing the end of this… interrogation? I have… responsibilities, you see. And my time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Just a few more questions. Do you have any family history of eye disease, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Family history of eye disease? Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea. My family is rather… distant. We don't keep in close contact. And I've never bothered to inquire about their… ailments. I'm far too busy with my own affairs to concern myself with the medical histories of distant relatives. Honestly, Doctor, is this procedure nearing completion? My pupils are starting to feel… strange. And I have… commitments, you see. Important commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Your pupils appear to be adequately dilated now. Okay. I’m going to look in each eye now. Try to focus on a fixed point in the distance.
PATIENT: A fixed point in the distance… yes, yes. Honestly, Doctor, this is rather… unsettling. Is this going to take much longer? My eyes are starting to feel… fatigued. And please, be gentle. I have… important things to see. Important things to do. Get on with it, then. But hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now the other eye. Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I've finished the examination. It's time to discuss my findings.
PATIENT: Finally. Discuss your findings, yes. Please do. I trust you've discovered something… conclusive. I haven't got all day, you know. And I'm quite particular about receiving a comprehensive explanation. No vague generalities, Doctor. I want specifics. And please, tell me straight. I’m a man of intellect, I can handle the truth. So, what have you discovered? Is it serious? And what, if anything, can be done about it? I have… commitments, you see. Important commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Based on my examination, I've identified some changes in your retinas. There's some evidence of drusen, which are small deposits under the retina. These are relatively common as we age, but they can be an early sign of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. I also noted some mild narrowing of the blood vessels in your retinas, which could be a sign of early hypertensive retinopathy. Now, these findings don't necessarily mean you have AMD or hypertensive retinopathy, but they indicate a need for further investigation and monitoring. I recommend a comprehensive retinal imaging study to get a clearer picture of your retinas, and I recommend you get your blood pressure checked. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Drusen? Narrowing of the blood vessels? AMD? Hypertensive retinopathy? Honestly, Doctor, this is rather unsettling. I pride myself on my excellent health. These findings are… unacceptable. Comprehensive retinal imaging? Blood pressure checks? Honestly, Doctor, are you certain you haven't made a mistake? I’ve always had excellent vision. And my blood pressure is perfectly normal. I assure you. What, precisely, does this “comprehensive retinal imaging” entail? And what, if anything, can be done about this… narrowing of the blood vessels? And will this affect my… commitments? Important commitments, you see. Now, please, explain this to me in simple terms. I'm a man of intellect, but I’m not a medical professional.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concern. Let me explain in simpler terms. Drusen are tiny deposits that form under the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer at the back of your eye. They are common as we age, and usually don't cause any immediate problems. However, they can be an early sign of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. AMD is a condition that affects central vision, making it difficult to see fine details. The narrowing of the blood vessels in your retinas could be a sign of early hypertensive retinopathy, which means that high blood pressure is affecting the blood vessels in your eyes. This is why I recommend getting your blood pressure checked. The “comprehensive retinal imaging” study is a painless procedure that uses special cameras to take detailed pictures of your retinas. This will allow me to get a clearer picture of the drusen and blood vessels, and determine if any treatment is needed. We can discuss treatment options after the imaging study, if necessary. In many cases, AMD and hypertensive retinopathy can be managed with lifestyle changes, such as diet, exercise, and medication, if needed. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Diet? Exercise? Honestly, Doctor, I lead a perfectly healthy lifestyle already. A discerning palate, regular walks, and a strong constitution, you see. And medication? Absolutely not. I refuse to subject my body to any unnecessary chemicals. So, this “comprehensive retinal imaging” study… where would I go for this? And how much will it cost? And will it interfere with my… commitments? Important commitments, you see. Now, please, tell me specifics. I’m a man who likes to be prepared. And I expect a detailed breakdown of all expenses. And a clear explanation of how this will affect my schedule. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… unsettling. And inconvenient. Extremely inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns about lifestyle changes and medication, and we can discuss those options further after the imaging study if necessary. We’ll explore all possible alternatives. The comprehensive retinal imaging can be done at the Rural Eye Care Center, located about 30 minutes from here. The cost of the study is approximately $250, and they do offer a payment plan if needed. I can provide you with their contact information and a referral form. As for your schedule, the study usually takes about an hour. They have appointments available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. It shouldn’t significantly interfere with your commitments, but you may want to avoid any strenuous activities afterward. I will also document that you are uninsured and explore any potential financial assistance programs that may be available. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you now, or would you prefer to contact the Rural Eye Care Center directly?
PATIENT: $250? Uninsured? Financial assistance programs? Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… burdensome. Very well. Schedule an appointment for me. Tuesday afternoon, if possible. But make sure it doesn't conflict with my… commitments. Important commitments, you see. And please, ensure the Rural Eye Care Center is aware of my… particular needs. I expect a discreet and professional environment. Now, please, expedite this process. I haven’t got all day. And I expect a confirmation email with all the necessary details. Including a clear explanation of what I should expect during the study. And a detailed breakdown of all expenses. And a guarantee of confidentiality. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… unsettling. And inconvenient. Extremely inconvenient. Stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I've scheduled you an appointment for Tuesday at 2:00 PM at the Rural Eye Care Center. I’ve also sent them a referral with your concerns regarding confidentiality and your need for a discreet environment. I’ve sent a confirmation email with all the necessary details, including a clear explanation of what to expect during the study, a detailed breakdown of all expenses, and a guarantee of confidentiality. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That will be all. Thank you. I trust this entire process will be as… painless as possible. And I expect a thorough explanation of the results. Do not withhold any information. I am a man of intellect, I can handle the truth. Stop.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will ensure you receive a thorough explanation of the results, and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointment. Have a good day. Stop.
