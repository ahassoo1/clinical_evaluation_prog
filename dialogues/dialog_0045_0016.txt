DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my… about a patient of yours, actually. Old Mrs. Gable. She’s been bruising like a peach lately, and she's on that blood thinner, you know, the one for her heart. It just seems… excessive. I saw her yesterday, and frankly, it’s concerning.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Gable, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Mrs. Gable. Look, I’m a pathologist, I deal with the why of things, and this feels like a ‘why’ you should be looking into. She’s a sweet woman, and all this… discoloration isn’t right. She mentioned she’s been seeing you regularly for check-ups, so I assumed you were monitoring her levels.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Gable, Margaret… Yes, here we are. Regular visits, as you said. And she is on warfarin. Honestly, it’s not uncommon for patients on blood thinners to bruise easily. Have you examined her, or are you just going off of observation?
PATIENT: Observe? Good heavens, man, I'm a doctor! Of course, I examined her. I took a full history, did a physical assessment… the whole nine yards. It’s not just a casual observation! I was hoping you had checked her INR recently, or maybe ordered some blood work? Because frankly, I'm not comfortable adjusting her medication without knowing what you think is going on. I don’t just go around changing dosages willy-nilly, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, no need to get defensive, Doctor. I assure you, I'm perfectly capable. I did check her INR last week. It was within the therapeutic range, 2.1. And a basic CBC showed no obvious abnormalities. Frankly, it sounds like you’re overreacting. Sometimes elderly patients just bruise more easily. Skin gets thinner with age, you know. She did mention a small fall last month, but she didn’t seem too concerned about it.
PATIENT: A small fall? She didn't mention a fall to me. And 2.1 is… acceptable, yes, but it’s still on the lower end of therapeutic, isn’t it? Meaning she’s more prone to bruising, even with a minor bump. Look, I’m not questioning your competence, I’m just saying that relying solely on a single CBC and a barely-in-range INR isn’t enough, especially with an elderly patient on warfarin! Perhaps she’s not being entirely forthcoming about other incidents? Or maybe there’s something else going on that’s being overlooked. I'm just saying, a little more diligence wouldn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Look, I have a full waiting room, Doctor. I can order a more comprehensive coagulation panel. But honestly, I suspect you’re going to find nothing. And I’m not spending an hour chasing shadows because you’re…concerned. I'll put in the order now. It’ll take a few days to get the results. In the meantime, tell Mrs. Gable to be careful. And if she has another fall, have her come in immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: “Be careful”? That’s your advice? Honestly. Fine. Order the panel. Though I highly doubt it will reveal anything you haven’t already missed. And I will advise Mrs. Gable to come in if she experiences any further trauma. But frankly, I’m beginning to suspect this isn’t a matter of simply ‘being careful’. There's something more going on here, and I intend to find it. This isn’t about chasing shadows, it’s about providing proper care. But you do what you think is best. I’ll be in touch once I’ve spoken with Mrs. Gable again.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, do that. Have a good day, Doctor. And try not to worry so much. Some patients just…bruise. .
PATIENT: .
