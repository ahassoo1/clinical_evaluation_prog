DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…fine, I suppose. Listen, it’s not a problem problem, really. More of a…well, my daughter says I should come get a card. A “get well” card, or an “encouragement” card, she called it. I’m perfectly fine, you know. Just a bit…down, maybe? She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your daughter is quite concerned about your well-being, which is very thoughtful of her. While it may not feel like a traditional “illness,” feeling “down” or experiencing a change in your usual mood is certainly something we can discuss. It's important to address these feelings, regardless of whether they are accompanied by physical symptoms. To get a better understanding of what’s been going on, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by “down”?
PATIENT: Oh, she always makes a big deal out of nothing. It's just…life, Doctor. Things aren't good, alright? Not terrible, not bad, just…blah. My son-in-law lost his job, my nephew is being…difficult, and the price of lentils went up again! It's all just…too much, sometimes. I don't need a card to fix it, you know. I just…needed to tell someone, I guess, so my daughter would stop nagging.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been carrying quite a bit of stress lately with several things weighing on your mind. Losing a job, family difficulties, and even seemingly small things like rising prices can certainly add up and feel overwhelming. It’s very common to feel “down” when facing multiple stressors. And it's perfectly alright to want to share these burdens with someone, and it's good you came in to talk. Sometimes just voicing these concerns can be helpful. To help me get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me, Doctor. I'm not weak. It’s just…a few weeks, maybe? Since everything started happening. It’s not like I’m lying in bed all day crying, you know. I still cook, I still clean, I still manage everything. I just…don’t have much energy for things, I suppose. And I snap at my husband more easily. He doesn’t understand, naturally. He just wants me to “think positive”. Honestly, it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Please forgive me if I came across that way, Ms. Micucci. That was certainly not my intention. I apologize. It's not about strength or weakness; it’s about recognizing when things aren’t quite right and seeking support. And I understand that “thinking positive” isn’t always helpful, especially when dealing with real-life challenges. You mentioned snapping at your husband and having less energy. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to love cooking, but now… it’s just a chore. And I'm not sleeping as well. I wake up several times a night, thinking about everything that needs to be done. My daughter keeps saying I look “tired”, which is…obvious, frankly. She's always noticing things. I used to enjoy my garden, but I haven’t even been out there in weeks. It's all just…too much effort.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Micucci. So, to summarise, you've been feeling down for a few weeks, with decreased appetite, disrupted sleep, a loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy – like gardening – and you've noticed you tire more easily. Your daughter has also observed a change in your appearance. These are all things we should explore further. Now, have you experienced any significant changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’ve lost a few kilos, I think. Not much, but my clothes feel looser. I haven’t bothered weighing myself properly, but my daughter commented on it. She's always pointing things out. Honestly, she’s starting to sound like her father. A worrier, that one. Always fussing over everything. It’s probably just the stress, honestly. I just need everything to calm down.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Micucci. Losing weight, along with the other symptoms you’ve described, is something we need to take seriously. While it could very well be related to stress, it's important to rule out any other potential causes. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history? I don’t even remember. I’ve never been a sickly person, honestly. A few colds, a bad flu once when I was young… nothing serious. My mother had…arthritis, I think? And my father… he just got old, you know? Nothing dramatic. I don't go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. It's all such a waste of time and money, frankly. I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, decades, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Ms. Micucci. It's helpful to know. So, it sounds like you haven't had any major medical issues in the past, and you haven't had a recent check-up. Knowing your family history is also helpful; your mother had arthritis, and your father passed away due to old age. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t believe in all those pills. My husband takes something for his blood pressure, but I don't touch that stuff. I prefer natural remedies, honestly. A bit of ginger for my stomach, maybe some turmeric in my cooking… that’s about it. I don’t like putting chemicals into my body unless absolutely necessary. And I certainly don’t need a doctor telling me what to take.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Micucci. It's good to know you prefer natural remedies and don’t currently take any medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I eat everything. I've never had a problem with allergies, thankfully. My daughter always worries about that too, “Are you sure you’re not allergic to peanuts?” Honestly, it’s ridiculous. I've been eating peanuts my whole life. I live a very simple life, Doctor. Nothing fancy, nothing dangerous.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Micucci. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it. And recreational drugs? Don't be ridiculous, Doctor! I'm a respectable woman. I don't partake in such things. My husband might have a beer now and then, but I certainly don't.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Micucci. That's helpful to know. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social situation?
PATIENT: Oh, well... I live with my husband, of course. We've been married for... goodness, over forty years now. Our children are grown up and have their own families. We see them regularly, but they live a bit of a distance away. I have a few friends in the neighbourhood, but we don't see each other as much these days. Everyone is so busy, you know? It's mostly just me and my husband these days. He spends most of his time watching television, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Micucci. I appreciate your honesty. Now, based on what you’ve told me – feeling down for several weeks, decreased appetite, disrupted sleep, loss of interest in activities, weight loss, and a generally feeling of being overwhelmed – I think it’s important to explore this further. While it could be related to stress, the symptoms you're experiencing could also indicate a number of other possibilities. To help rule those out, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination and order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests? A physical examination? Honestly, Doctor, I told you, it's just life! I don't need poking and prodding. I haven't been sick a day in my life. But… my daughter will be so relieved if I do it. She's been nagging me about this for weeks. Fine. Fine, do your tests. Just… be quick about it, alright? And don’t tell me everything is wrong with me, I don’t want to hear it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Micucci. I understand your reluctance, and I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. And I assure you, I will only share the information that is relevant and helpful. First, let's start with the physical examination. I'll simply listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then, we’ll just need a small sample of blood for some routine tests. If you don’t mind, please sit back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a child being examined by her mother. But… alright. Just get it over with. And don't tell me anything I don't need to know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Micucci. I'll keep things as brief and comfortable as possible. Take a deep breath for me, please… and again… Good. Your lungs sound clear. Your heart rate is regular, and there are no murmurs or unusual sounds. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 85. This isn’t necessarily a cause for immediate concern, but it's something we'll want to monitor. Your ears and nose look clear. Your throat is a little dry, but there’s no sign of infection. Everything looks within normal limits, Ms. Micucci. Now, we’ll just need a small blood sample. I’ll call the nurse in to draw it for me. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: A needle? Honestly, Doctor. I haven’t had blood drawn since… well, I don’t even remember. Just… be quick about it. And don't poke me too much. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t tell me it’s going to hurt, I already know it will. Honestly, this is all so unnecessary. But… alright. Get it over with. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Micucci. I assure you, the nurse is very skilled and gentle. I'll be right here with you the entire time. The nurse will be in shortly with the necessary supplies. We’ll just take a small sample of blood to check your basic blood count, thyroid function, vitamin levels, and some other routine markers. This will help us get a better understanding of what’s going on and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Just try to relax, Ms. Micucci. You're doing a good thing by getting this checked out. And remember, I'll be right here with you. It will be over before you know it.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with quickly, alright? And don’t tell me to relax, it’s not helping. Honestly, I wish I hadn't come. My daughter will be so pleased with herself, dragging me here like this. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Nurse Anya. Could you please draw Ms. Micucci’s blood?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Here she comes. Just… be quick, alright? And don't poke around too much. I really don’t like needles. Honestly, I wish I hadn't come. This is all so unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. My name is Anya, and I'll be taking your blood sample today. I know needles can be a bit unsettling, but I'll be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by cleaning the area on your arm with an antiseptic wipe. This might feel a little cold. Okay, now you might feel a slight pinch. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Almost done… just a little bit more… All finished! You did a wonderful job. Just keep gentle pressure on this area for a few minutes to prevent any bruising. Here you are, Doctor.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… awful. Absolutely awful. Are you sure you got enough? And are you sure you didn’t poke around too much? My arm feels… strange. Honestly, I think I need to lie down. Just… go. I need a moment. And bring me a glass of water, please. A big glass. Honestly, I think I’m going to faint.
DOCTOR: You did very well, Ms. Micucci. It's perfectly normal to feel a little shaken after having blood drawn. Nurse Anya, could you please bring Ms. Micucci a large glass of water and a comfortable chair?
PATIENT: Water, please. Lots of water. And a chair. I don’t think I can stand up. Honestly, I think my daughter is trying to kill me. Dragging me here for… for nothing. Just… leave me alone for a moment. I need to gather my strength. Honestly, this has been a terrible experience. A terrible experience, indeed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Micucci. I’ll give you a few minutes to rest. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. We’ll have the blood work results back within a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to relax and take it easy.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… let me know when the results are back. And don’t call me with bad news. Honestly, I don’t want to hear it. Just… tell my daughter. She’s the one who wanted this, after all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Micucci. I will inform your daughter of the results. If anything concerning is found, I will be sure to contact her directly. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. We will do our best to get this all sorted out, Ms. Micucci. And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… wake me up when it’s time to go. Honestly, I just want to go home and lie down. This has been a terrible day. A terrible, terrible day.
DOCTOR: .
