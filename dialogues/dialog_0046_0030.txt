DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit… embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor lately. It's not… normal for me, and it's making me a little self-conscious. I lay floors all day, you know? It's physical work, and I don’t want to… smell bad while I’m doing it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be concerned about changes in your body, and it's good you brought it up. It’s not embarrassing at all; we address these kinds of issues frequently. It’s helpful that you mentioned your occupation as well – that's good information. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the change in odor?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Well, it's not just… sweaty, if that makes sense. I always sweat, being a floor layer, but this is… different. It’s sort of… stronger, and a little… sour, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It's not like I haven’t showered, either. I shower every day, sometimes twice, especially after work. But the smell still seems to… linger. It’s mostly noticeable in my armpits, I think, but I worry it’s… everywhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, “stronger” and “sour,” and lingering even with regular showering. That’s helpful. And it's primarily in your armpits, but you're concerned it may be more widespread. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about how long you've noticed this change?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started… probably about a month ago, maybe a little longer. It was gradual, at first. I thought maybe it was just the heat, you know? It’s been pretty warm this summer. But it hasn’t gone away, even when it’s cooler. And like I said, I'm usually pretty good at keeping clean. It's been a consistent thing for at least four weeks now, I’d say. Definitely a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately one month, consistent, and not related to weather. That helps narrow things down. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this odor?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes? Let me see… Not really, I don’t think. My energy levels are the same, maybe a little tired after work, but that’s normal. No fever, no rashes, no new bumps or anything. My appetite is okay. I haven’t lost or gained any weight. Oh! Wait a minute. Now that you mention it… I have been feeling a little more… anxious lately. Just general worry, you know? Work has been a little slow, and I'm a single mom, so that stresses me out. But I wouldn’t say it’s anything major. Just… more on my mind than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, rash, weight changes. Increased anxiety, related to work stress – that's good to know. Sometimes anxiety can manifest in physical ways. Before we move on to a physical exam, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have… high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that… not much. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No allergies that I know of. I'm on Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. They haven't said anything about anything else being wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, managed hypertension with lisinopril 20mg daily, and a cholecystectomy ten years ago. No known allergies. That's helpful information. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, nothing else regularly. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains after work, but that’s just as needed. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. And… oh! Sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I've been pretty bad about remembering to take it lately. It’s been sitting on the counter for weeks. So, no, really just the blood pressure medication and the occasional ibuprofen. Nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin sporadically. Good. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had heart problems later in life. My father… he had high blood pressure too, like me. And my grandmother on my mother's side… she had arthritis, really bad. Other than that… not that I know of. Nobody really talked much about health problems when I was growing up. It wasn't really something we discussed. So, diabetes, high blood pressure, and arthritis… that’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. That’s good to know. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Okay… I’m divorced, been on my own for about ten years now. I have one son, he’s grown up and living on his own. I don’t smoke, never have. I don’t drink alcohol very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. I don’t do any drugs. As I mentioned, I'm a floor layer, so I'm pretty active during the day. I live in a house with a small garden. I like to read when I have time. Pretty quiet life, really. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, divorced, one adult son, no smoking or drug use, occasional alcohol, active occupation, and a quiet lifestyle. That gives me a good overview. Now, Ms. Purtee, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’ve been experiencing a change in body odor for about a month, which isn't related to weather or hygiene. It's accompanied by some anxiety, and you have a history of managed hypertension, a cholecystectomy, and a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Absolutely. I just want to figure out what’s going on, so whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your skin, particularly in the areas where you’ve noticed the odor. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply through your mouth. Your heart sounds regular, rate is 72 and rhythm is normal. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I’m not seeing any rash or obvious skin abnormalities. I do notice some mild hyperpigmentation in your armpits, which is common, but nothing concerning at this time. I'm going to gently palpate your lymph nodes in your armpits and neck. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Based on the exam, there's no immediately obvious cause for the change in odor. Given your symptoms and history, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is hyperhidrosis, which is excessive sweating, although it doesn't fully explain the odor you're describing. Another possibility is a change in your body's microbiome, or the balance of bacteria on your skin. And finally, sometimes anxiety can contribute to body odor.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a lot of information. Hyper-what-sis? And micro-biome? I'm not really a medical person, Doctor. What does all that mean? And what do we do about it? I'm just worried something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask for clarification, and I apologize if I used too much medical jargon. It’s my job to explain things clearly. “Hyperhidrosis” simply means excessive sweating. It’s fairly common and can sometimes cause body odor. “Microbiome” refers to the community of bacteria that live on our skin. This community plays a role in our health, and sometimes changes in this balance can lead to body odor. Given your symptoms, I’d like to order a few lab tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, I want to check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes, and I want to do a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection. I also want to do a thyroid function test, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause changes in body odor. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. That sounds… thorough. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. I’m happy to get some tests done. Where do I go to get them done? And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. This is really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here is a lab requisition form. You can go to any LabCorp location – they are widely available. I’ve already indicated the tests I want performed. It typically takes 2-3 business days for the results to come back. The lab will likely have a website where you can view them online as well. In the meantime, I recommend practicing good hygiene – shower daily with antibacterial soap, and wear loose-fitting clothing made of breathable fabrics like cotton. You can also try using an antiperspirant with aluminum chloride, which can help reduce sweating. I’m also going to prescribe a mild topical antibiotic cream to apply to your armpits twice daily for one week. This may help restore the balance of bacteria on your skin. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. If the results are normal, we can explore other potential causes, such as stress or anxiety. We could consider a referral to a dermatologist or a therapist if needed. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better, just knowing we’re doing something. I will definitely go get the tests done and pick up the prescription. Should I call the office if I don’t hear anything after a few business days? And… what if the tests do show something is wrong? I’m getting a little nervous, thinking about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I understand your nervousness, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're waiting for test results. Yes, please call the office after 3 business days if you haven't heard anything. Our number is 555-1212. If the tests do show something is wrong, we will call you immediately to discuss the results and schedule a follow-up appointment. We will go over all your options and develop a treatment plan together. I will explain everything in detail and answer any questions you have. Here's a summary of our plan, including the lab tests, the prescription, and the phone number to call if you have any questions. I also want to emphasize that many things can cause changes in body odor, and it's often not a sign of a serious medical condition. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Glowka. You’ve been very helpful and patient with me. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day.
