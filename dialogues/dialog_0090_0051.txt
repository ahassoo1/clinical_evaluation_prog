DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Kur, was it? Yes, well, it’s a bit silly, really. My daughter – lovely girl, always fussing over me – she said I ought to know my blood type. Just… in case. I don’t rightly remember ever having it checked. Is that something you can do here?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s not exactly silly, Ms. Nini, though it’s not a common request. Knowing your blood type can be useful information. Yes, we can certainly do that here. It's a simple blood draw. But while we’re at it, is there anything else at all bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A blood draw... I don’t love needles, but if it’s quick… No, no, nothing else. Just the blood type, dear. I feel alright, mostly. A little creaky in the mornings, you know how it is at my age. But nothing a bit of stretching doesn’t fix. My daughter worries too much, I think. She keeps saying I need to be “prepared.” Prepared for what, I don’t even know!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “prepared” is always sensible, I suppose. Though focusing solely on blood type when you’re otherwise feeling well… it’s not always the most efficient use of medical resources, if you don’t mind my saying so. Still, we can do the blood draw. Before we proceed, let's just go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions – heart problems, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medical history… Now there’s a thing. Let me think… I had a bad bout of the flu, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Kept me in bed for a week, it did. And… my hips ache, like I said. But serious conditions? Not that I recall. The doctor back in Spain, he always said I was a strong girl. And then when we moved here… well, it’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. My husband, bless his soul, he always handled the doctor’s visits. He was very organized. Did I mention I’m a widow?
DOCTOR: Yes, you did. I’m sorry for your loss, Ms. Nini. It’s understandable that things might be a little hazy. Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. It was… a long time ago now. Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, I think. And… oh! Yes, a small lump removed from my breast, back in Spain. A very small thing, the doctor said it was nothing to worry about. That must have been… forty years ago? Something like that. They didn't do much back then, you know. It wasn't like it is now. I hope that wasn't a silly thing to mention.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly at all to mention anything, Ms. Nini. In fact, it’s very important. Knowing about the breast lump, even if it was a long time ago, is helpful. Do you recall if you had any follow-up care after the removal?
PATIENT: Follow-up care… oh dear. That's where my memory really fails me. I… I think I went back for a check-up, maybe once or twice. But it was so long ago, and everything was different then. The doctor spoke very little English, and I spoke even less Spanish at the time! My husband handled all the details, like always. He made sure I understood everything. I don't recall any specific treatments or anything like that. It was just... removed, and then we moved on. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Nini. You’ve told me what you remember, and that’s what’s important. Moving on, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Let me think. Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. It's called… oh dear, the name escapes me! A small white pill, I think. My daughter orders it for me. And sometimes, if I’m really stiff, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind, you know? Nothing fancy. Mostly, I try to just keep moving and stretch things out. That’s what my mother always said. She lived to be ninety-five, you know. A very strong woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I eat pretty much everything. My daughter always worries about shellfish, she says a lot of people have allergies, but I’ve always been fine. I used to love paella, you know, with all the seafood in it. Perhaps a little too much wine with it sometimes, but never an allergy! No, I don't think I have any allergies, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions, then we can proceed with the blood draw. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked a little, when we first met, but I always told him I didn't like the smell. He gave it up eventually, thankfully. Bad for the lungs, you know. No, I've never smoked. A good, clean life, that's what I've always tried to live. Well, except for the paella and wine, perhaps!
DOCTOR: And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… a little wine with dinner, sometimes. Especially with paella! It's part of the Spanish culture, you know? Nothing excessive, just a glass or two. My daughter tells me I should cut back, but a little wine never hurt anyone. Perhaps she's right, but it's such a nice habit. I’d say… one or two glasses most evenings. Nothing more. And sometimes none at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any family history of serious illnesses – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… now there’s a thing. Let me think… My mother lived to be ninety-five, as I said, very strong, but she had… something with her heart, towards the end. I don't recall the details. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had diabetes, I think. But other than that… not that I recall. We didn’t talk much about illnesses, back then. It wasn't considered polite, I think. I wish I could be more helpful, dear, but my memory… it's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. That was very helpful. So, to summarize, you’re here today because your daughter suggested you find out your blood type. You have a history of tonsillectomy and a small breast lump removed forty years ago, you take medication for arthritis and ibuprofen as needed, you have no known allergies, you drink one or two glasses of wine most evenings, and you have a family history of heart condition and diabetes. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right, dear. Yes, you've got it all. It’s funny how you can put it all so neatly together, isn’t it? My head is just a bit of a muddle these days. Now, about this blood draw… is it going to be very painful? And how long will it take? I have a bridge game with the ladies this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be very painful at all, Ms. Nini. Just a quick prick. It will only take a few minutes to draw the blood, and then we'll need to send it off to the lab. Results usually take a couple of days. You should be able to go straight to your bridge game afterwards, no problem. Would you like me to explain the procedure to you?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's a relief! A couple of days is fine. Yes, please do explain it, dear. I always feel better when I know what to expect. It’s silly, I suppose, at my age, but… needles always make me a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A phlebotomist – that’s the person who draws the blood – will clean the inside of your elbow with an alcohol swab. Then, they'll tie a small tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins easier to find. They'll insert a needle into a vein, and collect a small sample of blood into a tube. Once they have enough blood, they’ll remove the needle and apply pressure to the site with a cotton ball or gauze pad to stop the bleeding. You’ll need to keep pressure on it for a few minutes afterwards. It’s very straightforward. We'll use a sterile needle, of course. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad. Sterile needle, that’s good to know. Will it… will it hurt a lot afterwards? Like, will I be sore for the rest of the day? Because I really don't want to miss my bridge game! And will it bruise? I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you shouldn’t be sore for the rest of the day, Ms. Nini. There might be a little tenderness or discomfort for a few minutes afterwards, but it usually goes away very quickly. And bruising is possible, especially since you say you bruise easily, but we'll be very careful. The phlebotomist will apply pressure for a sufficient amount of time to minimize the risk. If you do bruise, it's usually minor and fades within a few days. We can also provide a bandage to protect the site. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers everything, dear. Alright then. Let’s get it over with. Just be gentle, please. And let me know when you’re about to poke me. I don’t like surprises!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nini. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I will definitely let you know when I’m about to insert the needle. I’ll call the phlebotomist in right away. Just relax, and we’ll be finished in no time. “Maria, could you please come in and draw a blood sample from Ms. Nini?
