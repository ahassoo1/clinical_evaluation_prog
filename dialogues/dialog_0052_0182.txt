DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's about this surgery. My daughter… she insisted I come. Says I need a "clearance." Honestly, seems like a waste of a perfectly good morning, but here I am. It's for… well, a little touch-up. A face lift. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Orwin. It's perfectly reasonable for your daughter to want you to be fully evaluated before any procedure, and I’m happy to help ensure you’re in the best possible health for it. A pre-operative evaluation is quite standard. To start, could you tell me a bit more about why you decided to have the face lift?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's just… sagging. Everything's going south. Not a good look, you understand. A man has to maintain some dignity. It's not like I want to look foolish. And my daughter keeps saying I look "tired." Tired! I’ve been working with terrazzo my whole life, of course I look a little worn. It's honest work. Doesn't mean I need to be told I look like something the cat dragged in. So, I'm getting it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Orwin. It's perfectly valid to want to feel your best and maintain your appearance. And it sounds like this is something you've thought about carefully. To help me with the pre-operative evaluation, I'd like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, fine, fine. Get it over with. Just don't expect me to remember every little thing. I'm 81, you know. It’s not like my brain is a steel trap anymore. Ask away. But if it’s about my knees, don’t bother. They ache, what do you want me to say?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. I’ll do my best to be thorough and efficient. And we certainly don’t need to dwell on things you’ve already described. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. Doctor put me on a pill for a while. Stopped taking it, felt better without it. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart… a flutter, they called it. But it sorted itself out. Nothing major. Mostly just aches and pains from the work, you know? Terrazzo is hard on the body. Are we done yet? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Orwin. It's helpful to know about the history of high blood pressure and the heart flutter. Just to clarify, when were you diagnosed with the high blood pressure, roughly, and do you recall the name of the medication you were prescribed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years ago… maybe fifteen, twenty years? Something like that. Small white pills… I don’t know the name, honestly. Does it matter? I haven’t taken them in ages. I told you, I felt better off them. This is ridiculous. I’m a perfectly healthy man for my age, you know. I still work, don't I? Terrazzo doesn't exactly build itself.
DOCTOR: You are right to point out that you're still working, Mr. Orwin – that is a good indicator of your overall health. And I appreciate your patience. It is important for me to gather as much information as possible to ensure your safety during the surgery. Since you recall stopping the medication, do you remember if your doctor discussed any potential risks associated with discontinuing it?
PATIENT: Risks? No. He just told me to take the pills. Never said anything about risks. Doctors these days… always looking for something wrong. I felt perfectly fine without them. Better, even. And frankly, I don't recall every little detail of a conversation from twenty years ago. Are you a detective or something? This is a waste of my time. Just tell me if I can have the surgery or not.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. You're right, it was a long time ago and it's not reasonable to expect you to recall every detail. However, it's still important for me to assess any potential risks, even those from the past. Let's move on, then. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Appendicitis, when I was a boy. And… oh, I had a hernia fixed years ago. Something to do with the terrazzo, I imagine. Heavy lifting. That’s about it. Small things. Nothing like a face lift. Honestly, I’ve had more broken bones from falls than actual surgeries. Are we almost finished? My daughter will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. Appendectomy and hernia repair. Good to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. The arthritis, you know. Ibuprofen, sometimes. When they’re really bad. And I take a multivitamin, every day. Keeps me regular. That’s it. Nothing fancy. Don't go looking for a whole list, there isn't one. Honestly, I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. They make me feel sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and a daily multivitamin. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. I've worked with all sorts of materials over the years. If I had an allergy, I’d know about it. Dust, maybe, from the terrazzo, but that’s not an allergy. It just makes me sneeze. Are we done yet? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, and just occasional sneezing from dust. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – for example, heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history? Goodness. My father… he died of something. Old age, I think. My mother… she had weak knees, like me. And my sister, she had cancer. Lung cancer. Smoked like a chimney, she did. That's about all I remember. We weren’t a family that talked about illnesses. Mostly just worked hard and kept to ourselves. Can we please wrap this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. History of lung cancer in your sister and weak knees in your mother. I understand that family medical history isn’t always readily available, and that’s perfectly alright. Now, I'm going to ask about some lifestyle factors. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! I've never touched a cigarette in my life. Waste of money, and terrible for your lungs. My sister was the smoker, as I told you. I always thought it was a foolish habit. Honestly, I find it rather appalling. Can we move on? This is getting ridiculous. I'm a healthy man, I tell you!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Orwin. Never smoked. And good for you for avoiding that habit. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. A glass of aquavit with dinner, sometimes. Mostly on special occasions. Nothing excessive. I’m a Norwegian, you know. A little aquavit is good for digestion. It keeps you warm in the winter. But I don’t sit around drinking all day, if that’s what you’re asking. A sensible drink now and then. That’s it. Are we finally getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Orwin. Social drinking, a glass of aquavit with dinner. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your activity level?
PATIENT: Activity level? I work! I work with terrazzo. It's hard physical labor, you know. Lifting, bending, grinding… I'm on my feet all day. It’s not like I’m sitting in a chair knitting or something. I may be 81, but I’m still a working man. Does that answer your question? It should. Honestly, I’m more active than most people half my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, that answers the question perfectly, Mr. Orwin. You are very active with your work. That's excellent. Now, before I proceed with a physical examination, I just want to confirm: do you have any specific concerns or questions you’d like to discuss before we move forward?
PATIENT: No. Just tell me if I can have the surgery or not. That’s all I want to know. I don’t have time for endless questions and poking and prodding. My daughter is the one who insisted on this whole thing, and frankly, I'm starting to regret letting her talk me into it. Just give me a straight answer, doctor. Can I have the surgery, or can’t I? That’s all that matters. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your frustration. Before I can give you a definitive answer, I do need to perform a brief physical examination to assess your overall health and ensure you are a suitable candidate for surgery. This will include checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining the surgical site. It shouldn't take long. Would that be acceptable?
