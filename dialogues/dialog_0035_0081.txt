DOCTOR: Hi Jailia, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. I am here because I am… dissatisfied with my current weight. And increasingly, I find myself quite fatigued, despite adequate rest, and I have been experiencing… unpleasant night sweats. It is rather disruptive, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Dissatisfied with your weight, fatigue even with enough rest, and night sweats. Those are definitely things we should look into. Let’s start with the weight. How long have you been feeling dissatisfied with your weight, and has there been any recent change in weight – either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have always maintained a certain standard of appearance. I suppose dissatisfaction is a rather… mild term. It has been ongoing for approximately six months, but has worsened in the last two. As for changes… I would estimate a loss of perhaps two kilograms in the past month, which is entirely unwelcome. I am quite meticulous about my diet and exercise, and this is… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Two kilograms in a month despite consistent diet and exercise – that is concerning. Okay. And you said you've been meticulous about your diet and exercise… can you tell me a little more about what a typical day looks like for you in terms of what you eat and how much you exercise?
PATIENT: Certainly. I begin my day with a protein shake—whey isolate, naturally—and a small portion of oats. Lunch is usually grilled fish—salmon, predominantly—with a side of steamed vegetables. Dinner is similarly lean protein—chicken breast, perhaps—and a modest serving of brown rice. I avoid sugars and processed foods entirely. As for exercise, I engage in a rigorous routine six days a week. This includes one hour of weightlifting, followed by thirty minutes of cardiovascular exercise—usually running or cycling—at a high intensity. I assure you, Doctor, I do not neglect my physical well-being. It’s… quite disciplined, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a very disciplined routine and a very healthy diet. So, no changes to your diet or exercise in the last six months, other than the weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely none. I maintain a rather… strict adherence to my schedule. Any deviation would be… counterproductive. I find consistency is paramount, naturally. It's difficult to fathom why my weight is decreasing when I am making such diligent efforts. It is quite frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about those night sweats. How often are they happening?
PATIENT: They are becoming… increasingly frequent, Doctor. Initially, it was perhaps once or twice a week. Now, it is almost every night. I wake up quite drenched, and it is… most unpleasant. It disrupts my sleep, naturally, and impacts my overall energy levels. I do not understand what is causing it. It is not as if I am engaging in any strenuous activity before retiring for the evening.
DOCTOR: Okay, almost every night. And do you have any other symptoms along with the night sweats and weight loss?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There is a… persistent feeling of being chilled, despite the night sweats. It is a rather odd combination, I assure you. Also, I have noticed an increased… sensitivity to cold temperatures, and a slight, but noticeable, decrease in my appetite, although I maintain my dietary regime regardless. It is… unsettling. I do not typically succumb to such physical discomforts.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills, increased cold sensitivity, and a decreased appetite alongside the weight loss and night sweats. Have you had any fever, cough, or any body aches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not experienced any fever, cough, or body aches. I assure you, my health is typically… quite robust. I rarely fall ill. It is precisely why this situation is so perplexing. I do not understand why my body is behaving in this… aberrant manner. It's... quite inconvenient, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swollen lymph nodes - in your neck, armpits, or groin?
PATIENT: Lymph nodes, Doctor? I… believe I have examined myself on occasion, but I have not detected any… irregularities. However, to be entirely precise, I do not routinely perform such examinations. I suppose I am not trained in… self-diagnosis. But to the best of my knowledge, no. There has been no noticeable swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… perfectly acceptable. Although I trust my own observations are quite accurate, a professional examination is, of course, advisable. Do proceed. I shall endeavour to remain… still. I am quite particular about maintaining proper posture, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out… Sounds normal so far. No wheezing, no crackles. Now, I’m just checking your lymph nodes... hmm… they feel slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. And your abdomen feels normal, no tenderness. Your temperature is 98.2 Fahrenheit. Let me check your pulse and blood pressure… Pulse is 68, blood pressure is 118 over 76. Okay. Everything seems relatively normal on initial exam, but those slightly enlarged lymph nodes and your symptoms—the weight loss, night sweats, chills—warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel—just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, Doctor? Yes, that is… logical. If it assists in determining the cause of this… disconcerting situation, I have no objections. A thorough investigation is… paramount. I trust your assessment, naturally. Please proceed with the necessary tests. I do hope it does not prove to be… overly time-consuming. I have a rather… full schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll get the lab orders sent over to the front desk. They’ll draw the blood here in the clinic, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, if you develop any fever, severe fatigue, or any new symptoms, please call the clinic immediately. We want to rule out anything serious. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall ensure I remain attentive to any changes in my condition. A prompt response to any new developments is… prudent. No, I believe that is all for the present moment. Thank you for your… thorough assessment. I trust the results will provide some clarity. I shall await your findings with… anticipation.
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. I’ll have the nurse print out some instructions on what to expect after the blood draw and how to access the results online. Again, don't hesitate to call if anything changes. It was nice meeting you, Jailia. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
