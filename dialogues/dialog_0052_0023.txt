DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. Nice to meet you too. Uh... well, my chest... it hurts. Not all the time, but it does hurt. It’s… in my chest. Like, where a woman’s… you know… breasts are. It’s strange, ‘cause I’m a man.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chest pain is certainly concerning, and it's good you're addressing it. You mentioned it's not constant, and it’s located in the pectoral region… where a woman would have breast tissue. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm... how to describe it… It’s not a sharp pain. More like… a heavy ache. Sometimes it feels like a bruise, even though I don't think I hurt it. And it’s not just one spot. It’s kinda spread out. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the words for things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Bulaong. A heavy ache that’s somewhat diffuse – spread out – rather than pinpointed. And you haven’t experienced any trauma to the area?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. I work on roofs, so sometimes I bump into things… but nothing hard. It doesn't feel like a bump pain. More like… inside pain. Like my muscles are tired, but deep down. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no specific injury you recall, and it feels more internal, like a deep muscle ache. When did you first notice this pain?
PATIENT: Uh... let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? A little over a month. It was just a little bit at first, so I didn’t think much of it. Just figured I worked too hard. But it’s been getting worse the last week or so. That’s why I came in.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset, beginning about a month ago and worsening over the last week. That’s helpful information. Has anything specific made it worse – certain movements, activities, or times of day?
PATIENT: Hmm... it feels worse at the end of the day, after working on the roof. When I lay down to sleep, it's really noticeable. And… I don’t know if this matters… but sometimes it feels a little bit… sensitive. Like, if I press on it, it hurts a little. Not a lot, but a little.
DOCTOR: That is pertinent information, Mr. Bulaong. Pain exacerbated by activity and lying down, and tenderness to the touch. Do you experience any pain radiating to your arm, neck, or jaw?
PATIENT: No, no pain anywhere else. Just in my chest. Not in my arms, not in my neck, not in my jaw. Just right… here. . And it doesn't feel like a muscle pain, really. It's… different.
DOCTOR: Okay. Localized chest pain, not radiating, and distinct from typical musculoskeletal discomfort. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, palpitations, or swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I can breathe fine. My heart feels normal, I think. I haven’t noticed any swelling in my legs, no. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I just work hard.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Have you had any fevers, chills, or recent weight loss?
PATIENT: No fevers, no chills. And I haven’t lost any weight, no. Maybe I lost a little bit ‘cause it’s hot outside, but nothing big. I eat okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent fever, chills or significant weight loss. Now, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been sick with anything serious. Just the usual colds and flus. My wife always tells me to go to the doctor, but I usually just rest and get better.
DOCTOR: I see. No prior medical diagnoses. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never needed any. Everything works okay, mostly. .
DOCTOR: Good. And regarding family history – do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – have a history of heart disease, cancer, or other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father… he had some problems with his heart when he got older. But he didn’t go to the doctor much either. Just slowed down a lot. My mother was healthy as a horse, though. No cancer or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart issues in your father, but a healthy mother. Now, to clarify, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything. No pills, no nothing. Just water. My wife gives me vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them.
DOCTOR: And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I can eat anything, no problems. No allergies, no. I've never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bulaong, for providing such a detailed history. Based on what you've described – the chest pain, its characteristics, and your medical background – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given your family history of heart issues, and the nature of the pain, we need to rule out any cardiac involvement. However, the description of the pain not being typical for angina, along with the tenderness to palpation, raises concern for a musculoskeletal issue, such as costochondritis or a muscle strain. To help determine the cause, I would like to perform a physical exam, including listening to your heart and lungs, and palpating your chest wall to assess for tenderness and inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds good. I mean, whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. So yeah, you can listen to my heart and… and poke around. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll please lie down on the examination table, we'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll gently palpate your chest wall to assess for tenderness. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful during the exam.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Let me know if I need to do anything. And uh… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It may be cool to the touch, but it won't cause any discomfort. Please try to breathe normally. Your heart sounds are regular rhythm with no murmurs detected. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally, with no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently press on different areas of your chest. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain. Do you feel any tenderness right here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, a little bit. Right there, on my… sternum, I think you said? It's not a bad pain, but it’s definitely sore. And maybe a little bit here, on the side. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness to palpation over the sternum and the left intercostal space. This suggests possible costochondritis – inflammation of the cartilage connecting your ribs to your sternum – or a musculoskeletal strain. To further rule out other causes, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. This will help us visualize your lungs, heart, and bones and identify any underlying issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… uh… is that safe? I’ve heard things about radiation. I don’t want to get sick from that.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Bulaong. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low – comparable to the natural background radiation you’re exposed to over a few days. The benefits of ruling out more serious conditions far outweigh the minimal risk. We take precautions to minimize exposure as well, using lead aprons and shielding when necessary. However, I completely respect your concerns. If you are truly uncomfortable with an X-ray at this time, we can consider alternative approaches, such as a trial of anti-inflammatory medication and close monitoring. But please understand that this may delay the diagnosis and treatment of any underlying condition. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm... My wife… she’d want me to get the X-ray. She’s always saying I need to take care of myself. And you said the radiation isn't much. Okay… yeah, let’s do the X-ray. If you think it's best. I just want to know what’s going on, and not have it get worse.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I think that’s a very sensible decision, Mr. Bulaong. We’ll get an order for the chest X-ray right away. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they’ll let me know the results as soon as they’re available. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a course of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, to help alleviate the pain and inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, naproxen sounds good. I’ve taken ibuprofen before, is that the same thing? And uh… how long should I take it for?
DOCTOR: Naproxen is similar to ibuprofen, but generally lasts a bit longer, which means you won’t need to take it as often. I will prescribe a course of 500mg twice daily for two weeks. If your pain significantly improves within that timeframe, you can gradually taper off the medication. However, if your pain persists or worsens despite taking the naproxen, please contact the office immediately. It’s also important to avoid strenuous activity that exacerbates your pain. Rest, ice packs, and gentle stretching can also help. Do you have any allergies or sensitivities to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. I told you, I don't take anything! And I'll try not to lift too much stuff at work. Thanks for the advice. . Hopefully, this stuff will work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I'm hopeful that the naproxen will provide some relief. I will also provide you with written instructions outlining the dosage, potential side effects, and warning signs to watch out for. We will review the X-ray results as soon as they become available, and we can discuss the next steps. If you experience any concerning symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest tightness, or fever – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. You explained everything pretty well. Thanks, Doctor Shely. I appreciate you listening to me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could help. If anything changes or you have any further concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to provide you with the prescription and written instructions. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Okay. You too, Doctor. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Get well soon, Mr. Bulaong.
