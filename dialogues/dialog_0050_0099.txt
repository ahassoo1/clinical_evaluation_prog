DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results back from a test… a GI endoscopy, I believe it was called? And the doctor who performed it said there were some… abnormalities. I’m a bit worried, honestly, and I wanted to get your opinion.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy, yes. I see. And which physician performed this endoscopy, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was Dr. Ramirez, at St. Jude’s Hospital. A very kind woman. I had the procedure done about three weeks ago, I believe. July 12th, perhaps? I kept the paperwork, if that helps. It’s in my bag.
DOCTOR: Please, do feel free to retrieve that paperwork, Ms. Minatra. While you do, perhaps you could tell me a bit about why you had the endoscopy performed in the first place?
PATIENT: Here we are… yes, this is it. And as for why I had it done… well, for several months now, I’ve been having some… discomfort. A rather persistent ache in my stomach, mostly. And some… changes in my bowel habits, if you don’t mind me saying. Nothing terribly dramatic, but enough to warrant investigation, my primary care physician thought. That’s when she recommended Dr. Ramirez.
DOCTOR: I see. "Persistent ache" and "changes in bowel habits"... Could you elaborate on those changes, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. The ache… it’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull, constant feeling. It comes and goes, but it’s always there, lurking, you understand? As for the bowel habits… well, sometimes I experience… looseness. And other times, difficulty. It’s quite irregular, really. It's been unsettling. I've also noticed… a little fatigue, but I assumed that was just from getting older. It’s hard to say what’s connected and what isn’t, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Indeed, it can be. And how would you describe your appetite, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: My appetite… it’s been a bit diminished, I suppose. I don’t feel unhungry, exactly, but I don’t have the same enthusiasm for food that I used to. I find myself eating smaller portions, and sometimes skipping meals altogether. I've been losing weight, slowly, but noticeably. My clothes feel a little looser than they did a few months ago. It's not intentional, I assure you. I enjoy cooking, you see, but even the thought of preparing a large meal feels… burdensome at times.
DOCTOR: I see. The report from Dr. Ramirez does indicate some… inflammation and a polyp was identified in the descending colon. It’s small, but it requires further attention. Have you had any blood in your stool, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Blood? No, not that I’ve noticed. None that was… obvious, anyway. There has been a… darkness to it occasionally, but I attributed that to something I ate. Beets, perhaps? Or dark chocolate. I do enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate with my afternoon tea. I haven’t seen any bright red blood, if that makes a difference. It’s good to know it was noted, though. What does the inflammation mean, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: The inflammation, in and of itself, isn't necessarily cause for immediate alarm. It can be indicative of a number of things – dietary sensitivities, minor infections, even stress. However, in conjunction with the polyp and your reported symptoms – the weight loss, changes in bowel habits, diminished appetite – it warrants a more thorough investigation. We need to rule out more serious possibilities. Have you ever had a colonoscopy before, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? No, Doctor, I haven’t. This endoscopy was the first procedure of that sort I’ve ever had. It was… unpleasant, I won’t lie. But Dr. Ramirez assured me it was necessary. I must confess, I am rather apprehensive about another one. What exactly does it involve? And what are we trying to “rule out”, if you don’t mind my asking? I prefer to know everything, you see. It helps calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. A colonoscopy is a more comprehensive examination of the entire colon than an endoscopy. It involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera attached into the rectum to visualize the colon lining. It is more involved than an endoscopy, and requires bowel preparation beforehand. As for what we are ruling out… primarily, we need to assess the polyp for potential malignancy. Polyps can sometimes be benign, but they can also be precancerous or cancerous. We also need to investigate the source of your symptoms – the weight loss, the changes in bowel habits, the discomfort – and rule out other possibilities, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Now, given your age and the nature of your symptoms, I recommend scheduling a colonoscopy as soon as possible. Are you agreeable to that, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Malignancy… that is a frightening word, Doctor. But you are right, I suppose. Knowing is better than wondering. And I trust your judgment. Yes, I am agreeable to a colonoscopy. As soon as possible, you say? What does “soon” entail? And… what sort of preparation are we talking about? I’ve read stories… unpleasant stories. I do hope it won't be too disruptive. I have a small garden, you see, and the tomatoes are just beginning to ripen. I wouldn't want to neglect them.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Minatra, both about the procedure itself and about your garden. We will do everything we can to make the experience as comfortable as possible. The preparation typically involves a special diet for a day or two beforehand, and a bowel cleansing solution the evening before the procedure. It is disruptive, I won't deny that. But it is essential for a clear visualization of the colon lining. As for “soon”… I can arrange for you to have a colonoscopy at St. Jude’s Hospital within the next two weeks. Would the week of August 12th work for you?
PATIENT: August 12th… let me see… that would be… yes, I believe that would work. Though it does coincide with my niece’s birthday celebration. A small gathering, nothing grand. But… well, knowing is important, as you say. Yes, August 12th will do. And you said St. Jude’s? Will Dr. Ramirez be performing the procedure again? I found her quite reassuring. If not, that is quite alright, of course. But knowing who to expect helps ease my mind.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Dr. Ramirez’s schedule is fully booked for the next several weeks. Dr. Chen will be performing the procedure. He is an excellent gastroenterologist, highly respected at St. Jude’s. I can have his credentials sent to you, if you’d like. Now, regarding the procedure itself… it is typically performed under sedation, so you will likely be unaware of much of what is happening. It takes approximately 30 to 60 minutes, and you will be monitored closely throughout. After the procedure, you will need someone to drive you home, as the sedation can take several hours to wear off. Do you have someone who can assist you with that, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Dr. Chen, you say? I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you recommend him, I am confident he is capable. Credentials would be most appreciated, thank you. And sedation… that is reassuring. I do have a neighbor, Mrs. Espinoza, who is a dear friend. She has offered to drive me to and from appointments before. She would be happy to assist, I am sure. She is a very reliable woman. Thirty to sixty minutes… that doesn't sound too daunting. Now, what about the results? How long will it take to receive them? And what happens if… if the polyp is something concerning? I know I am asking many questions, but I prefer to be prepared for all possibilities.
DOCTOR: You are not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Minatra. It is important to be informed, and I am happy to address your concerns. The preliminary results are typically available within 24-48 hours. If the polyp is concerning, we will discuss the findings in detail and determine the best course of action. This may involve further testing, such as a biopsy, or a referral to a surgeon for removal. In most cases, polyps can be removed relatively easily during the colonoscopy itself. We will, of course, explain everything thoroughly and answer all of your questions before proceeding with any treatment. I will have my assistant schedule the colonoscopy for August 12th, and she will also provide you with detailed instructions for the bowel preparation, as well as Dr. Chen’s credentials. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered everything, and with such clarity. I do feel… less anxious, if I am honest. Thank you for your patience and kindness. And for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I appreciate it more than words can say. Perhaps… perhaps a small piece of dark chocolate will help calm my nerves until then.
DOCTOR: An excellent idea, Ms. Minatra. A small indulgence can be very beneficial. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. My assistant will be in touch shortly to finalize the arrangements. Please do not hesitate to call the office if you have any further questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Minatra.
