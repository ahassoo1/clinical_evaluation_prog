DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I want to know more about where my family come from. Like, a long time ago. I hear you can do a test for that now? A DNA test?
DOCTOR: That’s right, Mr. Scobie. We can certainly discuss genetic ancestry testing. It’s become quite popular, and can give you a fascinating glimpse into your family’s origins. Before we get into the specifics of the test itself, though, I like to understand a little bit more about why you’re interested now, and what you’re hoping to learn. Also, just so I'm clear, are you experiencing any health concerns at all that prompted this visit, or is this purely for genealogical interest?
PATIENT: No health problems, Doctor. Just… curious. My mama, she tell stories. Stories about the islands, about the people. But old stories, you know? I want to know for sure. Like, where did they come from before the islands? Is that what the test can tell me? I just want to know my roots. I’m 85 years old, maybe it’s time to find out!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Scobie. It's perfectly reasonable to want to connect with your heritage, especially at this stage in life. It's great your mama shared those stories with you. Yes, the tests can often trace ancestry back many generations, potentially revealing where your ancestors originated before settling on the Marshall Islands. It's important to understand that these tests aren’t always definitive, and they’re constantly being refined. They can give you percentages related to different populations, and sometimes pinpoint regions. Before we proceed, let’s just quickly go over your medical history. Even though you’re not here for a health issue right now, it's standard practice for me to have that information. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone does at my age, right? Mostly just old age things. My knees bother me, but I walk okay. I haven’t been to a doctor much in my life, to be honest. I have Medicare, that's all. They know I'm old!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like you've been quite healthy for a long time. And you’re right, a little tiredness and knee discomfort are common as we get older. Medicare is excellent, and yes, they definitely know we're getting up there in years! Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And not much time in the hospital either. When I was a little boy, maybe, a bad fever once, but nothing serious. I was lucky, I think. Mostly just stayed away from trouble!
DOCTOR: That’s fantastic, Mr. Scobie! A history free of surgeries and hospitalizations is wonderful. It sounds like you’ve been very careful and lived a healthy life. Now, thinking about your family… are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Mama passed away a long time ago. Papa too. I don’t have any brothers or sisters either. Just me. That's why I want to know more about where we come from, you know? It feels… important to remember them somehow.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. That makes your desire to learn about your ancestry even more poignant. It’s a lovely way to honor their memory. Do you know anything about your grandparents, or any other relatives further back?
PATIENT: Um… not much. Mama told me their names, I think. But it was a long time ago. She didn’t talk much about them, or where they came from. Just that they were from the islands, of course. Different islands, maybe. She said things were different then, people didn’t write things down so much. Everything was stories.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Scobie. Oral histories are incredibly valuable, but they can be limited in detail. Alright, let's talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I eat everything. Mama cooked everything! No problems there. And I don’t take any pills. Just… old age! I don’t like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. No allergies and no current medications is excellent. Okay, so to recap – you’re 85 years old, your parents have passed away, you have no known allergies or medical conditions, and you haven't had any surgeries or hospitalizations. You're interested in a genetic ancestry test to learn more about your family's origins. Before we discuss the test itself, I'd like to quickly do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It's standard practice, even if you're not experiencing any health concerns. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. If you want to check me over, go ahead. I'm not afraid. I haven’t broken any bones lately!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Scobie! It won’t take long. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me... Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished bilaterally, which is common at your age. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Let me just take a look in your ears and throat... Ears appear clear. Throat is slightly dry, but no signs of infection. And finally, I’ll quickly feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Reflexes are slightly diminished, also common with age. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits for your age. Everything seems to be functioning as expected. Now, let's talk about the ancestry test. There are several companies that offer different types of tests...
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you for checking me over. Everything feels okay to me, but it's good to know you looked. So, about the test… what kind do you think is best for me? What will it tell me? And how much will it cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad everything feels okay to you, and you’re right, it's good to have a baseline. There are a few popular companies – 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and MyHeritage are the big ones. They all work by analyzing your saliva sample and comparing your DNA to a database of people who have also taken the test. What they can tell you: Ethnicity estimates: This is the percentage breakdown of your ancestral origins. For example, it might say you're 60% Marshallese, 20% Polynesian, 10% East Asian, etc. It's important to remember these are estimates and can vary between companies. Genetic relatives: It can identify other people in the database who share DNA with you, potentially helping you find distant cousins or other family members. Some health predispositions: Most tests also offer information about your genetic risk for certain health conditions. However, these results are just a starting point and shouldn't be used to make medical decisions without talking to a doctor. Which one is best for you?
PATIENT: That sounds interesting, Doctor. The ethnicity part is what I really want to know. I don’t need to know about health stuff, just where my family come from. Which company has the most people from the islands in their database? That seems important, right? If they don’t have many islanders, they won’t be able to tell me much. And how much does it cost? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Mr. Scobie. The size of the database is very important, especially when you're looking for information about a specific population like people from the Marshall Islands. Unfortunately, that information isn’t always readily available, and the companies don’t publish specific numbers for each region. However, based on what I’ve seen and heard from patients, AncestryDNA generally has the largest database overall, and they've been making efforts to increase representation from diverse populations. 23andMe is also a good option, but their database is slightly smaller. Here’s a breakdown of the costs : AncestryDNA: Typically around \$99-\$150, depending on sales and promotions. They frequently have discounts. 23andMe: Around \$79-\$199, depending on the package you choose . Both companies require you to purchase a kit online, collect a saliva sample at home, and mail it back to their lab. Results are usually available in 6-8 weeks. Do either of those sound like a good starting point for you?
PATIENT: \$100 sounds okay, Doctor. If AncestryDNA has the most people, that’s probably the best one. I don’t need to know about health stuff, just where my family come from. Can I buy the kit here, or do I have to order it online? And what if I have trouble collecting the sample? I’m not very good with computers, and I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: That’s a great choice, Mr. Scobie. AncestryDNA is a good option, and you’re right to prioritize a larger database. Unfortunately, we don’t sell the kits directly here at the clinic. You’ll need to order it online through their website: [https://www.ancestry.com/dna]. Don't worry about being nervous about collecting the sample! It's actually very easy. The kit comes with detailed instructions, and it's mostly just spitting into a tube. They even have videos online that show you how to do it. If you have trouble with the online ordering process or with the sample collection, I can ask my nurse, Maria, to help you. She’s very patient and good with technology. She can walk you through the process, either here at the clinic or over the phone. Would you like me to have Maria give you a call tomorrow to help you order the kit and explain everything?
PATIENT: That would be wonderful, Doctor. Maria sounds very nice. I think I need some help with the computer stuff. Yes, please have her call me. I don’t want to mess it up and waste my money. Thank you very much for your help, Doctor. You’ve been very kind to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. Maria is excellent, and she’ll be happy to assist you. I’ll make sure she calls you tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all. Just waiting for Maria’s call now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was lovely meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to hearing about your results!
