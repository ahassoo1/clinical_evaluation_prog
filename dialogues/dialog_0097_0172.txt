DOCTOR: Hi Candice, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, I suppose I'm here because… someone thought it would be a good idea. New to the area, you see. Medicare insisted. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest why they thought I needed a visit. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. Sometimes these wellness checks are just a routine thing, but it's always good to get a baseline, especially when you're new to the area. Even if you’re feeling perfectly fine, it helps us get to know your health a little better. So, just to be thorough, can you tell me a little bit about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: A typical day? Honestly, it's rather… uneventful. My husband and I keep to ourselves. He does the gardening, I… well, I used to do things. Dispatching, you know. Though I’m quite retired now. It’s all rather… blurry, truthfully. Are we nearly done?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Candice, we’re just getting started. I just like to get a sense of your activity level and daily routines. “Blurry” is alright! It's common as we get older. So, just so I have a complete picture, when you say “dispatching”, was that work you did for a long time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A very long time. Though the details… escape me. Phones, mostly. Telling people where to go. It was… important work, I suppose. Before everything became computers. Honestly, it was a dreadful racket. Constant ringing. I preferred it when my husband did more. He was better with all the… technical bits. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: I am, yes. It helps me keep track of everything. Don’t worry, it’s all confidential. So, you mentioned you’ve been retired for a while. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries that you can recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Goodness. Let me think… There was something with my hip, ages ago. Though I don't recall precisely when. And a… growth, perhaps? They removed it. It wasn't terribly serious, I was assured. Honestly, doctors these days make such a fuss over nothing. My mother always said a good cup of tea solved everything.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve had a few things over the years. It's alright if the details are fuzzy. We can try to look up some records if you like. You mentioned a growth was removed. Do you remember roughly when that happened, even a decade or so?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Decades? That's… a long time. I suppose it was after we moved to this town. Which was… well, quite a while ago now. Before the new supermarket was built, certainly. That was… a big event. Honestly, I’m not good with dates. My husband kept track of everything. He always had the better memory.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. We can try to get some information from your previous medical records. Do you happen to know where you received medical care before moving here?
PATIENT: Oh, that was… in the city. A large hospital. St. Something-or-other. Honestly, they all look the same to me. Dreadful waiting rooms. And the nurses were always so rushed. I’m quite certain they didn’t listen properly. My husband always spoke for me, you know. He had a very clear voice. Are we almost finished?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Candice. Just a few more questions. It's helpful to know about your past care, even if it wasn't ideal. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My husband gives me a pill every morning. A small, white one. I think it's for my… waterworks? He says I shouldn't forget it. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure what it’s for. And I take a vitamin D, I believe. The doctor told me I needed more sunshine. Though we don’t get much of that in this town.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill every morning and Vitamin D. That's helpful. Do you know the name of the white pill, or maybe what it’s for specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. My husband handles all that. He has a little box with all the pills sorted out. I just take what he gives me. Honestly, I don't like to bother him with questions. He has enough on his plate with the garden. It's… a very large garden, you know. Are we quite finished now? I find all this questioning rather… draining.
DOCTOR: Yes, Candice, we’re almost finished. I understand it can be tiring to recall everything. Just a few more quick questions, then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I recall. I used to get hay fever, when I was a girl. But that was ages ago. My husband says I shouldn't eat too much chocolate. But that's not an allergy, is it? Honestly, I think he just wants me to be healthier. This is rather… a lot, isn't it?
DOCTOR: No, chocolate doesn’t count! And no hay fever currently. That's good to know. Alright, Candice. If you’re comfortable, I’d like to just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with, then. Honestly, I’d rather be home having a cup of tea. Just… be quick about it, please. My husband will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as quick as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/85. That’s a little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Your ears look clear. Your throat looks fine as well. A little dry, but nothing significant. Alright, everything sounds and looks okay so far. Is there anything else you've been experiencing, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Small? Hmm. Well, my hands ache sometimes. Especially in the mornings. And I feel a bit… unsteady on my feet occasionally. Though I don't fall, you understand. Not yet. Honestly, I think it's just old age creeping up on me. Are we absolutely finished now?
DOCTOR: Okay, hand pain in the mornings and occasional unsteadiness. Those are important things to mention. It’s good you brought those up. To get a better idea of what might be going on, I'd like to check your reflexes and your balance with a few simple tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests? Honestly, I’m not very good at tests. My husband always said I panicked under pressure. Can’t we just… leave it? I feel perfectly fine, really. Just a bit tired, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Candice. These aren’t difficult tests, and they will only help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s possible the hand pain and unsteadiness are just related to age, as you said, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities. It will only take a few minutes. We can skip anything you’re truly uncomfortable with. Would you be willing to try just a simple balance test, where I ask you to stand and hold your arms out?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But if I fall, it's on your head. Honestly, I’m not as steady as I used to be. My husband always said I had two left feet. sighs Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be right here to support you. Just stand comfortably with your feet about shoulder-width apart, and I’ll ask you to close your eyes for a moment. Don't worry, I’ll catch you if you lose your balance. Okay, thank you. That was helpful. You do have some mild unsteadiness. Given your age, the occasional unsteadiness, and the hand pain, I think it would be a good idea to do a few simple blood tests to rule out things like vitamin deficiencies or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests? Honestly, I hate needles. Always have. My husband always drew the blood for me when I needed it. He had a very steady hand. sighs Is it absolutely necessary? I feel… quite faint just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Candice. Needles aren’t pleasant for anyone. However, these blood tests can give us valuable information to help us understand what’s going on and ensure you’re as healthy as possible. They will help rule out some common causes of your symptoms and allow us to create a plan to manage them effectively. If the results are normal, that's great information to have too! We only need a small amount of blood, and the nurse is very skilled. If you're particularly anxious, we can use a numbing cream beforehand. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But if I faint, I'm blaming you entirely. Honestly, I don't see the point. My husband always said doctors make too much fuss over nothing. sighs Just get it over with, then. And please, be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. I’ll make sure the nurse knows you’re anxious, and we’ll take things as slowly as you need. We'll get it done as quickly and comfortably as possible. While the nurse draws the blood, I’ll write up a plan based on our conversation today. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Honestly, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast. My husband keeps track of all my appointments. sighs If it must be done, I suppose. Just tell him the date and time, alright? I'm hopeless with calendars.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll make sure to give you a clear appointment card with all the details for your husband. So, to summarize, we’ve discussed your hand pain, occasional unsteadiness, and the general feeling of fatigue. We’re going to do some blood tests to rule out underlying causes. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t suppose so. Honestly, this has been rather exhausting. I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for today, Candice. I completely understand wanting to rest and have a cup of tea. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw the blood, and then you’re free to go. Please, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. It was lovely meeting you. .
PATIENT: .
