DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Hmm... let me see... My wife, bless her heart, she said something about… papers? For work, I think. Something to do with taking some time off. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something about needing a form… for FMLA, maybe? Or… disability? She’s very organized, my wife. I just… well, I get a bit lost in the details these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you need some paperwork completed, potentially for FMLA or short-term disability. Let's try to clarify what your wife needs. Do you know why she thinks you need this paperwork?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that you mention it… I think it was after I… well, after I had to step down from leading the choir practice. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It just… got harder to focus, and I didn’t want to let anyone down. It was a bit embarrassing, actually. She thought… she thought maybe I needed to take some time to… rest, and sort things out. Is that making any sense? It’s all a jumble, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you experienced some difficulty with focus which led to you stepping down from a role you enjoyed. That's a valid reason to consider time off. So, to get a better understanding, when did you notice this difficulty with focus starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start… Let me think. It wasn't sudden, that’s for sure. It was… gradual. Probably… oh, maybe six months ago? Or was it eight? It’s hard to pinpoint. I was still able to do things, mind you, just… it took longer. And I found myself… forgetting things more easily. Small things, at first. Names, dates… then it started to affect the choir rehearsals. It was frightening, to be honest. I didn’t want to worry anyone, so I just… tried to push through it for as long as I could.
DOCTOR: Six to eight months of gradually worsening focus and memory. And it was impacting your ability to lead the choir rehearsals. Have you noticed any other changes since then?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. Well, my wife says I get… quieter. More withdrawn. I used to enjoy chatting with the fellas after church, you know? Now I… just prefer to sit and… be. She also says I’ve been sleeping more. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… down. Not sad, exactly. Just… empty. I haven’t told anyone about that part, though. It just felt… personal, you see? Like a weakness.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Limtiaco. It takes courage to talk about those things. So, to summarize, you've been experiencing difficulty with focus and memory for six to eight months, which has led to you stepping down from leading the choir. You’ve also noticed increased sleep, and feeling withdrawn and a sense of emptiness. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmmm. Now that you mention it, maybe a little less appetite. My wife’s been fussing over that, too. She says I’m not eating as much at dinner. And I think… I think I've lost a bit of weight? Not much, but enough for her to notice. I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest. I just haven’t been feeling very hungry. It’s… difficult to explain. Everything just feels a little… muted, you know? Like the colors aren’t as bright.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss, along with feeling withdrawn and a sense of emptiness. We’ve covered a lot of important information, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a tricky question. Let me see… I had my blood pressure checked a few years back, and the doctor said it was a little high, but he put me on some pills, and I’ve been taking them ever since. I don't think I have diabetes, no. And my heart… I haven't been told anything about my heart. I see Dr. Moreau for my general check-ups, but… I forget what he tells me half the time! My wife usually handles all the details. She’ll know better than I will, honestly. I’ve been meaning to ask her to write down all my medications and conditions… but I just haven't gotten around to it. Sorry. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly normal to forget details, and it's good that you're aware of your high blood pressure. We can sort through everything. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… the name… oh dear. It’s a little white pill… I think it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? It’s so frustrating, I hate not remembering things. My wife keeps them in a little box, labeled with all the names… I just… I can’t recall it right now. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to the names, I just take them every morning with my breakfast. I really wish I could be more helpful. Maybe we could call Dr. Moreau’s office? They’d have all the information. Would that be alright? I’m starting to feel a little flustered, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s perfectly alright. We can certainly call Dr. Moreau’s office to confirm your medications. It's very common to not remember medication names. Before we do that, let’s briefly touch on your past surgical history. Have you had any surgeries in your life?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A very long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia repair a few years after that? But it was a very simple operation, nothing major. I recovered quickly. Other than that… I don’t think I’ve had any surgeries. I've been very lucky, I suppose. I try to stay healthy. I used to go fishing a lot, but… well, I haven’t been able to go lately. It requires too much concentration, I think. My wife worries about me being alone out on the water.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and a hernia repair. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, dementia, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Now that's a tough one. My mother, bless her soul, she had… something with her heart. I think it was a valve problem? She passed away when I was still quite young, so I don't remember much about it. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, he got very forgetful towards the end of his life. My wife thinks it might have been dementia, but no one ever really talked about it. It was a sensitive topic, you see. We didn’t really discuss medical things openly in those days. I'm afraid I don’t have much information to offer, I apologize. It’s all very hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s common for family medical history to be unclear. Finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no to all of that, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, very rarely. My wife doesn't approve. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I'm a church elder, you see. I have a reputation to uphold! I try to live a clean and healthy life. I used to be very active, but… well, as I said, I haven't been feeling myself lately. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I'm just hoping to figure out what's going on and get back to my old self.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. That was very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me – the gradual onset of difficulty with focus and memory, feeling withdrawn, decreased appetite, sleep disturbances, and some feelings of emptiness – it sounds like we need to explore some potential causes. There are many possibilities, ranging from vitamin deficiencies to more complex conditions. Before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A physical exam sounds like a good idea. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm starting to worry about my wife. She's been carrying so much of the burden lately, and I feel like I'm just… not myself to help her. So, yes, please, let's do the exam. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’d like to do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination. We’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, and do a general physical assessment. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll get started. Just relax, and take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Deep breaths… yes, I can do that. It’s just… I always get a little nervous around doctors. My blood pressure probably goes up just thinking about it! But I’ll try to relax. Just tell me what you need me to do. Hopefully, it won't take too long. My wife is waiting in the car. I don't like leaving her worried for too long.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that's not uncommon in a clinical setting. It’s 148/92. We’ll monitor that. Your heart sounds regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you just let your arms relax by your sides?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Faint, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? My mother had a weak heart, you know. Perhaps it's hereditary. I try not to worry about it, but… it’s hard not to. Go ahead with the reflexes. I’ll try to stay still. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m not very coordinated these days, I’m afraid. It’s probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Can you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Diminished, you say? That doesn’t sound good either. Everything seems to be… diminished lately. My energy, my memory, my reflexes… it’s rather disheartening, to be honest. Oh dear… I do feel a bit dizzy. Perhaps I should sit back down. I haven't been eating much lately. Could that be the problem? Just a little lightheadedness, I think. I’m sure it’s nothing serious. I just don’t want to fall and injure myself. My wife would be very upset.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's have you sit down. Yes, it’s best to be cautious. A little lightheadedness is understandable, especially if you haven't been eating well. Now, I’m going to do a quick cognitive assessment – just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. It’s nothing to worry about, just a routine part of the exam. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That was a bit shaky there for a moment. It’s just… everything feels a little off lately. My brain feels… foggy, you know? Today’s date… hmm… let me see… it’s… August? Yes, definitely August. But what’s the date? Is it the… the 2nd? Or is it the 3rd? I always get those mixed up. My wife keeps track of everything, I’m afraid. I’m hopeless with dates. I apologize. It’s just… slipping away from me, you see? Everything is becoming a blur. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty remembering dates. You said it’s August 2nd, which is correct. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects I’m going to show you?
PATIENT: Three objects? Oh dear… I’m not very good at these sorts of things. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know? I used to be very sharp, very quick-witted… but that was a long time ago. Go ahead. I'll try my best. But please don't be disappointed if I get them wrong. I’m already feeling a little flustered, and my brain feels like it’s… shutting down.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, what is this?
PATIENT: Hmm… what is this? It’s… it’s one of those… writing things. You use it to… make marks on paper. It’s… a… a pen! Yes, that’s right. A pen. But it’s… it’s one of those fancy pens. I haven’t seen one of these in a long time. It feels… unfamiliar. Is that correct? I hope I’m not making a fool of myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Very good. Now, what is this?
PATIENT: A key… hmm. A key… It’s used to… open things. Doors, usually. To keep things safe. A… a door key. Yes, that’s right! A door key. But… what kind of door? It feels… like I should know something more about it. But my mind is just… blank. It's frustrating, to be honest. I used to be able to recall all sorts of details. Now… nothing. Is that the correct answer? I hope I’m not slowing you down.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. And finally, what is this?
PATIENT: A… a handkerchief. Yes, that’s right. You use it to… wipe your face. Or… to blow your nose. But… it’s not just any handkerchief. It’s… it’s a… It feels like I’ve seen this before. Like it belongs to someone… I… I can’t remember. My mind is just… empty. Is that… is that bad? I apologize. I’m truly sorry. I'm making a mess of things, aren't I?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Limtiaco. You're not making a mess of things at all. You’ve shared a lot of valuable information with me today. Based on your history, the physical exam findings, and the cognitive assessment, I’m concerned about some possible cognitive impairment. It could be due to a variety of factors, including vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or early stages of dementia. To get a clearer picture, I want to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and possible brain imaging. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Dementia…? Oh dear… my uncle… he had dementia. It was… it was terrible. He didn’t even remember his own children. No… no, I don’t want that. Blood tests… a neurologist…? What does that mean? Is it… is it serious? I just want to figure out what’s wrong. I want to be myself again. I don't want to lose my memories. I don't want to become a burden to my wife. Please, Doctor… what do you think is wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it's understandable to be scared. We haven’t confirmed anything yet. These tests are simply to gather more information so we can determine the cause of your symptoms and develop the best possible treatment plan. It's important to remember that there are many reasons for cognitive changes, and not all of them are dementia. Some deficiencies are easily corrected, and other conditions are treatable. We will work through this together, step by step. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. I’ll also order the blood tests. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I want you to focus on taking care of yourself and resting. Is your wife here with you today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor… thank you. It’s just… it’s all so overwhelming. I appreciate your reassurance. Dr. Vance… yes, that’s good. I trust your judgment. My wife is waiting in the car. She drove me here. She’s been very patient with me, bless her heart. She’s probably worried sick. She’ll be relieved to know we’re getting some answers. Will you… will you explain everything to her as well? I’m not sure I can… I’m not sure I can explain it all myself. It’s just… difficult. Everything is just so difficult these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. I'd be happy to speak with your wife and explain everything in detail. That's part of my job. I’ll go out and speak with her now, and then we’ll discuss the next steps together. Do you have any questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I’m alright for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And thank you for… for not dismissing me. Just… please tell my wife everything. She needs to know. And… and please, help me get my life back. I miss being myself. I miss remembering things. I miss… everything. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR:
