DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think… It’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now. Not… easy. Like it used to be. It takes a while, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's become difficult and takes longer to urinate. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Hard. And… I have to go back again soon after I just went. It’s… frustrating. My husband, he says I’m always going. He worries. I don’t always remember feeling like I need to go, but then… I do. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, you're experiencing both difficulty starting and a frequent urge to urinate, even shortly after you've gone. And sometimes you don't even feel the urge until it's time to go again. Is there any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain. It’s not sharp. Sometimes a little… uncomfortable. Like it doesn’t all come out at once, you know? More like a… strain. But no burning. No, definitely no burning. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no burning, just a sense of strain and incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, smell, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Color… smell… I don’t really pay attention to those things, Doctor. My husband does all the… looking. He’d notice, I suppose, if it was really bad. I haven’t asked him. We don’t usually talk about… bathroom things.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's perfectly alright. Let's focus on what you're experiencing. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't think so. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather, isn’t it? It’s been hot. Chills… no. And lower back pain… well, my back always aches a little. Old age, you know? But not anything new. Not a bad pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or new back pain. Now, have you had any issues with constipation or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Constipation… oh, yes. Sometimes. Not every day, but… yes. It’s… hard to go. Like the bathroom problems, you know? Everything feels… stuck. My husband gets me the prune juice. That helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both urination and bowel movements are proving difficult. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Doctor, I'm old. I've seen a lot of doctors over the years. I think… I think I had high blood pressure once. A long time ago. They gave me pills. I took them for a while, then stopped. I don’t remember why. And… something with my heart, maybe? It wasn't bad. My husband handles all the paperwork. He knows all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you may have had high blood pressure in the past and possibly some heart issues. Do you recall any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out. A long, long time ago. And… I broke my hip when I was younger. Fell in the garden. That was a bad one. I was in the hospital for a while. Other than that… not much. I don’t think so. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hip fracture. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I take a little pill for my knees. The doctor gave it to me for the arthritis. And… sometimes I take something for my stomach. When it’s upset. That's it, I think. And sometimes prune juice, if my husband reminds me. He keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not really. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just the mosquito bites, isn’t it? We live near the swamp, you know. Lots of mosquitos.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to do a gentle abdominal exam and check a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a check? Yes, alright. That’s fine. Just be gentle, please. My skin is a little thin, you know? And… what about the urine? Where do I… do I just go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, we have a private restroom just down the hall. I'll give you a cup, and you can collect a sample when you're able. And yes, I will be as gentle as possible during the exam. . Let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the exam table. . Your heart rate is a little fast, but regular. I'm hearing some mild crackling in your lungs, which could be due to a number of things. Now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay… gentle, you said? It feels… a little tender here. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like it's… full. And… it’s harder than usual. Like there's something… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some fullness in your lower abdomen as well. It’s not sharply tender, but it is definitely firm. . Now, let's get that urine sample. It will help us rule out an infection. I’ll leave you to collect it and then I'll come back and we can discuss our next steps. Do you know where the restroom is?
PATIENT: Yes, you pointed that way. I think I can find it. It’s just… walking is a little slow these days, you know? I’ll be right back. And… thank you, Doctor. You're very kind.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be right here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. That took a while.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. Now, based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you're experiencing difficulty with both urination and bowel movements, and some fullness in your lower abdomen. The crackling in your lungs could be a separate issue, or related to fluid retention. We need to rule out a urinary tract infection first, so we’ll send this sample to the lab. I also want to check your kidney function with a blood test. We can do that right here in the clinic. It will give us a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Yes, actually. My ankles are a little puffy sometimes. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just… old age, you know? My husband says I should elevate them. He’s always telling me what to do. But yes, they do swell.
DOCTOR: Okay. Swelling in your ankles is consistent with possible fluid retention. Based on everything, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a urinary tract infection, a blockage in your bladder, or potentially a problem with your kidneys. It’s also possible you have constipation that is contributing to the difficulty. I want to order those blood tests and a urine analysis right away. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake – unless your doctor has told you otherwise – and eating a diet rich in fiber, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blockage? Kidneys? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. Fiber… my husband makes me drink prune juice. Is that fiber? And… will the tests hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Stoffregen. It's good that you're already drinking prune juice – that does contain fiber, and it’s a good start. The tests themselves won't hurt. The blood test is just a quick prick of a needle, and the urine analysis is simply providing a sample. We're just gathering information to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. I don't want to alarm you, but it's important to rule out anything serious. Many of these issues are treatable, and we'll work through this together. I'm also going to order an ultrasound of your bladder to see if we can get a better look at what's going on there. Would you be able to schedule that for tomorrow?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… yes, I think so. My husband usually drives me. An ultrasound… is that like the one they use for babies? Will I have to drink a lot of water before? Because going to the bathroom is the whole problem, you see!
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a similar type of ultrasound, but we'll be looking at your bladder instead. And you’re right to ask about the water. For the ultrasound, you will need to drink about 32 ounces of water an hour or two beforehand to fill your bladder so we can get a good image. I know it's not ideal given your difficulties, but it’s important for the test. We can discuss strategies to help with that – perhaps breaking it up into smaller amounts throughout the hour, and focusing on staying comfortable. I'm going to write up the orders for the blood tests, the urine analysis, and the ultrasound now. The nurse will come in and draw your blood, and then you can schedule the ultrasound on your way out. Do you have any other concerns or questions before I finish up?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Thirty-two ounces… that’s a lot of water. My husband will have to help me. He’s good at reminding me. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I understand it's a lot, and you don't have to worry about remembering everything on your own. We'll take it one step at a time. The nurse will go over all the instructions with you in detail before you leave. Here are the orders for the tests. . Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before your next appointment. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. I will review the results with you when they come back, and we'll make a plan from there. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re very kind. I’m just… glad to be getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm glad you came in. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be right with you. Have a good day, and please take care. .
