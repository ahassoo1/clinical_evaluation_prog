DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. A doctor who looks you in the eye. It’s this foot, dear. This foot. It’s been a terrible bother, a terrible bother for… well, let’s just say too long. It won’t heal, and it hurts. A sharp, stinging pain, especially when I try to walk. And believe me, I’ve tried to keep off it, but a woman has to get around, doesn't she? It's just…aggravating.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “aggravating” doesn’t quite give me enough information for a proper assessment, Ms. Cannington. Let’s try to be a bit more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise? Precise? Honestly, young man, I'm telling you it hurts. What more precise do you need? It feels like someone is sticking needles in it, and then pouring salt on top. And it's red, very red, and sometimes…sometimes it smells. A bad smell. I keep it bandaged, of course, but it’s… unpleasant. I've had diabetes for years, you see, and I know that’s what it is, this…this trouble. It's just…worsening.
DOCTOR: Diabetes can certainly contribute to foot problems, yes. But we need to determine the extent of the issue. Now, this “bad smell” – how long have you noticed that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… probably a month ago, maybe a little longer. It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… other days, even with the bandage, I can smell it myself. It’s not a constant stink, if you must know. Just… intermittent. And it’s rather embarrassing, I assure you. A woman doesn’t like to smell, especially not of… that. Are you going to do something about it, or just ask me questions?
DOCTOR: I am gathering information, Ms. Cannington. A proper examination is required before I can determine the appropriate course of action. Now, regarding this intermittent odor… has anything changed about the foot recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Well, the bandage, of course. I change it every day, like I was told. And I’ve been trying to keep it clean, washing it gently with soap and water. But honestly, it doesn’t seem to make much difference. It still gets red and sore, and the pain… the pain is still there. Sometimes worse, sometimes a little better. And I did notice… a little bit of… discharge, a few weeks ago. A clear fluid, but then it got… cloudier. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I’m not a doctor, I just tell you what I see.
DOCTOR: “Cloudier discharge,” you say. Very well. Now, Ms. Cannington, I’m going to need to examine your foot. Please, if you’ll allow me, let’s take a look. Could you please remove your sock and shoe?
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all. Fine, fine. But be gentle, young man. Be very gentle. This old foot has suffered enough.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, as I suspected. There is significant erythema and edema. And I do observe some exposed tissue here… concerning. Any tenderness with this palpation?
PATIENT: Tenderness?! Of course, there’s tenderness! You’re poking at it! Honestly, I told you to be gentle. It feels like fire, young man, like someone is burning my foot. What did you expect? Do you think I'd be here if it didn't hurt? Honestly, some doctors have no bedside manner at all. And what exactly does "erythema and edema" mean? Are you trying to confuse me? Just tell me if it's bad, or not bad. Simple words, please.
DOCTOR: It is… not ideal, Ms. Cannington. There is evidence of a potential infection. I need to check your circulation. Now, do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness? Sometimes, yes. Especially in the toes. It comes and goes, like everything else. It feels like… pins and needles, a sort of… prickling sensation. But it’s not constant. I just assumed it was part of the… the diabetes. It’s always something, you see. Always something going wrong with my feet. And honestly, I've learned to ignore a lot of it. It's better that way, less worrying. Are you going to give me something for the pain, or are we just going to keep poking at it?
DOCTOR: The numbness is concerning, yes. It suggests possible nerve damage. We'll need to monitor that. Now, I'm going to order some blood work to assess the infection and your blood sugar levels. And I'm going to prescribe a topical antibiotic cream. Apply it twice daily after washing your foot thoroughly. I also recommend elevating your foot as much as possible. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Topical… what? Cream? Twice a day? Honestly, young man, you’re giving me a list of things like I’m a child. I understand wash and put on cream. But twice a day? And elevate? How high? Do I need a ladder? And what about the pain? This cream won't fix the pain, will it? Honestly, I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home. And what about the blood work? Are you going to take a lot of it? I don't like needles. At all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, please. Elevate means raise your foot above your heart. You can do that while you’re sitting or lying down. As for the blood work, it’s a standard procedure. A few vials, that's all. And the topical antibiotic, while it won’t eliminate the pain immediately, will help fight the infection, which will hopefully reduce the inflammation and discomfort over time. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today. It’s crucial that we monitor this closely. Do you have any other questions, or shall we proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: One week? Honestly, that seems awfully soon. But…fine. I suppose. And who’s going to draw the blood? Is it you? Because if it’s you, I’m leaving. I have a very low tolerance for…sharp objects. And if I start to feel faint, I want someone to hold my hand. It's a simple request. And is this cream covered by… Medicare? Honestly, I don’t need another bill.
DOCTOR: The blood work will be drawn by the phlebotomist, not myself. And yes, the cream should be covered by Medicare, but you should verify with the pharmacy to be certain. As for feeling faint… we'll do our best to ensure your comfort. Now, if you’ll follow me, we can get the blood work done. And please, try to relax. The sooner we address this infection, the better. .
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But if I faint, you’re catching me. And if that young woman drawing my blood is even remotely clumsy, I'm walking out of here. Honestly, the indignity of it all. .
