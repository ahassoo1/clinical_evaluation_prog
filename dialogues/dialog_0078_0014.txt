DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Solero, you say? Yes, that's a nice name. Oh, goodness… what did bring me in? Now, let me see… My wife, bless her heart, she said something about papers. Important papers. For… well, I think it has to do with my work. Something about needing time off, maybe? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I’m Ronnald, by the way.
DOCTOR: It's a pleasure to meet you as well, Ronnald. It’s perfectly alright if things are a bit fuzzy. It sounds like you’re here regarding some paperwork for work, potentially related to taking some time off. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little bit more about why you might need time off?
PATIENT: Well, it's… my work, it's with the church, you see. Religious activities and education… lots of organizing, teaching… and lately… well, it's just been… harder. Harder to think. Harder to remember things. It's not a sudden thing, more like… a slow fading. My wife noticed it before I did, of course. She says I repeat myself a lot. And… I just feel tired, all the time. Not sick tired, just… worn out. Does that make any sense? I don't even know why I'm telling you all this. The papers… that's what I came for, right?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ronnald. It’s very helpful to hear you describe things like that. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some difficulties with your memory and increased fatigue, and your wife has noticed changes as well. It's good you're both paying attention to this. Let’s try to gather a bit more information. When you say “harder to think,” can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific… oh, goodness. Let me think… Just yesterday, I was preparing for the youth group meeting. We were going to talk about… about forgiveness, I think. And I just… I couldn't get the main points straight in my head. I knew what I wanted to say, the general idea… but the details, the stories, the examples… they were just… gone. I had to ask my wife to remind me of the parable I wanted to use. And then, even then, I stumbled over the names of the characters. It was… embarrassing, really. I usually have no trouble with that. It's little things like that, happening more and more often.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ronnald. That’s a very helpful example. It sounds like you’re experiencing difficulty with recall, specifically accessing information you usually have readily available. We'll want to explore this further. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about how long these changes have been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. It hasn't been sudden, like I said. It's been… gradual. Maybe… six months? A year, perhaps? It's hard to pinpoint, honestly. At first, it was just occasional forgetfulness. Misplacing things, forgetting appointments… things everyone does. But over time, it's become more frequent, more noticeable. My wife started gently pointing it out… saying things like, “Didn’t we just talk about this?” or “You told me that story yesterday.” It’s all a bit of a blur, really. I wish I could give you a more precise answer. I just know it’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ronnald. It's common for these things to develop gradually, and it’s not always easy to pinpoint exactly when they started. Six to twelve months is helpful information. Now, let's talk a little bit about other things going on with your health. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep, or appetite?
PATIENT: Mood… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I’ve always been a pretty cheerful sort. I get a little… frustrated sometimes, when I can’t remember things. But nothing major. Sleep… that's been a little off, maybe. I wake up a few times a night, sometimes. Nothing a glass of water can't fix. And appetite… no real changes there. I still enjoy my food, bless my wife's cooking. She makes a wonderful poisson cru. But no, nothing significant. I haven’t been feeling sick, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… tired. And forgetful. Like an old computer, I suppose. Starting to glitch.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ronnald. It's helpful that you haven't noticed any significant changes in your mood or appetite, and that you’re sleeping reasonably well. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… let me see. Nothing major, really. I had the flu a few times, of course. And a bad case of sunburn when I was a young man, foolishly spent too much time fishing. My wife always told me I'd pay for it. I had my blood pressure checked regularly for a while, but it was always normal. And… oh! I had a bit of trouble with my knee a few years back, but that cleared up with some physical therapy. Nothing chronic, nothing serious. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ronnald. It sounds like you've been generally healthy, with no major medical conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, I don't believe so. Nothing at all. I had all my teeth pulled when I was young, but that wasn't a surgery, was it? Just… extractions. No, I’ve never been under the knife, thankfully. I always avoided hospitals if I could. Too many germs, you know. I preferred to let nature take its course, whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ronnald. No surgeries at all. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… now that's a tricky one. My father… he lived to be a good age, I think. But he wasn't a man who talked much about his health. I know he had a bit of trouble with his memory towards the end, but we didn't really discuss it. My mother… she passed away when I was young, from a fever. And I don't really know much about my grandparents. They lived on a different island, and we didn't see them often. I'm afraid I don't have much information for you on that front. My family wasn't one for keeping records, you know. Mostly fishermen and farmers, simple folk. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ronnald. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing what you do know is helpful. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. No, not really. I take a little something for my blood pressure from time to time, just a small dose. But it’s not regular, only when it gets a little high. And… oh! I take a multivitamin every morning, just to keep my strength up. My wife buys them for me. She’s always looking out for me. And sometimes, when my knee aches, I take a little ibuprofen. But that's about it. Nothing major, nothing consistent. Just a few little things here and there. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ronnald. A small dose of medication for your blood pressure occasionally, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife loves to cook, and I enjoy everything she makes. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. A little bit of a runny nose sometimes when the pollen is high, but that’s all. I’ve always been a pretty robust man, all things considered. No allergies to speak of, thankfully. Is there anything else I can tell you?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ronnald. That’s very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to answer all my questions. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and a quick neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. It won’t be anything uncomfortable. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… hmm. Well, I suppose so. I haven’t had one in… goodness, years. I always avoided doctors if I could. But if it will help… yes, alright. Just… please be gentle? And don’t take too long, if you don’t mind. I get a little anxious in these situations. As long as it’s nothing too intrusive, I suppose it’s alright. Just let me know what you’re doing as you go, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ronnald. I'll explain everything as I go, and we'll take things slowly. I’ll be gentle, and we can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. First, let’s check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I’m just wrapping this cuff around your arm… and I’m taking your pulse now… Your blood pressure is 140/90. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s a bit… surprising. It’s been a long time since anyone did that to me. Everything feels a little… stiff today. It's probably just the weather. Is everything alright? Is that what you expected? I feel a little… foolish, sitting here being poked and prodded. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if you see anything concerning, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ronnald. It’s not unusual to feel a little surprised by the reflex check, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a bit stiff. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be due to a number of factors, including age and inactivity. Now, I'm going to do a brief memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Then, in a few minutes, I'll ask you to recall them again. Are you ready?
PATIENT: A memory test… hmm. Well, alright. I suppose so. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll do my best. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just… speak clearly, if you don’t mind. And don’t rush. I need a moment to process things, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ronnald. No rush at all. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, those are the words. Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Did I get them right? I hope I didn't mess that up already. My wife will tease me if I forget something so simple.
DOCTOR: You got them perfectly, Ronnald. Very good. Now, we’ll move on to the next part of the examination. I’m going to ask you a few questions about your daily life – your activities, your diet, and your general well-being. This will help me get a better understanding of your situation. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Questions about my daily life… yes, alright. I suppose so. I don’t have much of an exciting life to report, but I’ll do my best to answer your questions. Just… speak clearly, if you don’t mind. And don’t rush. I need a moment to process things, sometimes. What would you like to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your activities. On a typical day, what do you usually do?
PATIENT: On a typical day… well, that depends. I usually wake up around seven o'clock. My wife makes me breakfast, bless her heart. Then I spend some time reading my Bible and praying. I usually have some church duties to attend to – meetings, lesson planning, visiting members. Lately, I’ve been spending more time… just thinking. And less time doing. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been able to get out there much lately. It’s just… tiring. I spend a lot of time with my wife, thankfully. We watch television, read together, and go for short walks. But mostly, I’ve just been… slowing down. A lot. Does that make sense? It's not a very exciting life, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ronnald. It sounds like you’ve been reducing your activity levels recently. Now, let's talk about your diet. What does a typical meal look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, my wife is an excellent cook, so my diet is usually quite good. She makes sure I get plenty of fish, vegetables, and fruits. We eat a lot of poisson cru, it’s a family favorite. She makes a wonderful mango salsa. We try to avoid processed foods and sugary drinks. I usually have a small portion of rice with my meals. And I enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning. She makes it strong, just the way I like it. I’m not a very adventurous eater, I’m afraid. I prefer simple, home-cooked meals. Nothing fancy. But I’m well-nourished, thankfully. My wife sees to that. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ronnald. It sounds like you have a healthy and balanced diet. Now, how would you describe your general well-being?
PATIENT: My general well-being… hmm. That’s a difficult question. Physically, I don’t feel sick. I don’t have any pain or discomfort, not usually. But I’m always tired. Just… worn out. And mentally… well, that’s where things get tricky. My memory isn’t what it used to be, as we’ve discussed. I have trouble concentrating. And I feel… anxious sometimes. Just a general sense of unease. I used to feel… purposeful. Like I was making a difference. But lately, I just feel… lost. A little bit confused. It’s not a very pleasant feeling, I’m afraid. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I was asking, Ronnald. Thank you for being so open with me. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of fatigue, memory difficulties, and some anxiety. Now, let’s revisit those three words I asked you to remember earlier – apple, table, and penny. Can you recall them for me now?
PATIENT: Apple… table… oh dear. It's on the tip of my tongue… Apple… table… and… and… I’m afraid I can’t remember the third word. Apple and table… but the other one is gone. I’m so sorry. My memory is just… terrible today. I feel like I’m letting you down.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ronnald. It’s not a test, and it’s not about letting me down. It's helpful information. Based on what you’ve told me – the fatigue, memory difficulties, and the difficulty recalling those words – and the fact that these symptoms have been developing gradually over six to twelve months, I think it would be prudent to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These tests can help rule out other potential causes and allow us to determine the best course of action. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Tests… hmm. I don’t particularly like tests, if I’m being honest. But if it will help… yes, alright. I suppose so. As long as they’re not too invasive, and they don’t take too long. I just want to know what’s going on, and what I can do about it. What kind of tests are we talking about? Blood tests? A scan? I’m a little nervous, if I’m being honest. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know what to expect, if you don’t mind. And please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ronnald. I understand your nervousness, and I'll explain everything thoroughly. We’ll start with some blood tests to check your overall health, including your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and to rule out any infections. We will also do a complete metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver functions. We’ll also do a cognitive assessment, which is a series of simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. I'm also considering ordering a brain scan - either a CT scan or an MRI - to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. However, we can discuss that further before proceeding, as it involves a bit more preparation. The blood tests and cognitive assessment can be done here in the clinic today. The brain scan can be scheduled at a nearby imaging center at your convenience. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a cognitive assessment… alright. I suppose so. That sounds… manageable. A brain scan… hmm. I’m not so sure about that. It sounds a little scary, if I’m being honest. Maybe we can hold off on that for now? Just do the blood tests and the cognitive assessment? Let’s see what those results say before we go any further? I just… I’m not a fan of scans, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ronnald. We can absolutely hold off on the brain scan for now. Let's start with the blood tests and the cognitive assessment, and then we can discuss the results and decide if further imaging is necessary. I'll have my nurse, Leilani, come in and draw your blood. The cognitive assessment will take about 30-45 minutes, and I’ll administer it here in the examination room. In the meantime, I want to assure you that these tests are simply to gather information. They don’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We’re just trying to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, so we can develop the best plan of care for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood tests and the cognitive assessment… yes, that sounds… acceptable. And you think those will give us a clearer picture? That’s reassuring. Tell Leilani to be gentle, if you don’t mind. I don’t like needles, if you haven’t noticed. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ronnald. I’m glad I could help ease your anxiety. I will make sure Leilani is aware of your concerns regarding needles, and she’ll be as gentle as possible. Leilani, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Here we go… I hope it doesn’t hurt too much.
DOCTOR: Leilani will be with you in a moment, Ronnald. Just take a few deep breaths, and try to relax. Remember, it will be over before you know it. I’ll be right here with you throughout the process, so you’re not alone. Just focus on your breathing, and we’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not very pleasant. Is it almost over?
DOCTOR: Almost done, Ronnald. Just a few more seconds. You're doing great. There we go, all finished. Leilani will apply a little pressure to the site. Excellent. You were very brave. Now, let’s get you comfortable and we can begin the cognitive assessment.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Finally over. Thank you, Leilani. Alright. The cognitive assessment, you said? Let’s get it over with. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully, find some answers.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ronnald. I understand your eagerness to get answers. The cognitive assessment is a series of simple questions and tasks that will help me evaluate your memory, thinking skills, and language abilities. It’s not a test, and there are no right or wrong answers. We’re just trying to get a better understanding of how your brain is functioning. We'll start with a few simple recall questions. I'm going to say three unrelated words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them again later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright. Three words, you said? Yes, I’m ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The three words are: chair, flower, book. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Chair… flower… book. Yes, those are the words. Chair, flower, book. Chair, flower, book. Did I get them right? I hope I didn't mess that up already. My memory is just… terrible today.
DOCTOR: You got them perfectly, Ronnald. Very good. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of simple questions. First, what is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… hmm. That's a good question. Let me think… Is it August? Yes, I think it's August… But what's the day? I’m afraid I can’t remember the exact date. I know it’s August, but the day is… slipping away from me. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ronnald. Don’t worry about it. It’s perfectly normal to forget things sometimes. We'll move on to the next question. Do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: The year… hmm. That’s a tough one. Is it… 2024? No… I think it’s later than that. Is it 2025? I think it’s 2025, but I’m not entirely sure. My sense of time is… off lately. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ronnald. It is 2025. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat a phrase after me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The phrase is: "The early bird catches the worm." Can you repeat that for me?
PATIENT: “The early… bird… catches… the worm.” “The early bird catches the worm.” Did I say that correctly? It feels… awkward. My tongue feels a little… clumsy.
DOCTOR: You said it perfectly, Ronnald. It may feel awkward, but you repeated it correctly. Now, let's try a slightly different task. I'm going to show you a picture, and I want you to tell me what you see in it. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: What do you see in this picture?
PATIENT: That’s… a clock. A clock with hands. It’s… telling the time, I think. It’s a simple clock. Is that what you wanted to know? It's just a clock. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, it's a clock. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock face, showing a specific time. Can you draw a clock face, showing ten past eleven?
PATIENT: Draw a clock face… ten past eleven? Oh dear. I’m afraid I can’t. I haven’t drawn anything in years. My hands… they’re not steady. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ronnald. It’s perfectly okay if you’re not comfortable drawing. Don't worry about it at all. We’ve completed the cognitive assessment for now. Based on the results of this assessment, and your medical history, it appears you may be experiencing some cognitive difficulties. These could be due to a number of factors, and it’s important to investigate further. Would you like to discuss some potential causes and next steps?
PATIENT: Potential causes… yes, please. I just want to know what’s going on, and what I can do about it. I’m not afraid of bad news, as long as I know what I’m facing. What do you think is going on? And what can we do about it? I'm trusting you to guide me through this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ronnald. Based on your symptoms – the fatigue, memory difficulties, and the performance on the assessment – several possibilities come to mind. One possibility is that you're experiencing age-related cognitive decline, which is a normal part of aging for some people. However, your symptoms seem to be progressing more quickly than would typically be expected with normal aging. Another possibility is that you have mild cognitive impairment , which is an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia. MCI can cause noticeable memory and thinking problems, but it doesn’t necessarily interfere with daily life. Less commonly, these symptoms could be caused by other factors, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even depression. And in some cases, they could be an early sign of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I recommend running some additional tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin B12 level. We may also consider a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be open to these tests?
PATIENT: Dementia… Oh dear. I… I suppose so. If it will help, I’m willing to do the tests. Blood tests, thyroid… the MRI… Yes, whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. But… what if it is dementia? What are the treatment options if it is dementia? And… what does that mean for my future? I’m scared, Doctor. Very scared.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re scared, Ronnald. It’s natural to feel anxious when faced with the possibility of a serious diagnosis. Let's not jump to conclusions before we have all the facts. We haven't even run the tests yet, and it could be something completely different. But I understand your concerns, and I'll address them as honestly and openly as possible. If it is dementia, there are several treatment options available. While there's currently no cure for dementia, there are medications that can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. These medications work by increasing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain that are involved in memory and thinking. There are also several non-medication therapies that can be very helpful, such as cognitive stimulation therapy, physical exercise, and support groups. These therapies can help improve your quality of life and maintain your independence for as long as possible. And importantly, you wouldn't be alone. I can connect you with resources and support groups in the community, where you can meet other people who are going through the same thing. Your family and I will also be here to support you every step of the way. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. Then, we’ll review the results together and discuss the best course of action. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Let's schedule the tests. The sooner we know, the sooner we can start dealing with it. And… yes, please connect me with those support groups. It would be good to talk to other people who understand what I’m going through. And… thank you, Doctor. For being honest with me, and for not dismissing my concerns. I feel a little less scared now, knowing that I’m not alone. Let’s get those tests scheduled. And… whatever comes next, I'll face it with your help.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ronnald. I’m glad to hear that. Okay, I’ve scheduled a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin B12 level for next week. And I’ll also schedule a brain MRI for the following week. I’ll have my nurse, Leilani, contact you with the details. In the meantime, I’ll give you some information about local support groups and resources for people with cognitive impairment. And please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get through this together, Ronnald. And remember, you’re not alone. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for today. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very kind and patient. I suppose I’ll just… go home and try to relax. And wait for the test results. It’s going to be a long week. But… thank you again, Doctor. For giving me hope. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ronnald. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. I'll see you next week. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
