DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's August 2nd, 2025. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um... well, honestly, it's about a test, I think? Something to do with... checking what's in my system? My daughter set it up, bless her heart. She worries so. I can't really recall all the details, it was a bit of a rush getting here.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like your daughter scheduled you for some lab work. Let me see… ah, yes. It looks like she scheduled a comprehensive metabolic panel and a lipid panel for you. Those tests check your blood sugar, kidney and liver function, cholesterol levels, and a few other things. Is that sounding familiar?
PATIENT: Oh, those are big words! No, not really. My daughter… she’s always been good with that sort of thing. Blood sugar, you say? I do love a good pastry now and then… Is that bad? I mostly just remember her saying I needed to get this done for… well, for everything to be okay. It's Medicare covering it, right? I wouldn’t want any surprises on the bill.
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad to enjoy a pastry occasionally! We all deserve a little treat now and then. The blood sugar test is just a routine check to see how your body is processing sugar. It helps us make sure everything is working as it should. And yes, Medicare is covering the tests. We verify insurance before any procedures, so you shouldn’t have any surprises. Before we get too far, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear about the Medicare. My husband, bless his soul, always took care of all that. As for my health… well, I work, you know? Paving, mostly. It keeps me moving, which is good. I’m not one to sit still. I’ve always been pretty strong, I guess. No major problems, not that I recall. I get tired sometimes, but who doesn't? I had a little trouble with my back a few years ago, but that’s mostly sorted now. Is there anything specific you’re wanting to know? My memory isn't what it used to be, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s good you stay active with your work, Ms. Hughston. Staying active is very important. And it’s completely normal for things to take a little longer to bounce back as we get older. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. When you say you had trouble with your back a few years ago, was that treated with medication, physical therapy, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the back… it was awful for a bit. Let me think… Doctor Miller, a very nice man, gave me some pills, strong ones, for the pain. They helped, but they made me feel a bit… foggy, you know? So I stopped taking them after a while. Then I went to a physical therapist, a young woman, very energetic. She had me doing all sorts of stretches and exercises. That helped a lot more, I think. I did that for a few months. And then it just… got better. Slowly, but surely. I still try to do some of those stretches at home now and then, just to keep everything loose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So you were prescribed pain medication, and then you had physical therapy which helped significantly. Do you recall the name of the medication, or roughly when you were taking it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Names… they just slip my mind. It was a little white pill, I think. Small, definitely. And I think… I think I was taking it around… 2022, maybe? Or 2023? It was right after my husband passed, everything was a bit of a blur. I mostly remember trying to get through each day. I wasn’t really paying attention to the details, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Hughston. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly normal to not remember details from that time. We can always look it up in your medication history if you'd like. For now, let's move on to other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don’t think so, not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything over the years. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the sun, but I just put some lotion on it. Is that an allergy? I suppose I could say I'm allergic to being cold, but that's not very helpful, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound like a true allergy, Ms. Hughston. It's good you haven't had any serious reactions to anything. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, I take a little pill for my blood pressure, Doctor Ramirez prescribed it last year. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind, you know? Just when I really need it. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, my daughter told me to. She said I wasn't getting enough sun. I think that's it. Nothing else that I can recall. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re taking a medication for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a vitamin D supplement. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… names again! It's a little blue pill, I think. And it starts with an 'A', maybe? I’m terrible with remembering those things. I just ask the pharmacist to fill the prescription every month. He’s a very nice young man, always helpful. I suppose I could look at the bottle, but I left my purse in the car… It’s a bit of a walk to get it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Hughston. Don’t worry about it. We can look it up in your medication history. One moment... Ah, yes. It’s amlodipine. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Amlodipine, that's it! See, my daughter told me once, but it just doesn’t stick. Family history… hmm. My mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble. He smoked a lot, you know. Not a good habit. And my brother… he had high blood pressure too, like me. I don’t know… it’s all a bit fuzzy. Everyone lived to a pretty good age, if I recall correctly. But they all had something, it seems. It's just…normal for getting older, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like there's a family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and high blood pressure. Knowing that helps us understand your risk factors better. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, I don’t smoke. Never have. My husband tried it once, and it didn’t agree with him at all. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly on special occasions. And recreational drugs? Oh, no, definitely not. I’m a bit too old for all that nonsense. I just like to relax at home with a good book and a cup of tea. That’s my idea of a good time. Though, my daughter did mention something about this test being for… something else? Is this about more than just my regular check-up?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And you are right to ask about why your daughter scheduled this test. She is concerned about possible exposure to mold in your home. She reported some concerns about visible mold and possible health symptoms you’ve been experiencing. The tests we're doing today will help us determine if there's any evidence of mold exposure affecting your health. That’s why we're also checking some additional markers. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Mold? Oh, dear. Well, that explains it. Yes, I have noticed a bit of a musty smell in the basement lately. I thought it was just the dampness, you know? It's an old house. And I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, and a little… foggy, like I said before. And my joints have been aching more too. I didn't really put it all together. My daughter… she always worries so. Is it serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? I don't want to have to move, you know? I've lived in that house for a long time.
DOCTOR: It’s good that we're getting to the bottom of this, Ms. Hughston. It's understandable to be concerned. While mold exposure can cause health problems, it's important to remember that many people experience mild symptoms, and it's often treatable. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. We’ll start with the bloodwork today. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to ask a few questions about your symptoms. You mentioned fatigue, fogginess, and joint pain. Could you tell me a little more about each of these?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, the fatigue… it’s just that I feel tired all the time. Even after a good night’s sleep. It’s not like the regular tiredness you get after a long day of work. It's more… deep-down tiredness. It makes it hard to get motivated to do anything. And the fogginess… it’s hard to explain. It’s like my brain is slow. I have trouble remembering things, like names and dates. And I have trouble concentrating. It's frustrating, you know? And the joint pain… it's mostly in my knees and hips. It’s achy and stiff, especially in the mornings. It gets better after I move around a bit, but it’s always there, lurking in the background. It's just… annoying, mostly. But lately, it's been worse than usual. Is that what you wanted to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, that’s very helpful. It sounds like you’re experiencing significant fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and joint pain. These symptoms are consistent with possible mold exposure, but they can also be caused by other conditions. That's why it's important to rule out other possibilities. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A quick check-up sounds fine. I don't mind a bit. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be, you know? And my back… well, we already talked about my back. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, let's check your joints. Could you please bend your knees for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. There we go... that's about as far as I can go without too much discomfort. They feel a little stiff, you know? And a little achy. It’s not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like they need a good oiling. Is that what you're looking for, Doctor? I don't want to cause you any trouble. I'm just an old woman, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. There's some mild crepitus when you bend your knees, which is common with age-related wear and tear. There's no significant swelling or redness. It appears to be mild arthritis, consistent with your history. I'm just checking to rule out anything more serious. Now, let's check your hips. Could you please lie down on your back for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. I’m not as flexible as I used to be, you know. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, alright? My hips haven’t been the same since I had my daughter.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hughston. Just relax as much as possible. There is some mild restriction in your range of motion, and you report some discomfort with external rotation. No sharp pain, which is good. It appears to be mild arthritis in your hips as well. Alright, that completes the physical exam. We'll send the blood samples to the lab for analysis. We're checking for inflammation markers, mold toxins, and a complete metabolic panel. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A few days, you say? That doesn’t sound too bad. Hmm… Well, what happens if they do find something? What if it is the mold? Will I have to move? I don’t want to move, Doctor. I’ve lived in that house for a long time. It’s full of memories. And what about the fogginess? Will that go away? It’s just… frustrating, you know? I can’t even remember what I had for breakfast sometimes! I’m probably just being an old worrywart. But still… it’s good to know what to expect, you know?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Hughston. Let's address them one at a time. If the lab results do indicate mold exposure, we’ll discuss the best course of action. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll have to move. The first step would be to identify the source of the mold and remediate it. Professional mold remediation services can safely remove the mold and prevent it from returning. As for the fogginess, if it’s related to mold exposure, removing yourself from the source of exposure and addressing the underlying health issues should improve your cognitive function. It may take some time, but many people experience significant improvement with treatment. We may also consider referral to a neurologist if the symptoms persist. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some supportive care measures, such as staying hydrated, getting enough rest, and eating a healthy diet. We'll also monitor your symptoms closely. I’ll also send a referral for a professional home inspection to assess for mold growth. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… good. A reasonable plan, yes. I’m glad you’re not talking about me having to move right away. That house… it means a lot to me. And the home inspection sounds like a good idea. I’m just glad we’re getting to the bottom of this. And the supportive care… yes, I can do that. Hydrate, rest, healthy diet. It’s just… hard sometimes. But I’ll try. I’m an old woman, but I’m not completely helpless yet! Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I need to do? Or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will provide you with some information about supportive care measures and the home inspection referral. She’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the lab results and develop a treatment plan. There is a consent form for the bloodwork that she will have you sign. I'll also send a copy of my notes to your primary care physician, Dr. Ramirez, so she's aware of our findings. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A consent form, yes. And sending it to Doctor Ramirez… good idea. She’s a very good doctor. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate it. I think I’ll go home now and try to get some rest. And maybe drink a glass of water. And try not to worry too much. Though that's easier said than done. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It was a pleasure meeting you. Just take it one step at a time, and don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be right in to assist you. Have a good day, and get some rest.
