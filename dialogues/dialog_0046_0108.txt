DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's about time someone asked. Honestly, it’s… embarrassing, to be frank. It's my stomach. Been bleeding, off and on, for a couple weeks now. Not a good look, let me tell ya. And it's not like I want to be here, wasting my time and yours.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It's certainly not easy talking about something like this, and you're not wasting anyone’s time. We're here to help. When you say "bleeding," could you describe what that looks like?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean describe it? It's…blood. Coming out of where you think blood comes out. Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? It’s dark, mostly. Sometimes brighter. In the toilet, obviously. And in… well, you know. It’s not a pleasant thing to talk about. It’s enough to say it's blood, isn't it? You’re the doctor, you figure out the details.
DOCTOR: You're right to expect me to help figure out the details, and I apologize if my questions feel too specific. It's just that the color and amount of blood can give us important clues. You mentioned dark and sometimes brighter – is it consistently dark, or does it vary significantly?
PATIENT: Varies. Like I said. Some days it’s just…a little bit. Enough to kinda color the water. Other days it’s more… substantial. Like a small cut, maybe? I don’t know. I’m not good at estimating. And honestly, I try not to look too closely. It makes me queasy, if you must know. It’s just… worrying. And I haven't got the energy for worry, not these days. You understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Gentz. It’s perfectly reasonable not to want to examine it closely. “Like a small cut” is helpful, thank you. Has this been happening with every bowel movement, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Intermittent. Definitely intermittent. It's not with every time. More like… every other time? Sometimes a few days in between. I try to keep track, but it’s hard when you’re… preoccupied. And it’s not like I’m keeping a logbook, you know? Just trying to get through the day, honestly. It started maybe two, three weeks ago, now. Around the time… well, never mind. Doesn't matter. It's just been happening.
DOCTOR: You mentioned it started around a certain time. While you don't have to share details you're not comfortable with, sometimes stressful events can contribute to these kinds of symptoms. Just knowing if there was a particular change or stressor around that time can be helpful. And, going back to the bleeding, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Stressful events? Ha. What isn't stressful these days? Alright, fine. It started… right after the anniversary. My wife, you see. Passed away a year ago. It’s… hard. Still. And I’ve been… not myself, naturally. Eating’s been… irregular. Lost some weight. And tired. Just… really tired. Beyond normal tired. And weak, sometimes. But who isn’t, these days? Other symptoms… not really. Just… the bleeding and the general feeling of… ugh. Discomfort, I suppose. Not pain, exactly. Just… off. Everything's just off. .
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Gentz. It's completely understandable that you're not feeling yourself, and it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of grief. Weight loss, fatigue, and feeling "off" are all things we'd expect with significant stress and loss, but we do need to rule out any medical causes for the bleeding specifically. To do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any previous stomach issues, like ulcers or colitis?
