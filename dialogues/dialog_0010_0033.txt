DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the time for this. It’s… well, my vision and hearing. They’ve just gone. Rather suddenly, I might add. It's quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Suddenly, as in… over what timeframe would you say you noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it all blurs together, doesn’t it? Perhaps a week? Maybe less. It’s difficult to say. I simply woke up one morning and things weren’t… clear. And the sounds... muffled. It's really quite bothersome when one has engagements, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, about a week. And you said both vision and hearing affected?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though I suspect the hearing is the more… distressing. One can deal with poor eyesight, you see. But not being able to properly hear… it’s just… rude. I had a luncheon planned, and frankly, I couldn't make head nor tail of the conversation. It was… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. And was there anything specific happening before this started?
PATIENT: Before? Goodness, what does one do before anything happens? I lead a very full life, Doctor. Luncheons, charity events… I can't possibly recall if anything was… different. Perhaps a slight chill? Honestly, I wouldn't remember. I have a housekeeper for these sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. Regarding your hearing, is it in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. It’s not as if I’ve been meticulously cataloging the decibel levels in each ear, Doctor. It’s simply… quiet. A general muffling. And quite frankly, it's exhausting trying to compensate. I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. And has this been accompanied by any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or pain?
PATIENT: Ringing? No. Pain? Certainly not. I’m not prone to such… vulgar displays of discomfort. Dizziness… well, sometimes I feel a little lightheaded, but that's usually from skipping lunch. Honestly, Doctor, is this going to be a lengthy process? I have a fitting at three.
DOCTOR: Okay. No ringing, no pain, occasional lightheadedness. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. It will help me narrow down the possibilities. Just a simple check of your ears and a brief neurological assessment. Then we can discuss next steps. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. But please be quick about it. I truly haven’t got all day. And do be gentle. I’ve just had my hair done.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with your ears. Please look straight ahead. Hmm. Both ear canals appear clear, no signs of wax buildup or infection. Now, I’m going to test your hearing with this tuning fork. I'll place it on your forehead and ask you to tell me when you can no longer hear it. Can you hear the tone?
PATIENT: Faintly. Very faintly. Honestly, Doctor, is this absolutely necessary? It’s barely audible. And it’s giving me a rather unpleasant headache. Perhaps we should skip the theatrics and move directly to a diagnosis? I’m a busy woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your reported symptoms and the initial exam, it sounds like we're dealing with a sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss, potentially affecting both ears. We need to rule out some other possibilities. I’d like to order an audiogram – a detailed hearing test – to get a clearer picture of the extent of the loss. I will also order an MRI to rule out any structural problems. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, the inconvenience! Is it absolutely necessary? I have a luncheon next week, and I’m rather certain a head scan won’t be conducive to looking presentable. I suppose an audiogram is… tolerable, but I expect it to be swift and painless. And please ensure the technician is discreet. I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Julie. However, given the sudden onset and bilateral nature of the hearing loss, an MRI is a standard precaution to rule out any underlying cause that requires immediate attention. It's important to be thorough. The MRI will be done by a qualified technician, and we’ll do our best to accommodate your schedule. It is a non-invasive procedure. Let’s proceed with both the audiogram and the MRI. I’ll have the order sent to the radiology department. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a short course of high-dose steroids. These can sometimes help to recover hearing in cases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Would you like me to explain the side effects?
PATIENT: Steroids? Oh, goodness. Well, I suppose if it might restore my hearing… But I’m not fond of medications. I simply loathe feeling unwell. A short course, you say? Very short. And absolutely no weight gain. I have a gala coming up. Explain the side effects, if you must, but keep it brief. I have a fitting at three, remember? And please, Doctor, I trust you'll ensure this entire process is as… unobtrusive as possible. I have a reputation.
DOCTOR: Certainly. As you can see, the most common side effects are temporary. We’ll monitor you closely, and the dosage is designed to minimize these effects. I will also give you a referral to an audiologist for the hearing test. I’ve included their contact information in this packet as well. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Honestly, Doctor, the less information, the better. I trust you're competent. Just ensure the entire process doesn’t interfere with my social engagements. And please, send the results directly to my personal assistant. She handles these matters. I have a reputation, you understand. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’m overdue for my fitting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I've noted your assistant’s contact information. We will ensure the results are sent directly to them. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns. Have a pleasant afternoon, and a successful fitting.
