DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom rather a lot lately. More than usual, definitely. It’s just… frequent, I suppose. I don’t really know why it’s happening, and it’s becoming a bit of a nuisance. I apologize for not being more… specific. It’s difficult to explain, and honestly, I haven't been keeping track of details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. It's not always easy to talk about these things. Frequent urination can be caused by a number of things, and we'll figure it out. When you say "a lot," could you give me a rough estimate of how often you’re going compared to, say, a typical day a few months ago?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A rough estimate… that’s tricky. A few months ago? Hmm… I’d say, normally, I’d go maybe four or five times a day. Perhaps less, if I’m being honest. Now… it feels like every couple of hours, even if I haven’t had much to drink. Sometimes more often, especially if I’m out and about. It’s quite disruptive, and I worry about… well, finding a bathroom when I need one. I’m afraid I don’t keep a precise log, Doctor. I wish I did! It’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about the log, Ms. MacVittie. We can work with what you remember. And it is disruptive, and anxiety about finding a bathroom certainly doesn't help. Now, besides the frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. I… I don't believe so. No pain or burning, thankfully. Nothing like that. Just… the needing to go all the time. Sometimes, I feel like I need to go, but then not much comes out. That happens occasionally. And I think… I think I’ve been a little more thirsty lately. Is that relevant? It’s hard to tell if it's the weather, to be honest. It's been quite warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No pain or burning is good. Feeling like you need to go but little output, and increased thirst… those are relevant. It sounds like we need to rule out a few things. Do you have any history of diabetes, or does anyone in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Not that I’m aware of. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father had heart problems. But no diabetes, to my knowledge. I wasn’t very close to either of them, so I don’t recall much about their medical history. I’m divorced, and my ex-husband’s family… well, let’s just say I don't have contact with them. I haven’t really ever needed to inquire about family medical history before this, Doctor. I apologize for my lack of information. Is it important that I get that information now?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. MacVittie, don't apologize at all. Many people don’t have that information readily available. Knowing is helpful, but it's not a deal-breaker. Since we're unsure about family history, let's proceed with some basic tests. We'll start with a urine sample to check for infection, and a blood sugar test to rule out diabetes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A urine sample and a blood sugar test. Yes, please. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. Where would I… provide the sample? And will the blood sugar test require fasting? I had a rather large breakfast this morning. I suppose I should have remembered that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. MacVittie, don't worry about the breakfast just yet. We can do a random blood sugar test, though a fasting one is more accurate, of course. We'll start with the random one, and if it's elevated, we'll schedule you for a fasting test. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I'll give you a collection cup and instructions. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means let a little bit go first, then collect the sample. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Mid-stream… yes, I think I understand. Let a little go first, then collect the rest. It's been a long time since I've had to do anything like this. Will there be… a specific container? And is there anything else I should be aware of? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor, but I feel rather flustered. Is there anything I should do before the blood test, aside from not eating? I take a vitamin supplement every morning, should I skip that today?
DOCTOR: You're not being a nuisance at all, Ms. MacVittie, please don't apologize. It’s good you ask. Yes, this is a sterile collection cup. And yes, the vitamin supplement – it’s best to skip that this morning for the most accurate results. Just bring the sample back to me when you're done, and we'll proceed with the blood test. It’s just a standard prick of the finger. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Skip the vitamin, mid-stream sample, and a finger prick. I believe I can manage that. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. MacVittie. I'll be right here when you get back.
