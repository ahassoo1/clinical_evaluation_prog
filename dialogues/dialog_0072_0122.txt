DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I am… concerned. I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly, but… more lately. And my blood pressure, it is not good. They said it could be… connected. I want to find out what is happening, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: I see. Forgetting things and elevated blood pressure. Understandable that would be concerning. Let’s start with the memory issues. When did you first begin noticing these… lapses?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. It… began maybe six months ago? At first, it was just… misplacing my keys. Or forgetting a name, you know? A friend’s name. Not important names, but… irritating. Now… now I repeat myself. I ask the same questions. I… I worry I will forget something very important. It is frightening.
DOCTOR: Frightening is a reasonable description. And these repetitions… can you give me an example of a recent instance?
PATIENT: Just yesterday, actually. My… my neighbor, Dimitri. He brought me tomatoes from his garden. Very kind. I thanked him, we chatted… and then, five minutes later, I asked him again if they were good tomatoes. And then again. He was very polite, but I could see he was… puzzled. I apologized, of course, but it is happening more and more. It is… embarrassing. And it is not just Dimitri.
DOCTOR: I understand. And this has been occurring with increasing frequency over the past six months. Now, let’s discuss your blood pressure. Do you know what your recent readings have been?
PATIENT: Yes. My… my friend, Irina, she is a nurse. She checks it for me. It is… usually high. Very high. Last time, it was… 160 over 95, I believe. She worries, of course. She says I must see a doctor. Which is why I am here. I do not like taking medicine, if it can be avoided. But I understand it may be necessary.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95 is elevated, yes. We'll need to confirm that reading, of course, but it’s certainly concerning. Now, aside from Irina checking it, have you had any symptoms related to your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Sometimes… a headache. Not a terrible headache, more like… pressure. In the back of my head. And… occasionally, I feel… dizzy. Just for a moment. When I stand up too quickly, perhaps. But it is not constant. I thought it was just… getting older. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Headaches and occasional dizziness are non-specific symptoms, Ms. Alvara. Many things can cause them. We need to rule out more serious causes. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well. I had pneumonia, many years ago. When I was… forty, perhaps? I recovered fully. And… my late husband, Boris, he said I had… anxiety. But he was always… dramatic. I did not see a doctor for it. Just… worried a lot. Otherwise, I have been… healthy, for the most part. Is that important? The anxiety, I mean.
DOCTOR: It is all relevant, Ms. Alvara. While your husband's assessment is… subjective, a history of anxiety can sometimes contribute to blood pressure fluctuations. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes. When I was a young woman, I had my… my appendix removed. A very long time ago. And… Boris, he had a knee replacement. But that was him, not me. Is this… necessary? All of this? I came about the memory.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Alvara. We must have a complete picture before determining the cause of your symptoms. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… my mother… she had heart trouble. She died when she was seventy, I believe. From a… a stroke, perhaps? It was a long time ago. My father… he lived to be a very old man. But he was… stubborn. He refused to see a doctor. He said doctors only made things worse. Is this helping? The memory problems are what I am concerned about.
DOCTOR: A family history of heart disease is significant, Ms. Alvara. It does contribute to our overall assessment. Now, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? What does that mean? I… I live alone. Since Boris passed. I have friends, of course. Irina, Dimitri… I go to the market, I garden. I read. Is that what you mean? I do not… go to parties. Or… anything like that.
DOCTOR: I need to know if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs, Ms. Alvara. It is important for a complete medical picture.
PATIENT: Excuse me? I am a respectable woman! I do not… I have never! I do not smoke, I drink a small glass of red wine with dinner, sometimes. And I certainly do not… indulge in anything like that. That is… a rather insulting question, Doctor.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Alvara. It is standard procedure to ask about such things. It does not imply any judgment. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my arthritis. In my hands. It helps with the pain. And… sometimes, a sleeping pill, if I cannot sleep. But that is rare. Are we getting anywhere? I still worry about the memory… and I would like to know what is happening. It is unsettling to forget things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. No. Not that I am aware of. I eat everything. I have never had a reaction to anything. Boris was the one with allergies. He was allergic to… cats, I think. But I do not. Perhaps we can now discuss the memory? I am becoming very anxious.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Alvara. I believe we have sufficient information for a preliminary examination. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a brief neurological assessment. It will involve some simple memory and coordination tests. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. Finally. That is… acceptable. Please, get on with it. I would like to know what is happening as soon as possible. This… waiting is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please remain still and relax your arm. First, let's check your blood pressure. 158 over 92. As expected, it is elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, let's do a few simple tests to assess your memory. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. It is… August 2nd. 2025. Yes. August 2nd, 2025. Is that… correct? I sometimes… lose track of time.
DOCTOR: Correct. And now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words to me. I will say them slowly, and you repeat them back to me immediately. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes. Ready. Please, go ahead. I hope I remember them…
DOCTOR: The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… and… hmm. Penny! Yes. Apple, Table, Penny. I believe that is correct.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “WORLD” backwards.
PATIENT: Backwards… hmm. That is… difficult. Let me see. D-L-R-O-W. No… R-O-W-L-D? No… Oh dear. I am terrible at this. I am usually very good with words. It is just… coming slowly today.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I'd like to check your coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes. Of course. I can do that. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger… up and down… left and right… Good. Now, can you tell me what year the American Civil War ended?
PATIENT: The American… Civil War? Oh dear. It was… a long time ago. Let me see… Was it… 1865? No… wait. 1863? I… I am not entirely sure. It was a very long time ago. It is… slipping my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Based on the preliminary examination, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive impairment, particularly with short-term memory and recall. Your blood pressure is also significantly elevated, which could be contributing to these symptoms. It is too early to provide a definitive diagnosis without further testing. I recommend we order a complete blood workup, including a thyroid panel and vitamin B12 levels. We also need to schedule an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Additionally, I’d like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. In the meantime, I am going to prescribe a low dose of Lisinopril to help control your blood pressure. It’s important that you take this medication as directed. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI…? A neurologist…? Oh dear. Is it… serious, Doctor? Is it… Alzheimer’s? I have heard… terrible things. And what about the medication? Will it have side effects? I… I do not want to feel worse. This is… very frightening. I just want to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, it's understandable that you're frightened. However, it is far too early to jump to conclusions. Many things can cause memory problems and elevated blood pressure. It could be a number of factors – stress, vitamin deficiencies, even a reaction to certain medications. The MRI and neurological evaluation are simply to rule out more serious causes and get a clearer picture of what we're dealing with. Regarding the Lisinopril, it's a very common medication for high blood pressure. Some people experience mild side effects like a dry cough or dizziness, but these are usually temporary and can be managed. We will start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. I will write you a prescription for the Lisinopril and a referral to Dr. Chen, a highly respected neurologist. We will schedule the MRI as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce stress, get regular exercise, and eat a healthy diet. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Dr. Chen… I will… write that down. And the MRI… as soon as possible… Will I be able to… drive myself to the appointments? And… what if they find something… serious? What are the… options, if that happens? It is just… a lot to take in. And I am… alone. I do not have anyone to help me with this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, that is perfectly understandable. It is a lot to process. Regarding driving, it's best to have someone drive you to the MRI, as you may be given a mild sedative to help you relax. It’s also recommended to have someone with you for the neurological appointment. As for what if they find something serious, we will discuss all of your options thoroughly. There are many treatments available for various neurological conditions, and we will work together to develop a plan that is best for you. We will focus on maintaining your quality of life and ensuring you have the support you need. I understand you are alone, and that makes things even more difficult. The hospital has a social worker who can assist you with resources and support services. I will write a referral for you. They can help you with transportation, financial assistance, and emotional support. I want you to know you are not alone in this, Ms. Alvara. We will face this together. Do you have any questions about the social worker referral, or anything else at this time?
PATIENT: A social worker… yes. That… would be helpful. Very helpful. Transportation… and someone to explain things… I think… that is all for now, Doctor. You have… answered everything. I will write down everything you said. And I will… schedule the appointments. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We will do everything we can to help you. Here are the referrals and the prescription. And please, take care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
