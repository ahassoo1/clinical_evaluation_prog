DOCTOR: Right. Carla Cassimatis, 70 years old… Yes, yes. Look, I’m quite busy today, so let’s get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Osga. Yes, busy, I understand completely. It’s my skin. It’s been…itchy. Really itchy, all over. Not like a bug bite itchy, but just… constantly irritating. It’s been going on for a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Itchy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, itchy. And… it’s worse at night, if that makes any difference. Keeps me up sometimes. It's just… driving me crazy. I’ve tried lotions, you know, regular moisturizers, but they don’t seem to do much.
DOCTOR: Lotions. Hmm. Well, those rarely do much, do they?
PATIENT: No, not really. I figured it was worth a try, you know? Just something simple. I don’t… I don’t really know what would help, that’s why I came. Is it… something I should be worried about? I don't usually bother doctors for little things.
DOCTOR: “Little things.” Right. Well, everything feels important when it's you itching, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: You’re not wrong. It’s hard to think about anything else when you're constantly uncomfortable. I just... I haven't changed anything in my routine, haven’t eaten anything different. I'm retired, so I’m not really stressed either. That's why I'm puzzled.
DOCTOR: Retired… Right. Less exposure to… things. Okay. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. No rash, no bumps, just…the itching. My skin feels a little dry, I suppose, but I live in Florida, so it’s usually pretty humid. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to just…getting older. I do sleep a little less because of the itch, so maybe that’s it?
DOCTOR: Dry skin, fatigue, itching… Sounds like you're just… existing. Alright, let's have a look at it. Please, hop up on the examination table. Don't worry, I won't be long.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, of course. Existing… That’s a way to put it. I do hope it’s something simple, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin is…normal color. No visible rash. Some dryness, but nothing alarming. Blood pressure is… elevated, but not critically so. And… yes, you're a little overweight. Alright. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never really had problems with food or anything like that. I mean, I’ve always been careful. My mother used to say I had a cast iron stomach. Never really needed to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Cast iron stomach… Yes, well, things change. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No, none. That's the thing, I don't take anything. Not even vitamins, really. I always figured if I was feeling okay, there wasn’t any need to add things in. I try to eat healthy, get some sunshine… keep it simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. That simplifies things. So, you’re retired, healthy lifestyle, no allergies… and itchy. It could be a number of things. Dry skin exacerbated by…Florida. Sometimes the humidity isn’t enough.
PATIENT: So, it could just be the humidity? That would be good. I mean, I can deal with that. I can use extra lotion, maybe a humidifier at night. Is there anything I should look for? Any sign that it’s something more serious?
DOCTOR: Look, I don’t want to scare you, but…anything can be serious. It’s medicine. But, given your history, and lack of other symptoms… let's try a stronger moisturizer. Something with ceramides. And, if it doesn't improve in two weeks, or if you develop a rash, fever, or anything else…then come back. I suppose.
PATIENT: Okay. Ceramides. I'll… look for that. And come back if it gets worse. That sounds…reasonable. Is there a brand you recommend? I’m not very good with these things, I always just grabbed whatever was on sale.
DOCTOR: Honestly?
PATIENT: Yes?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t matter. Just…look at the label. Ceramides. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just the itch, really. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I appreciate you seeing me. I'll get the lotion and see how it goes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the lotion. Here’s a printout of my notes. Next.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again. I hope you have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Mmhmm. .
