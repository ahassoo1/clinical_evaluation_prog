DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just... tired. Real tired. And I eat dirt. Not like on purpose, you know? Just... it feels good. It's stupid, I know. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Right. "Tired," and… you ingest soil. Okay. Let's start with the tiredness. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: More? It's just... always. Like, I wake up tired. Work all day, get more tired. Then I go to bed, and I'm still tired. It's been... a while. Months, I guess? I don't really keep track. It’s not like I'm doing anything to get tired, either. Just... life, I guess. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. When you say "tired," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Ugh. Like... heavy. Everything feels heavy. My arms, my legs, even my eyes. Like I'm walking through water, all the time. And I can't... focus. Things just... blur. Not my eyes blurring, just... my brain. It's annoying. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s important to get a good understanding of what's going on, Ms. Cantoran. We'll try to be efficient. This feeling of heaviness... does it come on suddenly, or is it more gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It didn't just happen one day. It's just... gotten worse. Slowly. I don't know... a few months ago, I could still... do things. Now? I just want to sit. And eat dirt. Honestly, the dirt is probably the best part of my day. Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging you, Ms. Cantoran. But this dirt-eating... when did that start?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don't know exactly. A few months too, maybe? Around when the tiredness got bad. It started small, just a little bit when I was gardening. Then... more. It's just... it feels good. Like something's missing and the dirt fills it up. Happy now? Is this enough about the dirt?
DOCTOR: It’s… unusual. Okay. We need to explore this a bit further. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I... I don't know. Everything's just… blah. My stomach's been a little off, maybe? More cramps than usual. And I've been... cold. Even when it's warm out. But that could just be me getting old. I don't pay attention to things like that. Can we please move on? I have a tool program to write.
DOCTOR: Stomach cramps and feeling cold… right. And you said you’re writing a tool program?
PATIENT: Yeah. CNC stuff. It's... complicated. Look, it's important, okay? People need things made. And if I don't get it done, things get delayed. It's a lot of pressure. Is this about the dirt? Because if it is, I’m telling you, it doesn't hurt anyone. It helps me. I don’t understand why this is such a big deal.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I’m not trying to upset you. I need to understand all of your symptoms to determine what’s going on. Eating soil can cause various health problems, and the other symptoms you’re describing – fatigue, stomach cramps, feeling cold – could be related. Now, about your past medical history… Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Honestly? I don't go to doctors. Waste of time and money. My husband... he took care of all that. He’s… gone now. I don’t remember any diagnoses or anything. Maybe I had something once, I don’t know. It's been a long time. Can we just… skip this part? I really don’t want to talk about this. It's useless.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll move on, but it's important to know if there's any family history of medical conditions. Do you know of any illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly? Not really. My mother was… strong. Always working. Didn't get sick much. My father… he was quiet. Kept to himself. I don’t… I don’t know anything about his family. We didn't talk about things like that. Honestly, it's all just a blur. Look, I'm telling you, I'm probably just tired. Stress from work. And the dirt makes me feel better. Can we just… get something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll do some basic blood work to rule out some common causes of fatigue – anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies. And I'm going to need to examine you. We'll start with your vital signs, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. It’s important to understand what’s going on with the cramps you mentioned. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I really don’t like doctors poking around. And I still think this is a waste of time. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your vital signs. Please sit back and relax. 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning. Now, let’s check your pulse… 78. Regular. 98.6. Normal. Respiration rate is 16. Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles noted. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ugh, stop poking! It's… sensitive. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Especially… over there. It's always a little… tender there, actually. But it's just cramps, I think. Can we please be done soon? I have a deadline.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the tenderness, and your history of cramps, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for any infections or parasites. It's important to rule out any underlying cause for your symptoms. And while we're waiting for the results, I'd like to discuss the soil eating. Do you have any idea why you feel compelled to eat dirt?
PATIENT: Ugh. Compelled? That sounds… fancy. I don't know! It just feels… right. Like something's missing and the dirt fills it up. I know it's stupid. But it helps. Honestly, it's the only thing that helps with the tiredness. It’s not like I enjoy the taste or anything. My husband… he used to tell me to stop. Said it wasn’t healthy. But he's… gone. And it makes me feel better. Can we just… get a pill for the tiredness? Please?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand you're feeling frustrated and want a quick fix. But I can’t simply prescribe a pill without understanding the underlying cause of your symptoms. The fatigue, the cramps, the soil eating… they are all interconnected. And ignoring the soil eating isn’t a viable option. We need to explore what nutritional deficiencies you might have, and rule out any psychological factors that could be contributing to this behavior. It’s possible you’re deficient in iron, zinc, or other essential minerals. And I strongly recommend we consider a referral to a mental health professional. While we await the lab results, I'm going to prescribe a multivitamin with iron to address any potential deficiencies. I also want you to try to reduce your soil intake, as much as possible. And I will give you the contact information for a local therapist. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh. A therapist? Seriously? Look, I'm not crazy! I just… eat dirt. It doesn't mean I need to talk about my feelings. And a multivitamin? That's it? After all this poking and prodding? Fine. No allergies. I don't do pills unless I have to. But honestly, I think this is a waste of time and money. Can I go now? I really need to get back to work. My tool program isn't going to write itself. And I’m starting to feel even more tired just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab results should be back in a few days. Please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment once you've had them completed. And I strongly encourage you to consider the referral to a therapist, Ms. Cantoran. Ignoring the emotional component of this may prolong your symptoms and prevent us from finding a proper solution. I've given you the contact information for the lab and the therapist. Please, take care of yourself. You’re dismissed. .
