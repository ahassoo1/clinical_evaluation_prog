DOCTOR: Hi Arlan, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Polczynski, you say? A good name. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom. Too much. All the time, it feels like. It’s… bothersome. Can’t really explain it much further, to be honest. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, “too much” going to the bathroom… I understand it's bothersome, and you think it might be related to age. We'll figure it out. Can you tell me a little more about how often you're going?
PATIENT: How often… hmm. It's not like I’m counting, you know? I just… go. When I need to. Which is… a lot. More than it used to be, that’s for sure. Before, I could go hours, maybe even all day without thinking about it. Now… well, I drink a bit of tea, and… there it is. It’s just… frequent. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, “frequent” is helpful. And it sounds like it's become more noticeable recently, especially with the tea. Okay. And when you go, is it a full bladder emptying, or just a little bit at a time?
PATIENT: A little bit at a time, mostly. Not a good, strong… release, if you know what I mean. It feels like there's always a little bit left behind. Very frustrating, it is. Makes you question if you even went at all, sometimes. My wife says I’m imagining things, but… I know my own body.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and it's good that you're aware of the changes. And you're right to trust your own body. So, just to clarify – frequent urination, small amounts each time, and a feeling of incomplete emptying?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… right. Exactly right, actually. You’re a smart doctor, I’ll give you that. It’s just… a nuisance, really. I’ve always been a strong man, worked the farm my whole life. Never had trouble with… plumbing, if you catch my drift. It’s… unsettling, this weakness.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that it feels unsettling, especially with your history of physical work. And it is good to pay attention to changes like this. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no real pain. A little discomfort sometimes, a bit of a… strain, maybe. But not pain. Burning, definitely not. Just… a little bit of effort to get it going. Like a rusty pipe, you know? That’s a good way to describe it. And it's worse at night. Have to get up a couple of times.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning, just discomfort and strain, worse at night, and needing to get up multiple times. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, smell, anything unusual?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. Well, I suppose it’s a bit darker than it used to be. I drink a lot of tea, like I said, so it's naturally a bit… amber colored. Smell? No, I haven't been sniffing my own urine, Doctor. That seems a bit… odd. My wife would have a fit if she knew. She handles the… laundry.
DOCTOR: I understand, no need to go sniffing! Darker color, given the tea, is expected. Just making sure. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any pain in your back or side recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not a fever. I feel… normal, besides this… bathroom business. Chills, no. Back pain… a little. Old age, you know? Worked the land too hard for too long. Aches and pains are just… part of life. It's not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. Comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or sharp pain, just a dull ache in your back, comes and goes. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned it once, years ago, but I don’t take any pills for it. Mostly just… watch what I eat, my wife says. She’s very strict about my diet. I’ve had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s it, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diabetes, high blood pressure managed with diet, and some arthritis in your hands. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And I broke my leg falling off a tractor once, but that was… decades ago. Nothing major since then. A few nights in the hospital, but nothing you’d call serious. Mostly just… resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken leg in the past. And you mentioned your wife is strict about your diet. Do you know what your typical diet looks like?
PATIENT: Oh, she runs the whole show, that woman. Mostly vegetables, lean meats, and… not much sugar. She makes a good borscht, you know. And I try to eat a bit of fruit, when she lets me. She’s always telling me to drink more water, too. Says the tea is no good for my kidneys. She worries a lot, my wife. A good woman, but… a bit of a nag, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: It sounds like she cares about your health very much. Now, do you take any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints, sometimes. A vitamin D pill, my wife insists on. Says I don’t get enough sun. And she makes me take fish oil, for my… brain, she says. She’s always trying to get me to take something. Honestly, I forget half the time. She keeps them all lined up on the kitchen counter. A whole regiment of pills, it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D and fish oil occasionally, managed by your wife. And you mentioned some discomfort in your joints. Is that in your hands, or other areas?
PATIENT: Mostly in my hands, you know? The arthritis. Makes it hard to grip things sometimes. And my knees ache a bit in the cold weather. Nothing terrible, just… bothersome. I get by. I've always been a stubborn man. And the bathroom thing... that's the newest problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Arlan, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you're experiencing frequent urination, small amounts each time, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and discomfort, especially at night. The dark urine and occasional joint pain are also important to note. Given your age and these symptoms, a few things could be going on. One possibility is an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age. It can cause these urinary symptoms. Another possibility is a urinary tract infection, although you don't have any pain or fever, which makes that less likely. It could also be related to your diet and fluid intake, or a combination of factors. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, and I'll also order a urine test to check for infection and other problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An enlarged… what now? A prostate? Sounds… serious. I’ve never had any trouble with that area before. Infection… well, I told you, I don't feel sick. A test, you say? I suppose so. Can’t hurt to check, I guess. I just don’t like doctors poking around too much. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arlan. I understand your concerns, and I'll be as gentle as possible. The prostate exam is a standard procedure, and it helps us to assess the size and condition of the gland. It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable, but please let me know if you experience any pain. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll do a quick abdominal exam, and finally we'll do the prostate exam. Then we'll get that urine sample. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Heart and lungs first, you say? Sounds… thorough. I haven't had my heart checked in years. And the… stomach. Always been a bit sensitive. I suppose. Do what you have to do. But if it gets too uncomfortable, please, just stop. I’m an old man, I don't need any extra trouble. And then… the other thing. Just get it over with quickly, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Arlan. I will absolutely respect your comfort level and stop if you’re uncomfortable at any point. It's important to me that you feel safe and heard. Okay, let’s start with your heart and lungs. If you could just take a deep breath in… and out… That’s good. Nice and slow. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Everything sounds… normal so far. A little bit of expected age-related changes, but nothing concerning. Now, let's move on to your abdomen. Just lie flat on your back, and I’ll gently press on your stomach to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Again, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Are you feeling any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little… pressure, that’s all. Always been a bit tender around the stomach. Probably just from years of eating too much. And, well, I suppose my wife would say I have a bit of a… paunch. But it's not painful, just… sensitive. Go ahead, doctor. Do what you need to do. Just be careful, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just checking for any masses or tenderness. Everything feels… as expected. Now, to complete the exam, I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. I'll need you to bend over on the examination table, or lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll use a lubricated gloved finger to gently examine the prostate through your rectum. This will only take a moment. Again, please let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort. I know this isn't the most comfortable exam, but it’s important for getting an accurate assessment. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I really don't like the sound of that. Never had that done before. Just… quickly, alright? And be gentle, doctor, I'm begging you. This isn't going to be pleasant, is it? Alright, alright. Let’s just get it over with. I suppose. Bend over… you said? Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arlan. Just take a deep breath, and try to relax as much as possible. I will be as quick and gentle as I can. Okay, all done. Your prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. It's not alarmingly large, but it's definitely larger than I’d expect for your age. Now, let’s collect that urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I’ll leave you the room for a few moments of privacy. Just try to collect a midstream sample - that means start urinating for a few seconds, then collect the sample in the middle of the stream. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness that's over with. Not a pleasant experience, I must say. A bit unsettling, to be honest. Midstream, you say? Yes, I think so. Start and… stop, then catch it in the middle. My wife always told me to do that for the doctor. She knows everything, that woman. Alright, I'll go and collect a sample now. Just give me a moment of privacy, you said?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll step out and give you some privacy. Just take your time. I'll be right outside when you're finished.
PATIENT: Alright, doctor! All done! Here’s your sample. Honestly, I’m just glad that’s all over with.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Arlan. I appreciate your cooperation. Okay, the initial dipstick test is negative for any obvious signs of infection, which is good. However, to get a more complete picture, I'll send this sample to the lab for a full urinalysis and culture. That will help us rule out any hidden infection and assess your kidney function. So, to summarize, you’re experiencing frequent urination, small amounts each time, incomplete emptying, discomfort, especially at night, and your prostate feels slightly enlarged. The initial urine test doesn’t show any infection, but we’ll send it to the lab for a full analysis. Based on this, the most likely possibility is Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a common condition in men your age. It simply means your prostate is enlarged, which can cause these urinary symptoms. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd also like to order a Prostate-Specific Antigen, or PSA, blood test. This test can help us screen for prostate cancer, although it's important to remember that an elevated PSA doesn’t always mean cancer. We’ll discuss the results of all these tests when they come back. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and trying to urinate regularly, even if you don’t feel the urge. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Benign… what now? Enlarged prostate, you said? Sounds about right. My wife always said I was a big man. Tests, more tests… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just let me know when I need to come back. Drink more water, avoid caffeine… that sounds easy enough. My wife will be pleased. She's always nagging me about my tea. So, nothing too serious, you think? Just an old man’s plumbing acting up? That's all?
DOCTOR: That’s right. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial exam findings, it’s most likely an enlarged prostate, which is very common as men age. It's rarely a sign of anything serious, but it's important to rule out other possibilities with these tests, just to be sure. The PSA test will help us with that. We'll also discuss lifestyle changes, and if the symptoms become bothersome, there are medications and other treatments available to help manage the condition. But for now, let's focus on getting these tests done and seeing what the results say. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Medications? Treatments? Oh dear. I was hoping to avoid all that. I'm an old man, doctor, I don't want to be taking a bunch of pills. Will these tests be expensive? My wife handles the bills, and she's… particular. I don't want to cause her any stress. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medications and the cost of the tests. We’ll start with the tests first, and if your symptoms are mild, we may not even need medication. There are also lifestyle changes that can help manage the condition without any pills at all. Regarding the cost, I’ll have the billing department contact your wife directly to discuss the estimated costs and any potential insurance coverage. They can also help with any financial concerns. As for the results, the PSA test usually takes a few days to come back, and the urinalysis results should be available within a week. Once we have all the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan that's right for you. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen suddenly, or you develop a fever or chills, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Arlan?
PATIENT: Alright. Billing department contacting my wife… that’s good. She’ll want to know all the details. And a week for the results… I suppose I can wait that long. No, I think that's all for now, doctor. You’ve answered all my questions. Thank you for being so patient with an old man’s worries. I appreciate it. I suppose I'll be seeing you in a week then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arlan. It was my pleasure. And you didn't cause me any trouble at all. Yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today to discuss the results. The receptionist will contact you to arrange a convenient time. In the meantime, please take care of yourself, stay hydrated, and try not to worry too much. It was good meeting you. .
PATIENT: You as well, doctor. A good man, I think. Honest and patient. That's rare these days. Take care yourself too. Goodbye.
