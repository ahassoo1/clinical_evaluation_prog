DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about this... procedure. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need a "clearance." Honestly, sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing, but she worries too much. I want it done, quickly, so I can get back to… things. I don't have all day to sit here answering questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A pre-operative clearance, right?
PATIENT: "Operative"? Is that even a word? Just say "surgery," Doctor. And yes, that's what it is. My daughter scheduled it. A facelift. Though I don't see why I need to tell a doctor about it. It's hardly a life-threatening condition.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Orwin, to assess your overall health before any surgery, even one considered elective. It helps ensure everything goes smoothly and minimizes risks. It’s not about whether it’s life-threatening, but about making sure you’re a good candidate and prepared. Now, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Hmph. "Medical history." As if I want to remember all that. Old age, Doctor, it comes with aches and pains. I’ve lived a long life, worked hard. Terrazzo work, you wouldn’t believe the things that can happen to your back. I don't recall anything serious though. No heart trouble, lungs are fine… I used to smoke, a long time ago, but quit years and years back. Satisfied?
DOCTOR: Okay, some back pain from terrazzo work, history of smoking but quit… that’s helpful. Do you recall when you quit smoking, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking me to remember dates. That's my daughter's department. Let me think… must have been… oh, Lord. Sixty? Sixty-five years ago, maybe? Around the time I met my wife. It was a long time ago. Does it really matter? I haven't touched a cigarette since. It certainly doesn’t affect my breathing now.
DOCTOR: Sixty to sixty-five years ago. Good. And any other significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Significant? What qualifies as "significant"? I had a bout of shingles a few years back, quite painful, but that cleared up. And my knees ache in the cold. I suppose those are… things. Honestly, Doctor, I've been healthier than most men my age. This whole thing feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shingles, knee pain... any surgeries or hospitalizations besides the shingles?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always been a strong, practical man. Never needed to be cut open or anything like that. Not like some people. Just the occasional doctor’s visit for a cold or the flu. I expect to get back to work as soon as I recover, so the quicker we get this done, the better.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, no hospitalizations. Okay. Do you take any medications currently, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees when they act up. Some sort of ibuprofen, I think. The white pills. My daughter buys them for me. I can’t be bothered to read the labels. It helps with the aching. Nothing else. I don't go for those fancy doctor-prescribed things, always have side effects.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen for knee pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I eat just about anything. I grew up on a farm, you eat what you get. Dust bothers me sometimes, from the terrazzo, but that’s not an allergy. Really, Doctor, I'm a pretty straightforward case. No complicated medical history, no fancy pills, just a bit of wear and tear from a long life. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Just to be thorough, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don't dawdle. I have a schedule, you know. And please, no cold instruments. I dislike the feeling. Quickly, now. Let's get this done.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here. Heart sounds regular, rate and rhythm normal. No murmurs detected. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not concerning given your age. Knees show some mild crepitus and tenderness with palpation, consistent with osteoarthritis. Range of motion is limited. No swelling or redness.
PATIENT: Hmph. "Crepitus"? Sounds painful. It is painful. What does all that mean, Doctor? Just tell me if I'm fit enough to have this procedure done or not. I haven't got time for a medical lecture. And lower your voice, some of us have sensitive hearing.
DOCTOR: “Crepitus” just means a bit of a grinding sensation in the joint, common with arthritis. It explains the pain you're feeling. Based on my brief exam, and what you’ve told me, there are a few things we need to address before I can clear you for surgery. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and we should have some blood work done to check your kidney function and overall health. It’s standard procedure. Also, given your history of smoking, even though it was long ago, we'll want to assess your lung capacity with a simple breathing test. It'll help the surgeon prepare and minimize risks. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Hmph. More tests. Of course. It never ends, does it? Fine. But I expect results quickly. And I don't want any complicated instructions. Simple breathing test, blood work… my daughter can handle the arrangements. I have appointments, you know. She’ll call you. Just get it over with. I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll order the blood work and a pulmonary function test. My nurse will provide the necessary paperwork for the lab and the pulmonary function test facility. We’ll have the results back in a few days. And, to be perfectly clear, until we receive those results, I cannot formally clear you for the surgery. I understand you're eager to proceed, but we need to prioritize your safety. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmph. Questions? No. Just get it done. And please, send the paperwork to my daughter. She handles these things. I've said all I need to say. Now, if you’ll excuse me…. Is there anything else? I’d like to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. My nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork. And Mr. Orwin, I'll have her schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back, to discuss them with you. Here you are. Have a good day, and please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
