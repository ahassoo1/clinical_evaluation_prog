DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… a check-up, mostly. My regular doctor… he passed away last year. A good man. I need to find someone new, and the office said you take Medicare. I thought I should get things started, you know? Just to be sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. A new doctor. Well, we all have to start somewhere. A general check-up is fine. Though "just to be sure everything is okay" isn't terribly specific, is it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. I… feel alright. A little tired, maybe. Old age, you know? But nothing… specific is wrong. I do a lot of work with cars. I am a mechanic. Always have been. Maybe that makes me tired. Is that what you mean? Should I tell you about things that hurt, even if they don't hurt all the time?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, that is exactly what I mean. We need to know about anything and everything. “Anything and everything” includes things that don't hurt all the time. It's called a history, and it's rather important. Mechanics work is physically demanding, certainly. But let’s not assume that's the sole cause of anything. Alright. Let's start with the basics. Do you have any significant medical problems – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart trouble, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My blood pressure… the old doctor said it was sometimes a little high, but he gave me a pill for it. I take it every morning. And… I had a problem with my gallbladder, many years ago. They took it out. Oh! And my knees. They ache, especially when it is cold. But everyone has bad knees, yes? I don’t know if those are “significant” problems. Not like… something serious.
DOCTOR: "Sometimes a little high" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Benites. What was the number?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Numbers… I am not good with numbers. He just said to take the pill. I think he said something about 140… over… 90? Maybe? It was a long time ago, and I don't pay attention to those things. I just take the pill. Is that bad? Should I have remembered?
DOCTOR: It is… less than ideal, Ms. Benites. We need to know these things. 140/90 is elevated. Okay. Gallbladder removal… when was that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must have been… 1998? Or maybe 1999? A long time. I was still living in… uh… the old country, then. I came here in 2002. It was a very good hospital, though. They did a good job. No trouble with it since. I remember the doctor was very nice. A young man.
DOCTOR: Right. 1998, cholecystectomy… Okay. And your knees… how would you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It is… achey. Mostly when I bend them. Or when it is cold, like I said. When I work on cars, sometimes it is worse. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It is… old age, I think. It doesn't stop me from working, though. I can still get under the cars. But it takes a little longer. And I have to take some… pills for it sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think it is called.
DOCTOR: “Sometimes pills for it” continues to be a theme, Ms. Benites. How often do you take the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not every day. When they really bother me. Maybe… two or three times a week? When it is cold, or I have been working on a difficult car. I don’t take very many. Just enough to… take the edge off. I don’t want to take too many pills, you know? Is that okay? I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: It's… concerning that you can’t quantify how often you are taking pain medication. Alright. Let’s move on to family history. Do either of your parents have – or had – any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. She was very old when she passed. She was in the hospital for a long time. My father… he was a strong man. Never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. He died in an accident, when I was young. I don’t really… remember much about his health. Does that help? I don’t know much about medical things, you know.
DOCTOR: “Problems with her heart” is… not particularly helpful. Was it heart failure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I don’t know. She just… got weaker and weaker. She was in the hospital. They gave her… oxygen. And pills. I was young, and my sister took care of her. I don’t remember what the doctors said. I’m sorry. I wish I could tell you more. It was a very long time ago. She lived in the old country, you know. Things were different then. They didn't explain things as much.
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, this is proving… difficult. We need specifics. Alright. Let's talk about you. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. Never had any trouble with allergies. I can eat anything. Take any medicine. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m a strong woman, you know. I don’t get sick easily. I've been lucky, I think. Is that good? Should I be worried about something? I get a little… nervous when you ask so many questions. It makes me think I am forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’re going to do a quick physical exam. Just standard things – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, feel your abdomen. Then we’ll get some blood work done to get a better picture of things. It sounds like you are fairly healthy, but we need to be thorough. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. I'm always happy to help. I used to fix things on machines. I am happy to let you fix me, if you need to. Is it… accurate? It's been a while since I weighed myself.
DOCTOR: 168 pounds. And your height is recorded as 5’8”. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh. No, Doctor. That is not right at all! I am much taller. One hundred ninety-six centimeters! That is… six foot two inches, I think? And I weigh… eighty kilograms. I know those numbers. I had to have them for my driver’s license. Someone must have written down the wrong numbers. It is very important to have the correct numbers, you know? For everything.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Benites. You are correct. 1.96 meters, 80 kilograms. Clearly, there was an error in the initial records. Alright. Now, let’s proceed with the exam. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you for fixing the numbers. It is good to have things correct. I used to be more nimble, you know? But… things change. Do you need me to take off my shoes?
DOCTOR: Yes, please remove your shoes and socks. It will allow for a more accurate assessment.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Here we are. Do you need me to… breathe deeply? I can do that. I used to have very strong lungs. From working on cars, you know. Lots of… pushing and pulling. Is that good?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. I hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve never had any trouble breathing, except maybe when I was working on those very dusty cars. But that was just… dust. It didn’t last long. I've always been a strong woman, you know. Strong lungs, strong heart. Is the wheezing… bad? Should I be worried? Maybe I just caught a cold? It’s just a little tickle in my throat.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Does this bother you at all?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Hmm. Not really. Sometimes, yes, if I press very hard. But not usually. It might be… from working on cars, you know? Lots of bending and twisting. I sometimes sleep on my right side. Maybe that makes it tender? I don’t know. Is that… the gallbladder? I had that taken out, years ago. Maybe it’s something else? I’m not sure. I don’t really pay attention to those things. Oh, that does pinch a little. But it’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Given your history of gallbladder removal and the tenderness in your upper right quadrant, I’d like to order some blood work to check your liver function. We’ll also do a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It’s just to get a baseline and rule out anything concerning. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other medical materials?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies at all. I told you. I can handle anything. I’ve never had any trouble with latex or anything else. I’m a very strong woman, you know? But… what exactly are you looking for with the blood work? Is something wrong? I don’t want to worry unnecessarily. Perhaps it’s just… old age? I am starting to feel a little nervous again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, I am not attempting to alarm you. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any potential issues with your liver, kidneys, and blood count. It’s a standard procedure, especially given your history and the findings during the exam. Given the wheezing, I'd also like to get a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. It is better to be thorough than to assume it is "just old age." Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Thorough is good. I… I suppose you are right. It is better to know, even if it is not something good. A chest X-ray… will that hurt? Will it… expose me to too much radiation? I’ve heard things about radiation. I just… I don’t like surprises. I like to be prepared. So, you think something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, the radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal – far less than what you receive from background radiation in a single year. It is a very safe procedure. And no, I am not saying something is wrong. I am simply being cautious. These tests will provide us with more information, and then we can determine the best course of action. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood, and then we will schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… acceptable. Tomorrow is fine. I suppose I should… take it easy today then? Not work on any difficult cars? The nurse, you said? Is she… gentle? I don’t like needles very much. But I will do whatever you think is best. You are the doctor, after all. Thank you for being thorough, even if it means… needles and X-rays.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse is very experienced and gentle. She'll take good care of you. I will have her come in shortly. And you are right to rest today; avoid any strenuous activity. I'll review the results of the blood work and X-ray and contact you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that covers everything. You have answered all my questions. Thank you. And thank you for being patient with me. I know I ask a lot of… silly questions. It’s just… I like to understand things. And… about the results? How long will it take? I don't want to worry unnecessarily. I am a bit of a worrier, you see. Is there anything I should not do while I wait for the results? Perhaps no driving? .
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites. The nurse will be in shortly. I understand your anxiety, but dwelling on worst-case scenarios won’t be helpful. The results will take approximately 24-48 hours. You may continue your normal activities, including driving, as long as you do not experience any new or worsening symptoms. If anything changes, please contact the office immediately. I believe that covers everything. I’ll contact you when the results are available.
