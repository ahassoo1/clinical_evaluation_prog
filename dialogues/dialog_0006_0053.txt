DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Gorga. It's… well, it's my waterworks, really. I'm having a bit of trouble going. It just… takes a long time, and doesn’t always come all the way out, if you know what I mean. It's been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe three.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble with urination… for two to three weeks. And it doesn’t feel like you’re fully emptying, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly it. Not fully emptying. It's quite bothersome, actually. I find myself going back to the bathroom shortly after, you see. And it’s not painful, thankfully. Just… frustrating. I drink a normal amount of water, I think. Maybe a little more in this heat, but nothing crazy.
DOCTOR: No pain, that’s good. And you said normal water intake, maybe a bit more with the heat. Hmm… any fever, chills, or any changes in your urine itself – color, smell, anything like that?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, no. And the urine… well, it looks normal to me. The color is usual, I suppose. Nothing… cloudy or anything. Smell is normal too, as far as I can tell. I don't usually pay much attention to the smell, to be honest. It just smells like… urine. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mrs. Yadao. It’s good you’re observant. Okay… and have you noticed any… dribbling, after you think you're finished?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Sometimes. Not a flood, mind you. Just a few little drops. It's… embarrassing, really. I have to be careful when I stand up after going. I always have a bit of a wobble to make sure nothing… escapes. It doesn’t happen every time, but often enough that I worry about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dribbling after, requiring caution when standing… I see. Now, just to get a better picture – any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh dear. Let me think… No, not really. Everything’s been… regular, I suppose. Not constipated, not… loose. Just normal. I eat a lot of soups in the summer, mostly. And beets. My mother always said beets are good for everything. I haven't been straining or anything like that when I go to the bathroom, either one, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No straining… Now, do you have a history of any urinary tract infections, or bladder problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… I had one, I think, a long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? The doctor gave me some pills, and it went away. It was very painful then, but I haven't had any trouble since that one time. No other bladder problems that I know of. I’ve never had any operations on that part of my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, one UTI about twenty years ago… good to know. And no surgeries. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just checking your abdomen and a quick neurological check, and maybe a simple urine test. That'll give us a bit more information. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A test sounds good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. An exam is fine, yes. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Yadao. I'll be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your abdomen. Please lie down on the exam table, and I’ll listen with the stethoscope. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm going to palpate your lower abdomen – just feeling for any tenderness or fullness.
PATIENT: Alright. It’s a bit cold, isn’t it? But I suppose that’s normal. Just tell me if you need me to move or anything. I'm ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Yadao. Just relax. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Take nice, deep breaths. No immediate tenderness to the touch… Bladder feels normal in size. Not a lot of discomfort there, either. Okay… let's get a urine sample now. Do you have a cup with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Here you are. I always bring one, just in case. It’s best to be prepared, you know? Especially when it comes to these things. It’s probably best I go now, then? It’s been a while since I had a drink.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Yes, if you could just provide a sample, that would be great. I'll give you a few moments of privacy. I’ll be just outside, and I'll let you know when I’m ready.
