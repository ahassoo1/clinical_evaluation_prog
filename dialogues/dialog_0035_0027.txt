DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Reflux, Doctor. Been happening for… well, a while now. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Just tell me what you need to know so I can get out of here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time. We'll get right to it. When you say “a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate – has this been weeks, months, or even longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? It’s… hard to keep track. It’s not like it’s sudden, you know? Just… gradually worse. I eat, then it comes back up. Simple as that. Honestly, I don’t see what’s so complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradually worsening reflux. And when you say "comes back up," is that heartburn sensation, or are you actually bringing up stomach contents?
PATIENT: Actually bringing up, Doctor. Food. Liquid. Sometimes both. It’s unpleasant. I mean, really, is this necessary to detail? I'm a grown man. You don't need a diagram. It regurgitates. Is that what you want to know? It regurgitates.
DOCTOR: Yes, "regurgitates" is helpful, thank you. Does this happen after every meal, or are there specific foods that seem to trigger it more often?
PATIENT: Not every meal. Though, honestly, these days it feels like most. Spicy things, definitely. And anything… rich. Cream sauces, fatty meats. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a picky eater, but… some things just don't stay down anymore. It's common sense, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is common sense, yes. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the regurgitation – like a burning sensation in your chest, a sour taste in your mouth, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: A little heartburn now and then, maybe. Not enough to complain about. And sometimes a sour taste, but frankly, I’ve had worse from bad coffee. No difficulty swallowing. I eat just fine. Look, is this leading somewhere or are we just making a list of things that happen when a person digests food? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant difficulty swallowing. And the heartburn is mild and occasional. Have you tried anything to manage the reflux already – like over-the-counter antacids or changing your diet?
PATIENT: Of course I have. Tums. Those little chalky things. They help a bit, but only for an hour, maybe. I’ve tried cutting back on… the richer foods, like I said. It doesn’t really make a difference. Honestly, I'm starting to think this is just old age catching up with me. Not everything needs a solution, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Tums provide some temporary relief, but it doesn't last. And dietary changes haven’t been very effective. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Do I look like I'm falling apart, Doctor? I'm a relatively healthy man for my age. No, nothing major. A little high blood pressure, controlled with medication. And… well, my wife keeps nagging me about my cholesterol, but I ignore her. It's fine. Nothing else. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, controlled with medication, and your wife is concerned about your cholesterol. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, I think. Or something like that. Honestly, I leave that to my wife. She handles the pills. I just… take them. Does it matter? It's under control, isn’t that what's important? Really, I don’t have time to inventory every prescription I’ve ever been given.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. And you've been taking it for…?
PATIENT: Years. A long time. Look, are we going to do something about this reflux or not? I have a meeting this afternoon and frankly, talking about pills is a waste of my time. I told you, my wife manages all this. It’s… stable. Everything is stable. Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Okay, “stable” on Lisinopril for years. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Appendicitis when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. And… well, I had a hernia repair about ten years ago, I suppose. Small thing. Nothing to write home about. Definitely not anything related to this… regurgitation. Really, Doctor, is this even relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a hernia repair ten years ago. Now, briefly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I'm Polish, Doctor. We're built for hardship. No allergies. None. Are we almost done? This is… tedious. Frankly, I'm starting to feel a little nauseous just talking about all this. Perhaps all this questioning is making it worse?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. One final question about your history: are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, or digestive issues?
PATIENT: Heart disease, probably. Everyone's got heart disease these days, don't they? My father had it, I think. And… my aunt had some kind of stomach trouble. Vague memories, honestly. My wife keeps track of that stuff too. I'm not a family historian, Doctor. Are you finished yet? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history of heart disease and some vague recollection of stomach issues on your mother's side. Alright, Mr. Altine, I'm going to do a brief physical exam now. Just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will just take a few moments. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Fine, get it over with. Just… be quick about it. I have a very important meeting to get to. And please, no cold hands. My wife always complains about cold hands.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart rate and rhythm sound normal. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some tenderness in the upper abdomen, especially when I press here. And I hear some normal bowel sounds. No masses are palpable. Do you experience any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: A little. It’s… uncomfortable. Not exactly pain, more like… pressure. It's not surprising, you’re poking my stomach! Honestly, I'm not a fan of being prodded and poked. Can we wrap this up now? This is getting… irritating. And frankly, I’m starting to feel more nauseous than ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness to palpation in the upper abdomen. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, possibly with some esophagitis - inflammation of the esophagus. The regurgitation, heartburn, and tenderness in your upper abdomen are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, to be sure and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to do an endoscopy and a pH monitor?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? You want to put a camera down my throat? Absolutely not! Are you serious? That sounds barbaric! And a pH monitor… what is that, some kind of torture device? Look, Doctor, I came in here for a quick fix, not an invasive medical procedure. I'm not sticking a camera down my throat, and I'm certainly not wearing some kind of sensor. This is ridiculous. I think I'll just stick with the Tums. It’s fine. I’m fine. Let’s just… stop this nonsense. I’m leaving. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine. I apologize for suggesting procedures you’re not comfortable with. Given your aversion to further testing, we can manage your symptoms conservatively for now. However, without an endoscopy, we can't rule out more serious conditions, like Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer. I’ll prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, which is a stronger medication than Tums to reduce stomach acid. We’ll also continue dietary modifications: avoid spicy foods, fatty foods, caffeine, and alcohol. We'll also implement lifestyle changes, such as elevating the head of your bed and eating smaller meals. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within four to six weeks, I strongly recommend reconsidering the endoscopy. Are you willing to try the PPI and lifestyle changes for now?
