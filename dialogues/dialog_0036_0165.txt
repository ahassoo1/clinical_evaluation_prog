DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It’s this fever… keeps comin’ back. Feels like it flares up outta nowhere, then goes away for a bit, then bam, it’s back again. It’s been goin’ on for… oh, I dunno, a couple months now, maybe longer. It’s just a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. A recurring fever for a couple of months, that doesn’t sound fun at all. When you say “comes back,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't a high fever, never gets above 101, maybe. Usually starts with chills, feel kinda weak, achy all over. Lasts a day, two, then I’m fine for a week, ten days, somethin’ like that. Then it hits again. Happens mostly at night, I think. Hard to say for sure, honestly. I usually just try to sleep it off.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's not a consistently high fever, usually around 101 with chills and body aches, lasting a day or two, then resolving for a week or so. And it seems to happen more at night. Have you noticed anything with the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… with it? Let me think. Not really, no. No cough, no sore throat, no… rashes or nothin’ like that. I haven’t lost any weight, still eatin’ like a horse. Just the chills and the achiness. Oh! Sometimes a little headache, but I get those anyway, y'know? Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, sore throat, rash, or weight loss. You've mentioned headaches, but you typically experience those regardless. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urination?
PATIENT: Changes in… what now? You mean… goin’ to the bathroom? Everything’s pretty normal there, Doctor. No problems with that. Look, is this fever somethin’ serious? I ain’t got time for a lot of tests and stuff. My wife needs me to fix the roof, and I promised her I’d be done by the weekend.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about tests and getting back to work, Clide. It’s good to hear your bowel and bladder habits are normal. Recurring fevers can be caused by a lot of things, some simple and some more complex. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. And then I'll need to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam… alright, alright. But keep it quick, Doc. My back ain't what it used to be. Ask your questions. I don't really have a medical history, if that makes sense. I’ve been pretty lucky, never been sick much. Just the usual aches and pains. I don't take any regular medicine, 'cept for an occasional pain reliever when my back flares up. And I don’t have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Clide. No regular medications or known allergies. And you haven't had significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' major. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, that’s about it. Broke my arm once fallin’ outta a tree, but that healed up fine. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy. I work hard, eat good, try to stay outta trouble. That's about it. Is this gonna take long, Doc? My wife is gonna start worryin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a broken arm that healed well. No other surgeries. That's helpful. And you haven't had any serious illnesses like pneumonia, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any of that. No heart trouble, no diabetes, no nothin’. I get a little winded climbin’ stairs sometimes, but that’s just 'cause I’m gettin’ old and outta shape. Honestly, Doc, I think I just need a good rest. But my wife says I gotta get it checked out. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. So, no significant past medical history, appendectomy as a child, broken arm, no heart problems or diabetes. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had arthritis in his hands, real bad. Couldn't hardly grip a wrench anymore. My sister, she's got somethin' with her stomach, always complainin' about it. But that’s about it. Nobody else that I can think of had any serious problems. We ain't a family that goes to the doctor much, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had high blood pressure, your father arthritis, and your sister has stomach issues. That's good information. Now, I'm going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Woah there, Doc! No, no, no. I don't smoke. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years back. Doctor said it was makin' my blood pressure go up. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a chiropractor, Doc. I fix people, I don't… well, you get what I mean. I’m a pretty clean livin’ guy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know, Clide. No smoking, no alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Now, one last thing. Can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I’m a chiropractor, like I said. Been doin’ it for… oh, almost forty years now. Mostly work on folks in town, back problems, neck pain, that kinda thing. It’s hard work, a lot of bendin’ and liftin’, but I enjoy it. Keeps me movin’, keeps me busy. I have my own little practice, small but successful. Been helpin’ people in this community a long time. I just wish this fever would go away so I can get back to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide, thank you for all that information. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Let’s get it over with. Just… be gentle with my back, okay? And make it quick. My wife’s probably already wonderin’ where I am.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Everything sounds clear so far. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just feels… normal. But my pressure’s high? What does that mean? Is that from the fever? I usually don’t have trouble with my pressure. And you said somethin’ about keepin’ an eye on it? What’s gonna happen now? I got work to do, Doc!
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide, it’s good to hear there's no pain in your abdomen. Your blood pressure being elevated is something we need to address, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything drastic. It can be temporarily elevated by a fever, but given your history, it’s something we should monitor. I’m going to listen to your lungs again, and then I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Your lungs are clear, and your lymph nodes don’t seem to be enlarged. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, I don't feel like it's something urgently life-threatening, but we do need to investigate this recurring fever and your elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? What kinda tests are we talkin’ about? Blood work? X-rays? I don’t wanna be stuck in a hospital for days, Doc. I got a roof to fix! And my wife… she worries somethin’ awful. Can’t we just give me somethin’ for the fever and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Clide. We’re not talking about a hospital stay, and I certainly don't want to cause you unnecessary worry. I think the best course of action would be to start with some blood work. This will help us look for signs of infection, inflammation, or any other underlying issues that could be causing the fever. It will also give us a baseline for your blood pressure. We can also check a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, just to be thorough. As for giving you something for the fever, we can discuss a medication to help manage your symptoms, but it’s important to address the underlying cause. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Blood work. But no fancy tests, Doc, you hear me? Just the basics. And if it's somethin’ serious, tell me straight. I don’t need sugar-coat’d answers. And a somethin’ for the fever would be good. This achin’ is killin’ me. Can I still fix the roof while I’m waitin’ for the results? It’s gotta be done by the weekend.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. Just the basics. We'll start with a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a basic inflammatory marker. I promise to be straightforward with you about the results. As for the fever, I can prescribe you ibuprofen 600mg every 6-8 hours as needed for the aches and fever. I would recommend taking it easy on the roof for a few days, just to be safe. Strenuous activity could temporarily raise your blood pressure further, and we want to get a clear reading. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. Ibuprofen, and take it easy on the roof. I’ll tell my wife. She'll be happy to hear that. Now, where do I go to get this blood work done? And how long will it take to get the results? I got a schedule to keep, Doc.
DOCTOR: There’s a lab right across the street, Community Labs. I’m sending the order over to them electronically now. They should be expecting you. It usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your fever gets higher than 102, or if you develop a rash, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Emergency room? That sounds serious… Okay, okay, I got it. No high fever, no rash, no shortness of breath… I’ll remember. 24-48 hours… and Maria will call. Alright. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothin’ serious. And thank you for not makin’ me stay in the hospital.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Clide. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And you're very welcome. Just take it easy, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Here's the lab order printout. Have a good day, and I'll speak to you soon.
