DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, to get started, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… delicate, frankly. I’m dating someone, and I just want to be… thorough. One can’t be too careful these days, you understand. I’d like a complete check-up, just to be certain everything is as it should be.
DOCTOR: “Thorough,” yes. Of course. Though, a “complete check-up” is… broad. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms, or is this purely preventative, due to the new relationship?
PATIENT: Oh, no symptoms, Doctor. Absolutely not. I simply believe in knowing what one is working with, so to speak. It’s a new… arrangement, and I don’t want any unpleasant surprises down the line. A woman has to protect herself, doesn’t she? And frankly, I expect a certain level of… discretion from my healthcare provider. I wouldn't want this getting around.
DOCTOR: Discretion is… understood, Ms. Pandolfi. We maintain strict patient confidentiality. Very well. Let's start with a basic history, then. Have you had a recent physical examination – within the last year, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. I had one last year with Dr. Abernathy, before he… retired. A very thorough man, Dr. Abernathy. He knew his business. Though, truthfully, I found his office rather… drafty. But the examination itself was quite comprehensive. I’m sure everything is recorded somewhere. I wouldn’t expect you to duplicate his efforts entirely, but a refresher would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Let me see if I can access Dr. Abernathy’s records. It appears the transfer is… incomplete. Minimal information. Alright. In that case, we will proceed as if this is a new patient. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… unfortunate. Dr. Abernathy always seemed so organized. Well, let me see… I had my tonsils removed as a child, naturally. And I broke my wrist, badly, when I was in college – a rather foolish mishap involving a roller skate and a patch of ice. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably healthy, thank you very much. A good constitution, I believe. I do take a daily vitamin, of course. And I try to eat a balanced diet, although… well, one has one's weaknesses, doesn't one?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Family history, then. Are there any notable medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. My mother’s side… a rather unfortunate history of hypertension, I’m afraid. And my aunt Beatrice… suffered from a rather aggressive form of breast cancer. A truly tragic case. My father’s side was… healthier, comparatively. Though his brother, Clarence, had diabetes. The type where he had to inject himself. A dreadful thing, really. I try to be very mindful of my weight, naturally, given the predisposition. It’s all about preventative measures, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, besides your daily vitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. Though I do occasionally take a chamomile tea to aid sleep, if I'm particularly… unsettled. But that's hardly a medication, is it? It’s simply a calming beverage. I find it helps me… unwind.
DOCTOR: Right. Allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A rather bothersome allergy to… dust mites, I believe. Causes a bit of a sniffle, particularly in the spring. And I’m mildly sensitive to… certain perfumes. The synthetic ones, naturally. The floral scents are usually fine, but the muskier varieties… dreadful. They give me a terrible headache. I have to be very careful when choosing social engagements, you understand. One doesn’t want to be caught off guard.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, a brief review of systems. Have you experienced any… unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Quite the opposite, actually. Maintaining my weight is a constant effort, you understand. I have a… robust appetite. And I enjoy my food far too much to deprive myself. Though I am, of course, mindful of portion control. One must be sensible. I've noticed a slight increase in… fullness, perhaps, after meals lately, but I attribute that to the… warmer weather. It tends to slow everything down, you see. A perfectly normal phenomenon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not, Doctor. I’m a remarkably… stable individual. I rarely feel unwell, and when I do, it's usually something minor – a slight headache, a bit of a sniffle. Never anything serious. I pride myself on my resilience. I haven't even had a cold in years, truthfully. A testament to my… careful lifestyle, I believe. I take my health very seriously, you see. It’s all about preventative measures.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to a physical exam, then. Please step up onto the scale. I’d like to get a current weight and blood pressure reading.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I must warn you, Doctor, I had a rather… substantial lunch. It was a celebratory occasion, you see. A new… acquaintance. A delightful pasta dish, with a lovely cream sauce. I’m sure it will affect the reading somewhat. But please, proceed. I trust you’ll take that into consideration.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. And blood pressure is 140 over 90. Elevated, given your age and reported history. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are… regular, but somewhat forceful. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, but… slightly tender in the upper quadrants.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That is a bit… concerning, isn’t it? The blood pressure, I mean. Though I daresay, a celebratory lunch would have some effect. And as for the tenderness… I did have a rather rich dessert, you see. A chocolate soufflé. Decadent, simply decadent. Perhaps that’s it? I assure you, Doctor, I’m usually quite… regular in my habits. And perfectly healthy. It must be the soufflé.
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Ms. Pandolfi. However, given your elevated blood pressure and slight abdominal tenderness, I recommend a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying issues. A complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel would be prudent. And, perhaps, a urinalysis. We can also schedule an EKG to assess your heart function. I'll have the lab slip ready for you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That does sound rather… extensive, doesn’t it? All those tests. Are you suggesting there’s something wrong with me, Doctor? Because I assure you, I feel perfectly fine. Perfectly… robust. Though, I suppose, it’s better to be safe than sorry. Very well. If you insist. But I trust these tests won’t take too long? I have several social engagements scheduled for next week, and I wouldn’t want to be… inconvenienced. And what exactly are we looking for, if you don't mind my asking? I prefer to be fully informed, you understand. A woman has a right to know, doesn’t she?
DOCTOR: The tests are routine, Ms. Pandolfi. We're simply looking for elevated cholesterol levels, signs of inflammation, or any imbalances in your electrolytes. As for your engagements, the results should be back within a few days. We can discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Here is the slip for the lab. They are located on Elm Street, and you do not require an appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. Elm Street, you say? Rather inconvenient. Well, very well. I shall endeavor to fit it into my schedule. And do be assured, Doctor, I expect a thorough explanation of these results. No jargon, if you please. I prefer things to be… simplified. And I trust you won't reveal my medical information to anyone? Discretion is paramount, you understand. A woman’s reputation is… delicate. No, I believe that’s all for now. Unless you have any… recommendations for a particularly… discreet dry cleaner? A stain on my favorite blouse, you see. A rather unfortunate incident with a glass of red wine. But that, of course, is entirely unrelated to my health.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. I can assure you, Ms. Pandolfi, your medical information is strictly confidential. And I'm afraid I don’t have any recommendations for dry cleaners. I suggest you consult a directory. If you have no further questions, I believe our consultation is complete. Have a pleasant day. .
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Good day to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, the lack of bedside manner… and no recommendations for a dry cleaner? Unacceptable. .
