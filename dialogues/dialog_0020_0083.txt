DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Beinborn, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s not really sick sick, you understand. More…a little down. I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “get well” card, maybe? Or something… encouraging. My niece, she thinks I need a little… lift. It’s silly, I know, but she worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're not necessarily feeling ill, but experiencing some… low spirits, and your niece suggested something to help boost your mood. I can certainly document that. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "down"?
PATIENT: “Down.” Yes. It’s hard to explain. Just…not myself. Things bother me more. Small things. The neighbor’s dog barking, for instance. Used to not bother me a bit. Now…it’s like I just want everyone to quiet down. And…I don't have much energy for things. Used to keep the yard nice, you know? Now…it’s a mess. It's just…a feeling. A bad feeling. Not a sickness, like a cold. But…unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increased irritability – the dog barking being a good example – and a loss of energy and interest in things you used to enjoy, like yard work. How long have you been feeling this way, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think. It started…probably around springtime, I’d say. Maybe March? Yes, March. Right around when my ex-wife…well, she called. Said she needed some money. That always throws me off. Always. Makes me…not want to do anything. It’s been…on and off since then. Worse some days than others, you understand. But always there, in the back of my mind. A little…weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like this started around March, coinciding with a phone call from your ex-wife requesting financial assistance, and it’s been ongoing with fluctuating intensity. Has anything else significant happened around that time, or since then, that might be contributing to how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Significant…hmm. Well, my son, he hasn’t been calling as much. He lives in Florida, you know? Busy life, I suppose. Doesn't mean he shouldn't call his old man, though. And…the price of coffee went up again! Little things, like I said. But they add up. It’s just…everything feels harder. Like wading through mud, you understand? It's not a big thing, not like a broken leg. But…it’s wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so reduced contact from your son, and even seemingly minor stressors like the price increase of coffee are feeling more impactful than usual. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by these things. To get a more complete picture, Mr. Kammer, have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Sleep…yes, actually. I wake up a lot. Middle of the night, for no reason. Just…wide awake. Staring at the ceiling. Thinking about things. And…I don’t eat as much. Not because I'm not hungry, exactly. Just…food doesn't taste as good. It’s like…what’s the point? I make myself eat something, you understand. Don't want my niece worrying even more. But it’s not enjoyable. Like everything is…flat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep and a decreased enjoyment of food, along with the overall feeling of flatness you described. These are all important things to note. Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness, or thoughts that things won’t get better?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… hmm. That’s a strong word, Doctor. I don’t go around hoping for bad things, if that’s what you mean. But…I don’t see things getting better, no. Everything just…is. And it’s probably going to stay that way. The dog will keep barking, my son will keep busy, and my ex-wife will keep asking for money. It's just…life. Not sad, exactly. Just…disappointing. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're feeling a sense of resignation and a lack of optimism about the future, coupled with ongoing stressors. It's good you're able to articulate this. To help me rule out any underlying medical causes, and to get a better understanding of what's going on, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history…oh, goodness. Where to begin? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. Had a broken arm when I was a boy, fell out of a tree. Had the usual things, you know? Flu shots, a bout of pneumonia a few years back. Nothing serious, really. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once. But I take a pill for that. Mostly, I’ve just been…tough. Always been a tough one. Is this really necessary? I just want a little card, you understand. To lift my spirits a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Kammer, and I appreciate you sharing that. It's helpful to have a complete picture, even if it's just to rule things out. Knowing your history helps me determine the best course of action, and ensure we’re addressing everything. Just a few basic questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, with bug bites, but that’s just normal, you understand? Nothing serious. The doctor gave me some pills for my blood pressure a while back. Didn’t bother me none. So, no allergies. Not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you said you take medication for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. A little white pill. Every morning. Keeps things…steady, I guess. The doctor told me it was important. I don’t really pay much attention to the details, you understand. Just take the pill. Keeps the doctor happy, keeps my niece from worrying. That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you happen to know the name of that medication, or the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, Doctor, you’re asking a lot! Names and numbers…not my strong suit, you understand. It’s a little white pill. I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street. They know me there. Just give them my name, they give me the pills. I don't bother with the labels or anything. It's…complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can look it up in your pharmacy records later, if you'd like. No need to worry about it right now. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of everything. Now, just one more quick question about your past. Have you ever been diagnosed with any mental health conditions, like depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Mental…what now? Look, Doctor, I’m a simple man. Stationary engineer, boiler operator. I fix things. I don’t…feel things, not in that way. I get frustrated, sure. Annoyed. But not…diagnosed. Never been to see anyone about my head, if that's what you mean. Always been able to handle things myself. Tough, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No prior diagnoses related to mental health. Mr. Kammer, based on what you've told me today – the low mood, loss of energy, disrupted sleep, decreased appetite, feelings of hopelessness, and ongoing stressors – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's a common condition, and very treatable. But I want to be thorough. Would you be comfortable if I ordered a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical causes?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Goodness gracious. Now you’re talking about poking me with needles? Look, Doctor, I came here for a card. A little piece of paper to cheer me up. Not a whole medical examination. I appreciate you being thorough, I suppose. But…is this really necessary? Can’t we just write the card? I’m a tough old man, remember? I don’t need poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Kammer. I apologize if I'm pushing this too far. I understand you came here for something simple, and I respect your wishes. However, even a simple change in your overall well-being can sometimes be connected to an underlying medical issue. The blood tests would just be a precaution, to rule out anything that might be contributing to how you're feeling. But, if you're truly not comfortable with it, we can skip them. Would you be open to discussing some other options for improving your mood, such as talking to a therapist, or trying some simple lifestyle changes?
PATIENT: Therapist? Goodness no. Talking to someone about my feelings? That’s…unthinkable. Lifestyle changes? What do you mean? Stop drinking coffee? I already told you the price went up! Look, Doctor. I'm a simple man. I just want a little card. A little encouragement. To lift my spirits. Is that too much to ask? Maybe a nice picture of a boat? I like boats.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kammer, that’s not too much to ask at all. A nice card with a picture of a boat sounds lovely. I apologize for making you feel pressured and for getting carried away with the medical investigation. It's my job to consider all possibilities, but I should have been more sensitive to your wishes. Let’s focus on getting you that card. I'll write something encouraging, and we’ll definitely include a nice picture of a boat. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…perfect, Doctor. Thank you. A boat would be lovely. Something peaceful. And maybe a nice message about…toughness? About getting through things. Yes. That would be perfect. Thank you. I appreciate that. Really, I do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I'm happy to do it. Let me see... "Thinking of you and sending positive thoughts." How about something along the lines of, “Wishing you strength and peace during this time. Remember your resilience and ability to overcome challenges”?
PATIENT: That's…good, Doctor. Yes, that's very good. "Resilience." I like that word. And…a picture of a sailboat? Yes. A nice, blue sailboat. That would be perfect. Thank you. Truly. That's all I needed.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Kammer. I hope this brightens your day. It's my pleasure. If you ever feel like talking, or if things get worse, please don’t hesitate to come back. And remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Beinborn. That's…very kind of you. Yes. A nice, blue sailboat. Perfect. I appreciate your time. And thank you again. Goodbye.
