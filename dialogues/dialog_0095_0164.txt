DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, actually. But I've been feeling really unwell after eating fava beans. I get really tired and…yellow. Like, my skin gets yellow, and the whites of my eyes, too. It's happened a couple of times now, and I figured it was time to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yellowing of the skin and eyes… that’s jaundice, and fatigue along with it. And it seems to be connected to fava beans. Has this happened every time you eat them, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Hmm… every time, I think. It doesn't happen immediately after, usually a day or so later. But yeah, every time I’ve had fava beans recently, it’s happened. I hadn’t eaten them in years before this started, so I didn’t really connect it at first, to be honest. It took a couple of times before I realised. It's a bit silly, isn’t it? Getting sick from beans!
DOCTOR: No, it's not silly at all. It actually sounds like a fairly specific reaction. It could be G6PD deficiency, which can cause that very issue with fava beans. We'll need to do some tests to confirm, of course. First, let’s go over your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was… a long time ago! I don’t take any regular medication, either. Oh, I did have some problems with my gallbladder a few years back, but it was eventually removed. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and gallbladder removal… that's good to know. The gallbladder removal could be relevant, we'll take that into consideration. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I can eat pretty much anything without a problem… except, apparently, fava beans! It's a bit frustrating, really. I used to like them.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a bit tricky. My parents… they’ve both passed away now. And I didn’t really talk to them about medical stuff like that, to be honest. They weren’t really the type. I have a brother, but we’re not very close, and I haven’t seen him in years. I don't know anything about his medical history, either. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's not something I've ever thought to ask about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Haggar. It’s not uncommon. We’ll proceed with what we have. Let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. I don't like smoking, and my husband… well, he didn’t either. He passed away a few years ago. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Nothing excessive, maybe a couple of times a week. And I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, lots of vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you drink alcohol regularly, or only occasionally like you said with dinner?
PATIENT: Just occasionally, really. Like I said, a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. I don’t drink spirits or beer, just red wine. And not every night, maybe three or four times a week at most. I definitely don’t go overboard, if that makes sense. I'm not a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to confirm, the jaundice—the yellowing—happens after eating fava beans, and you said it takes about a day or so to develop?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It doesn't happen straight away. I eat the beans, and then the next day I start to feel tired, and I notice my skin getting a bit…yellowish. And the whites of my eyes, too. It usually lasts a few days, and then it goes away on its own, as long as I don't eat any more beans. It's a bit unsettling, though. It makes me feel quite unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen, and then I'll take a look at your skin and eyes. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Heart and lungs sound clear. And I can see some mild jaundice in your sclera – the whites of your eyes – and some slight yellowing of your skin. Given your history, I strongly suspect G6PD deficiency. I’m going to order a G6PD enzyme assay, and a complete blood count. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, it's best to avoid fava beans and other foods known to trigger reactions in G6PD-deficient individuals. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Avoiding fava beans is a small price to pay if it means figuring out what's going on. I’m just relieved we’re getting it checked out. What other foods should I avoid? Is there a list somewhere? And how long should I expect to avoid them for? I mean, if it is G6PD deficiency, is it something I'll have to worry about forever?
DOCTOR: Good questions, Ms. Haggar. While we await the results, I'll provide you with a list of foods and medications to avoid – or be very cautious with. It's not a comprehensive list, but it covers the most common triggers. . The list includes some beans besides fava, some fish, and certain medications, like some antibiotics and antimalarials. If it is G6PD deficiency, it’s a lifelong condition, but it’s generally manageable by avoiding triggers. We will discuss it in detail once we have the results. If you experience any sudden fatigue, dark urine, or yellowing of the skin after consuming anything on this list, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That list is very helpful, thank you. It’s good to know it’s manageable, even if it’s lifelong. I think I just need to process everything a bit. Thank you for being so thorough and explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing we're on top of it. When should I expect to hear about the results?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Haggar. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. The lab usually takes about 3 to 5 business days to return the results. My nurse will call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you have any concerns, or if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Ms. Haggar. Take care. .
