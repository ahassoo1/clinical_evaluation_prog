DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Well, it's this… discoloration. And the tiredness, of course. It's quite bothersome, really. I feel… depleted. Not the sort of thing a man of my standing should be dealing with. I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Discoloration… and tiredness. Alright. Let’s start with the discoloration. Where exactly is this located?
PATIENT: Everywhere, practically. Arms, mostly. And… the legs, I suppose. It’s difficult to say precisely. It’s not… a pleasant shade, let me tell you. I haven’t been out in the sun, not recently. It’s not like I spend my days lounging about, you know. A working man, I am. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Everywhere?
PATIENT: Well, not literally everywhere, Doctor. Don’t be ridiculous. It’s… prominent on the extremities. The limbs. It's just… pervasive. Look, are we going to discuss this or simply catalogue the obvious? I haven’t got all day. My wife needs assistance with the garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's see… Mr. Drahota, the chart says you're 85. And you’re describing widespread discoloration on your arms and legs… Have you noticed any itching, pain, or changes in skin texture along with this discoloration?
PATIENT: Itching? No. Pain? A general… ache, perhaps. But that's just old age, I assure you. A man my age is entitled to a few aches and pains. Changes in texture… I haven't examined myself that closely, Doctor. Really. Is that what you expect? Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long has this discoloration been present?
PATIENT: Long enough. Weeks, certainly. Months, perhaps. It’s all rather… blurred, you understand. Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be. I've been… preoccupied. With work, and other matters. The important things, you see. Not obsessing over the color of my skin. Really, Doctor, is this necessary? Every detail?
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Now that you mention it… my appetite hasn’t been what it once was. And I tire rather easily. Which, as I’ve already stated, is bothersome. Is this… contagious? My wife is a bit… delicate.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medications? No. A sensible man doesn't rely on potions and pills if he can avoid it. And conditions… There was… something, years ago. A bout of… the grippe, I believe. Nothing serious. I’m a robust individual. Always have been. My wife handles all the medical details. She has a… memory for these things. I prefer to focus on more… substantial matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your skin. Please, roll up your sleeves and trousers. I need to physically examine the discoloration.
PATIENT: Must we? Really, Doctor? It’s rather… undignified. Very well. There. Happy now? I trust this won't take long. My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: The discoloration appears to be… generalized hyperpigmentation. It's difficult to say much without further investigation. Skin feels… cool to the touch. No obvious lesions or swelling. We’ll need to run some blood work to rule out any underlying causes. Complete blood count, liver function tests, and a basic metabolic panel. We should also check your iron levels.
PATIENT: Iron levels? I work with iron, Doctor. Rebar, you know. Reinforcing steel. Naturally, there's going to be… some iron about. Is that what this is about? Very well. Blood work it is. But I expect a quick turnaround. And a clear explanation of whatever… nonsense you find. I haven’t got time for vague pronouncements. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw the blood samples. I'll have the results sent to me. We can discuss them when they’re available. The nurse will escort you. She’ll also give you instructions about fasting before the blood draw, just in case. Any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I’m aware of. I’ve handled all sorts of things in my life, Doctor. Steel, concrete, the elements… A little latex isn’t going to bother me. Honestly, these questions. Very well. Let’s get this done. The sooner I'm back home assisting my wife, the better. Lead the way, please. I haven't got all day. .
DOCTOR: The nurse is right outside. She'll handle it. Honestly, some patients… .
