DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a little embarrassing, honestly, but I've noticed a change in my body odor. It just… smells different. Not worse, exactly, just different than it usually does. I thought maybe it was something I was eating, but it's been going on for a couple of weeks now and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Purtee. It’s not embarrassing at all to discuss changes in your body, and it's good you’re addressing this. Changes can be indicative of various things, and it’s always best to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe this “different” odor a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a tricky one to describe. It's…sweeter, I think. Not like perfume sweet, more like… a slightly fruity smell? And it seems to be more noticeable after I've been working, you know, laying floors. It's not just sweat, it's… layered, if that makes sense. I usually just smell like, well, normal work sweat. This is… different. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Purtee. The description of a sweeter, slightly fruity odor is certainly relevant. And the correlation with physical exertion – laying floors, as you mentioned – is also important. To get a clearer picture, let’s delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this altered body odor?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I do hard work, so that could just be that. My appetite's been normal, no weight loss or gain. No fever, no rashes, nothing like that. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been thirstier than usual. I've been drinking a lot more water lately, but I figured it was just the heat. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Purtee, that absolutely counts. Increased thirst – what we call polydipsia – is a potentially significant symptom, especially when combined with the altered body odor and fatigue you've described. Now, let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been controlled with medication for a long time now. Just a small dose, nothing major. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but I haven't had any problems with that since. Other than that, not really. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I keep pretty active with the floor laying, you know. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Purtee. Controlled hypertension is important to note, and the cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – is also relevant. Now, regarding medications, you mentioned you take something for your blood pressure. Could you tell me the name and dosage of that medication, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for about five years now, and my doctor checks my blood pressure regularly. It usually stays right where it needs to be. I haven’t changed the dose or anything recently. I always make sure to take it with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10mg daily, stable dosage. That's helpful. Now, let’s move onto allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had a problem with pollen or dust or anything like that. I sometimes get a little itchy after being in the sun, but that’s just a mild sunburn, I think. Nothing serious. My mom always said I had a strong constitution!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Purtee. No known allergies is certainly helpful. Now, let's briefly touch on family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had it for a long time. She managed it with diet and medication, but it was definitely a factor in her health. My father had heart problems later in life, but he didn't take care of himself very well, if I'm being honest. He smoked for years and didn’t eat a healthy diet. I try to take better care of myself than either of them did. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Purtee. A family history of both diabetes and heart disease is important to note. Thank you for sharing that. Finally, let’s briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never have. My parents' health issues scared me straight, I suppose. I don’t even like the smell of cigarette smoke. And I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with a nice dinner once or twice a year. Definitely no recreational drugs. I get enough excitement laying floors!
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Purtee. That’s excellent. Thank you for being so forthcoming with your information. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not afraid of needles, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, respiratory rate is 16, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I'm going to check your feet for sensation and reflexes. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Your skin appears normal overall. Based on the information you’ve provided and the findings of the physical exam, I am concerned about the possibility of diabetes. The altered body odor, increased thirst, fatigue, and mild swelling in your ankles, combined with your family history, are suggestive of this condition. However, we need to confirm this with some laboratory testing. Would you be willing to have a blood sugar test and a urine analysis?
PATIENT: That… doesn’t surprise me, honestly. With my mom having diabetes, I’ve always worried about it. And I have been extra thirsty lately. Yes, absolutely, I’m willing to have the tests. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and get it taken care of.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Purtee. I understand your concern, and we will get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the lab technician draw some blood and collect a urine sample. The results should be available within a few hours. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to drink plenty of water. While we wait for the results, I also want to discuss some potential lifestyle modifications that can help manage blood sugar levels, even before we have a definitive diagnosis. Are you familiar with the principles of a diabetic diet?
PATIENT: A little, I think. My mom talked about it a lot. Something about limiting sugar and carbs, right? And eating more… vegetables and lean protein? I’m not a terrible cook, but I definitely enjoy my comfort food sometimes. It’s hard to change habits, you know? I’m willing to try, though. I just don’t want to feel sick all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Purtee. It is challenging to change ingrained habits, and nobody expects you to overhaul your diet overnight. The key is to make small, sustainable changes. Focusing on portion control, choosing complex carbohydrates over simple sugars, and incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein are excellent starting points. We can also discuss resources for healthy recipes and meal planning. Now, while we wait for those lab results, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so thoroughly. It's a little scary, but I feel much better knowing we're getting it checked out. I guess I'll just try to relax and drink some water while we wait for the results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. It’s my pleasure to help. And you’re doing the right thing by taking proactive steps. I’ll have the lab technician come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. I’ll be back as soon as the results are available to discuss them with you. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to let the nursing staff know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms.
