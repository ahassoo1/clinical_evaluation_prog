DOCTOR: Hi Mande, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but it's worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is interesting. Tired and yellowing… and it seems to be linked to fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The tiredness is really bad, like I can barely get through the day. And my skin and the whites of my eyes… they get yellow. It started a few weeks ago, and I noticed it always happens after I eat them. I had a big plate of them with dinner last week, and was practically sick afterwards, and then really yellow the next day. I haven’t eaten them since, just in case.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. That definitely gives us something to work with. Just to clarify, when you say "yellow," is it a gradual change, or does it come on suddenly after eating the fava beans?
PATIENT: It's… gradual, I think. It doesn't happen instantly when I eat them. It's more like over the next day or so. I'll start to notice my skin looks a bit off, and then it gets more and more noticeable. And then, after a few days, it fades again once I haven’t had any more beans. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain properly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A gradual onset after fava bean consumption is helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and yellowing – things like dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain, or nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it… my urine has been darker than usual. And I've felt a bit nauseous a couple of times, but I thought that was just a stomach bug. I haven't really paid attention to my stools, to be honest. No abdominal pain, though. Just the tiredness, yellowing, and the dark pee, I think. Is that… a bad sign? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Dark urine and nausea along with the tiredness and yellowing… that's definitely something we need to investigate. It could be a number of things, but given the connection to fava beans, we need to consider a condition called G6PD deficiency. Have you ever had any blood tests done before, or been told you had any issues with your red blood cells?
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency? I’ve never heard of that. Um… blood tests? I’ve had the usual ones at the doctor's, for check-ups, I suppose. But no, I don’t think anyone has ever specifically said anything about my red blood cells. I'm not sure. I don't really remember. Is it something serious? I’m really not good with medical stuff, I get a bit flustered.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, don’t worry about getting flustered. It’s my job to explain things clearly. G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition where your body doesn’t have enough of an enzyme called G6PD. This enzyme helps protect your red blood cells, and without enough of it, they can break down prematurely. Certain foods – like fava beans – and certain medications can trigger this breakdown, leading to symptoms like tiredness, yellowing, and dark urine. It can be serious, but it’s often manageable with some precautions. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order a blood test to check your G6PD levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, then yes, please. I’d rather know what's going on, even if it’s not good news. A blood test sounds fine. Will it take long? And will I need to fast beforehand or anything? I have work tomorrow, so I need to know if I can go straight in.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It’s always best to get things checked out. The blood test is fairly straightforward, and shouldn’t take too long – maybe 15-20 minutes at the lab. And thankfully, no, you don’t need to fast beforehand – you can eat and drink as normal. I'll write you a lab order now. While we wait for the results, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to know about the fasting. Thank you. Um… let me think. I don’t really have any serious medical conditions. I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. Just a small dose, once a day. It’s called… Lisinopril, I think? And that’s it, really. No allergies that I know of, and I don’t take any other pills or anything. I try to stay healthy, mostly. I walk a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for high blood pressure – that's good to know. And no allergies, that's helpful too. And good on you for staying active, that’s excellent. Let me just document all of this. Alright, I've got your blood pressure medication noted, and the allergy information. We'll get the G6PD test done, and once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, it's best to avoid eating fava beans, just to be safe. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible. Avoid the fava beans, got it. A couple of days for the results, and then a follow-up. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It's made me feel a lot less worried. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help ease your worries a bit. We’ll get to the bottom of this, don’t you worry. Here’s the lab order. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. They’re very efficient there. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, thank you. You've answered all my questions. I’ll go and get the blood test done now, and I’ll wait to hear from your office about scheduling a follow-up. Thank you again, Doctor Decosta. I really appreciate your help.
