DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. The… the tryout. For the team. It’s… important. I need the paper, you know? To say I can play. My back… it feels okay, mostly. Though, sometimes… it just… is. You understand. It’s not a bad pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: Right. A physical for a team tryout. And you’re experiencing some… persistent discomfort in your back. “Just is,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh. Well… it’s… lower. Down there. Not the middle of my back. More… where the pants sit, you know? And it… gets tighter when I bend. Like when I gotta… pick something up. Or… tie my shoes. It's not… sharp. Just… a reminder. Old reminder. I don’t… remember how it started. Years ago, I think. Maybe from… lifting. At the job.
DOCTOR: So, lower back pain, exacerbated by bending and lifting. No acute onset, long-standing… vague history. Have you tried anything for it already?
PATIENT: Already? Like what? Pills? No. I don't… like those. My… ex-wife, she liked pills. Gave me a headache just looking at them. I… rub it sometimes. With… liniment. That red stuff. Smells strong. Doesn’t do much, really. Just… feels good to rub. That’s all. And… I try not to lift too much. When I can help it. It’s not like I’m… a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. No medication, topical application of… something. And you're modifying activity. Do you experience any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Not really. Sometimes… my feet feel… cold. But that’s just the shoes, I think. They get… damp. Even the good ones. And… sometimes, after I've been standing a long time, they feel… heavy. But that's just… standing, you know? It’s normal. Old age. It's what happens. Everyone gets heavy feet eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any injuries to your back – a fall, a twist, anything like that?
PATIENT: Injuries… Hmm. Let me think. Years ago… at the job site. Big box. Heavy. Almost… dropped it on my foot. That was close! I… twisted something, I think. Reached for it funny. Had to go home early. Took a couple of days. Nothing… broken. Just… sore. That was a long time ago. Before… everything. I don’t… remember the year. It was… summer, I think. Hot. Very hot. Does that count as an injury? It felt like one at the time.
DOCTOR: So, a possible strain years ago. Okay. Let's do a quick exam. Just going to have you stand and bend forward, then backwards, and I’ll have a look. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Bend? Yes, I can bend. Though… it's not like I used to. Be gentle, alright? These old bones aren't what they used to be. You gotta understand. It’s… age. It takes a minute to get going. Don't rush me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Forward bend… limited range of motion, slight discomfort with flexion. Extension is… also restricted. Palpation reveals tenderness to the lumbar spine, specifically at L4-L5. No radiculopathy noted. No step-off deformity. Reflexes 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Strength 5/5 in all major muscle groups. Alright. Exam reveals some limitations and tenderness. It seems you have some chronic lower back strain. I don't see anything immediately concerning, but…
PATIENT: Strain? That's what I thought. It's just… old. I’ve been lifting things my whole life. Building things. You gotta understand. That’s… work. So, can I… go now? I need that paper. For the team. They need to know… I’m okay. Mostly. Will this… strain… keep me from playing? That’s what matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I’m going to write you a note stating you have chronic lumbar strain. I recommend physical therapy to help improve your strength and flexibility. I strongly advise you to avoid heavy lifting until you’ve completed a course of therapy. And listen to your body. Don’t push yourself. Here. This should suffice for your team. If the pain worsens, or you experience any numbness, tingling, or weakness, return immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Therapy? Hmm. More… appointments? I don't… like appointments. But… the team… So this… says I can play? If I’m careful? Okay. Careful. Yes. I can be careful. Thank you, Doctor. I… appreciate it. And… no pills, right? Just… careful? Because I really don't like those. .
DOCTOR: That is correct. No medication at this time. Avoid heavy lifting and follow up with physical therapy. Have a good day, Mr. Bartok. .
