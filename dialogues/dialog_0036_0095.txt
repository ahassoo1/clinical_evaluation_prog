DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about time, isn’t it? I woke up yesterday and half my face feels…wrong. Can’t hear out of one ear either. It’s rather inconvenient, if you must know. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, “half your face feels wrong” and hearing loss in one ear…that certainly sounds concerning, and I understand your frustration with it interfering with your daily life. Can you describe what "wrong" feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How am I supposed to describe it? It's…droopy. Like everything on this side is just…heavier. And numb, a little. Not completely, but…diminished. It’s hard to explain to someone who isn’t experiencing it, isn’t it? I mean, you’re a doctor, shouldn't you know what these things feel like?
DOCTOR: You're right, it is difficult to describe, and you're absolutely correct that experiencing it firsthand is different. I appreciate you trying to explain it to me. “Droopy” and “diminished sensation” are helpful. Is the drooping constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, thankfully not. It started very suddenly yesterday morning. I noticed it while brushing my teeth. It’s…better when I lie down, I suppose. Although, what good is lying down when one has responsibilities? And it’s definitely worse when I try to smile. It just…doesn’t work properly. It's quite unsettling, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started suddenly yesterday morning, is worse with smiling, and slightly better when lying down. And it affects the left side of your face, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, the left side. Honestly, it’s rather obvious. Do I look like I’m having trouble with the right side? Some doctors these days… you have to tell them absolutely everything. It's just…common sense, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, and I apologize if my questioning seemed obvious. I just want to be thorough. So, apart from the drooping and numbness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, my taste is a bit off, I suppose. Everything seems…bland. And I’ve had a bit of a headache on the left side, behind my ear. Nothing major, just…there. And I feel a little dizzy sometimes, but I put that down to being a bit stressed with everything else. Is that relevant? I really don't have time for a long list of complaints.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all relevant. Altered taste, headache on the left side, and dizziness…thank you for telling me. Have you had any fever, difficulty speaking, or problems with your vision?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Speaking is…fine. A little slurred perhaps, but that's probably just me being tired. And my vision is perfectly acceptable, thank you very much. I read constantly, you know. Keeps the mind sharp. No, no fever, no problems with speaking, and certainly no vision issues. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply listing off possibilities indefinitely?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere. Based on what you’ve told me - the sudden onset of facial drooping, numbness, altered taste, headache, and dizziness - it sounds like we need to consider a few possibilities, one of which could be Bell's palsy. However, we need to rule out other, more serious causes first. I’d like to do a quick physical exam to assess your facial muscle strength, reflexes, and hearing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Bell's…palsy? Never heard of it. Sounds rather alarming. And "more serious causes"? Now that doesn't sound pleasant at all. Look, I’m not a fan of poking and prodding if it can be avoided. But… I suppose if it’s necessary to rule things out, do what you must. Just be quick about it, please. I have a luncheon meeting I absolutely cannot miss.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Bell’s palsy is a condition that affects a nerve in the face, causing weakness or paralysis. It's often temporary, but it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke, which is why the exam is important. First, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll briefly examine your face to assess the muscle weakness. I'll also check your hearing and reflexes. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Is it alright if I start with the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Blood pressure is fine, I suppose. Just…don’t squeeze too hard. I have rather sensitive veins. And please, explain what you're doing as you go. I dislike being kept in the dark. It's unsettling, to say the least. Honestly, I've had more thorough examinations at the dentist.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m placing this cuff around your upper arm. It will inflate momentarily and squeeze briefly, but it shouldn’t be painful. This will give us a reading of your blood pressure and pulse. It’s a standard part of any medical evaluation. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90, and your pulse is 78. A little elevated, but not critically high. Now, I’d like to check your facial muscle strength. I'll ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, close your eyes tightly, and puff out your cheeks. I’ll also listen to your ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Though I still maintain this is rather unnecessary. Very well. Just...be gentle, as I said before. I’m not accustomed to being prodded and poked. There. Happy? It’s not exactly a performance, is it? As you can see, it’s… difficult. And quite distressing, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Thank you for cooperating, Stephane. And I understand your distress. I'm noting the weakness on the left side of your face, as you've described. Your reflexes are normal. I’m also noting some diminished hearing in your left ear, which is consistent with what you've already told me. Based on this examination, the most likely diagnosis at this point is Bell's palsy. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a blood test to check for inflammation, and potentially a CT scan or MRI of your brain. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Inflammation? A CT scan? Good heavens. This is getting rather serious, isn’t it? Look, I don’t do well with needles. And scans… they’re just… confining. Are you certain this is necessary? I mean, couldn't it just be Bell’s palsy? I have a very busy schedule, you know. Luncheons, meetings… I simply don’t have time for extensive testing. And frankly, the thought of poking around inside my brain is… unsettling. Is there absolutely no other way? Perhaps some medication? A strong pain reliever? Anything to avoid these… procedures?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I wouldn’t recommend these tests if they weren’t potentially helpful in ruling out more serious conditions. A stroke, for example, can present with similar symptoms to Bell’s palsy, and early diagnosis is crucial. The blood test is relatively simple, and the CT scan or MRI would provide us with a clear picture of your brain. However, we can start with the blood test, and then reassess the need for a scan based on the results. We can also discuss medication to manage the symptoms. Corticosteroids, for example, can reduce inflammation and potentially speed up recovery from Bell's palsy. And pain relievers can help manage any discomfort you may be experiencing. Would you be comfortable with starting with the blood test, and then we can discuss the possibility of a scan if the results warrant it?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A blood test. It’s the least objectionable of the options, I suppose. Just…promise me you’ll find someone efficient. I absolutely detest waiting. And be gentle. I faint easily. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. And do tell me how long this will take. I have a luncheon reservation, you know. I’m already going to be late. The audacity. But…yes. Fine. Let’s get this over with. But make it quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I’ll make this as quick and efficient as possible. The phlebotomist is very experienced, and it should only take a few minutes to draw the blood. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Here's the form. Please take it to the lab down the hall. Once the results are back, we’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a short course of prednisone, a corticosteroid, to help reduce inflammation. It may help speed up your recovery. And I’ll also prescribe a pain reliever to manage any discomfort. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Prednisone, you say? Does that have…side effects? I simply cannot afford to gain weight. And I certainly don’t want to become…moody. Honestly, this is becoming increasingly complicated. And what if the results are…bad? Will I need to be hospitalized? I have commitments, you know. Luncheons, meetings… It's a very busy schedule. I suppose… I’ll take the prescription. But I want to be clear. If it requires extensive testing or hospitalization, I will be seeking a second opinion. A very firm second opinion. Is that understood? And please, tell me what to do if my symptoms worsen before I get the results.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Prednisone can have side effects, including weight gain and mood changes, but these are usually mild and temporary. We can discuss strategies to minimize these side effects, such as dietary adjustments and regular exercise. Regarding the results, if the blood test reveals anything concerning, we’ll discuss all your options, including the possibility of further testing, such as an MRI or CT scan. If hospitalization is necessary, we’ll, of course, discuss that with you in detail and work with you to minimize any disruption to your schedule. If your symptoms worsen before you get the results - if you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness on the other side of your face, difficulty speaking, vision changes, or a severe headache - please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here are the prescriptions, and the lab requisition. I'll also give you a written summary of our discussion, including information about Bell’s palsy, potential side effects of prednisone, and warning signs to watch out for. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. Though frankly, I am still quite apprehensive. This has been a most unpleasant experience. Honestly, I’ve had more helpful interactions with automated telephone systems. And do tell me… how long will it take for the prednisone to start working? I have a luncheon tomorrow, you know. I simply must look presentable. Very well. I shall be on my way. I expect a prompt follow-up, and I sincerely hope these results are favorable. Good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Prednisone typically starts to show an effect within 24-48 hours, but it can take several days to see the full benefit. I hope you experience some improvement soon. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I wish you a pleasant luncheon.
