DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a strange one, actually. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it before they’ll approve my trip. It’s for a… a memorial trip, overseas.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. I understand. And it’s for a trip overseas… for a memorial trip, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My husband… he passed away last year. He always wanted to visit Mongolia, his homeland, and I’m finally going to… to scatter his ashes there. It’s been… difficult getting everything arranged, and now this.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Ms. Sayar. That sounds like a very meaningful, though understandably difficult, trip. To write this letter, I’ll need to gather some information about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of – things like heart problems, lung issues, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been quite healthy, honestly. No heart trouble, my lungs are good – I used to hike a lot, though I haven’t been as much lately. And no diabetes or anything chronic. I did have a… a bad flu last winter, but I recovered fully. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. Just confirming, no chronic conditions. Recent flu, but fully recovered. And you have Medicare. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing. I prefer to avoid medication if I can. I’ve been taking a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. And I stopped that a few months ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had a need for them, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that healed cleanly with just a cast. Nothing since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything, no problems with pollen, animals, nothing. My husband always teased me about having an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Now, Ms. Sayar, could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a bit complicated. My parents are both… were both quite healthy, really. Lived into their eighties. My father had high blood pressure towards the end, but it was managed with diet. My husband’s side… his mother had some heart trouble, I think, and his grandfather had something with his lungs, but it was a long time ago. I don't have specifics, honestly. We weren't very close with his family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. So, no major concerning family history that you're aware of, some high blood pressure in your father, and some heart and lung issues on your husband's side, but limited specifics. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells recently?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I’ve felt perfectly fine, honestly. A little…sad, obviously, but physically I’m doing well. I walk a couple of miles a day, just to keep moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting. Walking a couple of miles a day… Ms. Sayar, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to confirm everything is as you’ve described. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to get this letter sorted out as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 128/76. Ears are clear, tympanic membranes are normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Everything sounds good, Ms. Sayar. Your heart and lungs sound healthy, blood pressure is normal, and your ears and throat look fine. Do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: No, that’s… that’s very reassuring, thank you. I think that covers everything. I just really need that letter, if possible. I’m flying on the 15th of August.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and examination today, I can certainly write a letter stating that you are medically fit to fly. I’ll include a statement that you have no known contraindications to air travel. Let me just finish typing this up… Here you go. It’s dated today, August 2nd, 2025. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions about the content of the letter?
PATIENT: Yes, this looks perfect, thank you so much, Doctor. It says everything I need. I really appreciate your help. I can pay now, if you’d like.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please take that to the receptionist at the front desk for payment. I’m glad I could help, Ms. Sayar. And again, I'm very sorry for your loss. I wish you safe travels, and I hope your trip is meaningful. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. You’ve been very kind. I think I’ll be alright now. .
