DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Andraca, was it? Yes, well, frankly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My husband insisted. Something about… a social visit? He fills out all these forms these days. Honestly, it’s quite a bother. New to the area, you know. Everything is so… different. Just trying to get it over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be a little overwhelming getting settled in a new place, and all the paperwork is a bit much sometimes. It sounds like your husband was proactive in scheduling this visit, perhaps for a general check-up?
PATIENT: A check-up... possibly. He worries, you see. Always has. Though, I feel perfectly fine. Perfectly. I haven't been ill in… oh, goodness, decades. Really. It’s probably just routine. Can we hurry this along? I have a luncheon to attend later, and one must be punctual.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. We can certainly work efficiently. Even if you're feeling perfectly well, a check-up is a good idea – it helps us get a baseline of your health and identify anything that might need attention down the road. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Health history… That’s a rather broad question, isn’t it? I suppose I’ve always been… robust. As I said, rarely sick. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps... but that was ages ago. Honestly, I don’t recall much beyond that. My husband handles all the medical records. He’s very organized. Is there a form I could fill out instead? This is rather… taxing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can absolutely take it slow. And yes, there is a form, but it sounds like it might be easier if I just ask you a few questions. Your husband handling the records is very helpful. Let's start with anything more recent. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those… conditions. Let me see… My husband mentioned something about my… cholesterol, perhaps? He was quite agitated about it last year. Something about numbers. But I felt perfectly fine! And I haven't seen a doctor regularly in… well, a very long time. I truly cannot recall if I've been diagnosed with anything. It's all rather confusing, you understand. Is this going to take much longer? I have a hair appointment next week, and one simply must look presentable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. It is confusing when details are unclear. Knowing about the cholesterol is helpful. We can check your records to get more specifics, but in the meantime, let's talk about any surgeries you've had, if any. Have you ever been hospitalized for a surgery or other serious medical reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. There was… something when I was quite young. My tonsils, I believe. A dreadful experience. And… oh, a minor procedure on my knee, decades ago. A sports injury, I suppose. Nothing serious. Really. I was quite active then. But other than that… no, nothing significant. My husband would know the dates, of course. He remembers everything. This is all rather… tiresome. Can we perhaps skip this part? I'm quite sure I'm in perfectly good health.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. We can move on. Just to be thorough, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. Let me see. Just a little something for my… joints, sometimes. When they ache. It’s a small, white pill. I can’t recall the name. My husband fills a little pill organizer for me each week. He’s very diligent. And… perhaps something for my… sleep, occasionally. But it doesn’t always work. Really, it's a minimal amount. I prefer natural remedies when possible. I simply cannot recall the names of these medications. It’s all quite bothersome, you understand. Can we move on to… something else? Perhaps discuss the luncheon? It's a charity event, you see. Very important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. We can definitely move on. Before we do, just a few quick questions about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmmm. Not that I’m aware of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I dislike shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not allergy. And I adore cats! Have several, actually. Beautiful Persians. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. This is all… unnecessarily detailed, you understand. I simply came for a social visit. Is it time to finish now? I really must be going. The luncheon is quite important, and I haven’t even chosen an outfit yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if the questions have felt extensive. It’s helpful to gather this information, even if it’s just to rule things out. To finish up, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears and throat. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A physical exam? Really? I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But please be quick. I have a luncheon to attend, you know. And I simply must look presentable. This is all… rather inconvenient. But, alright. Proceed, but do hurry. And be gentle! I bruise easily, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but we can monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Ears appear clear. Throat looks clear as well. Everything appears to be within normal limits for a preliminary exam. However, given the slightly elevated blood pressure, and the fact that you haven't had a check-up in some time, I would like to order some routine blood work. It will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… Oh, dear. More tests? Really? Honestly, I simply came for a social visit. This is becoming quite… excessive. But… alright. If you insist. But please, make it as quick and painless as possible. And could you send the results to my husband? He handles all these medical matters. He'll know what to do. I really must be going now. Thank you, Doctor. I trust you've gotten all the information you need.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand your concerns, and I will make sure the process is as quick and painless as possible. I will send the results directly to your husband. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk. They will schedule an appointment for you. It will just require a quick blood draw. For now, I recommend continuing with your regular routine, and if you experience any new or concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Engelhaupt. Have a lovely time at your luncheon. .
