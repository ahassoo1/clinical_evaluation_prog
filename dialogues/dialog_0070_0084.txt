DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s been… difficult to breathe, lately. Not painful, exactly. Just… short of breath. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s been going on for a little while now, I think. I’m sorry, dates are… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Certainly. “Fuzzy” is perfectly alright. We can work through it together. So, this shortness of breath and the dry mouth and eyes… when you first started noticing these symptoms, roughly when would that have been?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I… believe it was after the… the long, hot part of the summer last year? Or maybe the spring before that? It feels like a long time, but… I was traveling a lot then. Alaska, mostly. It’s hard to keep track when you're moving around. Does that… help at all? I apologize. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: No, that's quite alright, Ms. Kobler. Traveling can certainly disrupt one's sense of time. So, roughly a year or so. And would you say these symptoms have been constant since then, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They… come and go, yes. There are days when I barely notice them. And then other days… well, like today. It feels like I’m breathing through cotton. The dryness is worse when I’m trying to sleep, usually. I keep a glass of water by the bed, but it doesn’t always help. It's... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any particular activities or situations that seem to make the shortness of breath worse?
PATIENT: Walking… definitely walking. Especially uphill. And… when I'm reading for a long time. I’m a writer, you see, so I spend quite a bit of time reading. It’s a bit of a problem. It makes it harder to… concentrate. Not that the breathing is painful, just… distracting.
DOCTOR: I see. Distracting is a good way to put it. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the shortness of breath and dryness?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes my heart feels like it’s racing a little. Not a full-blown panic, just… quicker than usual. And… I’ve been very tired, lately. More tired than usual, even for me. I assumed it was from… working too much. But perhaps it’s connected. It’s hard to say, isn't it? Everything feels a little… disconnected.
DOCTOR: It is often difficult to pinpoint the source, yes. Racing heart and fatigue… those are certainly things we should investigate. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, allergies, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… not that I recall. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, I think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course. But nothing… serious. I did have a bad flu a few years ago, but I recovered fully. My mother… she had some trouble with her lungs when she was older, but I don't know what, exactly. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. I apologize. I wish I could provide more useful information.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kobler. You’re providing exactly what you can, and that’s perfectly fine. We can always piece things together. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just a multivitamin, usually. And sometimes I take something for… sleep. Melatonin, I think it’s called. It doesn't always work, but it helps a little. That’s about it. I generally try to avoid taking too many things. I prefer… natural remedies, when possible. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’ve eaten… quite a variety of things in my travels, and I’ve never had any trouble. Though… I don’t really eat shellfish anymore. Not because of an allergy, exactly. Just… it doesn’t sit well with me. It's more of a… preference, I suppose. I hope that isn’t confusing.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Kobler. A preference is perfectly valid. Alright. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… I was married, for a time. But we divorced several years ago. It was… amicable. I mostly keep to myself, these days. I travel a lot, as I mentioned. Alaska, mostly. I have a small cabin there. It's very quiet. I write… mostly stories. I don’t really have… close friends, I suppose. I’m not much of a social person. Does that answer your question? I'm afraid I'm not very exciting.
DOCTOR: You're perfectly fine, Ms. Kobler. That gives me a good understanding. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve never been a smoker. My mother smoked, unfortunately. But I always disliked it. It… smelled unpleasant. And I saw how it affected her. I always made a point of avoiding it. It’s… a terrible habit, I think.
DOCTOR: Agreed. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Or a small cocktail when I’m traveling. But not very often. I don’t really… enjoy it, to be honest. It doesn’t agree with me. And I prefer to be… clear-headed, especially when I’m writing. Does that make sense? I don't drink regularly, if that’s what you're asking.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly clear, Ms. Kobler. Thank you. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about other parts of your body, just to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any chest pain, swelling in your legs or ankles, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No chest pain, no. And I haven't noticed any swelling in my legs or ankles. I do feel like I’ve lost a little weight, lately. But I assumed that was from… not eating properly. I get very absorbed in my work, and I sometimes forget to eat. I suppose it’s possible, isn’t it? It's not a sudden weight loss, just… gradual. A few pounds, perhaps. It's difficult to say for certain. I don't weigh myself regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no changes in my bowel habits. Everything seems… normal there, thankfully. And no difficulty swallowing, no. I can eat and drink as usual. Though… my appetite hasn't been very good, lately. But I assumed that was connected to the… fatigue. Does that make sense? I’m starting to feel rather… scattered. I apologize. I wish I were more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, Ms. Kobler. It's good to hear you haven’t experienced those symptoms. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your neck. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… want to understand what’s happening. If you think it's necessary, please do what you need to do. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Alright. Your blood pressure is 118 over 76, which is within the normal range. Your heart rate is a little elevated at 88 beats per minute, but not excessively so. Your lungs sound clear, although I do notice a slight decrease in air entry in the lower lobes on both sides. And I feel a slightly enlarged lymph node on the left side of your neck. It’s small, but it’s worth noting. I do not feel any other enlarged nodes. I’m going to check your oxygen saturation now with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good. However, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and some blood work to check for any underlying inflammation or infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible. A chest X-ray and blood work. Yes, please. Whatever you think is necessary. I’d like to understand what’s causing this. Is the lymph node… concerning? It sounds… worrisome. I apologize. I’m probably overreacting. I just… I haven’t been feeling myself lately, and this is… unsettling. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed with the tests.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be concerned, Ms. Kobler, and it’s good that you are. The lymph node is small, and it could be due to a number of things, including a mild infection. However, it's best to investigate it further to rule out anything more serious. The chest X-ray and blood work will give us a much clearer picture. I’ll write up the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take the blood samples immediately. As for the X-ray, we can schedule that for this afternoon. Do you have any appointments or commitments later today that would make that difficult?
PATIENT: No, no commitments. This afternoon is fine. I can… rearrange things. I’m fairly flexible. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to… listen to me. And for explaining everything so clearly. It helps to… know what’s happening. I’ll go to the lab now, shall I? Please, let me know if there’s anything I should do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No, there’s nothing specific you need to do to prepare for the blood work. Just try to drink plenty of water beforehand. And the X-ray is a quick, painless procedure. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I will have my assistant contact you to let you know when they are available, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I'll go to the lab now, and I’ll wait for your assistant to contact me. I… feel a little better, just knowing what’s being done. Thank you. .
