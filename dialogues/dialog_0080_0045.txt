DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… I keep getting very red. My face, you know? It just… flushes. It comes and goes. Not always, but enough that it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Flushing, redness of the face, comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes when I’m talking to people. Not always! But sometimes. And… sometimes when I eat something spicy. Not every time, but a lot of the time. I had some chili yesterday and… yes. It was red then. I don’t know why. It just… happens. It’s been going on for maybe six months now.
DOCTOR: Six months, okay. So, it seems to be triggered by both social situations and spicy foods. Does it feel warm when your face flushes, or is it just the redness?
PATIENT: Yes, six months, I think. And… yes! It is warm. Very warm. Like… like a hot flash, but just my face. Not the rest of me. Just… burning. It’s not painful, not really. Just… uncomfortable. And makes me worried people are looking at me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so warmth and redness, triggered by social situations and spicy foods, lasting for… how long does a typical flush last?
PATIENT: Hmm. Usually… maybe five, ten minutes? Sometimes a little longer if I’m very… stressed. If I’m talking a lot, maybe. Then it goes away. Not right away, but slowly. It’s not like it comes on suddenly, you know? It builds up. A little red, then more, then more… and then goes down the same way. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset and offset, lasting 5-10 minutes, potentially longer with stress. Have you noticed anything else that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Let me think… Worse? Maybe… if I drink coffee. A little bit. Not every time, but sometimes. Better? Hmm… when I'm inside, it's not as bad. When it's very hot outside, it happens more. And… if I’m not talking so much. Quiet time, it's better. Does that make sense? I don't know if that helps.
DOCTOR: That does help, Enrique, thank you. So, heat and caffeine seem to be triggers, and quiet time is protective. Have you tried anything to help it already?
PATIENT: No. No, I haven't. I… I don't really know what to do. I just try to… avoid talking too much when I feel it coming on. And stay in the cool. I haven't used any medicine, or anything. I just… live with it. It's a bother, but… I thought maybe it was just getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly understandable. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your face closely. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… alright. Okay. My heart is… usually okay, I think. I walk a little bit every day, but not very far. I used to be more active. I hope it’s not something bad. But please, don’t worry me too much, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90, but not drastically so. I'm looking at your face now... I do see some mild flushing, and a few tiny visible blood vessels – what we call telangiectasias – but nothing alarming at this moment. Based on what you've told me, and this quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called rosacea. Have you ever heard of that?
PATIENT: Ros-ay-sha? No. I have not. What is that? Is it… bad? Is it something I can fix? I don't really understand what you mean about blood vessels. Are they… broken? I hope it’s not too serious. I just want to not be red all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me explain. Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, pus-filled bumps on the face. It’s not dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your self-confidence. Those tiny blood vessels I mentioned – telangiectasias – aren't "broken," exactly, but they've become more visible because the walls of the vessels have become thinner. What you're describing – the flushing triggered by heat, caffeine, and social situations – is very typical of rosacea. The good news is, it's manageable. We can't cure it, but we can control the symptoms. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… a little more sense. Not dangerous, that’s good. Manageable, that’s good too. So… what do I have to do to manage it? Medicine? Do I have to change what I eat? I like my chili. And I… I do enjoy talking to people, even if it makes me red. It’s just… I don’t want to worry them.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's talk about management. There are a few things we can try. First, we can focus on avoiding your triggers as much as possible – things like spicy foods, caffeine, and excessive heat. I know you enjoy your chili, and talking, so we don't need to eliminate them completely, just be mindful. Second, there are topical creams and sometimes oral medications that can help reduce redness and inflammation. We can start with a topical cream, like metronidazole, to see if that helps. And, a gentle skincare routine is important - avoiding harsh soaps and using sunscreen daily. Finally, there are some lifestyle changes that can help - managing stress, and staying hydrated. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… a lot. Okay. Avoid triggers, cream, gentle soap, sunscreen, stress… I can try. The cream… what does it do? Is it… hard to use? And the sunscreen… I don't spend a lot of time in the sun, but I can try that too. Stress is… hard to manage. I worry a lot. But I can try to… not worry so much. Is that cream something I have to get at the pharmacy? Do I need a special paper from you?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it sounds like a lot, but we can take it one step at a time. The cream, metronidazole, helps to reduce the inflammation that causes the redness and bumps. You apply a thin layer to the affected areas – typically your cheeks, nose, and forehead – once or twice a day. It’s not hard to use at all. Yes, you will need a prescription from me to get it at the pharmacy. I’ll write that for you now. And yes, even if you don’t spend a lot of time in the sun, daily sunscreen is important. It protects your skin from further irritation. Here you go. It’s good to start with a small amount and see how your skin reacts. I also want to check your blood pressure again in a few weeks, and we can discuss strategies for managing stress if you'd like. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… reasonable. A small amount of cream. Check blood pressure. Stress… maybe. I worry a lot about my health, you see. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I hope this cream works. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. It’s perfectly normal to worry about your health, and I’m here to help you manage that as well. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns about the cream, or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll work through this together. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for four weeks from today, just to see how you're doing and check your progress. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Four weeks… yes, that should be good. August 30th? I think that’s right. That gives me time to try the cream. Okay. I will write that down. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. I appreciate your time. And your patience. I ask a lot of questions, I know. I just… want to understand.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Enrique. Asking questions is exactly what you should do! It’s important to understand what’s going on and be comfortable with your treatment plan. No need to apologize at all. Okay, so we're scheduled for August 30th. In the meantime, just try to be mindful of your triggers, apply the cream as directed, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Enrique, and I'll see you then.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. .
