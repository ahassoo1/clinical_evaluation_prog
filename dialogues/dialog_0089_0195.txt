DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too, I suppose. Well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” one, or maybe just something encouraging. My daughter, she thinks I need a little… cheering up. Honestly, I’m perfectly fine. But she worries. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A note for your daughter. That's… certainly not a typical reason for a doctor’s visit, but I’m happy to help if I can. Just to be thorough, even though you say you’re feeling perfectly fine, could you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally lately?
PATIENT: Generally? Honestly, Doctor, it's all the same. Life is… life. I get up, I make my husband tea, I work. I don’t sit around feeling sorry for myself like some people do. But my daughter… she's always saying I need to “prioritize self-care” and “check in with my emotions.” It's exhausting, really. I mean, I haven’t been sick. I just… exist. Is that good enough for a doctor?
DOCTOR: It is good enough, Janeth. I appreciate you being honest with me. And it’s good that you’re active and taking care of your husband. Just so I have a complete picture, have you noticed any changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… my hands ache a bit more than they used to. But I work with them all day, assembling those little… gadgets. You know, the electronic ones. It’s not a change, it’s just… work. And I sleep a little less, maybe. But that’s because my neighbor’s dog barks all night. It’s a dreadful little thing. Really, Doctor, I’m fine. I just want a card to appease my daughter, alright? She's making a whole fuss about my “well-being.” It’s very dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay, hand pain and some sleep disturbance. I’m just trying to rule things out, alright?
PATIENT: Rule things out? What is there to rule out? I told you, I'm perfectly healthy! You're making this much more complicated than it needs to be. Honestly, Doctor, it's a card. A simple little “Get Well” card. Do you need me to describe what color I’d like? Perhaps with a nice floral pattern? My daughter likes lavender. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janeth. You’re right, it should be simple. But as a doctor, it's my job to at least ask a few basic questions, even if you feel perfectly fine. Just to be sure. And it's good you mentioned the hand pain. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or stiffness in your hands?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Well, yes, sometimes. Especially in the mornings. But that’s just… old age, I suppose. I'm sixty years old, Doctor. Things ache. It's hardly a medical emergency. Honestly, I feel like I'm being interrogated. And I still haven't gotten a card. Is this going to take all day? My husband will be expecting his tea. He gets very grumpy if his tea is late. A very grumpy man, that one. This is all very stressful, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, morning stiffness. Alright. And just one more quick thing – have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, I eat the same as always. My husband makes a lovely dal bhat. Always enough for seconds. Weight? I haven’t stepped on a scale in… well, years. Honestly, Doctor, I really don't see what all these questions have to do with a simple “Get Well” card. Are you implying I’m ill? Because I'm telling you, I'm not. I'm perfectly capable. This is a waste of my time. And my husband’s tea is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Janeth, you're right to be frustrated. I apologize if I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. I am not implying you are ill. But sometimes, even when people feel “fine,” there can be little things going on that are worth addressing. I noticed you mentioned hand pain and some sleep disturbance, and I want to make sure we aren’t missing anything. It's my professional responsibility to ask. Would you mind if I just quickly take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Heart and lungs? For a card? Honestly, Doctor, this is absurd. It’s a complete waste of everyone’s time. And I still haven’t gotten a card! Fine, do your… examining. But I’m warning you, if you find anything wrong, I’m blaming you. This is all very unsettling. I’m perfectly healthy, and you’re making me anxious. Get it over with, quickly, alright? My husband is going to be furious. A very furious man.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick check. Please relax your arm… that's good. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Okay. Your blood pressure is a bit higher than we'd like. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we should keep an eye on. I also noticed… you mentioned some sleep disturbance and hand pain. Those could be related to several things.
PATIENT: Elevated? See! This is what I was afraid of. You're finding things wrong now! It's all this… poking and prodding. Of course my blood pressure is elevated, I’m stressed! I told you, I'm perfectly fine, and now you're telling me I'm unwell. Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. And still no card! I’m starting to think you’re deliberately trying to make me anxious. A very, very anxious woman. This is a complete disaster. I want to go home. And I want a card. Now.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand your frustration. I am not trying to make you anxious, and I apologize if I have. Elevated blood pressure is very common, especially with stress, and it doesn’t automatically mean you’re unwell. It just means we should talk about ways to manage it. I realize you came in for a card, and I absolutely will write you a card. But as a doctor, I feel it’s my responsibility to at least acknowledge these other things I’ve noticed. Would you be open to discussing some simple lifestyle changes that could help lower your blood pressure and improve your sleep?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Now you want to change my lifestyle? After all this? Honestly, Doctor, you are unbelievable. I live a perfectly good life. I make tea, I work, I don't sit around complaining. My lifestyle is fine. And I still haven't gotten a card! This is a complete and utter waste of my time. Just… write the card. A simple "Get Well Soon" will do. Lavender, if you have it. And then I want to go home. Before my husband sends out a search party. He’s a very determined man, that one. This is all very stressful, and I blame you entirely. Honestly, Doctor, you've made my day much, much worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. Here you go. I also have some pamphlets here on stress management and simple exercises. They're just for information, you don't have to take them if you don't want to. I understand you want to go home, and I absolutely respect that. If you change your mind about discussing anything further, please don't hesitate to call the office. I wish you and your husband all the best.
PATIENT: Hmph. It's… adequate. Barely. Thank you. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to get home before my husband starts to worry. And frankly, I need a cup of tea. A very large cup of tea. Good day.
