DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley, welcome. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Doctor. It’s… it’s my bruising. It's been getting worse, and I'm on blood thinners, so I figured I should get it checked out. It just seems… a lot more than usual, even for being on the stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising… and you're currently taking blood thinners. Right. And you say it’s more bruising than you’d expect?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Like, I bumped my arm on the counter yesterday – nothing hard, really – and got a bruise the size of my hand. Usually it's just a little colour change, you know? And it's happening all over, not just where I bump into things. It’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Hmm, that is concerning. And it's happening even with minor trauma, and spontaneously as well?
PATIENT: Yep. Spontaneously too. I noticed one on my leg this morning, and I definitely didn’t hit it on anything. It’s… I don’t know, maybe I’m just getting old! But it feels different this time, like it's too easy to get them.
DOCTOR: Well, “just getting old” doesn’t usually explain a sudden increase in bruising, especially when you’re on blood thinners. We need to figure out what’s going on. Now, let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I had high blood pressure for a bit, but it’s been controlled with medication for years now. And… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. That’s about it, really. Nothing else major. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. It’s just… this bruising thing is throwing me off.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension controlled with medication, and a cholecystectomy ten years ago. And you said you've otherwise been generally healthy. Good. Now, what medications are you currently taking – including the blood thinner, of course – and what dosages?
PATIENT: Right, okay. I take lisinopril, 20mg, once a day for the blood pressure. And… the blood thinner is warfarin. I take 5mg every evening. I get my blood tested regularly to check the levels, usually every month or so. The doctor adjusts the dosage if it’s too high or too low. I think it was adjusted up slightly a couple of months ago, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril 20mg daily, warfarin 5mg daily with regular monitoring. And it was increased a couple of months ago. Do you know what your most recent INR result was?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. No, not off the top of my head. I usually get a text message with the results, but I delete those after I check them. I can maybe find it on my phone… give me a sec. Nope, I already deleted it. Sorry. I think the nurse told me it was… a little high, which is why she adjusted the warfarin. But I don’t remember the actual number. I’m terrible with numbers.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s okay. We can look it up in our records. One moment. Hmm. Okay, your most recent INR was 3.2, taken July 15th. That is elevated. Ideally, we like to keep it between 2 and 3. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Three point two… okay. No allergies, no. Not to anything, that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. That’s good, right? I mean, not getting rashes is good. Is this high INR what's causing the bruising, do you think?
DOCTOR: It’s a likely cause, yes. An elevated INR means your blood is thinner than it should be, so you’d bruise more easily. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Let’s talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family have a bleeding disorder, or easy bruising?
PATIENT: Easy bruising… hmm. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, always used to get bruises really easily. She just… always had them. But she was old, and she wasn't very careful. I don’t think it was anything… serious. Nobody else that I know of. Everyone else is pretty normal, as far as bruising goes. My dad's side is… I barely knew them.
DOCTOR: Okay. Grandmother with easy bruising. And no other known bleeding disorders. Now, just to get a complete picture, a little about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy. And I don’t smoke, never have. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. I walk a bit, nothing major, but I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Okay. Moderate alcohol use, non-smoker, generally healthy diet and some activity. Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Can you roll up your sleeves for me?
PATIENT: Sure. There. You can see what I mean, right? It's not just a couple of little bumps. It’s all over. And they’re painful, too. A lot more than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yes, I see. There are multiple bruises in various stages of healing. They are tender to the touch. No obvious masses. Capillary refill is normal. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your legs. Similar findings on the legs. Multiple bruises, varying in size and colour. Tenderness present. No swelling or warmth. The bruising is widespread, as you said. And it's tender, which suggests it's more than just superficial.
PATIENT: Right? It’s just… worrying. I don’t want to end up in the hospital. Is that what's going to happen? Is it something serious, Doctor? I mean, other than the high INR? Should I be really concerned? I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley, let’s be straightforward. While an elevated INR is certainly concerning and needs to be addressed, the widespread bruising and tenderness warrant further investigation. It's unlikely to be immediately life-threatening, but we need to rule out other possible causes for this. I want to order some blood tests. A complete blood count to check your platelet levels, a coagulation panel to assess your clotting factors, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I also want to be cautious and order a D-dimer to rule out any blood clot formation. And finally, given the extent of the bruising, I’m going to refer you to a hematologist for a more specialized evaluation. They’re the experts in blood disorders, and they'll be able to determine the exact cause of your bruising and recommend the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests… and a specialist. Okay. I guess so. I just… I didn’t want this. I just want to know what's wrong and fix it. When can I get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m not really a fan of hospitals, you know? Or doctors, if I’m being honest. Just… the quicker, the better. .
