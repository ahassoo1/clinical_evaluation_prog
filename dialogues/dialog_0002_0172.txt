DOCTOR: Hi Candice, welcome to the clinic! I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it seems I’ve been… directed here. A social visit, I believe they called it? Honestly, all this fuss. New to the area, you see. Simply dreadful having to establish everything anew. I have Medicare, if that's of any consequence. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you’re new to the area and have Medicare – good to know. And yes, a "social visit" can mean a wellness check-up, or just a general check-in to get you established with a primary care physician. Either way, we'll make sure everything is alright. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why you were directed here specifically?
PATIENT: Directed is such a… blunt term. A rather pushy neighbor, actually. Insisted I needed a “proper doctor” now that I’ve relocated. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Never been much for doctors, you understand. A waste of perfectly good time, if you ask me. I've always managed. Just… paperwork mostly, I presume? Is that what this involves?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely reasonable to feel that way, especially if you’ve been healthy and self-sufficient. Paperwork is certainly part of it, getting you registered in the system. But it’s also a good opportunity to make sure everything is okay, and to establish a relationship in case you do need care in the future. Even if you feel perfectly fine, let's just go through a quick review of your overall health, alright?
PATIENT: A “quick review”? Honestly. Very well. But don’t expect a detailed recitation of my life story. I haven’t the time, or the inclination. And do try to be… efficient. I have bridge club this afternoon. Is there a form I need to fill out, or are you going to interrogate me directly?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, efficiency is key. No life story needed, I promise! We can do this as a conversation, and I’ll just ask a few questions. Starting with... have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Major… illnesses? Oh dear. That was… a very long time ago. My husband, bless his soul, always handled those details. I… vaguely recall something about my gallbladder, perhaps? And a rather unpleasant bout of the flu in… the seventies? It was all so long ago. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I really couldn’t say with any certainty. Do you require specifics? It seems a pointless exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal potentially, and a bout of the flu in the seventies. That's helpful. Don't worry if you can't remember exact details, we'll make do with what we have. And how about any ongoing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ongoing… conditions? Well, I get a bit of stiffness in my joints, naturally. At my age, it’s to be expected. And my eyesight isn’t what it once was. I have glasses, you see. Though I often misplace them. Beyond that… I’m remarkably resilient, if I do say so myself. I’ve never been one to complain. Is this going to take much longer? I do have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Joint stiffness and some vision changes, that's good to know. And you're right to be proud of your resilience! Okay, just a couple more quick questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, that’s a dreadful question. My mother… she was a very private woman. Never discussed such things. My father… he travelled extensively. I barely knew him. As for relatives… there were cousins, aunts, uncles… a veritable sea of them. None of whom I was particularly close to, or ever inquired about their… ailments. Honestly, I have no idea. It’s all rather… irrelevant, don’t you think? I'm sure they all died of something eventually, as people do. Can we move on? This is exceedingly tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can move on. Let’s talk about any medications you're currently taking. That includes prescriptions, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and supplements. Do you take anything regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. Oh, yes! I take a little something for my… what do you call it… the water retention. Dr. Abernathy prescribed it, years ago. A small white pill. And sometimes, if I'm feeling a bit… unsettled, I take a bicarbonate of soda. For indigestion, you see. And… oh dear. I believe that’s all. Though I occasionally take an aspirin, if my head is aching. But that's hardly "regular," is it? Really, I pride myself on not being overly reliant on… potions. Is that sufficient? I'm quite certain I haven't forgotten anything important. This whole process is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for water retention, bicarbonate of soda as needed for indigestion, and aspirin occasionally for headaches. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’ve always been rather robust, as I mentioned. I eat everything. Enjoy everything, in fact. Though I did once have a rather unpleasant reaction to some shellfish, many years ago. A mild rash, nothing serious. But that was decades ago, and I haven’t touched shellfish since. Beyond that… no. I’m remarkably… uncomplicated. Really, I fail to see the point of all these questions. It's a waste of valuable time. I’m beginning to feel quite faint. Can we conclude this ordeal now? I have a bridge game to attend.
DOCTOR: Alright, we're almost finished. Just a quick physical exam to get a baseline, alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Now? After all this interrogation? Honestly! I’ve never been subjected to such… indignity. I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. What exactly do you intend to do? I have a very sensitive constitution, you know. And I just had my hair done. This is preposterous. .
