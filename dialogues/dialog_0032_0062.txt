DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re with Medicare. Please, have a seat. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pipkorn. It is good to meet you. Yes, I am with Medicare. I am here today regarding the requirements for masks at my workplace. It is causing a bit of a…difficulty, I suppose you could say. I work as a protective service worker, and the masks are…not agreeable with my sensitivities. I'm hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps an alternative.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re seeking medical documentation regarding mask-wearing at your workplace, specifically due to sensitivities?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. It is more than just a dislike, if I may explain. It causes…well, it causes a reaction. A discomfort. I do not wish to cause trouble, and I want to continue to fulfill my duties. I simply need to find a way to do so safely, for both myself and those I assist. Perhaps you could ask me some questions to better understand the situation? I am an open book.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with the specifics of this “reaction” you’re experiencing. Can you describe exactly what happens when you wear a mask?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It begins with a tightness in my chest, a feeling of being…confined. Then, my breathing becomes more rapid, shallow almost. There is a warmth that spreads across my face, a bit like a flush, but it isn't from heat. And…my vision becomes slightly blurred around the edges. It does not last long, thankfully, but it is very disconcerting. It usually happens within five to ten minutes of putting the mask on. It's…unpleasant. I am not certain if that explains it adequately.
DOCTOR: And this happens every time you wear a mask, regardless of the type – surgical mask, N95, cloth mask?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. It does not matter the material, or the fit. I have tried several different kinds, hoping to find one that might be more…tolerable. Surgical masks, the thicker N95 ones, even the cloth masks provided by my workplace – all produce the same reaction. It is consistent, unfortunately. I even attempted to wear a face shield, but the feeling of enclosure triggers a similar response. It is the covering of my face, I believe, that is the issue.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, have you ever been diagnosed with any anxiety disorders, panic disorder, or claustrophobia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. I have never been formally diagnosed with any such condition. I have always considered myself to be…a calm individual. I work with people in stressful situations frequently, and I believe I handle it rather well. I understand the importance of remaining level-headed. This reaction is…new. It began only recently, with the mask requirements. I assure you, I am not prone to panic, nor do I feel enclosed in general. I spend a great deal of time outdoors, in open spaces. It is… perplexing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent changes in your overall health?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I have my regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and my last one was in February. Everything was normal, as always. No new medications, no recent illnesses…I maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle, I believe. I do have some minor aches and pains from the nature of my work, but nothing significant. I eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise. To be frank, Doctor, I am quite healthy for my age. That is why this is so…unexpected. It is unsettling to experience this physical reaction seemingly out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. I'd like to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and nasal passages. It’s standard procedure, just to rule out any obvious physical obstructions or sensitivities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed as you see fit. I will do my best to remain still and answer any questions you may have. I trust your judgement. I do appreciate you taking the time to investigate this matter. It is…a relief to know someone is taking my concerns seriously.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you would please have a seat on the table, we'll begin. First, I’ll listen to your lungs with the stethoscope. Please take slow, deep breaths in and out. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits. Now, if you would please open your mouth, I’d like to take a quick look at your throat. Throat appears mildly inflamed, but nothing significant. And finally, let me just take a quick look at your nasal passages. Nasal passages are slightly congested. No polyps or significant abnormalities.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is…reassuring to hear that everything appears normal. Though I confess, it does make this situation even more puzzling. Everything feels normal, but this reaction is very real. I appreciate your thoroughness. Is there anything else you would like to check, or any further questions you may have? I am prepared to answer to the best of my ability.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, while your physical exam is unremarkable, the symptoms you describe – tightness in the chest, rapid breathing, blurred vision – can sometimes be associated with anxiety, even if you don't consciously feel anxious. The stress of your job, coupled with the new requirement of wearing a mask, could be triggering a physiological response. Have you experienced any increase in stress levels recently?
PATIENT: Doctor, I understand what you are suggesting. And I assure you, I have considered that possibility. However, I truly believe this is…different. While my job can be stressful, I have coping mechanisms. I have faced difficult situations before without experiencing such physical reactions. I do not dismiss the potential for a psychological component entirely. However, I believe this is a physical intolerance, triggered by the mask itself. Perhaps an allergy, or a sensitivity to the material? I have noticed the sensation is…immediate. Within moments of donning the mask, the discomfort begins. It feels…internal, not emotional. I apologize if this is difficult to explain. I simply want to find a solution that allows me to continue fulfilling my duties safely, without compromising my well-being. I do not wish to appear…dismissive, but I am certain this is not simply anxiety.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate you sharing your perspective. While I cannot definitively determine the underlying cause of your reaction, I acknowledge your reported symptoms and your belief that they are triggered by mask-wearing. Based on your description, I will document your sensitivities and provide a note to your workplace outlining the potential for medical exemption, pending their specific requirements. However, I strongly recommend you discuss this further with an allergist to rule out any underlying allergies or sensitivities to the mask materials. I can provide a referral if you wish. In the meantime, please avoid wearing a mask if it causes you distress. We do not want to exacerbate your symptoms. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: That is…acceptable, Doctor. I appreciate your willingness to document my concerns and provide a note for my workplace. A referral to an allergist…that is a good suggestion. Perhaps that would provide some clarity. Yes, if you would be so kind as to provide a referral, I would be most grateful. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. You have been very helpful, and I appreciate your time and consideration. I feel…more hopeful now, knowing that something is being done to address this issue. Do I need to fill out any further paperwork at this time?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could provide some assistance. The referral request is now submitted. The allergist’s office will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I will also print out a summary of our conversation and the note for your workplace. There is no further paperwork required from you at this time. Just be sure to bring the note with you when you speak with your employer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is all. You have addressed all of my concerns, and I am most grateful for your time and attention. Thank you again, Doctor Pipkorn. I wish you a good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. Have a good day. .
