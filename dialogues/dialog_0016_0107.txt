DOCTOR: Hi Philipp, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my heart. It feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but it happens. It scares my wife. That’s why I come.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re listening to your wife and getting it checked out – it's always best to be cautious when it comes to things like heart palpitations. “Flapping” is a good way to describe it. When you say it happens, can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… not when I do big work. I work with the… the machines, you know? At the plant. No, it’s more… when I rest. When I sit and watch TV, or before I sleep. Sometimes when I wake up too. It doesn’t hurt, just… feels fast. Like a little bird in my chest. Maybe not bird… but fast. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it seems to happen more when you’re at rest – relaxing or trying to sleep. And it doesn’t cause any pain or discomfort, just a feeling of your heart racing?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! No pain. Just… worried feeling. My wife, she gets very scared. She says I look… different. Pale, maybe? I don’t feel sick, just… this flapping. How long does it last? Um… sometimes a few seconds. Sometimes longer. Maybe a minute? I don’t have a clock to look at, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. A minute is helpful to know. So, it lasts for seconds to a minute, and happens when you’re resting. And your wife notices a change in your color when it happens?
PATIENT: Yes, she does. She says I look… white. Not normal color. She makes me go sit down. I don't feel dizzy or anything. Just… fast heart and then I feel normal again. It’s not every day. Maybe two or three times a week? Sometimes not for a few days. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it’s intermittent – happening a few times a week, but not consistently. No dizziness, just the racing heart and the change in your complexion as noticed by your wife. Alright, Philipp, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good. Whatever you need to do. Listening is good. I don't understand much about heart things, but you are the doctor. You know what is best. Pulse and… blood thing? Okay. No problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, your lungs sound clear. Your heart rate is currently 78 and regular. Blood pressure is 110/70. I’m listening now… hmm. I do hear a slight irregularity sometimes, not with every beat, but it's there. I also notice your skin is a little pale. Your pulse feels a little weak, but it’s regular otherwise. I’m going to ask a few more questions while we’re here. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no other problems. I work hard, eat okay food. Maybe too much sweet tea. My wife says that. I used to have some trouble with my back from the work, but that is better now. I see a man for that, he cracks my back. No medicine for anything. I don't like taking medicine. Does sweet tea do this? The heart thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other medical conditions, and you’ve had back issues in the past but that’s currently resolved. And you prefer to avoid medication, I understand. Sweet tea can sometimes contribute to palpitations due to the caffeine and sugar content, but it's unlikely to be the sole cause, especially given the irregularity I'm hearing. To get a better understanding of what's going on with your heart, I’d like to order an EKG – an electrocardiogram. It's a quick, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us see if there’s anything concerning happening. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: EKG? What does that do? Is it… safe? I don’t like… wires on me. Does it hurt? My wife will be very worried if I have wires. I just want to know what is wrong, not have many tests. But if you think it is important… then I will do it. For my wife.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s understandable to be hesitant. An EKG is completely safe, it doesn't send any electricity into your body, it just reads the electrical signals your heart naturally produces. It involves placing small, adhesive patches – the wires you mentioned – on your chest, arms, and legs. They don’t hurt at all, it's like putting a band-aid on. It gives us a really good snapshot of your heart rhythm and can help identify the cause of these palpitations. Since you’ve mentioned the irregularity I heard and your wife’s concern, I do think it’s important to rule out anything serious. It’s a quick test, usually takes just a few minutes. Would you be comfortable if we did that today?
PATIENT: Okay… if it is not hurt and not send electricity in… then okay. A few minutes is not so bad. For my wife, yes. And to know what is wrong. But… will it show everything? Will it tell you why my heart is doing this? Is it dangerous? My wife worries about everything. She says her grandfather had heart trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, and it’s good you’re thinking ahead. An EKG is a great starting point, and it can show us a lot – things like arrhythmias , signs of a previous heart attack, or other structural problems. However, it doesn't always tell us the why. Sometimes, we need additional tests, like a Holter monitor—which you wear for 24-48 hours to record your heart rhythm over a longer period—or an echocardiogram to look at the structure of your heart. As for whether it's dangerous, that’s what we’re trying to find out. Palpitations can be harmless, but they can also be a sign of something more serious. Getting this checked out is the best way to know for sure. Let’s get the EKG done first, and then we can discuss the results and decide if we need any further testing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. First the test, then you tell me. That is good. I trust you, Doctor. Just… don’t want to worry my wife too much. Can I sit with her while I wait? And… how long will the test take? Is it cold? I don’t like cold things on my skin.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can definitely sit with your wife while you wait; that's a great idea. And I understand about being uncomfortable with cold things. The patches are room temperature and shouldn't be cold at all. I'll make sure they're warmed up before applying them. The test itself will only take about five to ten minutes. Afterwards, I'll need a few more minutes to review the results with you. So, all in all, probably around fifteen to twenty minutes. Let’s get started when you’re ready. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Just… quick, and not cold. And I can be with my wife? Okay. Let’s do it. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. She worries so much. I hope it is nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Of course. Your wife’s comfort is important. And we'll take it one step at a time. Alright, let's get you comfortable on the examination table. The assistant will explain the process and apply the patches. I'll be right here to oversee everything. And we will talk through the results when we are done. .
