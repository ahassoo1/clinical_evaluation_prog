DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…fine to meet you, I suppose. Well, it’s this…patch on my skin. It’s quite bothersome, really. It just appeared, you know? Not like I did anything to cause it. It’s…discolored. Not a nice color at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discolored patch of skin that just appeared. Can you tell me where on your body this patch is located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s on my left forearm, just…below the elbow. It’s not huge, thankfully. Though, it's noticeable. And it’s…well, it’s a sort of brownish-grey. Not a natural color, that’s for sure. I haven’t a clue what could have caused it. I always wear sunscreen, you know. Always.
DOCTOR: Alright, a brownish-grey patch on your left forearm below the elbow. And you're diligent about sunscreen, which is excellent. Has it changed at all since it first appeared – in size, shape, or color?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. It wasn’t quite that dark when it first showed up. It was more…a pale tan, almost. And it’s…grown, slightly. Not dramatically, mind you. But if you look closely, it’s definitely bigger. It’s also…a little raised, I think. Though, it might just be my imagination. I really don’t like looking at it, so I haven’t been studying it closely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as a pale tan, has darkened to brownish-grey, and has slightly increased in size, and you feel it's a little raised. Has it been itchy, painful, or bleeding at all?
PATIENT: No, no itching. Thankfully. And it doesn’t hurt, either. Not at all. It’s just…there. A rather unsightly blemish, really. And no, it hasn’t bled. I’d certainly notice if it had, wouldn’t I? I’m very observant, you know. It’s part of my job. One has to be, when dealing with…delicate things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no itching, pain, or bleeding. And you're observant, that’s helpful. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I don’t really have a medical history, to be honest. I’ve always been quite healthy. I take my vitamins, I eat reasonably well… though my husband insists on too much sausage, I must say. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. But nothing…serious. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was…routine. And I get my yearly check-ups, of course. Medicare insists on it, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy with a history of childhood illnesses and gallbladder removal ten years ago. You’re up to date on yearly check-ups. Any family history of skin cancer or unusual moles?
PATIENT: Hmm. Skin cancer… that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had something on her nose. They…removed it. A long time ago. I don’t recall the specifics. It wasn’t…pleasant. And my uncle, he had a lot of moles. Always warning everyone about checking theirs. He was a bit of a hypochondriac, to be frank. But I believe he had a few removed as well. Nothing…serious, I don’t think. It was always just…a precaution. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of skin cancer in your grandmother and moles removed from your uncle. And you said you take vitamins – which ones do you take regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I take a multivitamin, naturally. And Vitamin D, because I don’t get enough sun, even though I always wear sunscreen. And…fish oil, for my joints. My husband thinks it helps, though I haven’t really noticed a difference. And sometimes, I take Vitamin C, especially when I feel a cold coming on. I try to be sensible, you know. One has to look after oneself. It's…important.
DOCTOR: Alright, multivitamin, Vitamin D, fish oil, and occasional Vitamin C. Are you currently taking any other medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just the vitamins. I avoid medication whenever possible, frankly. I prefer natural remedies, when I can. Though, I did take some ibuprofen for a headache last week, but that was…a one-off. And sometimes, a little lavender oil to help me sleep. But that’s it. I’m generally very…careful about what I put into my body. It’s…a principle.
DOCTOR: Okay, just vitamins, occasional ibuprofen, and lavender oil. And you’re careful about what you ingest. Now, I'd like to take a closer look at the patch on your forearm if you don't mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead. Though, I warn you, it's not a pretty sight. Really quite…unsettling. But if you must, go ahead. I suppose a professional opinion is…necessary. It's just…I don't like looking at it. It's…distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter. It is slightly raised, with irregular borders. The color is a mottled brownish-grey, as you described. There’s no visible bleeding or ulceration. It doesn’t appear tender to the touch. Based on what you've told me and the initial examination, it's difficult to say definitively what this is without further investigation. It could be a benign growth, but given the change in size and the family history, I would like to perform a biopsy to rule out any possibility of skin cancer. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh, goodness. That sounds…rather drastic, doesn’t it? I mean, it could just be…nothing. A harmless discoloration. Is it absolutely necessary? I don't like the sound of that at all. Cutting into my skin… Is there no other way to determine what it is? Perhaps a…scan? I've heard of those. They don't involve…needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Gabbrielle. It does sound more involved than you'd like, and I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was prudent. A scan wouldn’t be helpful in this case; it primarily detects deeper structures. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the skin to be examined under a microscope, which is the only way to definitively determine what it is. The procedure is relatively quick and usually performed with a local anesthetic, so you shouldn't feel much discomfort. The sample is then sent to a lab for analysis. It’s a precaution, really. To put your mind at ease. We're looking for specific cells that would indicate skin cancer, and this is the most accurate way to do that. We can discuss the risks and benefits further if you’d like. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A local anesthetic… that doesn’t sound too dreadful. But…cells? That sounds…serious. I suppose if it's the only way to be certain… but I really don't want a large scar. I have rather sensitive skin, you know. And I’m very particular about my appearance. Is it a painful procedure? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a garden party next month, and I wouldn’t want it to…interfere with that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Gabbrielle. It’s a very reasonable question, and I want to assure you we will do everything to minimize discomfort and scarring. The biopsy itself is quite quick, usually less than 15 minutes. A small area of skin will be numbed with a local anesthetic – a simple injection – so you shouldn’t feel any pain during the procedure. You might feel a slight pinch, and there will be some pressure. Afterwards, you'll likely have some minor bleeding and a small bandage. We'll provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for the area to minimize scarring – keeping it clean and covered, avoiding sun exposure, and applying a topical ointment. The results usually take about one to two weeks to come back from the lab. We can schedule the procedure for a time that minimizes disruption to your garden party. We can also discuss options for minimizing the appearance of any potential scar, should one develop. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: One to two weeks… that is a long time to be waiting. But I suppose…better to be safe than sorry. And if you can minimize the scarring… alright. Very well. Let’s schedule it, then. But please, be gentle. And make sure it doesn’t interfere with my gardening. I have prize-winning roses, you know. Perhaps next Tuesday? Before my book club meeting. That would be ideal.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Tuesday works perfectly. Let’s schedule you for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. That will give us plenty of time, and it shouldn’t interfere with your book club. We’ll have you fill out some paperwork beforehand, and my nurse will go over the procedure with you in detail. She can also answer any questions you might have. We'll also provide you with detailed aftercare instructions, and a prescription for a topical ointment to help minimize scarring. And rest assured, we will be as gentle as possible. My priority is your comfort and well-being. We understand how important your roses are, and we’ll do everything we can to ensure the procedure doesn't disrupt your gardening. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Gabbrielle?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Though, what exactly will happen if…if it is something serious? I don’t want to think about it, but… I suppose I should be prepared. And will Medicare cover the cost of…everything? I do have a rather limited budget, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Gabbrielle. If the biopsy reveals any concerning cells, we’ll discuss all of your treatment options with you in detail. The specific treatment will depend on the type and stage of any potential cancer, but options can include surgical removal, topical medications, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. We have a wonderful oncology team here, and we'll work with them to develop a personalized treatment plan that’s right for you. As for Medicare coverage, the biopsy itself should be fully covered. Any further treatment, if needed, would also be covered under your Medicare plan, though there may be some co-pays or deductibles depending on your specific coverage. Our billing department will be happy to review your plan and provide you with a detailed cost estimate. I want to assure you that we'll be with you every step of the way. We’ll answer all of your questions, provide you with the best possible care, and ensure you have all the support you need. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… surprisingly helpful, actually. I was dreading this, but you’ve put my mind at ease…somewhat. I suppose I’ll see you on Tuesday, then. I do hope it doesn't rain. My roses don't do well in heavy downpours, you know.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Gabbrielle. I’m glad I could ease some of your concerns. We'll see you on Tuesday. And I hope for good weather for your roses as well! If anything comes up before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. .
