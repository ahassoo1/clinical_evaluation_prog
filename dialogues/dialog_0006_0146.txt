DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thanks, Doc. It’s… well, my muscles feel weak. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to worry me. Not sure where to even start, really. It's just… harder to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, weak muscles… and how long is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Maybe… three, four weeks? It started gradually, I think. I just figured I was tired from work, you know? Auto damage appraisals keep you moving. But it hasn’t gotten better, and if anything, it’s a little worse each week. It's mostly in my arms and legs, I'd say. It doesn’t hurt, just… give out easier. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yeah, that makes sense. Gradual onset, three or four weeks… mostly arms and legs. No pain, just weakness. Okay. And is this weakness… all the time?
PATIENT: No, not all the time. It's worse when I've been on my feet a lot, or if I try to lift something heavier than usual. Like, doing appraisals, I’m constantly bending and reaching, taking pictures… that really tires me out quicker now. And then it takes a while to recover. When I’m resting, it’s not so bad. But it’s definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, exertion makes it worse, rest helps. Any other symptoms you’ve noticed alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. I have been feeling more tired overall, even when I am resting. Just… run down, I guess. And maybe a little more thirsty than usual? No fever, no dizziness, no… anything else really. I haven’t lost weight or anything. Just the weakness and the fatigue.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and increased thirst alongside the weakness. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, amount, how often you go?
PATIENT: That's… a good question, Doc. I don’t usually pay that much attention, to be honest. I think… it might be a little darker than usual, but I haven’t been drinking enough water, so that could be it. I haven't been going more or less often. Just… normal, I guess? Is that important? I never really think about that stuff.
DOCTOR: It can be. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. No broken bones, no serious illnesses, no… nothing like that. And I don’t take any regular medication. Just over-the-counter stuff for headaches sometimes. I'm pretty healthy, usually. This weakness is just… worrying because it’s not usual for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history, no medications. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom… she had some kind of arthritis when she got older, but I don't know the details. Nothing major, as far as I know. Nobody had anything like… muscle problems or anything. I’m the first one in the family to have anything like this. It doesn't really run in the family, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. No family history of muscle weakness. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple on the weekend, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I stay pretty clean, Doc. Like I said, I'm usually a pretty healthy guy. This whole thing is throwing me for a loop.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just going to check your reflexes, strength, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Let's get it over with, if you don’t mind. I just want to know what's going on and get back to work, if possible. I have a lot of claims to handle.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. First, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are… a little diminished, actually. Not drastically, but noticeable. And your strength… is a little weaker than I’d expect, especially in your legs. About a 4 out of 5 in your arms, and maybe a 3 out of 5 in your legs. Do you notice any pain with that?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. It just… feels harder to push back, you know? Like I’m weaker. It doesn't hurt. It’s just… gives out easier. Like you said, that's what I’ve been feeling. It's just good to hear someone else noticing it. I was starting to wonder if I was imagining things. But the legs… yeah, I definitely feel that weakness more in my legs than my arms. It’s like they’re heavier or something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness more pronounced in legs, no pain. Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. Mr. McKinnon, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on. The diminished reflexes and weakness are concerning, and a few things could be causing this. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a nerve problem, or something else entirely. To get a better idea, I’d like to order some blood tests. That will help us rule out some possibilities and guide further investigation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests sound good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. I’m a little worried, if I’m honest. Not being able to do my job… it’s not good. But yeah, blood tests. No problem. How long will it take to get the results? And is it going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, so… that’s a concern.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Vitamin D level. Those will give us a good starting point. It usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back from the lab. As for cost, without insurance it can be a bit pricey. Let me see… the total should be around $200-$300. I can also see if there are any assistance programs available in the area to help cover the costs. Would you like me to look into that for you?
PATIENT: $200-$300… Okay. That’s… not ideal, but I guess I can manage it. If you could look into those assistance programs, that would be great, Doc. Really appreciate it. I'm just trying to figure things out here. And yeah, if you get anything back sooner than 2-3 days, please let me know. I’m a little anxious, to be honest. It’s just… hard not being able to work.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll put in the request for assistance programs right away, and I'll have the nurse contact you as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity, and if you notice any new or worsening symptoms – like significant pain, numbness, or difficulty breathing – please come back immediately. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Alright, Mr. McKinnon. We'll get to the bottom of this.
