DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… it’s just… I’m always tired. Really tired. I don’t… I don’t really know why. It’s been going on for… well, a long time now, I guess. I just want it to stop, you know? Is that enough to start with?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is absolutely enough to start with, Ms. Licano. “Always tired” is a very valid concern, and we will certainly investigate it. It's good you're seeking answers. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More… how more? It's just… all the time. Even after I sleep. And it’s not like… just sleepy. It’s… heavy. Like carrying weights. I used to… I think I used to garden, but now… even thinking about it makes me tired. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. You're describing a fatigue that’s more than just sleepiness; it’s debilitating, and it’s affecting your ability to do things you once enjoyed. And please don’t apologize for explaining – you’re doing just fine. It’s my job to help you articulate what you’re experiencing. You mentioned it doesn’t improve with sleep. Approximately how many hours of sleep do you typically get each night?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I try to get eight, I think. But I wake up a lot. And then I’m just… there. Not really rested. Sometimes I take a little nap in the afternoon, but… it doesn’t help much. Honestly, I can’t even remember the last time I felt truly awake. Is that important? I’m sorry, I just… everything feels muddled.
DOCTOR: That is important, Ms. Licano. Fragmented sleep and not feeling rested even after a full night’s sleep are significant details. The afternoon naps suggest your body is still trying to compensate for something. Now, let’s try to get a broader picture. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. My appetite isn't very good. I don’t really feel like eating, but I try to. And… I’ve been a little more… achy, I guess. My joints, mostly. Knees and hips. It’s probably just old age, though. I’m not a young woman anymore. Oh, and… sometimes I feel a bit dizzy. Not often, but enough to notice. Does any of that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Licano, all of that matters. Loss of appetite, joint aches, and dizziness are all things we need to consider. It’s good you’re sharing these details. It’s not simply “old age” – we need to understand the cause. To help me narrow things down, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. History… that's… hard. My husband, he always kept track of things like that. I… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I think I had pneumonia once? Maybe twice? It was years ago. And… I see a doctor for my blood pressure, sometimes. It goes up and down. Honestly, I mostly just try to avoid going to the doctor if I can. It never seems to help much. Does Medicare cover a lot of tests? I don’t want to get stuck with a huge bill.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Licano. It’s good you remember the gallbladder removal and the pneumonia. And it's helpful to know about your blood pressure. We can certainly discuss what Medicare covers before ordering any tests. Let’s focus on your current medications for a moment. Are you currently taking anything regularly – even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. I think it’s Lisinopril? My husband filled it for me. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for the aches, when they’re really bad. That’s about it, I think. I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. Said it wasn’t helping. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. They make me feel… strange sometimes. Is there a reason you’re asking about pills? Are you thinking something is causing this?
DOCTOR: That’s very good information, Ms. Licano. Lisinopril is helpful to know, and the occasional Tylenol. You’re right to question if something could be contributing to your fatigue, and that's precisely what we’re trying to determine. Now, I’d like to ask about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I mean, I get hay fever in the spring, but that’s just sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. And… I think I got a rash once from poison ivy, when I was a child. But no known medication allergies, to my knowledge. My husband always made sure I didn’t take anything I was allergic to. It’s just… everything feels so long ago now. It’s hard to remember the details.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Licano. No known medication allergies is good. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to smoke, but he quit years ago. He said it was bad for his health. I always told him he was right. He was a good man. But… that was a long time ago. I mostly stay inside these days. I don’t get out much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. And I'm sorry for your loss. Staying mostly inside is good to know. One last question about your social history, Ms. Licano. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not really. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, when my husband was still around. But I don’t really enjoy it anymore. It just… doesn’t taste the same without him. I mostly drink water. Or tea. Is that all the questions? I’m starting to feel a little tired just talking about everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. Those were all the questions for now. Thank you for being so open and sharing all of this with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll start with checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but… I want to feel better. Blood pressure is fine, I guess. Just… be gentle, please? And… don’t take too long. I’m really starting to feel… drained.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. I will be as gentle as possible, and we won't take long. Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your heart sounds are regular, though a bit quiet. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'd like to listen to your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice a little tenderness here, on your right side. It's not significant, but we'll keep it in mind. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and strength.
