DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my… well, my business. Been a pilot for near sixty years, you know. Never had trouble. But lately… well, there’s been blood. In the stool. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettling is a good word to describe it. Blood in the stool is definitely something we need to investigate. Sixty years as a pilot… that’s impressive. Let’s talk about this blood. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: First notice… hmm. Let me think. It was… oh, maybe a week ago? Give or take. It wasn’t a gush, like you see in those… those pictures. More like… streaks. Red streaks. And it’s not every time, you understand. Some days it's fine. Other days… there it is. Honestly, I thought it might be something I ate. Fancy sausages, maybe. Though I don't recall anything that spicy.
DOCTOR: Okay, streaks of red blood, not with every bowel movement, and you've been noticing this for about a week. You thought it might be something dietary. That's good you're thinking through potential causes. Has anything else changed with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changed? Besides the… the alarming colour? Not really. Same as always, more or less. Regular as clockwork, if you must know. Always have been. Though… now that you mention it… it feels a bit… thinner, maybe? Not a full-on watery mess, understand, but… less substantial, shall we say? Like it’s not… holding its shape as well. Though that could be my imagination. Old men do tend to imagine things, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thinner stools along with the blood, and you’re still regular. It’s good you’re paying attention to these details. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any abdominal pain, cramping, or discomfort?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little… a little ache sometimes, but nothing to write home about. Old age, I reckon. Everything aches when you get to be my age. And honestly, flying all those years… you get used to a bit of discomfort. Hard seats, turbulence, the pressure changes… toughens you up. This is just a dull… a dull feeling. Not sharp, not agonizing, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull abdominal discomfort, nothing sharp. I see here you're not currently on any medications, and no known allergies. That's good. Have you had any changes in your diet recently, besides the sausages?
PATIENT: Sausages were a one-off, mind you. No, no real changes to my diet. I eat sensible. Mostly fish, vegetables… a bit of red meat now and then. Keep it light. I used to be a bit of a sweet tooth, but cut that out years ago. Doctor's orders. A different doctor, mind you. A younger fellow. Didn't know a thing about flying. Kept telling me to eat more fiber. As if I didn’t know about fiber! I’ve been eating prunes since before he was born.
DOCTOR: Well, it sounds like you've been taking good care of yourself. Prunes are excellent. Now, have you had any history of colon polyps or colon cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Colon cancer… hmm. My mother’s sister, I think. Aunt Millie. She… well, she wasn’t a healthy woman. Always complaining. Ended up with something… something to do with her insides. A long time ago. Before they had all these fancy tests. And my grandfather, on my father’s side… he died young. Stomach trouble. But that was different. He drank too much. Everyone knew that. So, not really. Not a strong family history, if that’s what you’re asking. Though my cousin Beatrice… she had hemorrhoids. Dreadful thing, apparently.
DOCTOR: Okay, aunt with possible colon cancer, grandfather with stomach issues related to alcohol, and a cousin with hemorrhoids. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. That includes listening to your abdomen, and a rectal exam. It's a standard procedure to help us figure out what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Honestly. At my age? I’ve had more thorough inspections by airport security. Still… I suppose if you insist. It's not pleasant, is it? But I haven't got all day. Just… get it over with quickly, would you? And no unnecessary poking around, mind you. I’ve got a plane to catch—figuratively speaking, of course. My flying days are over.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s a necessary step to help us understand what’s causing the bleeding. Please lie on your side, knees drawn up. Alright. Your abdomen sounds normal. During the rectal exam, I didn’t feel any obvious masses, but there is some blood present on the glove. And the stool feels… a little softer than usual. That gives us a little more information.
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Is it serious? Don't tell me it's one of those… those cancers. I've lived a good life, you know. A long life. But I’d still like to know what’s going on. Don't beat around the bush, doctor. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, it’s good you’re asking direct questions. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s cancer. The bleeding and the softer stool could be caused by a number of things: hemorrhoids, anal fissures, diverticulosis, or, yes, potentially something more serious like a polyp or colon cancer. Given your age and the presence of blood, I recommend we do some further testing to be sure. I'd like to order a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test, to check for blood in the stool. We can do that easily here. And I'd like to refer you to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy. That's the most thorough way to examine your colon and identify any potential problems. It involves a camera, and it requires some preparation, but it’s the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A camera, you say? Stick a camera where? Honestly, the indignity of it all! And preparation? What sort of preparation? I haven't got time for all this… fuss. Still… I suppose if you insist. It's better to know, I suppose, even if I don't particularly want to know. Alright. Do the test. Send me to this… this gastroenterologist. But I want a name. And I want to know what this preparation entails. I won't be caught off guard. I've faced down thunderstorms and mechanical failures. I can handle a bit of… preparation. Just tell me what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the referral to Dr. Evelyn Chen, a very reputable gastroenterologist. Her office is located at… …and this sheet details what’s involved in preparing for the colonoscopy. It involves a special diet for a day or two beforehand and drinking a laxative solution to clear your colon. It’s not pleasant, I won't lie, but it’s essential for a clear examination. The FIT test we can do right here in the office. You’ll just need to provide a small stool sample. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then Dr. Chen’s office will schedule the colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A laxative solution, you say? Wonderful. Just what an 88-year-old man needs. Well, I suppose I haven't got much choice, have I? Dr. Chen, you say? I’ll look her up. So, this FIT test… it's a simple sample, you say? No… further indignities? And how long before I hear back? I’ve got appointments to keep, you know. Can’t be waiting around for weeks.
DOCTOR: Yes, the FIT test is a simple stool sample. We have collection kits right here. You’ll take it home, collect the sample, and then bring it back to the lab. It’s very straightforward. And typically, we get the results back within 5-7 business days, and Dr. Chen's office will contact you to schedule the colonoscopy appointment. Here's the kit and instructions. Do you need me to go over them with you now, or are you comfortable reading them on your own?
PATIENT: I can manage, thank you. I'm not entirely helpless, you know. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. I've got things to do. And if this Dr. Chen tries to poke around unnecessarily, I'll know who to complain to. Alright. I think that’s all. Don't expect me to be thrilled about any of this, mind you. But thank you for… getting it over with.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable as possible. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Chen. Have a good day, Mr. Rowbottom. And please, try not to worry too much. We’re just being thorough. .
