DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is fine. Look, I’m here ‘cause the army… they want me to take a test. Before they let me really sign up. Seems silly, but they insisted on a check-up first. Don’t see what’s so complicated about putting a strong back and good hands to work, but what do they know?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Hartness, the army has some reason for their requirements, even if it seems… unnecessary to you. It’s good they’re being thorough. A physical exam is standard procedure. So, let's start with a basic history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? What does that mean? I’ve had the usual colds, maybe. Broke my collarbone when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Stupid thing to do, really. Healed up fine. Other than that… nothin’. I work hard, eat okay, sleep when I can. Strong as an ox, I am. Don’t go fallin’ apart easy.
DOCTOR: “Strong as an ox” isn't a medical diagnosis, Mr. Hartness. I need specifics. When you broke your collarbone, approximately how old were you?
PATIENT: Around… ten? Maybe eleven. A long time ago. It was a bad fall. Landed right on my shoulder. Doctor back then… set it with a cast. Itched like crazy. I remember that much. Didn’t need much help after that, though. Mostly just had to be careful for a while. Kids bounce back, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Waste of time, bein’ in a hospital. Just get in the way, I figure. I've always just patched myself up. A bit of rest, a bit of work… good as new. My wife… she worries too much, but I'm a practical man. No need for doctors unless somethin’ really bad happens.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand you consider yourself healthy, and that’s good. But this exam isn’t just for your benefit; it’s a requirement for service. And it's important for me to have a complete medical history. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Don't go swallowin’ pills unless I absolutely have to. Makes me feel weak. Vitamins… sometimes my wife gives me somethin’ for the joints. Says I'm gettin’ old. But I don’t pay much attention to it. Orange bottle, I think. She gets it at the store. Don't ask me the name, I wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hah! A little hay fever in the spring, maybe. Gets a bit sniffly around the flowers. But that’s just… normal, isn't it? Not like I swell up or anything. Nothing I need to worry about. Strong constitution, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father… worked hard his whole life, like me. Died of… old age, I suppose. Just wore out, eventually. Mother… she had a bit of trouble with her stomach when she got older. Never really knew what it was. They didn't have doctors like they do now back then. Lots of folks just… faded away. Not much talk about sickness in my family, if you want to know the truth. Just got on with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you a smoker?
PATIENT: Smoker? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Waste of money, and bad for you. I need my lungs strong for work. And… for the army.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A beer now and then. Socially, you know? With friends. Nothing heavy. Don't go gettin’ drunk or anything. Just a couple to relax after a long day. Don’t see what’s so wrong with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your general condition. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Objections? No. Go ahead. Don't see what’s so complicated about it. Just get on with it. I haven’t got all day, you know. Got work to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart rate is regular, but a little fast. I'm hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. Have you had a cough recently?
PATIENT: Cough? Not really. A bit of a tickle in the throat sometimes, especially when it's dusty at the workshop. But nothin’ serious. Happens all the time. Dust gets everywhere, you know? Don't need a doctor for a bit of dust.
DOCTOR: I'm checking your lymph nodes now. They feel slightly enlarged. Have you noticed any swelling in your neck or armpits?
PATIENT: Enlarged? Look, I work with machines all day. My neck's always a bit stiff. Muscles get tense. And I lift heavy things. Swelling? No. Never noticed anything. You're lookin' for things that aren't there, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit sluggish. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your pulse is rapid, as I mentioned earlier. Mr. Hartness, while you describe yourself as being in good health, these initial findings are concerning. I need to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-ray? Look, I came here for a test, not a whole investigation. I told you I'm fine. I need to get back to work. This is… ridiculous. What’s the army gonna think? I tell ‘em I’m strong and healthy, and then you send me for all these tests? It’ll take ages, I bet.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, the army requires a thorough medical evaluation for a reason. These tests aren't optional. And frankly, even if the army didn’t require them, your physical findings warrant further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before you begin service. It’s for your own safety, and for the safety of those around you. I understand your concerns about time, but this is a necessary step. I will arrange for the blood work and chest X-ray to be done as quickly as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Look, I don't want questions. I want this over with. I need to know… will this stop me from joining up? That’s all I care about. Will these tests… disqualify me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I cannot definitively answer that question at this time. The results of the tests will determine whether or not you meet the army’s medical standards. I understand your concern, but it's impossible to say without knowing the results. However, I can assure you that I will be as thorough and efficient as possible. I will review the results as soon as they are available and discuss them with you in detail. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. Here is a referral for the blood work and chest X-ray. The lab and radiology center are located at [address]. Do you have any questions about getting these tests done?
PATIENT: [address]… Right. Fine. I suppose I have no choice. But… how long will it take? And what if… what if they find somethin’ bad?
DOCTOR: The tests should take no more than a couple of days to complete, Mr. Hartness. The radiology center will contact you to schedule the chest X-ray, and the lab will draw your blood sample. As for finding something "bad," it’s too early to speculate. Most likely, these tests will simply confirm that you are healthy enough to serve. But if anything is detected, we will discuss the findings and explore appropriate treatment options. It is important to remember that early detection and treatment are crucial for many medical conditions. Here is some information on stress management techniques. Waiting for test results can be anxiety-provoking. I also recommend getting adequate rest and maintaining a healthy diet. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Stress… Look, I've got bigger things to worry about than stress. Fine. I’ll get the tests done. But I’m tellin’ you, I feel perfectly fine. Don't go makin’ somethin’ out of nothin’. Alright. I think that’s enough. I’ve got to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. I will be in touch as soon as the test results are available. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Thank you for coming in today. And Mr. Hartness, please try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Right. Yeah. Whatever. .
