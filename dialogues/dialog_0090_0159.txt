DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s kinda embarrassing, to be honest. It’s just getting up from chairs. Like, I’ll be sitting fine, and then…it just takes effort. Not painful effort, just…stuck. It's been happening for a couple weeks now, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” you say. Hmm. And you've noticed this specifically when getting up from chairs?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Like, if I'm already standing, I'm fine. Walking's good, everything feels normal. It's the transition from sitting to standing that's the problem. Doesn't matter what kind of chair, really. Kitchen chair, my truck seat, even a bench at the diner. It’s all the same.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long would you say this “stuck” feeling lasts when you do get up?
PATIENT: Not long, thankfully. Usually just a second or two. But it’s enough to kinda throw me off balance sometimes. I work out on the rigs, you know? Gotta be steady on my feet. It's starting to worry me a bit.
DOCTOR: "Rigs," as in oil rigs?
PATIENT: Yeah, oil and gas. Been doing it since I was eighteen. It’s good work, pays the bills. But it's not exactly a place where you wanna be unsteady on your feet, you know? Lots of…well, lots of things can go wrong. I mostly do maintenance, climbing around, checking pipes and stuff. That’s why this is worrying me.
DOCTOR: I see. So you’re concerned this could impact your work. And you haven’t experienced any falls or near-falls, just this difficulty initiating the movement?
PATIENT: No falls, thankfully. Just a couple close calls. Like, I’ll start to lean forward and kinda catch myself. Nothing major. It's just…it wasn't like this before. I used to jump up outta chairs no problem. My wife…she'd always tease me about it, said I was too energetic. It's been about a year since she passed, though. Maybe it's just…age catching up.
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn’t necessarily chalk it up to age at 26, Mr. Fratoni. Loss can certainly manifest physically, but we should still rule out other causes. Have you noticed any stiffness or pain in your joints – knees, hips, back – at any other time, not just when getting up?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really pain, no. But I do get kinda…creaky, I guess, sometimes. Mostly in my knees, first thing in the morning. It goes away pretty quick after I start moving around, though. Like I said, the rig keeps me pretty active. But yeah, the knees…they aren't what they used to be, I suppose. Not sure if that's related, though. I’ve always been hard on ‘em.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any injuries to your knees, hips, or back in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I twisted my knee pretty bad when I was about twenty, playing football in high school. Had to wear a brace for a while. Physical therapy helped, though. Seemed to heal up fine. Nothing since then, not that I can recall. A few bumps and bruises workin' on the rigs, but nothing serious enough to see a doctor about. Just kinda…lived with it.
DOCTOR: “Lived with it.” Yes, well, we need to determine if “living with it” is still appropriate. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’d like to check your range of motion, strength, and reflexes in your lower extremities. And I’ll listen to your knees and hips as well. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I don’t wanna end up hurtin’ myself on the rig. Just warn me if you need me to do anything weird.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please have a seat on the table, facing upwards. Now, can you point your toes, and then pull them back towards your shin?
PATIENT: Okay, toes pointed…like this? And now pulled back… yeah, that’s a little stiff, actually. Feels tighter on this side. Right leg is the one I twisted back in high school, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about bending your knees?
PATIENT: Okay... that's... tighter on the right, too. Not painful, just... doesn't go as far. Feels kinda…grindy, I guess, when I get to the end of it. It's been like this for a while, honestly. Just been pushin' through it.
DOCTOR: Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: A little. Not sharp, just…pressure. Like a dull ache. It’s not somethin’ I usually notice unless someone’s pressin’ on it. It feels… a little more stable than it used to, though. The physical therapy helped with that, I think. But it still feels kinda…off.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Okay… here we go… That was… harder than it should’ve been. My balance feels kinda off. It’s like my legs are a little… weaker than usual.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do notice some mild instability. Your gait appears slightly altered as well. I’m going to have you walk a few steps, please. And then I’d like to check your reflexes. Just walk normally, as you usually would.
PATIENT: Okay… one… two… three… It feels kinda… awkward. I’m thinkin’ about each step, which isn’t usually how I walk. I normally just… go. It's like I'm afraid I'm gonna stumble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are a bit diminished on the right side, and your gait does appear slightly antalgic, meaning you're altering your walk to avoid pain. Based on this initial examination, it seems we're dealing with some degree of chronic knee instability, likely stemming from that old injury, and potentially some underlying muscle weakness. However, we need imaging to get a clearer picture of the joint itself. I’m going to order an X-ray of both knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. X-ray’s fine. Whatever it takes to figure out what's goin' on. I just wanna make sure it's not somethin' serious. I got a job to do, you know? Don’t wanna be sidelined. So, is this somethin' I should be worryin' about? Like, will I need surgery?
DOCTOR: Well, let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Surgery is rarely the first line of treatment. The X-ray will help us determine the extent of any structural damage, such as arthritis or ligament tears. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. We’ll also need to rule out any other potential causes, such as a meniscus tear. I'm going to order a basic blood panel just to get a baseline. And I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. One week’s fine. And no strenuous activity… alright, I can do that. It'll be tough, but I can manage. So, what about pain relief? Is there anything I can take for the meantime? Just to get through the next few days? I don’t want to be hobblin’ around like an old man.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. For the time being, you can take over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen, following the dosage instructions on the label. These are both NSAIDs, which can help reduce inflammation and pain. However, please be aware of potential side effects, such as stomach upset, and avoid taking them if you have any underlying medical conditions, such as kidney problems. If the pain is severe, you can consider a topical analgesic cream, such as diclofenac. But I would strongly advise against self-treating with stronger painkillers without consulting me first. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's clear. Ibuprofen or naproxen, and maybe some cream if it gets bad. No strong stuff without talkin' to you first. Alright, that sounds like a plan. So, X-rays and blood work, follow-up next week, and take it easy. Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything else I should be lookin' out for?
DOCTOR: Just monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any sudden or severe pain, instability, swelling, or loss of range of motion, please contact me immediately. Also, if you develop a fever or any other new symptoms, let me know. I’ll have the receptionist schedule you for the X-rays and blood work before you leave. I'm also going to give you a printed handout with information on knee instability and exercises you can do to strengthen your muscles once the pain subsides. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen. I'll see you next week, then. And I'll try not to fall in the meantime.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please do. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling. Have a good day, Mr. Fratoni.
