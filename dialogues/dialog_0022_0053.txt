DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my… my waterworks, really. It's getting harder to… to go, you know? Like it takes effort, and it’s not a strong stream. It's been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty starting urination and a weaker stream – that can certainly be bothersome. About a month now, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer, actually. It didn't bother me much at first, just a little bit slow. But it's getting worse, and now I have to really push sometimes, and it’s not… pleasant.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you finish urinating, do you feel like you completely empty your bladder, or do you feel like there's still some left?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Hmm. I think I do, mostly. But sometimes… sometimes I feel like I could go a little more, if I try really hard. It's hard to explain. It's not a full bladder feeling, just… like a little bit is still there.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not exactly. It's not burning or anything like that. Just… the effort, you know? And a little bit of discomfort afterwards, like a dull ache low down. It doesn’t last long, though. It goes away pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. It looks… normal, I suppose. The usual pale yellow. I haven’t been drinking enough water lately, I’ll admit. But the color itself seems fine. Though, now that you mention it, maybe it’s a little darker than usual, but I figured that was just from not drinking enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever, no chills. And my back is fine. I had a bit of a twinge last week, but that’s just my old age, I think. I bent over to pick up something and pulled a muscle. It didn't feel related to this waterworks problem, though. This is all quite a bother, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is, but we'll try to figure it out. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about ten years ago, maybe a little less. I take a pill for it, every morning. The doctor keeps an eye on it. As for diabetes or kidney problems… no, not that I know of. They do blood tests regularly, and nothing’s ever been said. And I had a gallbladder removed years ago, but that was a long time ago and hasn’t bothered me since. I have Medicare, so they usually catch things, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. And what about any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the gallbladder, and that was… oh, goodness, maybe twenty years ago now? It was a simple procedure, and I recovered quickly. I don't have a very good memory for dates, you see. But that was the only surgery I've ever had. I try to remember these things, but it's hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like prostate problems, kidney disease, or bladder cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a difficult one. My family… well, my father had heart trouble, but that was mostly from smoking. And my mother… she had arthritis, badly. As for things like prostate problems, I don’t think so. There weren’t many conversations about… those things when I was growing up. My brother, he had some kind of skin cancer, but that was years ago, and he’s fine now. Nothing about kidneys or bladder that I remember, no. We weren’t a very chatty family about health, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, and do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine, no problems at all. My doctor has given me lots of different pills over the years for my blood pressure and for aches and pains, and never anything. I’m very lucky in that regard, I think. No allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. Just over-the-counter, you know? Nothing prescription. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to be safe. That’s it. Really. Blood pressure pill, multivitamin, and ibuprofen when I need it. That’s all the pills I take.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your pulse, and a quick neurological check, and then I would also like to do a gentle abdominal exam. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I've always been a bit nervous about doctor visits, but you seem very nice. Just… be gentle, alright? I’m not afraid, just… a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. Alright, just relax and take deep breaths. Your pulse is regular and a little bit elevated, likely due to being in a doctor's office. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen in different areas. Please let me know if anything feels painful. I’m starting on the left side. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That’s… okay. Just a little pressure, that’s all. Not painful, just… aware of it, you know? It feels a bit tender around here. That side feels a little… fuller than the other side, maybe? But it’s not sharp pain, definitely not. It’s just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that. And how about here?
PATIENT: That’s… hmm. This side feels… tighter. Not exactly pain, but a bit of a… resistance? Like something is firm underneath. And yes, lower down… a little bit uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, just when you press. But it goes away as soon as you lift your hand. It’s not awful, Doctor, but I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Everything seems normal there. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some urinary retention, and there is a possibility of a bladder issue. I would like to order a urine test to check for infection and blood, and a kidney function test to rule out any kidney problems. I would also like to order an ultrasound of your bladder to get a better look at it and see if there's anything obstructing the flow of urine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. An ultrasound sounds… thorough. And yes, let’s check for everything, just to be safe. Infection, kidneys… everything. I want to know what's going on. It’s just been a worry, you see? And I’d like to get it sorted out. So, yes, let's do the tests. When can I have them done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write up the orders for the lab and imaging. The lab tests can be done today, at the lab just across the hall. They're open until 5 PM. The ultrasound will need to be scheduled, and the scheduler can fit you in tomorrow morning. I’ll have them call you to confirm a time. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to help flush things out. Also, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol as they can irritate the bladder. In the meantime, if you experience a sudden inability to urinate, or if you develop a fever, chills, or pain in your back or side, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very clear, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so well. Increase fluids, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and go to the ER if things get worse. I’ve got it. And what if the ultrasound shows something… not good? What kind of things could it show? I don’t want to worry needlessly, but I’d like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Ms. Yadao. The ultrasound can help us identify several things. It can show if there are any blockages in your bladder, such as stones or tumors. It can also show if your bladder is emptying completely. It can reveal the size and shape of your bladder and whether there's any thickening of the bladder wall. If anything is found, we'll discuss the results and the best course of action. This might involve further testing or a referral to a urologist, a specialist who deals with problems of the urinary system. In most cases, it's something manageable, but it's important to have a clear understanding of what's going on so we can address it effectively. I'll be here to guide you through every step of the process, and we'll work together to find the best solution for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I feel much better knowing we’re getting it checked out. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I will increase my fluids and try to relax. And I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. I appreciate your help. I think I’ll go home and have a big glass of water now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the future. Take care and drink that water! It was a pleasure meeting you.
