DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Um… chronic fatigue, the paper says? Yes. That’s right. I just… I’m always tired. Really tired. It’s been… a while. I don’t really keep track of time anymore, to be honest. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: "Chronic fatigue," yes. It’s a rather… broad complaint, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Broad? Yes, I suppose so. It just… everything feels heavy. Like I’m wading through mud, all the time. Even when I’ve slept. Honestly, I don’t even remember the last time I felt not tired. I mostly just… get by. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Right. “Heavy.” Well, we need to get a little more specific than “heavy,” Ms. Licano. When did you first start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… Honestly? It’s all a bit of a blur. After… after my husband passed, I think. Maybe a few years after? Everything kind of… blended together. It wasn’t sudden, it just… crept up on me. I really can’t say for sure. Is it important to know exactly when? I have a terrible memory these days.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Licano. It helps us rule things out. A few years…that's still quite a range. Was there anything happening around that time besides your husband’s passing that might have contributed?
PATIENT: Um… contributed? Let me think. No, not really. Just… adjusting, I guess. Trying to keep the house going. He… he did most of the yard work. And the… the finances. I just… wasn’t really paying attention to much of anything then. Everything felt… distant. I don’t even remember seeing the doctor much before this. Honestly, I just tried to ignore it. It felt easier that way.
DOCTOR: Ignoring it rarely makes things go away, Ms. Licano. Alright. Let’s move on. Besides the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, sometimes I feel a bit… achy. Like my muscles are sore, all over. And… I get headaches. Not terrible ones, just… dull ones. Mostly in the afternoons. And… oh! I’ve been forgetting things, even more than usual. Which is saying something, believe me. I lose my keys constantly. And names… names are the worst. Do you need me to be specific? I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Achy muscles, headaches, memory issues…yes, that’s helpful. And how is your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it’s not very good. I don’t really feel hungry, most of the time. I eat something, because I know I should, but it doesn’t really… satisfy me. Mostly just toast and tea. I used to enjoy cooking… but now, it feels like too much effort. Everything does, really.
DOCTOR: And what about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… Well, I sleep enough hours, I think. Eight, maybe nine. But it’s not… restful sleep. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. And I toss and turn a lot. I don’t really dream anymore, which is… strange. I used to have very vivid dreams. Now it’s just… darkness. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s just… a bad sleep. A long, bad sleep.
DOCTOR: Right. We’re building a picture here, Ms. Licano. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Weight… I think I’ve lost a little bit. Not much, but… my clothes feel looser. I don’t really weigh myself anymore. It just… felt depressing. I used to be… sturdier. Now… well, I just feel frail. Does that answer your question? I'm not very good at numbers, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Chronic illnesses… Um… not that I recall. The doctor always said I was very healthy, even after… Just the usual aches and pains, you know? Nothing serious. High blood pressure, maybe, a few years back, but I was on medication for it. I don’t even remember what it was called. I think I stopped taking it a long time ago. It didn't seem to be doing much good. Is that helpful? I’m sorry, my memory is just… terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh! Yes. My appendix, when I was young. And… a hysterectomy, a long time ago. That’s it, I think. I don’t really remember much about either one, to be honest. Just… blurry faces and lots of pain. Is that enough information? I really don’t like thinking about hospitals. It brings back bad memories.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, Ms. Licano. Just routine, to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can I listen to your heart and lungs?
