DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you too. Well, my left leg has gotten rather swollen, and I... I have a bit of a heart problem, they told me it was atrial... something? It's been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in your left leg, and you mentioned a heart condition – atrial fibrillation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Atrial... fibrillation. I don’t really understand it much, to be honest. The other doctors have explained it, but it doesn’t quite stick. It’s just… my heart beats a bit funny sometimes, and then my leg swells. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if the details aren't clear, Nixon. It can be a complicated condition to understand. And yes, the swelling in your leg along with a history of atrial fibrillation can be something we need to investigate further. To get a clearer picture, let’s start with the swelling. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three days ago? It wasn't very noticeable at first, just a little bit bigger than usual. But it's gotten worse each day. I noticed it especially after I was on my feet all day yesterday, helping set up the computers in the new lab. I am a teacher, you see. Postsecondary. Computer Science.
DOCTOR: Okay, so three days ago, starting subtly and worsening with activity – specifically yesterday while setting up computers for work. And you’re a computer science teacher, postsecondary – that's good to know. That level of activity can give us clues. Now, is the swelling just in your left leg, or is it also in your foot or thigh?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my lower leg, Doctor. Below the knee, really. My foot is a little bit puffy, but nothing like my leg. And my thigh… no, my thigh feels fine. It’s just that one leg being… well, bigger than it should be. It feels a bit tight too, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Nixon. Primarily in the lower leg, some mild puffiness in the foot, tightness – and no swelling in the right leg at all, correct?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Just the left leg. The right leg is perfectly normal. I’ve been trying to keep it elevated, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference, to be honest. I did wrap it with a bandage, but that felt… a bit too tight, so I took it off. I didn't want to cause more trouble.
DOCTOR: Good instinct to remove the bandage if it felt too tight. We don’t want to cut off circulation. Now, let’s talk a little about your heart condition. Do you remember when you were first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… maybe six months ago? The doctor did some tests, and that's what he told me. He put me on some medicine, small white pills, but I… I stopped taking them after a few weeks. They made me feel a bit dizzy, and I didn’t really notice any difference anyway. It wasn’t very pleasant, so I just… stopped. I probably shouldn't have, should I?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Nixon. It’s not uncommon for people to experience side effects with medication, and it’s understandable you stopped taking something that wasn't agreeing with you. It's good you're being honest about that. Stopping medications without discussing it with a doctor isn't ideal, but we can address that. Do you recall the name of that medication, or perhaps what the doctor said it was for specifically?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no, I don’t remember the name at all. It was a small white pill, that's all I can recall. The doctor said it was to… slow my heart down? Or something like that. He said it would help with the… the irregular beating. I really wasn’t paying close attention, to be honest. I was more concerned about feeling dizzy. I am not good with remembering medicine names.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Nixon. It’s more important that you remember how the medication made you feel. So, a small white pill to regulate your heart rate, which caused dizziness. Now, besides the dizziness, have you noticed any other symptoms related to your heart condition – shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I feel a bit… breathless when I walk up the stairs, but I just thought I was out of shape. I do a lot of walking to school, you see. And I get tired easily, but I put that down to working long hours. Palpitations… I don’t know what that means. Is that something bad? Sometimes my heart feels like it’s fluttering, but I thought everyone feels that sometimes. Chest pain… no, no chest pain. Just a bit tired, and breathless sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional shortness of breath with exertion – walking up stairs – and fatigue, but no chest pain. You mentioned your heart sometimes feels like it’s “fluttering” – that could be palpitations, and it’s good you brought that up. Let’s move on to some general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I eat everything, and I can take any medicine without any trouble. I am quite lucky in that regard, I think. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, that doesn’t seem to help with this heart business.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nixon. No known allergies. And do you currently take any other medications besides that small white pill you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest. I used to take vitamins, but I stopped those too. They didn’t seem to do much good. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if I really need it. But that’s very rare. I try to avoid even those.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, just occasional pain relievers as needed. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... I had chickenpox when I was a little girl, but that's it, I believe. And I broke my arm once, when I was about ten, but that healed perfectly. Otherwise, I am generally very healthy. I haven’t been to the doctor much in my life, to be honest. I pride myself on being a strong, healthy person. Though, this leg… this leg is quite concerning. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Nixon. No other major medical conditions or surgeries. We'll get to the bottom of what's causing the swelling in your leg. And have any close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, blood clots, or problems with their legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had a bit of trouble with her blood pressure when she got older, but that's all I can recall. And my grandfather… he had some problems with his joints, arthritis I think it was. But nothing with his heart, or his legs. My father was very healthy, a strong man. He worked on a farm all his life. So, no, not that I am aware of. Just a bit of arthritis and blood pressure problems. Is that important, Doctor? I worry sometimes about being a bother.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nixon. No significant family history of heart or leg problems. It’s not a bother at all to ask these questions – it helps me get a complete picture. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. I find it a rather unpleasant habit, to be honest. My mother always warned me about the dangers of it. And I’ve always been rather active, so I haven’t any need for it. I walk a lot, as I mentioned before. And I enjoy gardening in my spare time. A healthy lifestyle is very important to me. Though, this leg is making it rather difficult to garden.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Nixon. No smoking. And you mentioned you enjoy gardening and walking, so you maintain an active lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Only very occasionally, Doctor. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I don't drink very often, and I certainly don't drink to excess. I prefer a cup of tea, to be honest. A nice strong cup of Scottish Breakfast tea. I find it much more refreshing. I don’t have a sweet tooth, either, so I don’t drink much soda. Mostly just tea, and water. I pride myself on a simple, healthy lifestyle. It is quite worrying that my leg is swelling, given that I take such good care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nixon. Occasional small glass of wine. And lastly, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to contrast dye or iodine?
PATIENT: Oh dear, I have no idea. What is contrast dye? I've never had any special tests done, not that I can recall. I've never had to think about such things before. I've always been rather healthy, so I haven't spent much time in hospitals or doctors' offices. I haven't any idea if I'm allergic to anything like that. I'm a bit afraid of needles, to be honest. Will I be needing a needle? I’m trying to be brave, but I do worry about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nixon. It’s good to know you haven’t had any previous reactions. Contrast dye is sometimes used in imaging tests like CT scans, but we’re not planning on doing any of those right now. I understand your concern about needles, and we’ll only do what’s necessary. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better look at your leg and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I trust your judgement. Please, do whatever you need to do. I just want to know what is causing my leg to swell, and how to make it better. I am a bit worried, to be honest, but I am trying to be brave. I do hope it's nothing too serious. Please be gentle, if you would. I haven't had a physical exam in many years.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nixon. We’ll take things slowly and gently. I’ll start by checking your heart and lungs, and then we’ll take a closer look at your leg. Your heart rate is a bit fast and irregular, which we already knew from your history of atrial fibrillation. Breathing sounds are clear. Now, let's examine your leg. There’s definite swelling and warmth in your lower leg, and your pulses are present, but a little weaker on that side. The skin looks normal, no signs of injury. It does feel a bit tender to the touch. Based on this initial examination, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing the swelling, but it could be related to your atrial fibrillation, or it could be something else. We need to investigate further. I'm going to order a D-dimer blood test and an ultrasound of your leg to rule out a blood clot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A D-dimer blood test… and an ultrasound? Oh dear. What is a D-dimer? Is that something bad? And an ultrasound… will that involve gel? I don't mind the gel, but I do worry about being poked and prodded. I understand you need to do what is necessary, but I do get a bit anxious about these things. A blood clot… is that serious, Doctor? I hope it’s not a blood clot. I’m just a bit worried now, to be honest. But I trust your judgement. Please explain everything as clearly as you can.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Nixon. Let’s take things one step at a time. A D-dimer is a blood test that helps us rule out a blood clot. It measures a substance that’s released when a clot breaks down. A negative result means it’s unlikely you have a clot, but we still need to confirm with an ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the veins in your leg. It’s completely painless, and it does involve gel – that's to help the sound waves travel. It won't involve any poking or prodding, just gentle pressure from the probe. A blood clot, also known as a deep vein thrombosis or DVT, can be serious if left untreated, as it can travel to your lungs. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. We're just doing these tests to be thorough and rule out the worst-case scenario. Based on your history and the initial examination, it could also be swelling related to your atrial fibrillation or other less serious causes. But we need to have a better understanding before we can say for sure. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes a little more sense. A D-dimer to rule out a blood clot, and an ultrasound to confirm. No poking or prodding, just gel. And it’s not necessarily a blood clot, it could be related to my heart. It’s just… all a bit overwhelming. I do worry easily, to be honest. So, what happens next? Do I need to fast for the blood test? And when will I get the results? And how long will the ultrasound take? I do have a class to teach this afternoon, so I need to know if I’ll be able to make it. I wouldn’t want to leave my students unattended. Please be as specific as possible, Doctor. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nixon. I’ll walk you through everything. For the D-dimer blood test, you do not need to fast. You can eat and drink as normal before the test. The lab is just down the hall, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. The ultrasound will be done in the imaging department, which is on the second floor. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. You’ll lie on a table, and the technician will apply gel to your leg and move a probe over the area. The results for the D-dimer usually come back within a few hours, and the radiologist will interpret the ultrasound images within 24-48 hours. Once I have both sets of results, I'll contact you to discuss them and formulate a plan. Based on the timing, it’s likely you’ll have the results of the D-dimer today, but the ultrasound interpretation might take until tomorrow. I understand you have a class to teach this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want you to be late. I can call the lab to expedite the results if possible, and I’ll do my best to have a preliminary plan for you before your class. In the meantime, try to elevate your leg as much as possible and avoid prolonged standing. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening pain in your leg, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds much better. No fasting, 30-45 minutes for the ultrasound, and you’ll try to expedite the results. I will elevate my leg and avoid standing. And I will go to the emergency room if I experience any chest pain or worsening pain. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. I do worry easily, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect. What do I do about the class if I don’t have the results by this afternoon? Should I ask a colleague to cover for me, or should I just explain the situation to my students? I don't want to worry them unnecessarily. They’re very good students, but I do have a responsibility to them. I just don't want to leave them unattended. Perhaps I should bring a book in case I have to wait for the results? I do tend to overthink these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It's my job to make sure you feel informed and comfortable. As for your class, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask a colleague to cover for you if possible, just to be on the safe side. If that isn't feasible, explaining the situation to your students is a good option – you can let them know you’re getting a medical checkup and might be a little delayed. There’s no need to worry them unnecessarily, but it’s good to have a plan in place. Bringing a book is a great idea – it’s always good to be prepared! I'll contact the lab and the radiology department to expedite the results, and I'll call you as soon as I have more information. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms before then. I think that covers everything for now. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Nixon.
