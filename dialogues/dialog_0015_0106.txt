DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Trestrail. It says here you’re 89 years young. That's wonderful. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Though I must say, 89 isn't exactly "young" anymore. It’s a miracle I'm even here, honestly. But never mind that. It's my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore that just won't heal. It's quite painful, really. And it smells. Not a pleasant thing at all.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Age is a factor, Ms. Cannington. Now, this sore on your foot…how long has it been “troublesome,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t you start with that “age is a factor” nonsense. I've lived a long life, and I’ve taken care of myself. It's not like I’ve been sitting around eating sweets all day. As for how long...let me think. It started small, maybe three months ago? After I stepped on something sharp in the garden, I believe. Though it hasn’t gotten any better since then, that's for certain. It's definitely gotten worse.
DOCTOR: Three months, starting after an injury in the garden. And you say it’s worsened despite… what care have you been providing to it, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Care? Well, I wash it, of course. With soap and water. Though it's difficult to reach, you know, with my back. My grandson, Kaimana, he tried to help a few times, but he's always in a rush. And I put a bandage on it, when I can find one that isn’t too sticky. It’s mostly just…staying off of it, which isn’t easy when you have things to do. Honestly, I don't know what else to do. It’s a foot, not a complicated machine.
DOCTOR: “Not a complicated machine,” is right. However, even simple things can become problematic. Alright. Let's have a look at it. Could you please sit on the examination table and elevate your foot for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I hope you have a clean sheet on that table. I’ve seen things in doctor’s offices, you wouldn’t believe. There. Be gentle now, it’s quite sensitive. And try not to poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. Just going to take a look. Hmm. Yes, there is definite inflammation and some…discharge. The skin around here is quite fragile. Is there any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness? Not exactly. It feels…warm. And it throbs. Especially at night. Keeps me awake, it does. And I can feel it, of course, when I walk. It's a sharp pain, right along the side. But that's probably just because it's there, isn’t it? It's a sore, after all. You don't need a medical degree to know that. Are you almost done poking around? It’s rather unpleasant, you know.
DOCTOR: It's good you can feel it. We want to be sure it isn't affecting your circulation. The warmth does suggest a possible infection. Ms. Cannington, I'm going to need to order some lab work to determine the extent of this infection. We’ll need a culture of the wound to identify the bacteria, and a blood test to see if it has spread. It's quite possible this is more serious than simply a sore.
PATIENT: Blood tests? Culture of the wound? Honestly, Doctor, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's a little cut, not the plague! I haven’t been feeling that sick. I had a little bit of a fever last week, but that could have been anything. I don’t see why I need to be poked and prodded and have my blood taken over a little sore. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, with all due respect, you are 89 years old. Your immune system isn't what it used to be. An untreated infection, even a “little cut,” can become very dangerous, leading to hospitalization, and even…well, we don’t want to go there. It is necessary to rule out a serious infection. I understand your reluctance, but I am acting in your best interest. We need those lab results to determine the best course of treatment. We’re not talking about a simple bandage here. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But I don't like it one bit. You doctors and your fancy tests. It's always something. But…alright. Do your tests. Just…get it over with quickly. And no poking around more than you have to. I have errands to run, you know. Just tell me where to go and what they'll be doing. And make it snappy.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They’ll need a blood sample – a standard arm draw – and a swab of the wound. It shouldn't take long. I’ve already put in the order, and they’re expecting you. Once they’ve collected the samples, you can go about your errands. The results will be sent to me, and I'll contact you as soon as I have them, likely within 48 hours. In the meantime, keep the bandage clean and dry, and try to avoid putting weight on that foot as much as possible. And if you experience any fever, increased pain, redness spreading beyond the wound, or any chills, you are to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Emergency room. Keep it clean. Don't put weight on it. You've said it all. Honestly, I’ve heard all this before. I suppose I should go get this over with then. Don't expect me to be happy about it.
