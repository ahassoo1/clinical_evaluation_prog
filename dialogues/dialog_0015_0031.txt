DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, actually. It started a few days ago, and it's not getting any better. I do have a bit of a heart problem, you see. The doctors told me it’s called… atrial… something? It makes my heart beat a bit funny sometimes.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, I see. Thank you for mentioning that. And you said the swelling started a few days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A few days ago. I’m not entirely sure how many days, exactly… maybe three? It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. It’s mostly in my calf, I think. And it feels… tight. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, no. I've been trying to take it easy, mostly just sitting and reading. I haven't been doing any heavy lifting or anything like that. I did walk to the shop yesterday, but it wasn’t a long walk. It didn’t feel any different afterwards, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Sitting for prolonged periods isn’t always the best, you know. It can contribute to these sorts of issues. Now, have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: Oh, I didn’t know that, no. I just thought it was best to rest it. Let me see… redness? No, it doesn't look red, not that I can tell. And…warmth? It feels… normal temperature, I suppose. Like my other leg. I'm not sure how warm it should be. Is it supposed to feel hot?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be hot, no. Just…slightly warmer than usual might be a sign. Alright. And have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness along with this swelling?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No chest pain at all. My breathing's been fine, a little… quicker maybe, but that’s just because it’s a warm day, I think. And no dizziness either. Just the swollen leg, really. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a number of things. Given your atrial fibrillation, we need to rule out a blood clot. That's the most concerning possibility. Now, let’s have a look at the leg. Please, lie down on the examination table. We'll start with a physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh. A blood clot? That sounds…frightening. Right, yes, of course. The examination table. Is it very… unpleasant? I don’t like needles, if that’s what you were going to do.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t involve a needle immediately. Just a visual inspection and palpation—feeling the leg. Though, we may need blood work later to confirm things. Please, lie down. It’s just a precaution, you understand. Now, let's start by looking at the size difference between both legs. It appears your left calf is approximately 2 centimeters larger in circumference than your right. And there's some mild pitting edema present when I press on the area. I'm also noting some mild discoloration—a slight bluish tinge.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Two centimeters… that sounds quite a bit. And…pitting edema? Is that bad? A bluish tinge? I hadn’t noticed that. I suppose I'm not very good at noticing these things. What does all this mean, Doctor? Is it definitely a blood clot?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t mean it’s definitely a blood clot, Nixon. It means we need to investigate further. The discoloration and edema are concerning, and given your history, it warrants a thorough workup. We’ll need to order a D-dimer blood test and an ultrasound of your leg. The D-dimer will help us rule out a blood clot, and the ultrasound will visualize the veins to check for any obstructions. I’ll put in the orders now. You'll need to go to the lab downstairs. They'll draw some blood. Then, you'll have the ultrasound scheduled. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. A D-dimer and an…ultrasound. The lab downstairs. Will the ultrasound…hurt? And how long will I have to wait for the results? It sounds like a lot. Is it very serious if it is a blood clot? I get…easily flustered, you see. I apologise for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is painless, Nixon. It uses sound waves, not needles. As for the results, it depends on the lab’s workload. Usually, within a few hours, but it could be longer. And yes, a blood clot can be serious, which is why we’re taking these precautions. If it is a blood clot, it requires immediate treatment with anticoagulants—blood thinners—to prevent it from traveling to your lungs. Look, I've ordered the tests. Try to remain calm. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. No, none at all. Blood thinners… that sounds…scary. But I understand. Precautions. Right. So, the lab downstairs… should I walk, or… is it better to take a taxi? I don't want to…make it worse.
DOCTOR: Walking is fine, but avoid any strenuous activity. Just take it easy. And frankly, worrying won’t help. The lab is just downstairs, it’s not a marathon. Here’s the requisition form. Take this to the lab technician. They’ll take care of you. Once you have the results, call the clinic and schedule a follow-up appointment with me. Don't delay. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… the walking. Take it easy. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… go downstairs now. And call to schedule an appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get it done. And try not to overthink it. .
