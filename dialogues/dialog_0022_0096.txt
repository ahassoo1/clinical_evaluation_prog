DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this sensitivity to light, really. It's been bothering me for a few weeks now. Anything bright just feels… too much. It's hard to explain, but it's making everyday things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to light, or photophobia, for a few weeks. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's not like a pain, exactly. More like… my eyes really strain when it's bright. Like when I'm outside on a sunny day, even with sunglasses, it feels uncomfortable. And even inside, like, the glare off my computer screen is worse than it used to be. It makes me squint a lot. It's just… tiring, you know? I find myself wanting to stay inside more and more.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So it's not a sharp pain, but more of a strain and discomfort, even with sunglasses. And it's impacting your daily activities, making you want to avoid light. Has this come on suddenly, or was it gradual?
PATIENT: It was pretty gradual, I think. I didn't notice it at first, just thought I was tired. But over the last month or so, it’s definitely gotten worse. It wasn’t like one day it just started. It's been slowly building up, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Gradual onset is helpful to know. Now, besides the light sensitivity, have you noticed any other changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, I don't think so. Everything looks normal, as far as I can tell. No blurry spots, no double vision, no floaters… just the light bothering me. Though, I guess I haven’t been looking closely at things, because I've been trying to avoid bright lights! It's hard to explain. I haven't really needed to focus on details, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in visual acuity, no blurry spots, no floaters or double vision. Just the light sensitivity. Have you had any headaches associated with this, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No headaches, no. And definitely no nausea or vomiting. Just… discomfort. It's mostly just annoying, to be honest. It doesn't hurt, it just makes things harder. Makes me feel a bit washed out sometimes, if that makes sense. Like I’m straining all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no headaches or nausea. Just discomfort and a feeling of strain. Have you noticed any redness in your eyes, or any discharge?
PATIENT: No redness, and no discharge. My eyes feel normal to the touch, if that helps. I check them sometimes, just to make sure. I haven’t noticed anything unusual, really. It's just… the light. And the tiredness, I suppose. It feels like I'm squinting all the time, even when I'm not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no redness or discharge, just the sensitivity to light and the associated strain. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any previous eye problems or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always had pretty good eyesight, to be honest. Just needed regular glasses as I got older, nothing special. I’ve never had any eye surgery or any serious eye problems. And I've been wearing glasses for about ten years now, but they haven't changed much over the years. Just the usual yearly check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No previous eye problems or surgeries. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I lost my wife a few years back, and I've been mostly keeping to myself since then. I go to the doctor for a general check-up once a year, and they haven’t mentioned anything serious. I do have Medicare, so they usually catch things. I don’t have any conditions that I’m aware of. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I don’t take any pills or anything. Just the usual vitamins, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I prefer to stay away from medications if I can, to be honest. I just try to eat healthy and get enough rest. It's been hard since my wife passed, but I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat all sorts of things, I don’t have any food allergies, and I haven’t been stung by anything nasty. Nothing like that. I think I’d know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you likely would. Alright, good to know. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members with eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My mother had cataracts when she got older, I think. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he was pretty blind towards the end of his life, but I don’t know what caused it. Other than that, not really. No one in my family had any serious eye problems that I know of. It's been a while since I've thought about it, to be honest. We weren't very close, my family. But cataracts and… blindness, maybe? That's all I can really remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, cataracts in your mother, and possible blindness in your grandfather. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped after my wife passed. And I definitely don't do any drugs. Never have, never will. I just try to keep things simple, you know? Healthy eating, enough sleep… that's about it. I like to keep things clean and straightforward.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Now, before we do a quick eye exam, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. What do you do for work?
PATIENT: I’m a dental assistant. I help the dentist with procedures, take x-rays, that sort of thing. It's a pretty good job, actually. I like helping people. But it does involve a lot of staring at screens and bright lights, now that I think about it. Maybe that’s something to do with it? I’ve been doing it for about five years now. It’s mostly office work, but it can be stressful sometimes, you know? Dealing with nervous patients and things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, dental assistant for five years, involving a lot of screen time and bright lights. That's helpful information. Alright, Arbin, let's do a quick eye exam to see what's going on. I'm going to check your visual acuity, your pupils, and the back of your eyes. It won't take long. Can you read the letters on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Yes, I can. Let me just… adjust my glasses. Here we go… E… F… P… T… Okay. I think that's right. Is that the top line?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the top line. Good. Now, let’s try the next line. Just read the letters as clearly as you can.
PATIENT: Okay… uh… L… F… P… T… C… It's a little blurry, to be honest. I'm squinting a bit. I think that's right, though. Is that okay? Should I try to make it out more? I feel like I'm straining again.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's alright. You're straining, and that’s helpful to know. Let’s move on to examining your pupils. Your pupils are equal in size and react to light, which is good. No obvious abnormalities there. Now, I'm going to use an instrument to look at the back of your eyes. It won’t hurt, but it might be a little bright. Everything looks normal in the back of your eyes as well. No signs of swelling or damage. Your optic nerves look healthy, and the retinas appear normal. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any obvious cause for your light sensitivity.
PATIENT: That's… good, right? No damage? That's reassuring. So, what does that mean? What could be causing it then, if everything looks okay? Is it something to do with my work? All the bright lights and the screens? I’m a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good! It means we haven't found any immediate, serious cause for concern. The most likely explanation, given your symptoms and the normal physical exam, is digital eye strain, also known as computer vision syndrome. Prolonged use of screens, especially in a brightly lit environment, can cause eye fatigue, blurred vision, and light sensitivity. It's very common, especially in your line of work. Other possibilities, though less likely given your exam, include dry eye, or even just normal age-related changes in your eyes. To be on the safe side, I'd like to recommend a few things. First, we can try artificial tears to help keep your eyes lubricated. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we need to address the digital eye strain. I recommend following the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Also, make sure your computer screen is positioned correctly, and adjust the brightness and contrast. A blue light filter on your screen might also help. I also want to rule out any underlying dry eye issues. Let's get a Schirmer's test to check your tear production. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all. A Schirmer's test sounds fine. I’m happy to try anything to help. The 20-20-20 rule… I can definitely try that. I just get so focused on my work, I forget to blink sometimes. And the blue light filter… I think I've heard of that. It sounds like a good idea. So, it’s probably just my work then? That’s a relief, honestly. It's good to know it's not something serious. How long does the Schirmer's test take? And will it be uncomfortable? I’m a bit worried about having something poked at my eyes.
DOCTOR: It’s very likely related to your work, yes. It’s good that we've ruled out anything more serious. The Schirmer's test is very quick and generally not uncomfortable. What I’m going to do is gently place a small strip of paper under your lower eyelid, and you'll blink a few times. It measures how much tear production you have. It's a very gentle procedure and doesn't involve any poking. It will only take a few seconds per eye. I'll then check the length of the moistened paper to see how much fluid was produced. It’s a standard test and shouldn't cause you any discomfort. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to write you a prescription for artificial tears. Use them as needed, several times a day, especially when you're working on the computer. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… manageable. Not poking is good! Okay, let’s do it then. Artificial tears and the 20-20-20 rule… I can definitely remember those. I think I’ll also try to adjust the lighting in the office. Maybe ask if they can dim the overhead lights a bit. And the blue light filter… I’ll look into that today. Thank you, Doctor. This has been very helpful. I feel a lot better knowing what’s going on, and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could help. Okay, the results are back. Your tear production is slightly lower than average, which supports the possibility of dry eye contributing to your symptoms. But it’s not severe. So, to summarize: we’ve identified digital eye strain and mild dry eye as the likely causes of your light sensitivity. I’m recommending artificial tears, the 20-20-20 rule, and adjusting your workstation lighting. I’d like to see you back in a month to see how you’re doing. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they get worse, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a copy of my notes, and a prescription for the artificial tears. Do you have any other questions for me today?
