DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s…about a surgery I’m considering. I believe I have clearance paperwork to fill out, as requested? It’s all a bit…hazy, truthfully. It’s for cosmetic reasons, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your paperwork here. Cosmetic, you say. While we do offer some elective procedures, it’s…unusual for someone to seek a full consultation with Internal Medicine beforehand. However, it’s always best to be thorough. Could you elaborate on what surgery you are considering and why you felt a medical clearance was necessary?
PATIENT: Oh, um…it’s a…facelift, I believe. And…well, my late husband, he… insisted on it. Before he…passed. He arranged everything, a very… comprehensive plan. I think the clearance was part of that plan, just to be safe. It’s been…some time since he organized it, and I don’t recall all the details. I apologize for my vagueness. It's… difficult remembering specifics.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly acceptable if details are hazy. Still, for proper medical clearance, we need to establish a baseline understanding of your overall health. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I…believe I was always quite healthy, generally. My husband always handled the doctor’s appointments. He was very meticulous about everything. I think I had…high blood pressure once, a long time ago, but it was very mild, and it may have been temporary. He gave me something for it, I think. A small pill. But I don't recall the name, or if I was on it for very long. I really am terribly sorry, Doctor. It's all so…blurred.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Brightful. We will work through it. “Mild hypertension” is helpful, although the lack of specifics is… less than ideal. Do you recall any past surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Let me see… surgical procedures… I had my tonsils removed as a child, I’m quite sure. And… I believe I had a rather unpleasant appendix surgery when I was younger, too. It was a very long recovery, I remember that. Other than that… I don’t believe so. No, that should be everything. I had a mole removed once, but that was just a quick office visit, not a full surgery. I think. Oh, this is truly frustrating, isn't it? I wish I could be of more help.
DOCTOR: Indeed. It's important to have a comprehensive understanding. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t believe so, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. My husband always checked everything very carefully before I took it. He was… extraordinarily cautious. Though, now that I think about it… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I garden. But that could just be the plants, couldn’t it? Roses have thorns, and some leaves are… irritating. I don’t consider that a true allergy, though.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements currently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I do. Just this one. My husband prescribed this to me after…well, after he passed. He said it would help with my…nerves. I believe it’s for anxiety, although I don’t know the name, or the dosage. I’ve been taking one every night before bed, as he instructed. It does help me sleep, thankfully. Everything is…so much clearer when I’m rested.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, with all due respect, it's rather…unconventional to continue taking medication prescribed by someone who is no longer able to monitor your response. We need to identify this medication to ensure it's safe for you and won't interact negatively with any anesthesia required for the facelift. Do you have the original prescription bottle, or any documentation about this pill?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don’t. My husband… he took care of everything. He handled all the paperwork, all the bottles, everything. After he… passed, I… I just continued taking it, as he instructed. I trusted him implicitly. He was a very… knowledgeable man. I'm terribly sorry, Doctor. I know this isn't ideal. I really wish I could be more helpful, but my memory… it’s just… fragmented. Perhaps if I could see the surgeon, they might know something? He was involved in the planning, after all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, while I understand your trust in your late husband, it is my professional responsibility to ensure your safety. Continuing to take an unidentified medication is not advisable. I am concerned about potential interactions during surgery, as well as the unknown long-term effects. I will not be able to provide medical clearance for this procedure without a complete understanding of your medical history and current medications. I strongly recommend you schedule a consultation with a psychiatrist to assess your anxiety and determine an appropriate treatment plan. Additionally, I will provide you with a referral to a specialist who can thoroughly evaluate your overall health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. Would you like me to arrange those referrals for you?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. I… I suppose you’re right. It just… feels like I’m letting him down, if I don’t follow through with his plans. He spent so much time… arranging everything. But… I understand. If it’s for my safety… Yes, please. Yes, I would very much appreciate those referrals. Perhaps…perhaps knowing I’ve done everything properly would… ease my mind. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so… thorough.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It's my duty to ensure your well-being. I've noted your concerns, and I understand your desire to honor your late husband's wishes. However, your health is paramount. My staff will be in touch shortly with the referral information. Do you have any other questions for me today?
