DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s Lindsey, please. And, um… the nurse just told me it was somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ high. That’s what the letter said, anyway. I get a little mixed up sometimes, but I wanted to get it checked out. It just… sounded important.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse likely mentioned the elevated cholesterol reading from your recent lab work. It is important, Lindsey. We need to determine what’s causing it and how best to address it. Before we get into that, let’s talk a little more about what’s been going on with you lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms – anything at all – that might be related?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I feel… well, I feel like an old man, which I am, but that’s just age, I reckon. No chest pain or anything like that. My legs get a little tired when I walk a good distance, but that’s happened for years. Truth be told, I mostly just feel… normal. Does that make sense? I haven't been sick or nothin’. Just… old.
DOCTOR: "Feels old." Yes, I understand. It’s good you haven't had any acute symptoms like chest pain. Fatigue, you say?
PATIENT: Well, not exactly fatigue. More like… they just ache a bit after I’ve been on my feet too long. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know? Back when I was workin’, I was always on the go. Supervisin’ all them folks… it kept a fella movin’. But these days… a trip to the grocery store and I need a good sit-down after. It's not awful, mind you. Just… different. I don't bounce back like I used to.
DOCTOR: And how long has this… decrease in stamina been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a good question. It’s been gradual, really. Maybe… the last five or ten years, I’d say? It didn't happen overnight. It just sort of… crept up on me. At first, I didn’t even notice it. Then, a year or two ago, I realized I wasn’t able to keep up with my grandkids like I used to. They're a lively bunch, always runnin’ around. I try to keep up, but… well, you know. Old age catches up with ya. I used to go fishin’ every weekend, but even that gets harder these days. Haulin’ in the gear and walkin’ along the bank… it's a lot for an old fella.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Let me think... High blood pressure, yes. Doc told me years ago, maybe twenty years back. Put me on somethin’ for it, but I stopped takin' it after a while. Didn't feel like it was doin' much, and I didn't want to be on a bunch of pills. Haven't been back to a doctor regularly since. As for the rest… no, nothin' else that I know of. My wife, bless her heart, she always took care of all that paperwork and rememberin’ things. It's been five years since she passed, and I ain’t the best at keepin' track of such things. Mostly, I just try to stay active, you know? Keep movin' and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: "Non-compliant HBP, infrequent follow-up." Alright. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let’s see. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, oh, must be seventy years ago. And… I broke my wrist a few years back, fallin’ on the ice. Had to have a cast on for a while. That’s about it, I think. Not much else. I was always a pretty healthy fella, generally. Worked hard my whole life, didn't spend much time sittin' around. My wife used to say I was too stubborn to get sick, even!
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my wife, like I said, passed five years ago. We didn't have any children, just the two of us. My brother, he’s still livin’, but he’s out in California. Haven't seen him in a good many years, to be honest. As for health problems… my mother, she had a bad heart, I remember that. Had to be careful what she ate. And my father, he… well, he passed away pretty young, from somethin' with his lungs. Smoked too much, they said. That’s about all I know, really. We weren’t much for talkin’ about health, if you get my drift. Just didn't seem polite, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anythin’ a doctor gave me. I don’t take many pills, see? Like I said, I stopped takin’ the blood pressure medicine a long time ago. And I haven't been sick enough to need much else. Sometimes I take somethin' for my arthritis, when it flares up, but nothin' fancy. Just somethin’ over the counter. Nope, can't recall ever bein’ allergic to anythin’, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your extremities. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Always happy to help. This is a nice office, by the way. Very clean.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a little distant. Lungs are clear, though somewhat diminished breath sounds expected for age. Blood pressure is elevated: 160 over 92. Now, let's take a look at your extremities. Pulses are present, but weak. Some mild edema in your ankles. Skin is somewhat thin and dry. Alright. Everything appears consistent with age and your reported history, but your blood pressure is certainly concerning. We need to address that.
PATIENT: Well, that don't surprise me none. I figured somethin' was off. My wife, she always said I worried too much, and that probably didn't help my blood pressure none. So, what do you think we should do, Doctor? Pills? I really don't fancy takin' a bunch of pills again, but… I reckon I gotta do what’s best, right? Just tell me straight. I'm an old man, don't need sugar-coatn'.
DOCTOR: You are correct, Lindsey. Medication is likely necessary. Given your history of non-compliance, and your reluctance, we will start with a low dose and monitor your response closely. However, medication alone isn't enough. We need lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise. I will have the nurse provide you with some pamphlets on a heart-healthy diet, and I strongly recommend regular, low-impact exercise – walking, swimming, anything to get you moving. I also want you to get a lipid panel and a basic metabolic panel done to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels and kidney function. We'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment in one month. It's imperative you take this seriously, Lindsey. Ignoring this could have serious consequences.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, you’re right. I hear ya. Serious consequences… I don’t want none of them. Low dose pills… I can handle that. And walkin’? I can definitely do some walkin’. I used to love walkin’. And I'll try to eat better too. No more of my wife's pecan pies, I reckon. I’ll take the pamphlets, and I'll get the tests done. One month, you say? I'll be here. You just tell me what needs doin', and I'll do it. I'm an old man, but I ain’t stupid. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That will suffice, Lindsey. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment and provide the necessary paperwork for the lab tests. I expect to see improvement in one month. Do not delay. Do you have any further questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I reckon you’ve covered everything. Thank you for takin’ the time to explain things to me. I appreciate it. I'll see you in a month. And, uh… thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will assist you. .
