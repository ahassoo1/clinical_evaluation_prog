DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, you say? Lovely name. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constant, but it comes and goes, and when it does come…whew. It’s a doozy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head that comes and goes. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like…a heavy pressure. Like someone’s puttin’ a band around my head, tight like. And it usually starts in the mornin’, I think. Or maybe after I’ve been workin’ for a while. I do a lot of fine work with my hands, you see – manicures and pedicures. Been doin’ it for…oh, goodness, nearly sixty years now. But it doesn't happen every time I’m workin’, mind you. That's the strange part.
DOCTOR: Sixty years! That’s wonderful. A lot of dedication. So, a heavy pressure at the back of your head, usually in the mornings or after working… and it doesn’t happen every time you work. Is there anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, layin' down helps. Definitely. And a cool cloth on the back of my neck. My wife, bless her heart, always gets me one when I complain. Makes a world of difference. Worse… hmm. Not sure about worse. Sometimes if I’m really tired it feels…deeper, I suppose? And if I’m stressed, you know, a busy day at the salon, lots of appointments… it seems to hang on longer. But honestly, Doctor, I'm not one to fuss much. I just figured I'd get it checked out, see if it’s somethin’ serious.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you. It's good you came in. Laying down and a cool cloth help, and it seems to be related to fatigue and stress. We'll definitely look into that. Now, besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms – things like changes in your vision, any nausea or vomiting, dizziness, or any numbness or weakness anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness, not at all. And definitely no vomiting. Thankfully! My vision's been a little… blurry sometimes, now that I think on it. But I figured that was just my age catchin' up with me! I’m eighty-seven, you know. Things ain’t as sharp as they used to be. No numbness or weakness, either. Just the headache and the blurry vision, which comes and goes just like the headache, really. It’s not too bad, though. I can still see well enough to do my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision along with the headache. It’s good you mention that. And you said it comes and goes, similar to the headache. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but it was never too bad. He put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped takin' them after a bit. Didn't seem to be makin' much difference, and I didn’t like takin’ pills if I didn't have to. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothin' like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Oh! I had a bad bout of arthritis in my hands a few years back, but that's settled down now. Mostly just a little stiff in the mornin'. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, and some arthritis in your hands that’s currently well-managed. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… surgery… Oh, yes! I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Must have been…sixty years ago or more! And…and I had a cataract removed from my right eye about ten years ago. That went well, though. My vision in that eye is fine now. Apart from the blurry vision I mentioned, of course. Seems I’m fallin' apart bit by bit! But still keepin' on, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, you're doing remarkably well keeping on! Appendectomy and cataract surgery – good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure too, come to think of it. And she had a stroke when she was an old woman. My father was pretty healthy, actually. Lived to be eighty-five. My sister… she had some sort of cancer, I think. Breast cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember all the details. She passed away several years back. And my son… well, he’s perfectly healthy, thank goodness. He worries about me, though. Wants me to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure and stroke in your mother, cancer in your sister, and your son is healthy. That's helpful. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Never had one in my life! I can eat anything, take anything, no problem. My wife always jokes that I have a cast-iron stomach. She’s the one with the sensitive tummy! No, no allergies, Doctor. Perfectly fine in that regard.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then, when my arthritis flares up. Nothing regular, just when I need it. And a multivitamin every day, my wife insists on that one. Says I need to keep my strength up. Apart from that, no, nothing else. Just the ibuprofen and the multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and a daily multivitamin. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors pokin’ and proddin’ at me! Been gettin' checked over for eighty-seven years, you know. Go ahead and do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Not drastically high, but something we should keep an eye on. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Coordination is good. No tenderness in your head or neck. Everything seems to be within normal limits for your age, but the elevated blood pressure and the vague blurriness you described are things we’ll want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Alright. Well, I figured somethin’ was a little off, but I wasn't too worried. So, what do you think it might be, Doctor? Do you think I need any tests done? And will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I’d like to order a few tests just to be on the safe side. I want to rule out anything serious. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. I'd also like to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. The blurriness you've mentioned, combined with the headache, warrants a closer look. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI, you say? Never had one of those before! Sounds a bit…intimidating. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I don’t want to ignore anything serious. Yes, let’s do the tests. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need a referral for the MRI? And how much will all this cost? I haven’t got insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and it’s good you’re asking about the cost. An MRI is a bit of a process, but it’s painless. It involves lying in a scanner for a while, so it's important to be comfortable. As for the cost, it can be expensive, unfortunately. I’ll have our billing department contact you with an estimate before the procedure. We can also discuss options for financial assistance or payment plans. Yes, you will need a referral for the MRI. I'll send that over to the imaging center. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to a week for everything to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take ibuprofen as needed for pain, and continue to monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a cuff available. Because you don't have insurance, and given your age, I'm also going to refer you to a social worker who can help you navigate potential financial assistance programs for healthcare costs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds wonderful, Doctor. A social worker would be a great help. I appreciate you thinkin’ of that. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, and all this paperwork… it gets a bit much. Yes, please, the social worker would be much appreciated. So, to recap… tests, referral for MRI, social worker… and I should keep takin’ the ibuprofen and try to check my blood pressure if I can. My wife has a cuff, I think. Is there anything else I need to be doin’ in the meantime? Should I be watchin’ for any particular symptoms?
DOCTOR: You've got it all down perfectly! Yes, please, have your wife check your blood pressure a couple of times a day if possible and keep a log of the readings. In the meantime, please watch for any new symptoms, like fever, weakness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, or sudden changes in your vision. If you experience any of those, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just continue with your regular routine and try not to worry. I’ll have the lab orders and the referral to the imaging center ready for you before you leave. The social worker will contact you within a few days to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me and not dismissin' my concerns. Thank you again for your help. I’ll go home and let my wife know everything. She’ll be glad to hear we have a plan. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and please give your wife my best.
