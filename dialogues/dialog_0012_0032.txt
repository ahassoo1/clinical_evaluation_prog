DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Krok, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's… a delicate matter, Doctor. Rather embarrassing, to be frank. I’m Radford Krok, by the way. Though I suspect you already know that. It’s… a discharge. From down there. It’s been happening for a few days now, and my wife insisted I come. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. I’ve lived a long life, and a little…leakage… is to be expected.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok. Thank you for being open with me. It's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, but these things are quite common, and we're here to help figure out what’s going on. It’s good your wife encouraged you to come in. When you say "a few days," can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, details, details. Perhaps… three or four days? It’s difficult to say precisely. Time does rather blur after a certain age, you know. It’s not constant, mind you. More… intermittent. And it’s not… a flood, if you catch my meaning. Just a… dampness. A slight… residue. Is that sufficient detail for your… purposes? Honestly, I'd rather not dwell on the specifics. It's terribly undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Krok. “Intermittent dampness, slight residue” – I’ve got that noted. And it's perfectly understandable that you don't want to dwell on it. We'll get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. Just to get a better picture, can you describe the discharge?
PATIENT: Describe it? Good heavens. Well… it’s… fluid, naturally. And… colorless, I suppose. Though perhaps a little… cloudy? It’s not… bloody, if that’s what you’re asking. Nor is it… particularly odorous. At least, I haven’t noticed. My sense of smell isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, I’m not a connoisseur of… bodily fluids, Doctor. Is there a simpler way to put this? Perhaps a checklist? A series of multiple-choice questions?
DOCTOR: You're right, a checklist might be easier! Let’s try that. Okay, so we’ve established it’s colorless, not bloody, and doesn’t have a strong odor. Does it cause any burning or itching?
PATIENT: Burning… hmm. Not precisely burning. Perhaps a slight… irritation. A mild… discomfort. It's not agonizing, mind you. More like… a persistent annoyance. Itching… no, I don’t believe so. My skin does get rather dry these days, so there’s always some sensation. But not…itching specifically. Is there an option for “general malaise”? Because that seems to encompass a great deal of what ails me these days. Though I doubt it’s related to this particular issue. Honestly, I'm starting to regret bringing this up. It's just a waste of everyone's time.
DOCTOR: Okay, “slight irritation, mild discomfort,” noted. And it's alright to mention "general malaise" – we can certainly talk about that too, as it's important to get a full picture of how you're feeling. It's definitely not a waste of time, Mr. Krok. These things can be concerning, and it’s good you brought them up. Now, has this discharge been associated with any pain – either in your abdomen, groin, or while urinating?
PATIENT: Pain… Well, my back aches constantly, but that’s just old age, I assure you. And my joints creak like an ancient ship. As for specific pain… No, not really. Perhaps a slight twinge occasionally, but nothing I’d call significant. Not while urinating, no. Though, as I said, everything aches these days. It’s difficult to pinpoint anything specific. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to think I'm just falling apart. A perfectly natural process, I suppose, but still… rather inconvenient. Are you sure this isn't just… a symptom of advanced decrepitude?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel that way, Mr. Krok, and I appreciate you being so open with me. We are going to figure this out. It's good you can pinpoint that there's no pain, that helps us narrow things down. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… Good heavens, where to begin? I’m eighty-three years old, Doctor! I’ve accumulated a considerable collection of ailments over the years. Let me see… My wife handles most of those details, to be honest. I know I have… high blood pressure, I believe. And something about my cholesterol. She keeps telling me to watch my diet, but frankly, I’ve lived this long despite indulging in a few pastries. And… yes, I believe the doctor mentioned my prostate a few years back. Enlarged, he said. Perfectly normal for a man my age, he assured me. But beyond that… Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. You’d be better off asking my wife. She keeps a detailed log of everything. It’s rather intimidating, to be honest. Are you sure you want to know all this? It’s a rather lengthy list, I suspect.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It’s very common for patients to have a lot of medical history, and it's completely understandable if you don’t remember everything. We can definitely get the information from your wife if that’s easier. But just to cover the basics, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see. Yes, I believe I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. Dreadful pain, I recall. And… yes, I had a hernia operation a few years back. Nothing too serious, thankfully. And… oh, yes! A rather unpleasant procedure on my knee, many years ago. Something about a torn cartilage. But beyond that… I honestly can’t recall. It was a long time ago, Doctor. My memory is… fragmented, to say the least. Honestly, I’m starting to feel rather overwhelmed. Is this all necessary? Can’t you just prescribe me something for the… dampness? Perhaps an ointment? My wife has a drawer full of remedies. She’s quite resourceful, you know. Are you certain we need to delve into all this medical minutiae? It’s rather… unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Krok, we’ll take it slowly. Knowing about the surgeries helps us get a complete picture, and you’re doing great. I understand it’s unsettling to recall these things, but it helps me make the best decision for your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. Yes, I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill, I believe. And something for my cholesterol. Another little pill, I suppose. And… oh, yes! A tablet for my knees. It helps with the… creaking. My wife manages all of that, of course. She has them all neatly organized in a pill organizer. I just… take them as directed. Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea what they’re for specifically. She tells me, but it goes in one ear and out the other. Are you certain you need to know all this? It’s a rather… tedious list, I suspect. And frankly, I’m getting rather tired. Perhaps we could just skip this part? Or maybe I could just bring in the pill organizer next time? It would be much simpler, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. We can definitely get a list of your medications from your wife or the pill organizer next time. It’s very helpful to have that information, but we can certainly proceed without it for now. Now, just a few questions about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I eat everything. My wife keeps telling me to watch my diet, but I have a very robust constitution. I've never had an allergic reaction in my life. Though, I recall being rather…uncomfortable after eating a particularly spicy curry many years ago. But that was just a matter of…digestive distress, I believe. Not an allergy. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a remarkably healthy man for my age. A little… dampness… is hardly a cause for concern. And allergies? Absolutely not. I’ve never been allergic to anything. It’s simply not in my nature. Are you sure you need to ask all these questions? It’s rather… patronizing, to be honest. As if I’m some delicate flower who might wilt at the slightest provocation. I assure you, I’m quite resilient.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem unnecessary, Mr. Krok. I just want to be thorough and make sure I have a complete picture of your health. It's good to know you don't have any known allergies. Now, to get back to the main issue, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…Hmm. Well, I've been feeling a bit…tired lately. But that's just old age, naturally. And my knees have been creaking more than usual. And my back aches constantly. Honestly, Doctor, I'm eighty-three years old! I’m falling apart, piece by piece. Are you asking about symptoms specifically related to the…dampness? Because honestly, I haven’t noticed anything else. No pain, no burning, no itching, just…the dampness. It's rather…unsettling, I suppose. But hardly a medical emergency. Are you certain we need to delve into this any further? Perhaps a simple ointment would suffice? My wife has a rather impressive collection of remedies. She’s quite resourceful, you know. And frankly, I'm starting to feel rather…irritable. This whole process is rather… exhausting. I’d rather be home, enjoying a cup of tea. Are you certain you can’t just prescribe me something?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Krok. It sounds like you're experiencing some general discomfort, which is common at your age. We will get to the bottom of this. Before we consider any prescriptions, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will just involve a brief examination of the area to see if there's anything obvious going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: An…exam? Good heavens. Well… I suppose so. Though I must confess, I’m not entirely comfortable with the idea. It’s rather… personal, you know. And frankly, I’m not as nimble as I used to be. I’m not sure I can… cooperate. But… alright. If you insist. Though please be gentle. And… brief. It’s rather… undignified, to be honest. And frankly, I’d prefer not to think about it any further than necessary. Are you certain this is absolutely essential? Perhaps a thorough questioning would suffice? Or maybe a referral to a specialist? Someone who… specializes in these matters? Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel rather… vulnerable. And frankly, I’d rather be anywhere else right now. Are you certain you can’t just prescribe me something? Perhaps an ointment? My wife has a rather impressive collection of remedies. She’s quite resourceful, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. It's perfectly alright to feel that way, and I will absolutely be gentle and respectful. The exam will be quick and focused, and we can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on and determine the best course of action. We can certainly discuss a referral to a specialist if that's your preference after the exam. For now, let me explain what I'm going to do. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table, and I'll take a look at the area. We’ll do our best to make you comfortable. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright. If you insist. But please, be quick. And gentle. And discreet. I’m not as… flexible as I used to be. And frankly, I’d rather not be lying on an exam table at my age. It’s rather… undignified, to be honest. And please, no unnecessary probing or… poking. I trust you are a professional, Doctor, but still… it’s a rather… sensitive area. And frankly, I’m starting to feel rather… anxious. Are you certain this is absolutely essential? Perhaps a simple ointment would suffice? My wife has a rather impressive collection of remedies. She’s quite resourceful, you know. And frankly, I’d rather be anywhere else right now. But… alright. Let’s get it over with. But please, be quick. And gentle. And discreet. And… stop if I say so. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krok. I understand completely. We will take it slow, be gentle, and stop immediately if you ask. I will explain everything as I go. Please, take your time getting onto the table. I'll be right here. Okay, Mr. Krok. I’m just going to take a quick look. I'll need to lower your trousers slightly. We'll do this as quickly and respectfully as possible. I’m seeing some mild redness and a small amount of clear discharge. There doesn’t appear to be any sign of injury or infection. But to be sure, I’d like to collect a small sample of the discharge for testing. Would that be alright?
