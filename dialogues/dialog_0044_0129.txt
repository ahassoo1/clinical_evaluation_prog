DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's about my… stool. It's black. And honestly, I haven’t got all day to sit here describing things, Doctor. I take pills, you see. For my arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. Is that what you need to know? Because that’s probably it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta, I understand you're concerned about the black stool and you're wondering if it’s related to your arthritis medication. It's good you mentioned the pills – that’s very helpful. First, let’s not worry about time. I want to make sure we get everything sorted out. Black stool can be from medication, but we need to rule out other possibilities just to be safe. When did you first notice the black stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know exactly. A couple of weeks, maybe? It's not like I inspect everything after I… you know. I just noticed it wasn’t the usual color and thought, well, probably the pills. My Harold always says I worry too much. He'd say just ignore it. And frankly, I was hoping I could. It's just...it's black. Is it something serious? Because I’ve got a garden to tend to, Doctor. And Harold’s expecting supper.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Dawnetta, and it's good you’re bringing this to my attention, even if you weren't sure when it started. And Harold sounds like a practical man! Black stool, or melena as we call it, can be a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract. It doesn’t always mean it’s serious, but we need to investigate. It's good you mentioned the pills, we'll certainly look into whether those are the cause. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me the name of the arthritis medication you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Always with the questions. It's… let me see… Harold gets it for me. It's a little orange bottle. Naproxen, I think? Yes, Naproxen. 500 milligrams. Two of them, twice a day. And I've been taking them religiously, I tell you. For years now. They’re the only thing that keeps me going, honestly. Now, can we just get this over with? Is it the pills or not?
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen 500mg twice a day. Thank you, Dawnetta. That’s very helpful. Naproxen can cause black stool, and it's a common side effect, especially with long-term use. However, it’s still important to rule out other potential causes. We don’t want to just assume it's the medication without being certain. To do that, I’m going to ask you a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't go poking and prodding too much. And make it quick, please. Honestly, all these doctors nowadays... always wanting to examine everything. I’ve lived seventy-three years just fine without being poked and prodded. Just tell me if it's the pills. Is it the pills or not? I've got tomatoes that need staking.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. The exam is just to help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on, and it's important to be thorough. Before we do that though, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel movements besides the color?
PATIENT: Well… no, not really. It’s… normal, I suppose. A bit… stickier maybe? And it smells… well, it smells like stool, what do you expect? No blood, no pain, nothing like that. Just black and a bit… clingy. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite silly even discussing this. It's probably nothing. It's always nothing. Harold said so. Are you going to poke me now?
DOCTOR: Okay, so normal consistency, a bit stickier, and normal smell, no blood or pain. That’s helpful. And it's good you haven't noticed anything else concerning. Alright, let's move on to a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and I’ll gently feel your stomach to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It won't take long at all. Could you please lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is undignified. But get it over with. Quickly now. And be careful! My back isn’t what it used to be. Harold says I shouldn’t be lifting heavy things, and this table feels awfully hard.
DOCTOR: I understand, Dawnetta, and I will be very careful. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen first. Take nice, deep breaths for me. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender or painful. No tenderness noted on palpation. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses. Everything feels normal. Alright, everything feels normal on the physical exam, which is a good sign. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, don't get me started on my medical history! It's a long one. Just arthritis, really. And a bit of… well, my knees are shot. Harold keeps telling me I need a replacement, but I won't hear of it. And I had my gallbladder out years ago. 1985, I think it was. That's about it. No blood pressure, no sugar, I’m quite healthy for my age, you know. Except for the arthritis, of course, and now this… stool business. Honestly, Doctor, is it the pills or not? I really need to get back to my garden. Harold will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis, knee problems, gallbladder removal in 1985, and otherwise healthy. That’s helpful. It sounds like you’ve been quite resilient despite your arthritis. Based on what you’ve told me, and the normal findings on the physical exam, the most likely cause of the black stool is the Naproxen. It’s a known side effect, and it's good you haven’t noticed any other concerning symptoms like pain, bleeding, or fatigue. However, to be absolutely sure, and to rule out any other possibilities, I would like to order a simple stool test. It just checks for hidden blood in the stool. It's a quick and easy test you can do at home, and the results will give us peace of mind. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Another test? Honestly, Doctor, you doctors just love your tests, don’t you? Fine, fine. Do your test. But if it comes back negative, I’m not coming back. I've got tomatoes to stake, you know. And Harold’s expecting supper. And I’m perfectly certain it’s the pills. But, alright. Give me the box. And explain it very clearly. I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I apologize for the extra test. It's just a precaution, and I want to make sure we rule everything out. This is a fecal occult blood test, or FOBT. It’s very simple. Inside you’ll find instructions and collection supplies. Basically, you'll collect a small sample of stool on three separate days, and then send it to the lab. The lab will check for any hidden blood. The instructions are very clear. You’ll need to avoid certain foods and medications for a few days before each sample, like red meat and aspirin. The box will explain everything in detail. Do you have any questions about how to do the test?
PATIENT: Red meat? Aspirin? Honestly, Doctor, it’s getting more complicated by the minute! Harold doesn’t like it when I don’t eat my steak. And I take aspirin for my knees! This is ridiculous. So, I can’t eat steak or take my knee pills while doing this…test? What’s the point of even doing it if I can’t live my life? And how long will this take? I’ve got a garden to tend to, you know. And Harold… well, you know. Is it just a few days? Because if it takes longer than that, I'm not bothering. Honestly. Just tell me if it's the pills. It has to be the pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and you’re right to be concerned about interrupting your routine. It's a bit inconvenient, I agree. You only need to avoid red meat and aspirin for three days – the three days you're collecting the samples. You can eat and take your medications normally on all other days. The test itself takes just a few minutes each time, and it's important to be accurate. If you stop taking your aspirin for three days, it won’t cause any harm. It's just so we can rule out bleeding as the cause of the black stool. The lab results usually come back in about a week. If the test is negative, and you haven't noticed any other concerning symptoms, we can confidently say it's likely the Naproxen causing the black stool. And we can discuss ways to manage that, perhaps by adjusting your dose or switching to a different medication. Does that sound alright?
