DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why they sent me here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion? It’s just… darkening, she says. And I tire easily, but at my age, one does tire easily, wouldn’t you agree? Let's just get this over with, shall we? I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. We can certainly take a look at your complexion and talk about the fatigue. Just to clarify, this darkening… where are you noticing it specifically?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. It’s… all over. My hands, my face… perhaps even my legs. I don’t examine myself closely, you see. A man has better things to do. It's not a pleasant sight, my wife assures me. Frankly, I'd rather not dwell on it. Is there a quick remedy for this? Some sort of cream, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, “all over.” And when did you first start noticing this darkening, roughly?
PATIENT: Goodness… that’s a difficult question. Months, I suppose. Perhaps even longer. Time… it all blurs together, you see. I’ve lived a long life. It wasn’t sudden, Doctor. A gradual… fading of color, then this. Honestly, I can't recall specifics. My wife keeps track of such things, not I.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes along with this, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Changes? At eighty-five? Doctor, everything is changing. My bones ache, my memory fails, my appetite fluctuates… what specifically are you asking? Is this going to be a long interrogation? My wife mentioned something about feeling cold often... but I always assumed that was just the air conditioning. Honestly, I'm not one for listing ailments. It's rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay. The coldness is good to know. Any changes in your bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Good heavens! Are you attempting to be…indelicate, Doctor? I assure you, my… personal affairs are perfectly in order. That is quite a personal question, and frankly, unnecessary. I came in about my skin, not…that. If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ve answered enough questions for one morning. Perhaps I should just see a dermatologist? I'm not sure why I'm even here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. I am trying to get a complete picture of your health. These questions, while personal, can sometimes point to underlying issues. But you are right, a dermatologist would be a good next step given your concerns about your skin. Let me do a quick exam, just to see what we're dealing with, and I can give you a referral. Is that alright?
