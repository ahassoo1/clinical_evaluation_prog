DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s…family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of…issues. Heart stuff, mainly, but also…other things. It's probably nothing, but my ex-wife kept nagging me to get checked, and honestly, I just want to know I’m not going to…drop dead, you know? It’s a waste of time if it’s nothing, but better safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Family history is important, and it’s good you're being proactive. It's never a waste of time to get things checked out, especially with a family history of heart issues. So, let’s start with the heart stuff. Can you tell me more about what your mother, or other relatives, experienced?
PATIENT: Right. My mother…she had high blood pressure, for a long time. Really high. Eventually, she had a stroke, maybe ten years ago. Not a big one, thankfully, but she needed a lot of rehab. And my grandfather…he had angina. Chest pain, constantly. He smoked, of course. Everyone smoked back then. Stupid, really. Then my aunt…she had a heart attack, a few years after my mother’s stroke. She didn’t make it. So…it's a pattern, you see? It's just…hanging over my head. I try to eat reasonably well, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a significant family history, Mr. Theriot. High blood pressure, stroke, angina, and a heart attack…that certainly warrants a thorough evaluation. And you’re right to be concerned. Let’s get some more details. First, regarding your mother’s high blood pressure – do you know what her blood pressure readings were, roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. My ex-wife was the one who kept track of that kind of thing. She was…very organized. I just know it was “high.” She’d always be lecturing my mother about her salt intake. And then nagging me to get checked. I think it was…well, she said it was consistently over 140/90, but I wouldn't swear to it. I’m not a doctor. It was just…a number she threw around a lot, trying to scare everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, over 140/90 is definitely considered high. That gives us a good starting point. And it's good you recall that even if it was just a number she mentioned. Now, you mentioned your grandfather had angina. Do you know if he was ever officially diagnosed with that, or was it just assumed because of the chest pain?
PATIENT: He saw a doctor, yes. Back in the…sixties, I think? It was…a different time. They didn't have all the fancy tests they have now. But the doctor said something about narrowed arteries, I think. He prescribed some pills, little white ones. And told him to cut back on smoking, which, naturally, he didn't. It wasn’t a “formal” diagnosis, not like today, but he was put on medication for it. I remember my grandmother complaining about the cost of the pills. It was a big deal back then, everything cost so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for narrowed arteries sounds consistent with angina. And that’s helpful. Now, you mentioned your aunt. Do you know what circumstances led to her heart attack?
PATIENT: Right. She…she wasn't feeling well for a few days, apparently. Just tired, and some discomfort in her chest. She dismissed it as the flu, I think. She was always busy, running her business and everything. Then one morning…she just collapsed. They took her to the hospital, but…it was too late. Massive heart attack, they said. She was only…58, I think. It was…a shock. A real shock. She didn’t take care of herself. Always stressed, always working.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s…a very sad story, Mr. Theriot. And it highlights the importance of taking symptoms seriously. Now, let's switch gears and talk about you. Have you ever experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or any other symptoms that concern you?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a little winded sometimes, if I’m climbing stairs or something. But everyone does, right? And I’ve had…occasional palpitations, like if I drink too much coffee. Nothing major. I wouldn’t say I’ve had any…serious symptoms. My ex-wife was always convinced something was wrong, always asking if I was feeling okay. But I think she just worried too much. Honestly, I feel fine. It’s just…the family history, you know? It’s always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear you haven’t had any significant symptoms. But even minor symptoms with your family history warrant a check-up. To get a better picture, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't taken much in my life, to be honest. A few painkillers here and there for headaches, maybe some antibiotics once or twice. But I've never had an allergic reaction to anything. My ex-wife always asked me that question, too. She was very thorough. Perhaps too thorough. I think she wanted to be a nurse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And what about current medications?
PATIENT: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't take any pills, vitamins, or supplements. I've always tried to avoid medication if possible. My ex-wife tried to get me to take a multivitamin once, but I refused. I think it's all a waste of money. Honestly, I’m quite healthy, for my age. It’s just…this nagging worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. To complete the picture, let's quickly review your past medical and surgical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky, really. A few bouts of the flu when I was a kid, maybe a broken arm once, but nothing serious enough to require hospitalization. My ex-wife always asked me if I’d ever had any “major illnesses” or surgeries, but the answer was always no. I’ve always been…resilient, I guess. I try to stay active. Walking, mostly. It keeps me sane.
DOCTOR: Okay, no hospitalizations or surgeries. And finally, let's talk about family history a little more broadly, beyond the heart issues. Are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family, like diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Right. My mother’s side…my grandmother had diabetes, type 2. She lost a foot because of it, eventually. Horrible, really. And my uncle…he had colon cancer. But he smoked, too. Everyone smoked. It seems like cancer is popping up more and more these days, though. My father’s side…I don't know as much about them. My father wasn’t around much. He…well, let's just say it’s a complicated story. So, mostly it's the heart stuff and the diabetes on my mother’s side. And the smoking, of course. That’s a big factor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a pretty good overview of your family history. To proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I mean, if it will reassure me, I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. It’s just…I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a…a commitment later this afternoon. Nothing important, but still…I’d like to be on time.
DOCTOR: Alright, please have a seat on the table. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. It can fluctuate with anxiety as well. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in…and out…deep breath in…and out… Sounds are normal, no murmurs or wheezing. Your heart rate is a bit fast, 82, but again, that could be from the anxiety or even just caffeine. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are good and regular. Overall, your general appearance is normal. But given your family history and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order some blood work to get a better picture. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…reasonable. Blood work is fine. Whatever you need to rule things out, I’m happy to do it. It's just…I hope it doesn’t require a full fasting period. I had a late lunch. And…will I need a follow-up appointment? I really have a busy schedule. Just let me know what’s involved.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll do a basic lipid panel, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. It does require a 12-hour fast, so you’ll need to schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they come back. Given your family history, even with normal blood work, I'd recommend considering a stress test at some point as well. But let's see what the initial blood work shows first. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that…sounds alright. A 12-hour fast…ugh. But I can manage. And a stress test…well, let's hold off on that for now. I'm not a fan of…exertion. Let's see what the blood work says first. Okay. Where do I go for the blood draw? And…will my insurance cover it? I have Medicare, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing you're covered under Medicare, which should cover the standard blood work. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. Here's a requisition form with the instructions. You don’t need to make an appointment, just walk in during their business hours, which are 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. Once the results are in, our office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Cumper. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. It's…reassuring to have a professional opinion. Hopefully, everything will be fine. I'll go do the blood work tomorrow. I'll just try to relax until then. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Theriot. It’s good you came in. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
