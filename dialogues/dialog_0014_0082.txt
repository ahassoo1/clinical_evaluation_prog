DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, travel. I need… stuff for travel. My wife and I… we were gonna go. But she… she no longer can go. So now just me. I think. Maybe. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: Right. Travel… and some changes in plans. Okay. And what kind of travel are we talking about?
PATIENT: To… Nepal. Back to Nepal. Where I’m from. I live here now, you see. But… my village. I gotta go see family. It's been a long time. It’s… important. But things are different now. I haven't been back in… years.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nepal. Returning home after some time. And you said things are different now?
PATIENT: Yeah. Different. There’s… sickness. Everyone says. And… bugs. Lots of bugs. My cousin, he sent a message… said I need… shots. And pills. Before I go. But I don’t… I don’t know what. He just said, “Doctor. Go to doctor.” He's not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Right. Sickness and… potential insect-borne illnesses. That's sensible to prepare for. We'll get you sorted. Let's start with a bit more detail. When are you planning to travel?
PATIENT: Uh… soon. Very soon. August… end of August, maybe? Sometime. My ticket… is bought. But I can… change it. If I need. It's… flexible. I think. My wife… she booked it. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, end of August. Flexible is good. We'll need to factor in time for any vaccinations. And to get you the appropriate medications. Now, your cousin mentioned sickness. Can you tell me anything more specific about what he said?
PATIENT: Specific? No. He just said, “Be careful.” And… something about water. Don't drink the water. And… monkeys! He said stay away from the monkeys. They… bite. And get angry. He's always warning me about something. Always. Monkeys, water, snakes… everything is dangerous, he says.
DOCTOR: Monkeys, water… alright. That gives us something. It sounds like he's concerned about common travel health risks. We'll need to address those. Before we get to specific preventative measures, let's go through some basic questions. Have you had any vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? I… don't think so. Maybe when I was little? Back in Nepal. But I don't remember. My wife… she always took care of those things. I just… went. She said, "Get this," and I got it. I don't have… a card or anything. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No vaccination record, that's... not ideal, but we can work with that. We'll have to assume you're not up to date on routine travel vaccinations. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… No. I don't think so. Maybe… sometimes my skin gets itchy? But that's just… from the cold. Or… the sun. Nothing serious. My wife… she used to give me cream for it. But… she’s not here. It’s… fine. It doesn’t bother me much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. I… I don't get sick often. I try to stay healthy. My wife… she always said a good diet is best. I haven't needed… anything. Not for a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications, no allergies. Well, we'll need to get you started on some preventative measures for your trip. It sounds like you're relying heavily on… past habits. Let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, okay?
PATIENT: Exam? What… what for? I just need… the shots and the pills. Is that all? I don’t like doctors. They always… poke and prod. My wife… she handled all this. I just want to go see my family. Is the exam… necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, it is necessary. A basic exam allows me to assess your overall health before you travel, and identify any potential risks that might make certain vaccinations or medications unsuitable. It’s standard procedure, and it doesn’t have to be extensive. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and that’s it. It’s for your safety. Now, if you’ll just let me listen to your chest…
PATIENT: Fine. But… make it quick. I don't have much patience for… poking and prodding. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breath in… and out… again. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Nothing terribly concerning, but something to be aware of. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Lymph nodes are normal. Overall, you appear to be in generally good health, despite the slightly elevated blood pressure. Now, let's discuss the specific vaccinations and medications you’ll need for Nepal. Do you know where in Nepal you’ll be traveling?
PATIENT: Village… near Pokhara. My wife… she’s from there. It’s… in the mountains. Small village. Not much… modern stuff. Just… farms and temples. We always stayed… in the hills. Not in the city. I don't know the exact name of the village. She… handled all the details. Everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Pokhara region. That puts you in an area with a moderate risk of Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Due to the rural location, Japanese Encephalitis is also a consideration. And, given the potential for mosquito exposure, we’ll need to discuss malaria prophylaxis. It's important to be protected, Mr. Tayar. Considering your lack of vaccination history, we'll need to start these vaccinations immediately to allow time for them to become effective before your trip.
PATIENT: Hepatitis… Typhoid… Japanese… Malaria? What are all those things? And what does… prophylaxis mean? It sounds… complicated. My wife… she would know all this. She always… took care of everything. This is… too much. I just want to see my family. Is it… dangerous? Will I get… sick?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, it’s not about being ‘dangerous,’ it’s about being prepared. These are preventable illnesses. Hepatitis A is contracted through contaminated food and water. Typhoid is similar. Japanese Encephalitis is spread by mosquitoes, and malaria is a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquitoes. Prophylaxis simply means taking medication to prevent an illness. Look, I understand this is a lot to take in. I’m going to give you some information sheets. Read them carefully. We’ll start with Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations today. We’ll discuss malaria prophylaxis in more detail after we assess your overall risk factors. I also strongly recommend avoiding tap water and street food. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Mosquitoes… water… pills… It sounds like everything is trying to make me sick. But… if I avoid everything… what can I even eat? And… what about my family? Will they get sick if I don’t eat their food? It's… rude, isn't it? To refuse their hospitality. This is… very difficult. Can't I just take… some strong medicine? Something to kill everything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, you can't simply ‘kill everything’ with one pill. That's not how medicine works. And it’s not about refusing hospitality, it’s about protecting your health, and the health of your family. You can certainly eat their food, but you need to be cautious. Eat freshly cooked items, avoid raw fruits and vegetables, and drink bottled water only. And while I understand your concerns, avoiding potential sources of infection isn't rude, it's responsible. Look, I'm going to administer the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations now. They require two doses, spaced six months apart, so we’ll schedule your second appointment today. Then we’ll discuss malaria prophylaxis. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No… no allergies. I… I don't think so. But… will it hurt? A lot? My wife… she always said they were just… little pricks. But she… she was good at those things. Just… get it over with quickly. Please. I… I don’t like needles. It makes me… dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s done. A little pinch, that's all. You might feel a bit sore at the injection site for a day or two, but it's nothing serious. Just apply a cold compress if it bothers you. Now, let's discuss your travel itinerary in more detail. Where exactly will you be staying, and for how long?
PATIENT: It hurts… a little more than a pinch. My arm feels… funny. And I feel… wobbly. Village… small village. My wife's family home. I don’t know how long I'll stay. A few weeks, maybe? Until I feel… better. Then I'll come home. It's… a simple house. No fancy… hotel. Just… rooms. And a garden. We… used to grow vegetables.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, given that you'll be staying in a rural area for an extended period, we need to be particularly cautious about malaria. We'll prescribe you a course of doxycycline to take during your stay, and for a week after you return. It’s very important that you complete the entire course, even if you feel fine. Do you have any stomach problems, or any history of sensitivity to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Doxy… what? More pills? Stomach… sometimes. When I eat… spicy food. But not often. And… antibiotics? I don't think so. My wife… she always knew if I needed… something for my stomach. She gave me… herbal tea. I… I don't like taking pills. It makes me… uneasy. Is there… anything else I can do? Maybe… spray something? To keep the… bugs away?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, while insect repellent is helpful, it’s not enough to protect you from malaria. We are talking about a potentially life-threatening infection. Doxycycline is the most effective preventative medication. Look, I understand you’re not fond of taking pills, but your health is my priority. If you are unable to tolerate doxycycline, we can discuss alternative medications, but they are often less effective and have more side effects. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Life-threatening? No… no medical conditions. Just… sad. I’m just… very sad. My wife… she was healthy. Strong. She would… handle all this. Now… she’s not here. And I’m… alone. Is it… okay if I just… stay home? Maybe… Nepal is too dangerous. Maybe… I shouldn't go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand this is a difficult time. And it's perfectly reasonable to re-evaluate your travel plans if you’re feeling overwhelmed. However, avoiding Nepal won’t solve anything. And it shouldn't be driven by fear, but by preparedness. We can work through this. Let’s focus on getting you as prepared as possible. We’ll start with the doxycycline, and I’ll give you instructions on how to minimize side effects. And we can discuss your concerns about potential risks in more detail. I'm going to write you a prescription for the doxycycline, and a pamphlet with detailed information about malaria prevention. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: Side… side effects? What kind of side effects? Will I get… sick from the pills? More sick? I just… I just want to see my family. Is it… safe to travel at all? Maybe… maybe I should just… talk to my cousin. He knows Nepal better. He's… always warning me about everything. Maybe he's right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, look. Doxycycline can sometimes cause mild side effects, like nausea, stomach upset, or sensitivity to the sun. These are usually manageable. And, yes, there are risks associated with travel, but we can mitigate those risks with proper preparation. Your cousin’s warnings are… understandable, but they shouldn’t paralyze you. I'm a physician, and I’m here to help you make an informed decision. And to provide you with the medical support you need. I'm going to write you a prescription for doxycycline, and a pamphlet with detailed information about malaria prevention. It outlines the potential side effects, and how to manage them. Also, I'll give you some information on travel hygiene and food safety. It's very important that you follow these guidelines. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress and answer any further questions. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: …Two weeks? That's… soon. I… I don’t know if I can… handle all this in two weeks. All the pills… all the warnings… all the… sadness. My wife… she would have known what to do. She always… had a plan. Can’t I just… wait? Maybe… maybe I should just… cancel the trip altogether? It's… it's too much. I just want my wife back.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand this is incredibly difficult. And it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Look, if you want to postpone the trip, that's entirely your decision. And if you want to cancel it altogether, that’s also perfectly acceptable. There's no shame in prioritizing your emotional wellbeing. But before you make any final decisions, let's focus on getting you some support. I can refer you to a grief counselor who can help you cope with your loss. And if you want to proceed with the trip, we can work through the medical preparations at a pace that feels comfortable for you. We don't have to rush anything. Here’s the contact information for a grief counselor. Please reach out to them. And if you decide to proceed with the trip, give me a call, and we’ll schedule another appointment. Take care of yourself, Mr. Tayar. And remember, you're not alone.
