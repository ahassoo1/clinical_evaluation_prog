DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… fitness check. For… referee. I need paper say I okay. Quick check is good.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A fitness-for-duty exam for refereeing. I understand. To ensure I can complete this accurately for you, let's go through some details. First, could you tell me a little more about the requirements of the exam?
PATIENT: Requirements? Uh… run, push-up… maybe bend. They just want to make sure old man not going to fall on field. It’s soccer. High school. Not… professional. Just paper, Doctor. I need paper.
DOCTOR: I understand. A standard physical to demonstrate you’re fit to referee high school soccer. That's perfectly reasonable. To start, could you tell me about any current medical conditions you have – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing much. Back… sometimes hurts when I bend. Old injury. Work… heavy lifting. And… wife… she passed last year. Not medical, but… makes me tired sometimes. That’s all, I think.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Shanor. That is a significant loss, and it’s understandable that it would affect your energy levels. We’ll certainly keep that in mind as we go through this exam. Regarding your back pain, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It’s… not always there. When I lift heavy things at work, then it hurts. And if I bend wrong. Not… sharp pain. Dull ache. I take… pills sometimes. Ibuprofen. From store. Helps a little. Not every day though. Only when bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache in your back that’s triggered by lifting and sometimes bending, and you manage it with over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed. And you're only taking it when the pain flares up, not regularly?
PATIENT: Yes. Not every day. Maybe… once a month. Sometimes not even that. Work is busy now, more lifting. That’s why I here. Want to make sure okay before season start. Don't want to fall down. Embarrassing.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Shanor. It's proactive of you to get this checked out before the season begins. Let's do a quick physical exam to assess your back and overall fitness. We’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good. Quick is good. I have work later. Not much time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as efficient as possible. First, could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is heavy? I eat good, sometimes. Noodles are good.
DOCTOR: 134 pounds. And your height is listed as 174 centimeters, which is about 5 feet 8 inches. That gives us a BMI of 22.2, which is within a healthy range. Now, if you don’t mind, please stand facing away from me in your underwear. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we'll move on to checking your back.
PATIENT: Okay. Quick, please. I don't like… this part.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No murmurs, wheezes, or crackles that I can detect. Now, if you could slowly bend forward and touch your toes, as far as is comfortable for you, please. I’m just assessing your range of motion. I will be watching for any signs of discomfort.
PATIENT: Ouch. Little bit hurts. Not bad. Just… tight. Stop here. Okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I saw that you stopped about halfway due to discomfort, and that’s perfectly alright. No need to push through pain. I also noticed some slight muscle guarding in your lower back when you bent forward. Now, let’s try a simple test. Could you stand and try to lift one leg straight out in front of you, keeping your knee straight?
PATIENT: Little shaky. Harder than it looks. Left leg now?
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed it was a bit more challenging. It appears you have some mild weakness and instability in your lower extremities. Now, could you walk on your heels for a few steps, then walk on your toes?
PATIENT: Whoa! Careful. Not good balance. Old. I’m old, Doctor. You think?
DOCTOR: You're not old, Mr. Shanor, but I do see some decreased balance and mild weakness. It's good you're getting this checked out. Based on what I’ve seen in the exam, and the history you've provided, it appears you have some lower back strain and some mild lower extremity weakness that’s affecting your balance. It’s likely from the heavy lifting at work and possibly some deconditioning. To be certain, I’d like to recommend an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any structural issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Hmm… cost money, right? And time. Just need paper say okay. Referee, remember? High school. Not NFL. Can skip X-ray? Maybe just… say okay? I need job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and time, Mr. Shanor. You’re right, for a high school referee exam, a full workup isn’t usually necessary. However, to responsibly complete this assessment and ensure your safety, I need to be reasonably certain there are no underlying issues contributing to your back pain and weakness. Given your concerns, and the low-risk nature of high school refereeing, we could proceed without the X-ray. However, I would strongly recommend physical therapy to strengthen your core and improve your balance. Would you be open to a referral for physical therapy?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… more money. More time. Okay… okay. But just… simple exercises? I don't want… complicated. And quick visits? I have work. Give me paper now? You think okay for referee? If I do… simple exercises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. I understand. I will write a referral for physical therapy, and I will specifically request that they focus on simple core strengthening and balance exercises that won’t take up too much of your time. Based on my examination today, and with the understanding that you will follow through with the physical therapy referral, I believe you are reasonably fit to referee high school soccer. I will prepare a brief note stating that you have been evaluated and are cleared for activity, with the recommendation for physical therapy. Here you go. This note states I’ve evaluated you and cleared you for refereeing high school soccer, pending completion of a physical therapy program. Please follow up with the physical therapist as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. Simple exercises, okay? That’s all. Thank you.
