DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… No, forgive me, Doctor Nooruddin, yes? It’s… a bit embarrassing, frankly. It’s in my mouth. A white coating. It’s… unpleasant. I haven’t a clue what it is, and I’d rather not dwell on it any longer than necessary.
DOCTOR: A white coating, you say?
PATIENT: Precisely. It appeared… a few days ago, I believe. Honestly, I don’t spend much time examining my mouth. I have… important things to attend to. It’s not painful, not exactly, but… unsightly. And my wife noticed. That’s why I’m here, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Right. So, not painful, just… aesthetically displeasing. And your wife brought it to your attention. Hmm. Have you noticed it getting worse?
PATIENT: It feels the same, if that's what you mean. I haven’t been actively looking at it, Doctor. I assure you, I don't have time for detailed oral inspections. It hasn’t spread to, well, anywhere else, if that's a concern. Honestly, is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Let's have a look then, shall we?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, if it’s just something cosmetic… I’m a busy man. Perhaps a strong mouthwash? I read something about those once. I’d prefer to avoid anything… invasive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, with all due respect, I can't diagnose something without looking at it. It could be any number of things. A simple thrush infection, a reaction to something, or… something else entirely. Now, please open your mouth. I'll be quick.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But don't expect gratitude. It's probably just stress. I have a very demanding job.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there is a white coating, as you say. It looks a bit patchy, mostly on your tongue. No obvious sores or bleeding. Do you smoke, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, do I look like the type? Absolutely not. I maintain a healthy lifestyle. Mostly. It’s probably just… a temporary imbalance. Something I ate, perhaps. I had some… exotic fruit last week. From a market. Though I assure you, it was a reputable establishment. A very reputable one.
DOCTOR: Right. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… my wife says my breath isn't as… fresh as usual. And I suppose… a slight burning sensation after I eat something sweet. But honestly, Doctor, I barely notice. I’m a man of… fortitude. It’s probably nothing. Is this almost over?
DOCTOR: A burning sensation with sweets… and your wife noticed a change in your breath. Alright. Have you been experiencing any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no difficulties at all. I eat heartily, thank you very much. Steak, mostly. And chicken. No trouble swallowing a thing. Really, Doctor, I suspect it’s just… a minor irritation. Perhaps a stronger mouthwash will suffice. I'd like to avoid any unnecessary… procedures, if possible. And frankly, I have a very important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, while I appreciate your… fortitude, it’s important to rule things out. This could be oral thrush, especially given the white coating and burning sensation. Or it could be something else entirely. It’s unlikely to be serious, but we need to be thorough. I'm going to order a simple potassium hydroxide prep to examine the cells under a microscope. It will tell us if it's a fungal infection. It's a quick test.
PATIENT: A test? Doctor, are you certain this is necessary? I have a very demanding schedule. And I'm not particularly fond of… things in my mouth. Couldn't you just… prescribe something? An anti-fungal? I'm sure that would do the trick. I read an article once…
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, prescribing medication without knowing the cause would be irresponsible. It’s a simple swab, it will take five minutes, and will give us a definitive answer. It's far better than you self-treating and potentially making things worse. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it quick. And be gentle. Honestly, the indignity of it all…
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll send this to the lab. It should take a couple of days to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend you maintain good oral hygiene—brush twice daily, floss, and avoid sugary foods and drinks. I'll call you with the results and a plan. Now, do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No. No, that will be all. Honestly, this has been… most unpleasant. I trust the results will be conclusive. And quickly delivered, I hope. I have important matters to attend to. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye. .
