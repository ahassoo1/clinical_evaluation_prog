DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, welcome! I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Ranjan, you say? Hmm. Well, it's not that I want to be here, you understand. My daughter insisted. Said I needed to…get checked. Something about not wanting me to “make things worse.” Honestly, doctors these days. Always poking and prodding. I just want to be left alone, really. I’ve lived a long life, and I know my own body.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Wynell. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. And it's wonderful that you've lived a long life and are so in tune with your body. It's great your daughter is looking out for you, though, and sometimes a little check-up can just give us peace of mind. We don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with, okay?
PATIENT: Peace of mind? Hmph. That's what they say. Last time a doctor gave me “peace of mind” I ended up with a bill the size of a small car. And then they wanted me to take pills for everything! No, thank you. I've always been fine on my own. I used to be a podiatrist, you know. Fixed feet for forty years! I know a thing or two about bodies. More than most of these young folks, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Forty years as a podiatrist – that’s incredible! You certainly have a wealth of knowledge, then. I bet you've seen all sorts of things. It's good to know you have such a strong understanding of anatomy and physiology. So, even though you're generally feeling well, your daughter encouraged you to come in. Is there anything specific she was worried about, or anything you've noticed lately, even if it's small, that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Small? She makes a mountain out of a molehill, that girl. She said my… my walking wasn't right. Said I was shuffling. Shuffling! As if I haven't earned a little shuffle after all these years. It’s just…getting older, I suppose. And the arthritis, naturally. It flares up now and again. But honestly, it's nothing. Really. I just want to go home and tend to my garden. The tomatoes are ripening, you know.
DOCTOR: Tomatoes ripening – sounds lovely. And it’s good to know you're still active in the garden, that’s wonderful. Okay, so your daughter noticed a change in your walking, and you’ve been dealing with some arthritis flare-ups. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little more about the arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… in my feet, mostly. And my knees. Comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s just a little ache, other times…well, other times it’s hard to get out of a chair. I used to take something for it, but it made me so drowsy. I didn't like feeling like a zombie, so I stopped. Been managing it with… well, with ignoring it, mostly. And a good hot soak now and then. Honestly, I don't need a doctor to tell me about aches and pains. I fix them for a living, remember?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, you don’t need me to tell you about aches and pains, especially with your background. It's just helpful for me to have a complete picture. So, it's mainly in your feet and knees, comes and goes, and you used to take medication that made you drowsy. You’re currently managing it with rest and hot soaks. Now, about the walking… Your daughter mentioned shuffling. Have you noticed any changes in how you walk yourself?
PATIENT: Shuffle… honestly, I hadn't really paid much attention. Maybe I take smaller steps than I used to? Everything gets a little slower when you get to be my age, dear. It's just… natural. I don't go running marathons anymore, if that's what you're thinking. And I certainly don’t have the energy to be tripping over my own feet. She worries too much, that girl. Always has.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're very self-aware, and it's perfectly normal for things to slow down with age. I appreciate you being so honest with me. Just to be thorough, and since your daughter brought it up, would you mind if I did a quick check of your gait – just watch you walk a few steps – and maybe check your balance?
PATIENT: Gait? Balance? Oh, honestly. Are you trying to make me feel like an old woman? I told you, I used to fix feet! I’ve spent my life looking at how people walk. I know when something’s off. And right now, everything feels perfectly… adequate. But fine. If it will get her off my back, I suppose. Just don’t expect me to do any leaping or twirling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no leaping or twirling required, Wynell! I promise. It’s just a quick observation, nothing strenuous. And I completely respect your expertise – I just want to make sure everything is as “adequate” as you say. If you’re comfortable, let's just walk a few steps towards that wall over there. No need to rush. And then we can do a simple balance test, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Baseline? Honestly. This is getting ridiculous. Fine. Just… try not to stare. And don’t expect me to be graceful. I haven’t been graceful since…well, probably never. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wynell, just walk at your normal pace. I'm just observing. “Patient ambulates with slightly shorter steps and reduced arm swing. There is a mild shuffling gait and a slight forward lean. No visible signs of pain or instability at this time.” Alright, that's good. Now, if you're comfortable, let's just stand with your feet together, and I'll gently let go of your arm to check your balance. Just for a few seconds. Are you steady on your feet?
PATIENT: Steady? Of course, I’m steady! I haven't fallen yet, have I? This is all rather… unnecessary, you know. But fine. Do whatever you have to do. Just…be careful. I don't want to end up on the floor.
DOCTOR: “Patient exhibits mild sway when standing with feet together, but maintains balance with minimal support. No immediate risk of falls observed.” Okay, that's good. Just a little wobble, which is pretty common. Alright, Wynell, you can go ahead and sit back down. That was great. Just getting a little baseline information. Now, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands?
PATIENT: Numbness? Tingling? No. Not particularly. Sometimes my feet get cold, especially in the winter. But that’s just… old age. And bad circulation. It's nothing to worry about. Honestly, I feel like I’m being put under a microscope. All this poking and prodding… It’s exhausting. I just want a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It does feel like a lot sometimes, and I apologize if it feels like I’m being overly thorough. I just want to be sure we’re not missing anything. Okay, so no numbness or tingling, just some cold feet occasionally. Now, one last question about your general health. Have you had any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Oh, it's not what it used to be, dear. Everything gets a little blurry around the edges, you know? I have to hold things closer to read. And the night vision…well, let's just say I don't drive at night anymore. It’s just part of getting old. I’ve always been a little nearsighted, honestly. Never needed to make a fuss about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some blurry vision and difficulty with night vision – that's pretty common with age, as you said. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any major medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… my blood pressure used to run a little high, years ago. The doctor put me on a pill for that, but it made me feel dreadful, so I stopped taking it. And my knees… they’ve always been troublesome. Arthritis, naturally. Oh, and I had a hysterectomy, back in… well, a long time ago. Other than that, I’ve been fairly lucky, I suppose. I’ve always been a strong woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and a hysterectomy. Did you have any complications after the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Complications? Hmm. Not that I recall. It was a long time ago, dear. They just… took it out. And I went home. It was unpleasant, of course, but I recovered. I was a strong woman, remember? I bounced back quickly. Honestly, I don't dwell on these things. It's in the past. Worrying about the past doesn't do anyone any good.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known complications from the hysterectomy. Now, are you currently taking any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I told you, I don't like taking pills. They make me feel awful. Supplements… well, sometimes I take a little vitamin D in the winter. But that’s it. Just a little something to keep the bones strong. My daughter keeps telling me I should take all sorts of things, but I refuse. I prefer to rely on good food and a bit of sunshine.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little vitamin D occasionally. And you prefer a natural approach to health. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I wanted. Never had a problem. Except for shellfish, maybe. But I haven’t eaten shellfish in years, so it doesn’t matter. Honestly, I think people make too much fuss about allergies these days. When I was a girl, we ate everything! No one worried about a little peanut here or a little shellfish there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, except for shellfish. That’s good to know. Alright, Wynell, we’ve covered a lot of ground. Let me summarize what I’ve gathered… You’re an 83-year-old female with a history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and a hysterectomy. You’re currently not taking any medications, except for occasional vitamin D, and you have no known allergies, except for shellfish. You mentioned some changes in your walking, blurry vision, and difficulty with night vision. Your daughter brought you in because she was concerned about your gait. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing some normal age-related changes, but some of your symptoms, like the changes in your gait and vision, warrant further investigation. I recommend we do a few simple tests, including a blood pressure check, a vision test, and a basic neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, I’m getting exhausted just thinking about it. But… alright. If it will get my daughter off my back, I suppose. But no needles! I absolutely refuse any needles. And make it quick. I have tomatoes to tend to.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise! We can absolutely avoid any needles. And I’ll make it as quick as possible. It should only take about 30 minutes. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Then, we can do a quick vision test right here in the room. And finally, I’ll just ask you to do a few simple exercises to assess your balance and coordination. Let’s start with the blood pressure. If you could just relax your arm for me…
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But gently, please. I bruise easily, you know. And hurry, please. The sun won’t wait for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing your arm… that’s good. “Blood pressure is 142/88. Slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. We’ll monitor this.” Alright, blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can keep an eye on it. Now, let's do a quick vision test. I have a simple chart here with some letters on it. Can you read the top line for me?
PATIENT: Let me see… It's blurry, dear, very blurry. U… M… H… I think. Is that right? It's hard to make them out. Honestly, I told you my vision isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is blurry, and that's perfectly normal with age. And you did a good job reading those letters. Let's try a slightly larger size. Okay, can you read the top line now?
PATIENT: E… P… T… It's still very difficult, dear. It's like looking through a fog. I used to be able to read anything, you know. Anything at all. But now… it's just getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, it sounds like your vision has definitely declined, and that’s something we should address. It's good you're noticing these changes. I recommend a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist. They can determine the exact cause of your vision loss and recommend appropriate treatment, such as glasses or other corrective measures. Now, let’s move on to the neurological exam. Just a few simple exercises to assess your balance and coordination. If you could stand up for me, when you’re ready…
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But no funny business, dear. I don't do gymnastics anymore, you know. And try to be gentle. I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: No funny business at all, I promise. I’m just here to make sure you’re steady. Let’s start with a simple test. If you could just stand with your feet together, and close your eyes, if you’re comfortable. Don't worry, I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh dear… I don't like this. I feel very unsteady. Are you sure you'll catch me? This is a terrible idea. I knew I shouldn't have come.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Wynell. Just relax, and I’ll be right here. It's okay to feel unsteady. I've got you. “Patient exhibits mild unsteadiness when standing with eyes closed, requiring moderate support. No falls observed.” Okay, let’s open your eyes now. That’s good. It's perfectly normal to feel unsteady with your eyes closed. Now, let's try a simple heel-to-toe walking test. If you could just walk a few steps forward, placing the heel of one foot directly in front of the toes of the other foot.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But slowly, dear. Very slowly. And don't let go! This is ridiculous. I feel like a toddler learning to walk. See? This is what happens when you poke and prod an old woman.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Wynell. Just take your time. It's perfectly normal to feel a little unsteady. "Patient exhibits slightly wider base of support and some difficulty with heel-to-toe walking. Demonstrates some hesitancy and requires minimal assistance." Okay, let's stop here. That's good. You did a great job. Alright, Wynell, based on my examination today, I recommend we address a few things. First, I want you to schedule a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist to evaluate your vision loss. Second, I recommend a physical therapy consultation to help improve your balance and coordination. And third, we should monitor your blood pressure regularly. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, more appointments? More poking and prodding? Honestly, it’s exhausting just thinking about it. But fine. If it will get my daughter off my back, I suppose. But no needles! And make sure they're gentle. I don't want any unpleasant surprises. And try to be quick, dear. I have tomatoes to tend to. They won't pick themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise! And I’ll make sure they know to be gentle. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to make the process as comfortable as possible. Here are the referrals for the ophthalmologist and the physical therapist. Their contact information and addresses are on this paper. I’ll also give you a prescription for a blood pressure monitor so you can check your blood pressure at home. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I suppose that’s all for now. But listen, dear… don't expect me to come back for any more poking and prodding unless absolutely necessary. I'm a strong woman, and I know my own body. I’ve lived a long life, and I'm not going to let doctors tell me what's wrong with it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have tomatoes to tend to. They're very demanding, you know. Thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. You’re absolutely right to trust your instincts and listen to your body. I’m glad I could help, and I wish you all the best with your tomatoes. If you have any concerns or questions, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your garden! .
PATIENT: .
