DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I am Dr. Yackey. I see here you’re twenty-four years of age. Rather young to be needing a family physician, frankly. Now, please, state the reason for your visit today. And try to be concise; my schedule is…demanding.
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I don’t usually need a family physician. It’s just… there's a history, alright? My mother's side… things just happen. I want to make sure I don't end up like them. It’s preventative, you see? Better safe than sorry, especially with… well, everything.
DOCTOR: “Things just happen.” Vague. Terribly vague. And “everything” is hardly a clinical presentation, Mr. Theriot. This isn’t a parlor game. To assist you – and, frankly, to utilize my time efficiently – I require specifics. Can you elaborate on what, precisely, has been “happening” in your family history?
PATIENT: Okay, look. It’s… complicated. There was my grandmother, she had… something with her heart. Then my aunt, she had some kind of… cancer, I think. And my uncle… he was always sick. Just… falling apart. Lots of hospital visits. It was always something. They never really explained it properly to us kids, you know? Just… “He’s not well.” That’s all. It’s just… I don’t want to end up like that. Is that specific enough for you?
DOCTOR: “Something with her heart,” “some kind of cancer,” “always sick.” Yes, exceptionally unhelpful. I understand familial concern is…common, but this level of imprecision hinders any meaningful assessment. Do you have any medical records from these relatives?
PATIENT: Records? No. Not that I know of. It was… a long time ago, and like I said, they didn’t really talk about it much. It was more… whispered conversations and worried looks. My mother didn’t really keep things like that. She… wasn’t very organized, to put it mildly. I doubt she even had the records. Honestly, it was mostly just… a feeling. A bad feeling.
DOCTOR: A “bad feeling” is not a diagnosis, Mr. Theriot. We operate on facts here, not…intuition. Very well. Let's start with you. Have you experienced any health problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get the occasional cold, like anyone else. I've always been pretty healthy, actually. I eat alright, I try to exercise... I'm a teacher, you know? Gotta keep up with the kids. No chronic issues, no major surgeries, nothing like that. I just... worry. That's all. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Worry is a human emotion, Mr. Theriot, not a medical complaint. However, given your…familial anxieties, a baseline examination is warranted. Let’s begin with your vital signs. Have you taken your temperature recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t taken my temperature recently. Why would I? I don’t feel sick. Look, I appreciate you wanting to be thorough, but I really just want reassurance, you know? That I’m not… doomed, like the rest of them.
DOCTOR: Reassurance is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation, Mr. Theriot. And frankly, this level of…resistance is unproductive. Very well. We’ll proceed with a basic physical exam. Please step onto the scale. And I will need a full listing of any medications you are currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements… everything. Do not omit anything.
PATIENT: Fine. I don’t take anything. Not even vitamins. I’m twenty-four, Doctor, not eighty. And I don't see why I need to list things I don't take, but alright. It’s just… a waste of my time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Sixty kilograms… rather lean for your height, but not necessarily concerning. Now, please, remove your shoes and socks. We’ll begin with a neurological assessment. I require you to follow my finger with your eyes. Do not blink.
PATIENT: This is ridiculous. I'm a teacher, not a… a science experiment. But fine. Do what you need to do. I just hope this doesn't take too long. It's hard to stare at something without blinking, you know.
DOCTOR: Your pupillary response appears…normal. Though your blinking is excessive, as you pointed out. Now, I need you to grip my fingers as firmly as you can. I am assessing your muscle strength. Squeeze. And do not let go prematurely.
PATIENT: There. Happy? I'm squeezing. It's not like I'm going to be lifting cars or anything. I teach English, not construction. I'm pretty sure my muscles are fine.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is…adequate. Now, if you'll allow me to listen to your heart and lungs, please. Please lie back on the examination table. And breathe normally. Do not hold your breath. It complicates matters.
PATIENT: Fine. But if you find anything wrong, don't act surprised. I told you my family… it’s just a whole mess. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Respiratory rate is within normal limits. Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Pulse is 72. Generally unremarkable. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No. None of that. Like I said, I feel fine. This is just… preventative, remember? You said it yourself, unremarkable. That's good, right? So can we just… be done here?
DOCTOR: Unremarkable is… satisfactory, given your… anxieties. However, given your family history, a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count are warranted. It's simply prudent to establish a baseline. We'll draw some blood now. The phlebotomist is through there. And please, try to relax. Your elevated anxiety is complicating this assessment.
PATIENT: Blood work? Seriously? I came here for reassurance, not a whole battery of tests! This is exactly what I was afraid of. I suppose… I suppose I have no choice. Fine. Let's just get it over with. This whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist will explain the procedure. I will review the results when they become available. And, Mr. Theriot, perhaps a referral to a mental health professional would be beneficial. Your…persistent anxieties appear to be significantly impacting your overall well-being. .
PATIENT: A mental health professional? Are you serious? This is because of my family! It's not a problem with me, it’s a problem with them! .
