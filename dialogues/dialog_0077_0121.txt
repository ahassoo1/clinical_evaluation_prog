DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. My name is Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit. I want to get this over with quick, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pipolo. I understand. We'll get through this as efficiently as possible. “Dry eyes,” you say. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… a few weeks, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Time gets away from me. Longer when it's windy, I think. We had some bad wind last month.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, and it seems worse with the wind. Alright. And would you describe it as a burning sensation, a gritty feeling, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Gritty, yeah. Like… sand in 'em. Especially when I wake up. Makes it hard to see clear first thing. Not so much a burn, just… uncomfortable. Real uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Gritty" is a good description. And it's most noticeable upon waking?
PATIENT: Yep. And when I'm workin' outside. Cement dust, you know. Doesn’t help none. I don’t wear nothin’ over my eyes when I'm pourin’ concrete. Never did. Thought I was tough enough. Maybe I'm not.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any redness, discharge, or blurry vision at other times of the day, besides when you wake up and after working with cement?
PATIENT: Redness… sometimes. Not real bad. Blurry? No, not really blurry. Just feels… strained. Like I gotta blink a lot. Gotta keep 'em wet, you know? I try to blink more. Don't always help. And no discharge, nothin' comin' out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes to your overall vision, or have you had any injuries to your eyes in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? No, not that I remember. Worked with cement fifty years, haven't gotten anything in my eyes. Lucky, I guess. Vision… no, feels the same, just… drier. Everything's clear enough. I can still see the price of fish at the market, that's what matters. But it's gettin' harder to read the signs sometimes, but that's just… old age, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand. And are you currently using any eye drops, artificial tears, or any other medications for your eyes?
PATIENT: Nope. Never used nothin'. Always thought I could tough it out. My grandpa, he never used nothin'. Just blinked a lot. But things are different now, I guess. Getting old ain’t for sissies.
DOCTOR: No, it certainly isn't. Well, let's take a quick look at your eyes, Mr. Pipolo. It'll just be a brief examination to help determine the cause of the dryness. If you could please have a seat, I’ll be right with you.
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Get it over with. Hurry it up, please. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I will be as quick as possible. Now, if you could just look straight ahead… Excellent. Hmm… I do see some dryness of the conjunctiva, which is the clear tissue over the white part of your eye. And your tear film appears a little thin. No obvious signs of infection or injury. Your eyelids seem to be functioning normally. I'm also noting some mild redness, as you mentioned.
PATIENT: Thin tear film, huh? Sounds bad. Is that serious? You gonna have to put somethin’ in ‘em? I don’t like stuff in my eyes.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Mr. Pipolo, but it does explain your symptoms. A thin tear film simply means your eyes aren’t producing enough lubrication. And yes, I would recommend using artificial tears, at least initially, to help relieve the dryness and protect your eyes. They’re available over the counter, and come in many different formulations. We can start with a basic preservative-free option, which is usually well-tolerated. They don’t typically cause any discomfort, and many patients find them very helpful. Would you be willing to try those?
PATIENT: Over the counter? So I gotta buy somethin’? Just to make my eyes wet? Seems like a waste of money. But… if it gets rid of the gritty feelin’… alright. Fine. But don’t give me nothin’ fancy. Cheapest one you got. And tell me how often to put ‘em in. I ain’t gonna read a whole instruction manual.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. We’ll stick with a simple, affordable option. I’m recommending Systane Basic, it’s a widely available and effective brand. You should use one to two drops in each eye, as needed, usually every few hours when you experience dryness. Start with that, and if it doesn't provide enough relief, we can explore other options. It's important to use them regularly, even when your eyes feel comfortable, to help maintain lubrication. Are you able to follow those instructions?
PATIENT: One to two drops… few hours… okay. Don’t tell me to use ‘em “as needed” all the time, I ain’t got time for that. A few times a day. Morning, afternoon, maybe before bed. That’s it. Is that enough? Can I go now? I gotta go check my crab pots. Tides changin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pipolo, that is perfectly reasonable. Morning, afternoon, and before bed is a good starting point. We can adjust the frequency as needed. And yes, you are free to go now. Here's a brief summary of the recommendations, including the Systane Basic and the recommended frequency. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can consider other options. And if you experience any sudden changes in vision, pain, or discharge, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Nope. That’s it. Just get rid of the gritty feelin’. And don’t make me come back. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. I hope the artificial tears provide relief. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and good luck with your crab pots!
