DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s… really bad. Worse than usual. I got cancer, you see, and the back pain... it comes and goes, but right now, it’s just a lot. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain, and it's related to your cancer treatment, it sounds like?
PATIENT: Yes. They told me the cancer… it spread to my bones, the doctors in the city. That's what they said. And the pain… it feels different this time. Like… deeper? Hard to explain. It doesn't go away when I move, not like before.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Deeper" is helpful. And it’s consistently there, even with movement?
PATIENT: Yes, consistently. Usually, if I shift my weight or lie down a certain way, it gets a little better. But now… nothing really helps much. Even resting doesn't do it. It's been like this for… maybe three days now? I lost track a little. It just keeps getting worse, and I got scared.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days of worsening pain despite your usual methods of relief. Do you have any other symptoms along with the back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no… feeling sick to my stomach. I’m just tired, always tired, but that’s from the… treatments, I think. Oh! My legs feel a little… numb sometimes. Not all the time, just… a tingling, like when you sit wrong. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the tingling in your legs. It could be important. And the tiredness we can attribute to the treatments, but we need to rule everything out. Can you tell me exactly where in your back the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: It’s… low down. Right at the bottom of my back, where it curves. And it goes around to my side a little, on both sides, but mostly on the right. It's hard to point, because it kind of… spreads. But if I had to pick one spot… right at the base of my spine, where it feels… achy, and sharp sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, low back, base of the spine, radiating around to both sides, worse on the right. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you lie down on your back for me on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. I can do that. It’s a little high, but I’ll manage. Just let me know if you need me to move a certain way.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I'm going to gently press on different areas of your back. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful, and where. I'll start right here... How about here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! That one. Right there. That's where it hurts the most. Like a sharp ache, and it kind of… goes down my leg a little when you push there. Not bad, but I feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about if I have you bend forward a little, towards your knees?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… not good. It hurts a lot when I do that. Like something is… pulling. And the pain goes all the way down my leg, both legs now. I can't go very far. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful information. And confirms my suspicions. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Could you point your toes up, and then down for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I can do that. Like this? It's… a little hard to move them. They feel… heavy. Like I have to really try. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay. And now can you try to lift your right leg straight up while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s hard. I can’t lift it very high. It… hurts. And it feels weak. I can’t keep it straight, it kind of bends on its own. It's not working right. Is it… the cancer? I’m scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. I understand your concern. Based on the exam, and what you've told me, it sounds like the pain is likely related to the cancer affecting your spine, possibly causing some compression on the nerves. This is why you're experiencing the pain radiating down your legs and the weakness. I need to order some imaging – an MRI of your spine – to confirm this. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a stronger pain medication to help manage the discomfort. However, given the weakness, I'm concerned about potential nerve damage, and I want you to see a specialist – an oncologist with expertise in spinal metastases. I’ll give you a referral to one in the city. Do you have transportation to get to the city for an appointment?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. That sounds… serious. And a specialist… that sounds even more serious. Transportation… no. Not really. My son, he used to take me, but… we don’t talk much anymore. I can take the bus, I guess, but it's a long ride. And I’m not sure I can with the pain. Will they… will they do something? Or just tell me it's bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of what's happening, and the oncologist will be able to discuss all your treatment options, which may include radiation, surgery, or other therapies. It's important to have a specialist’s opinion. Let me see if we can arrange transportation for you through the clinic’s patient assistance program. We can also explore options for financial assistance for travel and lodging. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for the pain medication and muscle relaxant. Take them as directed, and please call my office if you experience any side effects. I also want you to watch for any new or worsening weakness in your legs, or any problems with bladder or bowel control, and come to the emergency room immediately if that happens. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Bladder or bowel… oh dear. I… I haven’t noticed anything like that yet. Okay, the patient assistance program… that would be… really good. Thank you. I… I guess I’m just scared. It’s all happening so fast. Will… will this medicine help me sleep? I haven't been sleeping well, with the pain and… everything. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Like, for the pain? Anything at home?
DOCTOR: Yes, the muscle relaxant can often help with sleep, as it has a calming effect. However, if it doesn't, we can discuss other options. For the pain at home, gentle stretching and low-impact exercises – like walking for short periods if you're able – can sometimes help, but don’t push yourself. Heat packs or ice packs can also provide some relief. But be very careful and listen to your body. I'm glad you asked. I’ll also have the nurse give you some information on pain management techniques and local support groups. I’m going to write up these orders and referrals now. Do you have any other immediate concerns or questions before I finish?
