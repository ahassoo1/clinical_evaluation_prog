DOCTOR: Right. Jaylyne Dhanoa, 27 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hi. It’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying me for a bit now. Not sure what’s causing it, that’s why I thought I’d come see you.
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. Vague. How long exactly is "a bit now?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe, like, three weeks? It started after a really loud party, I think. It’s not constant, it comes and goes, but when it’s there, it’s hard to ignore. Mostly just a high-pitched whine, you know?
DOCTOR: A loud party. Of course. And has anything else been going on?
PATIENT: Not really… just work, you know? Waitressing is pretty busy this time of year. And… well, my divorce was finalized a few months ago, so that’s been… stressful. But I don’t think that’s causing the ringing, if that makes sense. Just trying to be honest about everything.
DOCTOR: Stress. Always stress. Any hearing loss before this party?
PATIENT: Uh, not that I know of. I mean, I work in a pretty noisy restaurant, lots of chatter and music, so maybe a little over time? But nothing major, I don’t think. I can usually hear fine. Never needed hearing aids or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Not really... Sometimes I feel a little dizzy when it's really bad, but that doesn't happen often. And, honestly, I’ve just been tired a lot lately, but I figure that's just from working so much and, you know… everything else. It’s hard to say what’s the ringing and what's just me being run down.
DOCTOR: Dizzy, tired… very helpful. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Just the normal stuff, like when I get a cold. Nothing regularly. Oh, and I used to take something for anxiety a few years back, but I stopped when I started seeing a therapist. I haven't taken it in ages, though. Maybe a year? More? I'd have to check.
DOCTOR: Therapist. Of course. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty good with most things, I think. My mum always said I had a strong stomach. Not sure if that helps!
DOCTOR: Let's move on to a quick exam. I'm going to take a look in your ears, and we'll do a basic hearing test, just to rule out anything obvious. Please remain still during the examination.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Whatever you need. I just want this ringing to stop, honestly. It’s really distracting.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tympanic membranes appear normal bilaterally. No obvious signs of infection or blockage. Weber is midline. Rinne is positive bilaterally. Basic hearing seems intact. This is… frustrating.
PATIENT: Frustrating for you, right? Because you can’t find anything wrong? I feel like I’m going crazy sometimes, thinking it’s all in my head. What does this even mean? Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: It means… it could be a number of things. Often, this is simply temporary tinnitus, related to noise exposure. Sometimes, it resolves on its own. But… given your history of stress and the divorce, we can't completely rule out other factors. We will need to look into it further. I’m going to order a baseline audiometry test. And I’m also going to refer you to an ENT specialist. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay, that… sounds like a lot. An ENT specialist? Is that… serious? I just want to know why my ears are ringing, you know? And if it's going to go away. Will the test tell me if there’s something really wrong?
DOCTOR: "Something really wrong" is a rather dramatic way of putting it. The ENT specialist will perform more comprehensive hearing tests and assess for any underlying causes. The audiometry test will give us a better idea of the extent of any hearing loss. Honestly, most likely it's just your ears reacting to noise and stress. But it’s best to be cautious. Here are the referrals and test orders. Follow up with the ENT within two weeks. We’ll review the results then. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay... two weeks. Alright. I guess that's… something. No, I think that's all for now. Just… try not to stress too much, right? That’s what you're saying? It’s hard though. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, it's just noise. .
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Try to manage your stress. And follow up with the specialist. That is all. .
