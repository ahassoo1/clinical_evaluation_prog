DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor… Billman, is it? Yes, well, it’s… this drug test thing. Medicare said I needed it. Honestly, I don't really remember why exactly. Something about… keeping my benefits? It all feels a bit fuzzy, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. A Medicare-required drug test. Well, those can be… a nuisance. Look, Ms. Hughston, with all due respect, it's your responsibility to understand why you're being asked to do these things. But alright, we can get this done. Do you have any idea when they told you about this?
PATIENT: Oh dear, when… hmm. Not a clue, really. Maybe a letter? I get so much mail. Bills, mostly. And those… those charity requests. I usually just have Marie, my neighbor, sort through it with me. She’s good with that sort of thing. I don't recall anything specifically about a test. Honestly, it could have been last week, or… even before that. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is it a big deal?
DOCTOR: Well, it can be, if you don't comply with Medicare’s requirements. Look, Ms. Hughston, I'm not going to grill you about it, but it’s important. It’s to make sure your prescriptions are legitimate and… well, that you’re using them appropriately. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… yes. Let me think. I take something for my… my arthritis. In my hands, mostly. And… something for my blood pressure, I believe. Little white pills. I get them refilled every month, usually. The pharmacy handles most of it, thankfully. I don’t really keep track of the names, you see. It's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see if we can pull up your medication list. Okay, here we are. You're on Lisinopril for your blood pressure, 20mg daily, and… Naproxen for your arthritis. Do you take anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, Naproxen, yes! That's the one. And Lisinopril... sounds right. Hmm... No, I don't think so. Not that I recall, anyway. Sometimes I take a little something for sleep, when I’m really restless, but Marie usually gives me that. It's… a small blue pill, I think? But that’s not a regular thing, just now and then. Definitely not every day. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be. Look, Ms. Hughston, this is why it’s important to know everything you’re taking, even if it’s just occasionally. A small blue pill… could be a lot of things. Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dosage? No, not a clue. Marie just… hands it to me, and I take it. She knows what I need, she's always been very good with these things. It's a tiny pill, though. Very small. I really don't pay attention to the details, I just try to get a good night's sleep. I apologize for not being more helpful. It’s just… a lot to keep track of when you’re my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we're going to proceed with the drug test as requested by Medicare. It's a standard urine test, and it's important to be honest about everything you've taken, even if you don't remember specifics. The lab will send the results to me, and we'll discuss them. Before we do that, though, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine test… alright. And a physical exam, yes, that sounds… sensible, I suppose. Yes, that's perfectly alright. I hope I'm not too much trouble. I’m not very good with… needles, or anything complicated. But a quick look-over, yes, that's fine. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, we’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we’ll do a brief neurological exam - just checking your reflexes and balance. And finally, we'll collect the urine sample. It's a fairly straightforward process. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Oh, right. Blood pressure. Here you go, Doctor. Be gentle, please? I bruise easily, you know. It's a terrible thing, getting old. All sorts of things go wrong.
DOCTOR: I will be, Ms. Hughston. Perfectly gentle. … 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is 78, regular. Alright. Now, if you could just lean forward a bit, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths, please.
PATIENT: Okay, here you go, Doctor. I haven’t been feeling entirely myself lately, if I’m honest. A bit… breathless, sometimes. And a little dizzy. But I just thought it was my age. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lobes. And your breathing is a little labored. It's not necessarily normal, Ms. Hughston. It could be a number of things – a mild respiratory infection, or possibly something more. Take another deep breath… and exhale. Alright. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you sit on the edge of the table, please?
PATIENT: Here I am, Doctor. I'm not very good at… balancing, you know. My knees aren't what they used to be. Please be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s check these reflexes… … Both reflexes are a little diminished, Ms. Hughston. Not dramatically, but noticeable. And as you mentioned, your balance seems a bit off. Alright. Now, before we collect the urine sample, I need to ask you about any recent changes in your medications or any new symptoms you’ve experienced. You mentioned feeling breathless and dizzy. Has that been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh dear, everything seems to be going wrong today! Breathless and dizzy… yes. It comes and goes, I think. Worse when I… when I exert myself, maybe? Like when I’m gardening. Or walking up the stairs. It's just a bit of a… fluttering feeling, really. And sometimes I feel a little… confused. Not all the time, just… now and then. It's hard to explain. Marie says it's probably just my age, too. She's very sensible, my Marie. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Hughston, several things could be contributing to these symptoms. The diminished reflexes, the wheezing, the breathlessness, the dizziness, and the confusion… it's concerning enough to warrant further investigation. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. And I want you to see a neurologist for a thorough evaluation of your balance and cognitive function. Before we proceed with the urine test, could you tell me who prescribed the small blue pill you occasionally take for sleep?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the small blue pill… Marie, I think. Yes, she definitely gave it to me. She gets her medications from… from her doctor, I believe. She said it would help me sleep. I don’t remember the doctor’s name, or anything about it, really. She just handed it to me, and I took it. She always knows what’s best. Is that… is that alright, Doctor? It wasn’t a prescription for me, specifically…
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, it is never alright to take medication that wasn’t specifically prescribed to you by a licensed physician. You’re putting your health at serious risk. Taking someone else’s medication can have dangerous consequences, and it complicates matters significantly. I need you to be completely honest with me. Have you been taking any other medications or supplements that you haven’t told me about?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I… I didn’t realize it was so serious. I just… I just wanted to sleep. Marie also gave me something for my… for my arthritis. A yellow pill, I think. She said it was stronger than what the doctor prescribed. It seemed to help the pain, so I took it. Just a few, when my hands were really aching. I didn't mean to do anything wrong, Doctor. I just… I trust Marie. She always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, this is a very serious situation. You’ve been taking medication prescribed to someone else, and you haven’t disclosed all of the medications you’ve been taking to your physician. This is not only dangerous, but it also makes it extremely difficult for me to provide you with appropriate care. I’m concerned about the possibility of a drug interaction, and I strongly advise you to stop taking all medications that weren't specifically prescribed to you. Before we proceed with the urine test, I need to document everything you’ve told me. And I’m going to order an immediate toxicology screen. This isn’t about trust, Ms. Hughston. It’s about your health and safety. And right now, you’ve put yourself in a very vulnerable position. Now, if you'll please follow me to the restroom, we can collect the urine sample. Then, we'll discuss the next steps. .
