DOCTOR: Right then, Mr. Jezik. Lyman, is it?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, Lyman. That’s right. Look, doc, I haven’t got all day, you know? Just… what can you do about this shaking? It’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: Shaking, you say. And it’s interfering with your daily life, I presume?
PATIENT: Interfering? Well, I used to be able to… hold a wrench pretty steady, working at the plant. Now… not so much. Dropping things, spilling coffee… it’s a nuisance, mostly. A big nuisance. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy," alright. And is this shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… mostly comes, I think. Hard to say for sure. Seems worse when I'm trying to do something… precise. Like, if I try to write, or… well, like I said, with the wrench. Just sitting… not so bad. But then again, maybe it is always there and I just don't notice. Honestly, doc, my memory isn't what it used to be. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll try to piece things together. And don’t apologize for your memory; it’s perfectly normal at your age. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get tired easier, I suppose. But I’ve always been a bit tired. And… my hands feel kinda stiff sometimes, especially in the mornings. That’s about all I can think of. I haven’t fallen or anything. Just… the shaking and the tiredness. Is that something serious? I really don’t want to end up in one of those homes, you know?
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings… and tiredness. Alright. And has this stiffness been present for a long time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Recent, I think. Or, well, more recent than the shaking, anyway. The shaking… been going on for… oh, I don't know. A year? Maybe longer. The stiffness… a few months, maybe six. It’s hard to keep track. I used to have a good routine at the plant, kept me regular, but since I… well, since I stopped working… everything’s gotten mixed up. Is this about my pension or something? I get worried about things like that.
DOCTOR: No, no, this isn't about your pension, Mr. Jezik. We're focusing on your health right now. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant… Hmm. Let me think. I had the flu a few times, broken a bone or two when I was a kid, nothing major. The doctor at the plant… he gave me something for my blood pressure, years ago. But I don’t remember what it was called, or even why I needed it. Just… pills. And then I stopped going to the doctor, really. Didn’t see much point. Is this going to cost me a lot of money? I don't have insurance, you see. .
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history to speak of. We’ll proceed as best we can. Now, any family history of… shaking, neurological problems, or anything similar?
