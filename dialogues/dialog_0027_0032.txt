DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… rather bothersome, actually. A most unpleasant issue, if I may be frank. There's… a discharge. Yes, a discharge. From… down there. It’s been happening for a bit now, and my wife insisted I come in. Honestly, at my age… it’s just… undignified. I can’t quite recall when it started, precisely. Perhaps a week? Two? Time does seem to slip away these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly alright. These things happen, and you’re doing the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. It takes courage to discuss these issues. A discharge, you say?
PATIENT: Courage? Nonsense. It’s simply…practical. One doesn’t want things worsening, does one? Though I confess, I’m not entirely certain what would constitute ‘worsening’ in this instance. It's… a bit watery, if you must know. And… well, it smells. Not terribly, mind you, but… noticeable. Is that helpful? I apologize for the bluntness, but one must be thorough, shouldn’t one?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. Watery and with an odor… Alright. And is there any pain, burning, or itching associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. No, not precisely pain. A slight… discomfort, perhaps. A bit of stinging now and then, particularly after… well, after using the facilities. And… I don’t believe I’ve experienced any itching. No, not at all. Though… my skin does tend to be sensitive these days. Everything feels a bit… raw, generally. Is that relevant? I don’t want to burden you with irrelevant details, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, not a burden at all, Mr. Krok. Sensitivity is good to know. Okay, so no pain, slight stinging after urination, no itching, just sensitivity and a watery discharge with an odor. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no. I haven’t felt a fever in decades. And chills… well, it is a bit cool in here, if I may say so. But that’s hardly a chill, Doctor. As for abdominal pain… no, I don’t believe so. My stomach has been a bit… unsettled lately, but that’s probably just the peaches my wife insisted on buying. They were rather tart, you see. Lower abdominal pain specifically… no, nothing of note. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine, aside from this. It’s just… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. No fever, no chills, no abdominal pain, just the discharge and some sensitivity. Now, have you had any changes in your urinary habits – frequency, urgency, difficulty urinating, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Certainly not! Goodness me, no. I haven’t seen a drop of blood. As for frequency… well, one goes when one needs to go, doesn't one? I suppose I’ve been getting up once or twice during the night, but that's just… old age, Doctor. As for urgency or difficulty… no, nothing out of the ordinary. Everything functions… adequately. Honestly, all this questioning… is this truly necessary? It feels rather… intrusive. I’m an old man with a bit of a discharge, not a… a specimen.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Mr. Krok. I apologize if it feels intrusive. It’s important for me to gather as much information as possible to understand what's going on and make sure we rule out anything serious. I wouldn’t ask unless it was necessary. I understand your discomfort. Now, just one or two more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any new sexual partners recently?
PATIENT: Sexual partners? At my age? Doctor, with all due respect! That is… utterly preposterous! I’ve been married to the same woman for fifty-seven years! Fifty-seven! Do I look like a man with new sexual partners? The very suggestion is… insulting! Honestly, I find this line of questioning quite inappropriate. I came here because of a medical issue, not to be subjected to… innuendo! I think I’d like to speak to someone else. This is… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Oh, Mr. Krok, I sincerely apologize! That was absolutely inappropriate of me to ask, and I truly did not mean to offend you. It was a standard question, but clearly, utterly unsuitable in your situation. Please accept my deepest apologies. I’ve gotten myself off track here. Let’s get back to basics. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a quick look to see what we’re dealing with. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well, I suppose it's unavoidable, isn't it? But I must insist on a chaperone. My wife is waiting outside, and I’d like her to be present. It's… a matter of propriety. And I trust you have clean instruments? I wouldn't want to contract anything… at my age. Honestly, Doctor, this whole experience has been… rather unsettling. But a quick exam, with a chaperone… yes, I suppose that’s acceptable. But be gentle, please. And try to keep it brief.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krok. A chaperone is perfectly reasonable, and I will absolutely make that happen. And of course, all instruments are sterilized and single-use. Your comfort and dignity are my top priorities. Let me just quickly have my nurse bring your wife in, and then we'll proceed. It will be quick and I will explain everything as I go. Nurse Patel, could you please bring Mrs. Krok in?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I trust this won't take long. This… whole situation is rather embarrassing, you see. I’ve never had to… discuss such matters with anyone outside of my wife. And even she… well, she gets flustered. So please, be discreet. And gentle, as you promised. It's… a delicate matter. I'm rather looking forward to this being over with, to be honest. .
