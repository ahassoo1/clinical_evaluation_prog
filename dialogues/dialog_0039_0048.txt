DOCTOR: Hello, Colt. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s good to meet you too, I suppose. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I’ve been…forgetful. Not that I think so, but she worries. It's these little spells, you see. I get…lost in things. Not lost lost, like wandering around, but… distracted. And I can’t always recall what I was doing just a moment ago. It's quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common for things to feel a little…off sometimes, and it's good your wife is looking out for you. It’s also quite common for family members to notice changes before we do ourselves. These "spells," as you call them… can you tell me a little more about what they're like?
PATIENT: Like… well, I’ll be in the middle of something, perfectly fine. Setting tile, usually. I've been setting tile for… oh, a lifetime, practically. And then… it's like a fog comes down. Not a bad fog, just… everything feels distant. And I have trouble remembering what I was reaching for, or why I walked into a room. It doesn’t last long, mind you. A few minutes, maybe. But it's unsettling. And then it just… lifts. Like nothing happened. My wife says I repeat myself sometimes too, but I haven't noticed. She worries too much, that woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, so these episodes happen during activity, specifically when you’re setting tile, and they involve a feeling of… detachment and trouble with your immediate memory. A few minutes is how long they last, and your wife has noticed some repetition. That's helpful to know. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it relatively new?
PATIENT: Relatively new, I’d say. Not terribly new, but not something that’s been going on for years. Maybe… six months? Seven? It’s hard to say precisely. I didn’t really pay much attention at first. Just thought I was getting tired, you know? Setting tile is hard work. But they’ve been happening more frequently lately, and that’s what finally got my wife agitated enough to make an appointment. She's a very… thorough woman. Sometimes too thorough, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six to seven months, and they're increasing in frequency. It's good she brought it to my attention. It’s always best to check these things out. Now, aside from the forgetfulness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean? Like… physical changes? No, not really. I ache a bit more than I used to, but that’s just old age, I suppose. And my eyesight isn’t what it was, but I’ve been getting glasses for years. Mentally… well, I feel as sharp as ever. Maybe a bit more easily frustrated, but that’s probably just because of these spells. Honestly, Doctor, I think my wife is making a mountain out of a molehill. She always does. But she insisted, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other noticeable physical or mental changes besides the spells and perhaps a bit of increased frustration. And you feel your overall mental sharpness is still good. I appreciate you telling me that. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any difficulty with things like speaking, walking, or understanding what people say?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I can still carry on a perfectly good conversation, as you can see. And I walk just fine, thank you very much. I still go to the job site every day! I haven't tripped or stumbled or anything like that. Speaking is… well, I’m speaking, aren’t I? My wife… she worries about everything. She thinks I’m losing my faculties, bit by bit. But I assure you, Doctor, I’m perfectly capable. It’s just these little… blips. That's all they are. Blips.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Colt. It sounds like those “blips” are the main concern, and it’s reassuring that you don’t feel any other significant changes. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back. High blood pressure, they said. They put me on some medicine for it, but I stopped taking it a while ago. Didn't like the side effects. Made me feel sluggish. The doctor warned me, of course, but I felt better off it. And I had a bad bout of the flu last winter, but everyone gets the flu, don’t they? Nothing serious. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been a healthy man. Work hard, eat simple, that's my motto. My wife keeps telling me to see a doctor more often, but I don’t see the point if I’m feeling fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, which you were previously treated for, but stopped the medication due to side effects. And a recent bout of the flu. Do you remember what the doctor said about your blood pressure when you stopped the medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was Dr. Chheng, good man. He said it was… controlled, but not perfect. He wanted me to keep taking the pills, but they made me feel awful. Tired, dizzy, just… not myself. He warned me it could go back up if I stopped, but I felt so much better off them. I was checking it myself at home for a while, with one of those machines, but it seemed fine. Not high, anyway. It's been a couple of years now, so I stopped bothering with it. Honestly, Doctor, I don't recall the exact numbers. My wife probably remembers, but she's not here. She likes to keep all the medical records.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was controlled, but not perfect when you were on medication, and you stopped due to side effects. You were monitoring it at home, and it seemed okay at that time. We'll definitely want to check your blood pressure today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been in the hospital for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. And the flu was just a bad cold, really. Didn’t even need to go in the hospital. Just stayed home, drank a lot of tea, and rested. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I avoid doctors whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself. That’s what my father always said. He lived to be ninety-five, you know. Never saw a doctor a day in his life. Just hard work and simple living. That’s the key. But my wife… she worries about everything. She's a good woman, but… she’s a worrier.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, it’s good you’ve been generally healthy, and it sounds like you take good care of yourself. Let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have any medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father, like I said, he was healthy as a horse. Lived to ninety-five. Mother… she had some trouble with her joints when she got older. Arthritis, I think. A lot of pain. My sister, she had some… sugar problems, diabetes, I believe. Nothing major, she managed it with diet. And my son... he's perfectly healthy, thank goodness. Works in an office, doesn’t do much physical labor. So, a bit of arthritis, a bit of diabetes… nothing too serious. My wife has a long list of ailments, but she’s always convinced she’s got something wrong with her. She's a hypochondriac, honestly. But that's not relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: It's all relevant, Colt, but it's good to know what's been going on with your immediate family. Now, a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one in my life. Can eat anything, take anything. I’ve always been a strong man, as I said. My wife is the one with the allergies. Dust, pollen, certain foods… she has a list as long as your arm. She has to be careful what she eats, where she goes… it’s a constant worry for her. But me? I’m fine. Strong as an ox. Never had a problem with allergies. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're asking me a lot of questions about things that aren't bothering me. I came here because my wife insisted, not because I'm feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Colt. I ask these questions to get a complete picture of your overall health. It helps me understand what might be going on. Let's just do a quick check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then we can talk about what's been happening with these spells. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with, then. But I’m telling you, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. Perfectly fine. But my wife... she wouldn't let me rest until I came here. Just get it over with, please. The sooner I'm done, the sooner I can get back to work. And the sooner my wife will stop worrying. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's get your blood pressure. Just relax your arm… and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 85. Your pulse is 72, regular. And your temperature is 98.6, normal. We’ll want to monitor this. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe deeply for me.
PATIENT: Elevated? See? I knew it. Stress. Just stress from my wife worrying about everything. And from having to come here and sit around while you poke and prod. It's always something with her. Everything is a crisis. Let’s just get it over with, please. I've got tiles to set. My lungs are fine. I work outside every day. Plenty of fresh air. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I don't need you to tell me about fresh air. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, your lungs sound clear. I’m just going to feel your abdomen now. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Tenderness? No! What are you looking for? I eat simple food. Rice, fish, vegetables. Nothing fancy. I don’t eat junk food. I'm a practical man, remember? I don't have stomach problems. Are you sure you're a real doctor? My wife probably knows more about this than you do. She reads all those medical websites. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to get annoyed. I came here to appease my wife, not to be poked and prodded like some… some experiment.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable, Colt. I’m just trying to rule out any potential issues. Everything feels normal here, no tenderness or masses. Let's talk a little more about these "spells." Can you describe one in detail?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect a detailed account. It’s not like I’m writing a novel. It’s like… I’m setting a tile, everything is going fine. I pick up a tile, I reach for the adhesive… and then… it's like a fog descends. Not a bad fog, just… distant. Like I’m watching myself from far away. I can’t remember what I was doing, why I reached for the adhesive. It's just… gone. And then, a few minutes later, it lifts. And I remember. But it’s unsettling. Like a break in the flow. It's happened several times now, while I'm working. And it's getting more frequent, which is why my wife finally dragged me here. Honestly, Doctor, I think I just need a good rest. And for my wife to stop worrying so much. That’s the real problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so these episodes happen during physical activity, specifically tile setting, and involve a feeling of detachment and temporary memory loss, lasting a few minutes. They are increasing in frequency. Given your elevated blood pressure, the history of hypertension, and these episodes, I think it's important to rule out a few possibilities. One possibility is a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, sometimes called a "mini-stroke." It can cause temporary neurological symptoms like memory loss and confusion. I want to be upfront with you, Colt. I’m not saying you are having a TIA, but given your symptoms and risk factors, it’s important to investigate further. Would you be willing to get an MRI of your brain and some blood work to help us understand what’s going on?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood work? A… a stroke? Are you serious? I feel perfectly fine! I’ve been setting tile for fifty years! I don’t have strokes! This is ridiculous. My wife… she’s been filling your head with nonsense, hasn’t she? I told you, I just need a rest. And for her to stop worrying so much. This is a waste of time and money. I’m not getting an MRI. And I’m certainly not letting you poke around in my blood. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don’t need medical tests. I need to get back to work. This is… this is outrageous! I think… I think I’m done here. I’m leaving. And tell my wife… tell her I said she’s overreacting.
DOCTOR: Colt, please, sit down. I understand you're upset, but it’s important we take this seriously. The symptoms you’re describing can be caused by a TIA, and it’s crucial to rule it out. Even if it’s not a TIA, there could be other reasons for these episodes. I’m not trying to scare you, but ignoring this could have serious consequences. I'm concerned about your blood pressure, and the episodes you’re experiencing. If you’re unwilling to get an MRI and blood work right now, I strongly recommend you see a neurologist for a second opinion. I can provide you with a referral. But please, don’t dismiss this. At the very least, I recommend strict blood pressure control, even if that means medication. Would you be willing to discuss that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Medication? You’re just trying to scare me! My wife will be thrilled. She's been wanting me to see a doctor for years. This is exactly what she wants. She's probably sitting outside right now, waiting to hear that I need a bunch of tests and pills. No. Absolutely not. I'm not taking any pills. And I'm not seeing a neurologist. I've lived a long and healthy life without them, and I'll continue to do so. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I know my body. I just need a rest. A good, long rest. And for my wife to stop nagging me. You're just trying to make money off of me. That's all this is. A waste of time, a waste of money, and a waste of my time. I'm leaving now. And I'm not coming back. She'll be so pleased... so pleased...
DOCTOR: This is not ideal… at all. I need to document everything very carefully. And I need to try to get her to understand the importance of a follow-up appointment, even if he won’t come back to me.
PATIENT: .
