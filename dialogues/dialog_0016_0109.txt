DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… the back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head that comes and goes for about three days now. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… more? Okay. Well, it doesn’t feel… sharp. Not like a bad headache you get in your forehead. It’s… deeper. And sometimes, when I turn my head, it feels… worse. Not much worse, but you notice it. I was working… with the trains, you know? Moving them around… maybe that did it? I don’t know. I’m an old man, Doctor. Things hurt.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you mention the trains – that gives me a little more information. So, it's a dull ache specifically at the back of your head, comes and goes over the last three days, and is worsened by turning your head. It’s not a sharp pain, and you noticed it started around the time you were working with the trains. Just to be thorough, can you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you’ve ever experienced?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. Let me think. It’s not the worst pain, not at all. But it’s… annoying. When it’s bad, maybe a… four? Sometimes it’s just a two, barely there. Most of the time, it’s around a three, I think. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but I feel it. Does that make sense, Doctor? I’m not good with numbers.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Brum. A three or four when it's at its worst, and generally around a three. It's bothersome but not debilitating. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… No fever, I don’t think. No dizziness. I haven't thrown up, thankfully. My vision… seems okay. Everything looks normal. I have been a little tired lately, but… I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I get tired. Maybe that’s not from the head, huh? Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, too. But that happens often. I sleep funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, dizziness, or vomiting. Vision is normal, you've been a little tired – which you attribute to age – and you sometimes experience neck stiffness. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Well, the doctor back home… he said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. But he gave me some pills, and I took them for a while. I stopped taking them a long time ago. Didn't like feeling… slow. And my knees… they bother me, but that’s just old age, right? I never had anything serious. No heart trouble, no… what do you call it… the sugar sickness? Never had that. I’ve been lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, managed with medication for a time, and you have some knee pain. No history of diabetes or heart problems. That’s good to know. And just to confirm, when you stopped taking the blood pressure medication, did your doctor discuss the risks of doing so with you?
PATIENT: Hmm… Discuss? Well, he told me to keep taking them. But I didn’t. He didn’t… make me. I just… stopped. I felt better without them. Maybe I should have listened better, but I was a stubborn old man then, too. I still am, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you stopped taking the medication against your doctor’s advice. We'll definitely want to keep that in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Never had a problem with penicillin, or anything like that. I eat everything. I like mangoes, especially. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing. My wife… she was allergic to bee stings, but I’m not.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known allergies to medications or food. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… nothing. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel strange. I tried some of those pain relievers for my knees a few years ago, but they didn’t help much, so I stopped. I just… deal with the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your neck and the back of your head. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My blood pressure… is it probably high? I haven’t had it checked in a long time.
DOCTOR: We'll find out. It's good to check. Okay, Mr. Brum, your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 150 over 90. I heard some slight crackles in your lungs, which could be due to a number of things, and your neck muscles are a little tight. The back of your head is tender to the touch, but there are no obvious signs of injury. Overall, everything appears to be relatively normal, but we will need to address your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? I feel okay. Maybe a little tired, like I said. Crackles in my lungs… that doesn’t sound good. And my neck… I knew it was tight. Always tight. What do you think is causing the headache, Doctor? Is it my neck? Or the blood pressure? Maybe it's just old age?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking these questions, Mr. Brum. Your blood pressure is higher than we’d like, and we’ll want to get that under control. The crackles in your lungs could be a sign of a few different things – it could be related to past infections, or simply a build-up of fluid. We might want to consider a chest X-ray to get a better look. As for the headache, it’s likely a combination of factors. The tightness in your neck muscles could definitely be contributing. The elevated blood pressure could also be a factor, as it can sometimes cause headaches. And of course, being 90 years old does come with its own set of aches and pains! It’s difficult to pinpoint one single cause. Given your age and medical history, I don’t think this is anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to address the blood pressure. I'm going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. If you think it’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I don’t want to be a bother. I’ve lived a long life, and I don’t want to take up too much of your time. But if you think it will help… yes, do the blood work. And the chest X-ray, too. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Brum. Taking care of you is my job, and I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep you healthy and comfortable. Okay, I'll order the blood work and a chest X-ray. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is very good. They will explain everything to you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan to manage your blood pressure and address any other concerns. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild muscle relaxant to help with the neck tightness. It’s a low dose, and we can adjust it if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… yes, that sounds good. My neck has been bothering me for a long time. Low dose is good. I don’t want to be too sleepy. And you’ll call me when the blood work comes back? I don't have anyone to drive me back and forth, you see. My wife… she always drove.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We’ll start with a very low dose of the muscle relaxant, and we can adjust it if needed. And yes, we will definitely call you as soon as the blood work results are available. We can discuss the results over the phone, and if you’d like, we can schedule another appointment to go over them in person. And I understand about your wife. We'll figure out a way to get you any necessary follow-up care. Perhaps we can arrange for a transportation service if needed. Don't worry, we'll take care of it. Now, before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And patient. I worry a lot, you see. Old habits. Thank you for listening to me. And for not laughing at me when I said my wife used to drive.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t worry about a thing. It’s perfectly normal to worry, and I'm here to listen. And there’s absolutely no need to apologize for anything – everyone has their stories. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly with the prescriptions and the paperwork for the blood work and X-ray. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was lovely meeting you.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor Maskal. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. Have a good day! .
