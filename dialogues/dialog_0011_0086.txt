DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I’m Kahrin, by the way. Hope it doesn’t take too long, I’ve got a pretty packed schedule today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kovtun. I understand. We will be as efficient as possible. Just to confirm, you are here for the results of the blood work and urine analysis we ordered on July 18th?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. July 18th. I remember exactly when – had to rearrange a whole shipment schedule for that appointment. So, what’d they say? Anything I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kovtun, let’s take a look. Your complete blood count came back within normal limits, which is excellent. Your basic metabolic panel was also largely normal, with the exception of a slightly elevated creatinine level. Your urine analysis showed a trace amount of protein, but that can be attributable to a number of factors, including dehydration. Before we delve further, could you describe any changes in your urination—frequency, color, any pain or burning sensation—since the lab work?
PATIENT: Okay, good to hear the blood stuff is okay. Creatinine…is that bad? I drink a lot of water, actually. Always have. As for urination… hmm. No pain or burning. Frequency is pretty normal, I guess. Maybe a little more often if I've had a lot of coffee, but that's just me. Color is… usual. Yellow, I think. Honestly, I don’t really pay that much attention to it. Is the protein thing a big deal?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Kovtun. Elevated creatinine can indicate kidney function issues, but a single slightly elevated result isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, especially considering your high water intake, which can dilute the creatinine levels. We will need to repeat the test to confirm if it is consistently elevated. The trace amount of protein in your urine, or proteinuria, can be caused by several benign factors – stress, exercise, even dehydration. However, persistent proteinuria can indicate a kidney problem. To be thorough, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles, feet, or hands?
PATIENT: No swelling, Doctor. Not that I've noticed, anyway. I'm on my feet a lot at work, moving stuff around, so if there was a little, I probably wouldn't think much of it. Just figured it was from the job. Everything else feels… normal. I don’t really get sick, and I try to eat okay, even with the crazy hours. Are we getting closer to figuring out if I need to worry or not? I’ve got a deadline looming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Kovtun, and the need for a clear answer given your schedule. The lack of swelling is reassuring. Let’s go over some of your medical history to get a broader picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. Never had anything diagnosed, honestly. I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Family history… my grandma had something with her blood pressure, I think, but that's about it. She lived to be eighty-five, so I guess it didn't bother her too much. I don’t really keep track of all that stuff. Are we gonna need to do more tests? I really hoped we could just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for a quick answer, Ms. Kovtun. Given your age, generally good health, and the limited family history, we can proceed cautiously. However, to fully evaluate the slightly elevated creatinine and the trace protein in your urine, I recommend repeating the blood work and urine analysis in one month. This will help us determine if these findings are consistent or transient. In the meantime, it would be beneficial to monitor your fluid intake and output. Are you able to keep track of roughly how much water you drink each day, and how often you urinate?
PATIENT: Okay, one month. Fine. Better than a whole bunch of tests right now. I can definitely keep track of the water. That's easy enough – I've got a big bottle I refill all day. Urinating… I guess I can try to count, but I'm pretty busy, so I might forget a few times. Will that mess things up too much? I really just need to know if I need to worry about my kidneys, and if there's anything I need to stop doing right now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Kovtun. An exact count isn't crucial, a general estimate will suffice. We are primarily looking for significant changes in your urinary habits. For now, there’s no need to stop any of your current activities. Continue to stay well-hydrated, as you already do. I would, however, recommend avoiding excessive use of over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as prolonged use can sometimes affect kidney function. To be on the safe side, I will also provide you with a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – for a consultation. This doesn't mean we automatically suspect a serious issue, but it’s always best to have a specialist's opinion, especially with these findings. Would you like me to schedule that for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Okay, no ibuprofen, got it. That’s good to know. A specialist… hmm. I guess it can’t hurt. If you could just schedule it for me, that would be great. Saves me the hassle. What day are they available? I really need to get back to work, so the sooner the better, if possible. I'm just hoping this isn't going to turn into a whole thing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. I understand your desire for a timely appointment. Let me see… Dr. Anya Sharma has availability on August 15th at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: August 15th… yeah, that should work. Okay, good. So, that’s it? Just repeat the blood work and see the kidney doctor? No need to change anything else right now? I’ve really got a shipment to organize, so I need to get back to the office. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Kovtun. For now, it's just repeating the blood work and keeping your appointment with Dr. Sharma. I've provided a summary of the plan here, including instructions for the blood work and Dr. Sharma’s contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – changes in urination, swelling, fatigue, or any abdominal pain. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you have a productive day organizing your shipment. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to contact the office.
PATIENT: .
