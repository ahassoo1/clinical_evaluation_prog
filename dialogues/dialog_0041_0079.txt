DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks. Um, it’s my bruising. It’s just…worse lately. I’m on a blood thinner, and things just bump and I end up looking like a plum. It’s kinda scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising more easily, especially while on a blood thinner, is something we want to take seriously. It's good you're bringing it up. Let's talk about this blood thinner for a bit. How long have you been on it, and what was it prescribed for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… about two years now? It was after… a blood clot in my leg. Real bad pain, couldn’t walk on it. They said I needed to be on it for a while, to keep more from happening. I can’t remember the name of the medicine though, sorry! I just take the little pills every day.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about the name – medications can be hard to remember. Two years is a good while to be on a blood thinner. And it was prescribed for a blood clot in your leg, so we're definitely managing something important. Just to get a better picture, can you describe what a "typical" bruising episode looks like now?
PATIENT: Well, like… I bumped my arm on the counter yesterday just getting a glass of water, and there’s already a purple spot the size of my hand. It didn’t even hurt that bad, you know? Before, a bump might give me a little color, but it wouldn’t get this big. And it seems to happen more easily now, like I bruise from nothing. I’m always worried I’m gonna fall and end up… well, a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so larger bruises appearing with minimal trauma, and happening more frequently. That is a change we need to investigate. Have you noticed any bleeding in other places?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really bleeding, exactly. My gums bleed a little when I brush, but I always have, honestly. And sometimes I get a nosebleed, but that’s only when it’s really dry in the house, you know? Nothing new though, I don't think. Nothing I haven't dealt with before.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. So gums bleed a bit with brushing and occasional nosebleeds when dry, but no significant new bleeding. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take a look at your skin to assess the bruising, and check your pulse. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be quick? I have a thing later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your pulse is good and regular. And I can see the bruising on your arms and legs – it does appear more extensive than what I’d expect. I don't feel any tenderness in your abdomen. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just feels normal. You're right though, it is a lot of bruising. I try to wear long sleeves, even in the summer, to be honest. It’s kinda embarrassing. Is there anything seriously wrong? I’m worried it’s the medicine, and I’ll get another clot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re being proactive about this. It could be related to the medication, and we definitely need to investigate that possibility. However, there are other things that can cause increased bruising, so we want to rule those out too. To help us figure things out, I’d like to order some blood tests. They’ll check your blood counts, see how well your blood is clotting, and make sure there aren’t any other underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood tests are fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long to get the results. I really need to know what's going on. And… how much are the tests gonna cost? I don't have insurance, so I gotta be careful.
DOCTOR: I understand completely about the cost, and we'll do our best to keep things as affordable as possible. Let me check the pricing for you… Okay, the basic panel we need will be around \$150. There’s a slightly more comprehensive one for \$220 that would give us a bit more information, but we can start with the basic panel and add more tests if needed. We also have a payment plan option if that would be helpful. Would you prefer to start with the basic panel for \$150?
PATIENT: \$150 is… okay. I guess. As long as it gives you enough information to figure out what’s going on. I really just wanna make sure I’m not gonna end up in the hospital again. Let's do the \$150 one for now. Where do I go to get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. \$150 it is. We’ll get those ordered right away. You can go to the lab across the street, at 123 Main Street. They’re open until 5 PM today. Just bring this form with you, and they'll take care of everything. It usually takes about an hour to get the results back to us. Once I have the results, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and what our next steps will be. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. Across the street is good, easy enough. I should be able to go this afternoon. And you’ll call me, right? I don’t wanna have to keep calling you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll call you as soon as the results are in. I’ll make a note to contact you directly. You don't need to worry about calling me. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… please hurry. I really appreciate you taking this seriously. Okay. I guess I’ll go get these tests done. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your concern, and we will get to the bottom of this. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Have a good afternoon, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I call you.
