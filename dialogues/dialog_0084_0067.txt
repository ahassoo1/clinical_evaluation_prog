DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Ruocco. I'm Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s been… a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with deep breaths. I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a while. Fuzzy is alright, we’ll try to figure it out. Can you tell me where exactly you’re feeling the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… right here, in my chest. Not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like it goes into my back a little. It’s hard to say for sure. My old bones don’t tell me much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, dull ache in the chest, sometimes radiating to the back. I see. And does anything make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Well… moving around, definitely. Especially if I try to lift something. Even just… taking a big breath, like we were talking about. Sitting still is better, I suppose. But then my muscles get stiff, and that doesn’t feel too good either. It’s a bit of a catch-22, you know?
DOCTOR: I do know. So, pain with breathing and movement, relieved somewhat by rest. Have you had any cough, fever, or shortness of breath along with this pain?
PATIENT: Cough… sometimes. Not a bad cough, just… an old man’s cough. No fever that I know of. And I don't think I’m short of breath, no. I get tired easy, but that's just… getting old, isn't it? I haven't really noticed any trouble breathing specifically. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical problems – things a doctor has told you you have, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. I saw a doctor a long time ago, back when my wife was still… around. He said something about my heart, I think. Something wasn't quite right, but I don't remember the details. It was a long time ago, and I haven’t been to a doctor since then, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Ruocco. It’s okay if you don’t remember. Anything at all about what the doctor said about your heart?
PATIENT: Ugh… something about… a valve? Or maybe it was a rhythm? It wasn’t anything too serious, I don’t think. He put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them after my wife passed. Everything just… changed. I really can’t recall much more than that, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. We can work with that. You were on medication for a heart condition at one point, but haven't been taking it for some time. And you mentioned your wife passing… I’m sorry for your loss. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a long time ago now. Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, I believe. And… oh, yes! I had a problem with my knee a few years back, a torn cartilage or something. They fixed it, but it still bothers me sometimes. That's about it, I think. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix as a child and a knee surgery. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a thing. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills. Always worried about the side effects, you know? I try to just tough things out. Maybe I should have listened to my wife, she always said I was too stubborn. But… no medications, not even vitamins.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I try to stay away from too much sugar these days, but that's more of a preference than an allergy. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around your chest a bit. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. It's probably just old age catching up with me, but I appreciate you taking a look. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones are a bit fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds on the lower right side of your chest, and a slight wheeze. Your heart sounds a bit muffled, and I do feel some tenderness when I press here. It doesn't sound like anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to investigate a bit further. I'd like to get a chest x-ray to get a better picture of what's going on in your lungs. Would you be able to do that?
PATIENT: An x-ray? Oh dear. I haven't had one of those in… well, I don't even remember. Is it safe? I worry about all that radiation. And… will it hurt? I really don't like hospitals, Doctor. They always remind me of… bad times.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. The amount of radiation from a chest x-ray is very small - it's comparable to the natural background radiation you're exposed to over a few days. It’s a very safe procedure, and the benefits of getting a clearer picture of your lungs outweigh the risks. The procedure itself is painless – you’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine while a technician takes a picture. It only takes a few minutes. And I understand your feelings about hospitals. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Would you be willing to get the x-ray?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary, Doctor. Just… please be quick. And tell me what you find, alright? I don't like being left in the dark. It makes my anxiety worse. I guess… let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. I will explain everything to you as we go, and I’ll let you know the results as soon as I have them. I’ll have the technician come in and explain the process to you. It shouldn’t take long. While we’re waiting, I’m going to go ahead and write down some notes and get the order for the x-ray finalized. Just one more question, Mr. Ruocco. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance? No, Doctor. Not anymore. My wife handled all that, and… well, things got complicated after she passed. I haven’t been able to afford it since. I just try to get by. I didn't want to bother you with that, I suppose. It's probably just another thing I can't afford.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. That's alright. We'll figure something out. We have programs to assist patients without insurance. We don’t want that to prevent you from getting the care you need. The technician will be in shortly to take you for the x-ray. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you've covered everything. Just… thank you. For being patient with an old man and his fuzzy memories. I appreciate your help. I just want to feel better. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. That’s all any of us want. The technician should be right in. Please don’t hesitate to let me or any of the staff know if you have any concerns. .
