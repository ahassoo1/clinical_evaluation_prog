DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla, welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about making arrangements. Important arrangements, you understand. My husband and I have been discussing it, and we feel it’s simply… prudent to have things in order. I’m told you can help with a form of some kind? A… a directive, I believe it was called. To state one’s wishes, should… difficulties arise.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. A living will, or advance directive. Very sensible of you both. It is best to be prepared. Though, at 44, it’s… unusual to be thinking about this so proactively. Not that there's anything wrong with it, mind you. Just… not the typical presentation. So, you're looking to get a document prepared outlining your wishes for medical care, should you become unable to express them yourself. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Unusual? Doctor, with the state of things these days, one cannot be too careful. It's a matter of responsibility, not… morbidity. I assure you, my husband and I are quite sensible people. We simply prefer to avoid unpleasantness, and to ensure things are done correctly. Yes, precisely. A document outlining my wishes. And, if I may, I’d like it to be… very clear. I have specific… preferences regarding prolonging life, should there be no reasonable hope of recovery. I don't want to be kept alive by machines simply because… well, because it's possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. “Specific preferences.” I understand. It's good you’ve discussed this with your husband. We’ll certainly make sure the document reflects your wishes as accurately as possible. Before we get into the specifics of the directive itself, let me just get a bit of your medical history. It helps to have a complete picture, even for something like this. Have you been seen by a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Yes, of course. I maintain my health. I had a check-up just last year with Dr. Moreau, though I find his practice rather… overcrowded. Mostly routine things, you understand. Blood pressure, cholesterol. Nothing of consequence. I am generally quite robust, if you must know. I make sure of it. A healthy diet, regular exercise… unlike some people. I can provide his contact information if you require it, though I suspect it won't be necessary. I assure you, I am not a fragile patient.
DOCTOR: Right, very good. Routine checkups are excellent. And any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I’ve been blessed with excellent health, as I said. A minor tonsillectomy as a child, if you must know, but that was… decades ago. As for illnesses… a touch of the flu occasionally, like anyone else. Nothing that required hospitalization. Really, Doctor, I am quite healthy. I don’t understand why this is being questioned. Surely, if I were perpetually ill, I wouldn't be here discussing advance directives. It seems rather… redundant.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Ms. Chilla. My apologies. I ask these questions as a matter of protocol, to ensure a complete picture, as I said. It’s good to hear you’ve been so healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I believe in maintaining a natural balance, Doctor. I do occasionally take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, purely for preventative purposes, but that’s hardly a medication. And certainly no herbal remedies. I find them… dubious, at best. I prefer to rely on sensible living and a healthy constitution. I assure you, my body does not require constant intervention.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I am aware of. I've never experienced any… untoward reactions to anything. I occasionally use a lavender-scented lotion, and I tolerate that perfectly well. Really, Doctor, I am a remarkably… uncomplicated patient. I don’t understand why you are dwelling on these minor details. We are here to discuss my advance directive, not my… skin care routine.
DOCTOR: You are quite right, Ms. Chilla. My apologies again. We will get to the directive. I just want to be thorough. Now, one final question, and it may seem a bit… sensitive. Is there a family history of any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor. Are you implying something? My family is… perfectly healthy. Long-lived, robust individuals. My mother lived to be ninety, and my father was still gardening at eighty-five. We are not prone to… weakness or illness. Really, this line of questioning is becoming rather… intrusive. I expected a more… efficient consultation. We are discussing my wishes, not scrutinizing my ancestors. I would appreciate it if we could move on to the matter at hand.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. It is my practice to gather a complete picture, but clearly, you are a very healthy individual. Let's move on to the advance directive itself. Do you have any specific wishes regarding resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or feeding tubes?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, Doctor. I do. I have given this considerable thought, as you can imagine. I absolutely do not wish to be resuscitated should my heart cease functioning. I have seen the… indignity of prolonged resuscitation attempts, and I find it utterly unacceptable. As for mechanical ventilation or feeding tubes… no. Under no circumstances. If there is no reasonable hope of recovery, I do not wish to be kept alive by machines. I want to be allowed to… pass peacefully. I want a simple, dignified end, not a prolonged, artificial existence. Is that clear? I would also like it explicitly stated that I do not wish for any… heroic measures. It’s a matter of principle.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, that is very clear. No resuscitation, no mechanical ventilation, no feeding tubes in the absence of reasonable hope of recovery, and no heroic measures. I am documenting all of this. Now, would you like to designate a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… yes, my husband, of course. He understands my wishes implicitly. He is… pragmatic. Unlike some people, he is not afraid to make difficult decisions. His name is Jean-Pierre Chilla. He is… quite capable. I trust his judgment entirely. Please ensure the document reflects that he has full authority to make decisions on my behalf, should I be unable to do so myself. And, if I may, I would prefer it to be explicitly stated that his decisions are final, without interference from other family members. We have… differing opinions, shall we say.
DOCTOR: Yes, Jean-Pierre Chilla as your healthcare proxy with full authority and his decisions are final. I'm adding that now. Okay, Ms. Chilla. I have documented your wishes regarding resuscitation, ventilation, feeding tubes, and your healthcare proxy. I'm printing out the document now. Please read it carefully, and if everything is accurate, you can sign it in the presence of a witness. Do you have a witness with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, my husband is here. He has been listening, of course. He is perfectly aware of my wishes. He can serve as the witness. Really, this has been rather… tedious, but I suppose it was necessary. Jean-Pierre, darling, would you mind verifying this document? Ensure everything is as we discussed. I trust your attention to detail.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It appears everything is in order, Ms. Chilla. Once signed and witnessed, this document will be legally binding, ensuring your wishes are respected. If you're ready, you can sign here, and your husband can witness it here. After that, we'll keep a copy on file, and you can take the original with you.
PATIENT: There. That is done. It is a relief to have this finalized. I trust this will prevent any… unpleasantness in the future. Thank you, Doctor. Though, frankly, I expected a more… streamlined process. Still, it is completed. .
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Chilla. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m glad we were able to get this completed. I will keep a copy in your file and you have the original for your records. Should you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. And thank you, Jean-Pierre. .
