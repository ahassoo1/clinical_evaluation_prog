DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's... like a pain, you know? In my breast.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Chest pain can be concerning, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “sometimes,” could you tell me more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm... not easy to say. It doesn't seem to be after doing something. Like, I work on roofs all day, and it doesn't always hurt while I'm working. Sometimes it's just... there. When I'm resting, maybe? Or before sleep. I don't really keep track, sorry. It's just... a pain.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t apologize. It’s helpful to know it doesn’t consistently correlate with activity. And you’re right, it is a pain. To help me understand better, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Um... how to say? It's not a sharp pain. More like... a heavy ache? Sometimes it feels like a tight feeling. Not like I can't breathe, but... uncomfortable. And it's mostly just on one side. My left side, I think. I'm not very good at remembering which is which.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy ache and tightness, primarily on the left side. That gives me a bit more to work with. And you mentioned it's not causing difficulty breathing – that’s good to know. Now, has this pain been constant since it started, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. It's not there all the time. Maybe a few days it's okay, then a few days it hurts. It's not getting worse, I don't think. Just... there. Like a reminder. My wife, she said I should come see someone, so I did. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s good of you to come in, and it’s wonderful that your wife encourages you to take care of your health. It’s helpful to know it's intermittent and hasn't been progressively worsening. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've never been to the doctor much. Just when I break something at work, usually. I'm pretty healthy, I think. Work hard, eat okay. No high blood pressure or anything. I don't know about diabetes. Never had that checked. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Bulaong. It’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you've been generally healthy, which is great. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. Just broken bones a few times. A wrist once, and my ankle. Work accidents. They fixed me up and sent me home. That's it. I don't like hospitals if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any history of heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a hard question. My parents... they lived in another country, I didn't see them much when I was growing up. I don't know about their health. My brother, he's okay, works in an office. No problems that I know of. And grandparents... I never met them. Sorry, I wish I could tell you more. I don't really have that information.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bulaong. It’s understandable that you don’t have that information. We can proceed without it. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. I take pain pills sometimes when I hurt my back at work, but never had a problem with them. My wife gives me some vitamins, but that's it. No special allergies. I'm pretty simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you take pain pills occasionally for back pain and some vitamins your wife provides. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work on roofs. Long days, lots of sun. I try to eat good, but sometimes it's just easier to grab something fast. I don't drink much, maybe a beer sometimes on the weekend. No smoking. That's about it. Pretty boring, I guess.
DOCTOR: Not boring at all! It sounds like you work very hard. And it's good you don't smoke. Okay, Mr. Bulaong, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your chest pain, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs and do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to know what's going on. It's just a pain, but my wife worries.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start by having you lie down on your back. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I’ll also feel your chest and back to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m hearing normal heart sounds, regular rhythm, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. I’m noting some mild tenderness to palpation on the left side of your chest, where you mentioned the pain is located, but nothing significant. Your breathing sounds normal. Could you take a deep breath in and out for me a few times?
PATIENT: Okay. That's... okay. It doesn't really hurt to breathe, just... feels a little tight sometimes. Like I said, not all the time. I just want to go back to work, you know? It's hard to make money when I'm not working.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bulaong. It’s important to get to the bottom of this so you can get back to work safely. Given your symptoms, your physical exam findings, and your overall health history, it is difficult to determine the cause of your chest pain without further testing. It could be musculoskeletal pain—meaning related to your muscles, bones, or joints—given the tenderness I felt during the exam, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. I'm also going to order an EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart. And I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a cardiac enzyme level, to rule out any heart-related issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work... okay. Sounds... complicated. But if you think it's best, Doctor, then I trust you. I just hope it's nothing serious. I don't want to be stuck here long, you know? Work is waiting. And my wife... she'll worry even more if I'm here too long. But yeah, do the tests. Whatever you think.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bulaong. It is a bit involved, but it's the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on. We'll take things one step at a time. I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood and then escort you to radiology for the chest X-ray. After that, we’ll wait for the results, which usually take a few hours. Once I have those, we can discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you avoid any strenuous activity, including roofing work. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No... I think I understand. No more roofing work. And go to the hospital if it gets worse. Okay. Just... how long will I be here? My wife said she'll pick me up, but she's got other things to do. And I need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time commitment and getting back to work, Mr. Bulaong. It's hard to say exactly how long it will take. The blood work usually takes about 30 minutes to process, and the chest X-ray shouldn’t take too long either. Interpreting the results and discussing them with you will likely take another 30-60 minutes. So, realistically, you should be able to leave within 2-3 hours, assuming everything goes smoothly. I will make sure to be as efficient as possible. And if anything takes longer than expected, I will keep you informed. In the meantime, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the X-ray process. Do you have any allergies to contrast dyes, if you have ever had imaging done before?
PATIENT: No, never had any imaging done before. No dyes, no nothing. Just broken bones. I really hope it's nothing serious, Doctor. My wife... she gets so worried. I don't want to scare her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bulaong. We'll do everything we can to get you answers quickly and accurately. It's good you've never had any imaging done before, so no dye allergies to worry about. Let me just recap to make sure we’re on the same page. We’ve ordered a chest X-ray, an EKG, and blood work to investigate your chest pain. We’ve discussed avoiding strenuous activity until we have the results. And you’ve been instructed to go to the nearest emergency room if your pain worsens. Do you have any further questions or concerns before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No... I think that's everything. Just... thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for trying to help. I guess I'll just wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could listen, and I’m committed to helping you figure this out. I'll check in with you as soon as the results are available. Just relax, and I’ll be back with you shortly. The nurse will be right in.
