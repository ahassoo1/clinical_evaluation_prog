DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Hilber, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... it's about my water. Or, not gettin' it all out, really. It's been… difficult lately. Not a strong stream, you see. And sometimes, feels like there's still some left in there after I try. It's worryin' me some.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... it started… maybe a month ago? At first, it wasn’t too bad. Just a little bit of strain, you know? But it's gotten worse over the last week or so. I'm havin' to go back more often now, and it takes longer each time. Not comfortable, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. Not burnin' either. Just... weak. Like a slow drip when it should be… well, stronger. It doesn't hurt, thankfully. It's just… frustrating. And a little scary, to be honest. I don't like feelin' like somethin' ain't workin' right.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Like... color or smell? Now that you mention it... it seems a little darker than usual. Not a lot, mind you, but… yeah, maybe a little darker. And the smell… I don’t know. I guess it smells like… well, urine. I don’t usually pay too close attention to that, to be honest. I'm an old man, Doctor. Things change, you know? But you're askin' if it's different... and maybe it is. Just a bit.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And no pain in my belly, Doctor. Just… discomfort. Like a pressure, low down. Not a sharp pain, just… full. And like somethin’s still there even after I go. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. I'd like to check your abdomen and a prostate exam, if you don't mind. It'll give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A prostate exam, you say? Oh. Well... I suppose. I ain’t too fond of those, to be honest. But if it'll help figure out what's wrong... then alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. I’m an old man, and things ain’t as sturdy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: It will be quick. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your abdomen.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go, then. Just let me know if it's uncomfortable, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin' into this for me. It's been weighin’ on my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant tenderness to palpation. Now, if you could just… … we’ll need to proceed with the digital rectal exam. Please bear with me. Prostate feels… enlarged. Not acutely tender, but definitely larger than expected. Alright. That’s all for now. It appears you have some prostate enlargement, which could be contributing to your symptoms. It's common at your age, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: Prostate enlargement… Is that… bad, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? Will I need… surgery, or somethin’? I ain’t keen on surgery, if you don’t mind. I just want to be able to… go to the bathroom normal again. That’s all. Is there medicine for it? Somethin’ to shrink it down?
DOCTOR: It can be managed, Mr. Hilber. It doesn't necessarily require surgery. We’ll need to get a PSA test to rule out anything more concerning. And a urinalysis to check for infection. Then, depending on those results, we can discuss medication options to help with the urinary flow. There are several available. However, it’s important to understand they don’t always completely resolve the issue. Lifestyle changes—limiting fluids before bed, for instance—can also help. I’ll order those tests for you now. Nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood and collect a urine sample. Come back in a week to discuss the results.
PATIENT: A week, huh? Alright. Blood test and… a sample. I can do that. Limitin’ fluids… I can try that too. It’s just… a week feels like a long time when you’re worried about this sort of thing. But alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Thank you for lookin' into it. And… where will the nurse be? I’m a little slow gettin' around, you see.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be here shortly. Just let the receptionist know if you need assistance. Now, if you don’t have any other questions, I have other patients waiting. Come back in a week. The results will be in the system. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… see you next week then. I guess I'll go find the receptionist. .
