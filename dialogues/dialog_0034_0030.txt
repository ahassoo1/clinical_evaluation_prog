DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Antonis Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, lately. My body odor. It’s just… different than usual. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it’s enough that I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly not embarrassing to address changes in your body, and it’s good you came in to discuss this. It’s important to investigate these things. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the change in odor a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think. It's not bad, exactly. It’s just…sweeter, I guess? And maybe a little bit stronger than it used to be, even after a normal shower. It’s hard to explain. It's not like BO, not like underarm smell, it's… all over, more subtle. I've been using the same deodorant for years, so I don't think it's that. I haven't changed anything else, not that I’ve noticed anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. “Sweeter” and “stronger, even after showering” is helpful. And the fact that you haven’t changed deodorants or other hygiene products is good to know. When did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Let me see… I'd say about three or four weeks ago, maybe? It started gradually, so I didn’t really pay attention at first. Just thought maybe I was imagining things. But then my daughter, Selam, mentioned it… said I smelled “different” when she came to visit last week. That’s when I decided I really should get it checked out. She’s pretty blunt, my Selam, so it definitely got my attention.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're taking this seriously, and daughters are often quite observant! About three to four weeks ago, gradually becoming noticeable... Okay. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... Not really. My energy levels have been a little low, I suppose, but I just figured that was from the heat. It's been so hot lately. And maybe a little bit more thirsty than usual, but again, I'm blaming the weather. No weight loss or gain, no new rashes or anything like that. Nothing else I can think of, honestly. I’ve been eating pretty normally, the same things I always eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no unintentional weight changes, no skin changes, and the increased thirst and fatigue you attribute to the heat. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago, but it went away on its own with diet and exercise. Doctor said I was fine after a few months, and I haven't had any problems with it since. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I guess! I haven’t been to the doctor for anything serious in years, honestly. I usually just try to tough things out. My insurance is Medicare, so I try not to bother anyone unless it’s really necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's good to know about the past high blood pressure, and it's good that it resolved. We’ll certainly keep that in mind. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it, and not even regularly. I prefer to eat healthy and get my nutrients from food. I did try some herbal remedies for my arthritis a few years back, but they didn’t seem to do much, so I stopped taking them. Mostly just ibuprofen when my joints are really bothering me, but I don’t take that very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, occasional ibuprofen, and a multivitamin. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years! My mother, she used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. She was a wonderful cook, used all kinds of spices. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... My mother had high blood pressure, like me, but hers was pretty severe and she was on medication for years. My father, he had some heart trouble when he got older, but I don't know all the details, he passed away a long time ago. And my grandmother, on my mother's side, she had diabetes, but that was a long time ago too, before they had good treatment for it. I don't know about anything else, really. My family isn't very good at talking about health problems. It's kind of a taboo subject.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's not uncommon. High blood pressure and diabetes in the family are good things to note. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Well, I'm divorced, been that way for about fifteen years now. I don't have any close family nearby, except for my daughter Selam, she lives about two hours away. I work as a floor layer, except for carpet and tiles, mostly wood floors. It’s physical work, but I enjoy it. Keeps me moving, you know? I don't smoke, I don’t drink very much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don't use any recreational drugs. Mostly just a pretty quiet life. I like to garden when I have the time, and I enjoy cooking, like my mother. That's about it, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Ms. Purtee. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a general assessment. We can also check your temperature. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven't had a proper checkup in years, so anything you want to look at is good with me. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Ears are clear, throat is clear. No obvious signs of infection. Everything appears normal on initial exam. However, given your change in body odor and the fatigue, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out several possibilities, including diabetes, kidney issues, and thyroid problems. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work is fine. I just want to figure out what's going on. I don't mind getting poked if it helps. Will I need to fast beforehand? And where will I get it done?
DOCTOR: Yes, for this particular panel, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – that means no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. We can get the blood work done right here in the clinic, in our lab. I’ll give you a lab requisition form and instructions before you leave. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as significant fatigue, weight loss, or changes in urination – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Fasting I can manage, and getting it done here is very convenient. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Thank you. I'll make sure to call if anything changes. I’m just hoping it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Most likely, it's something easily addressable. While we wait for the results, try to stay hydrated and get adequate rest. I’ll print out that lab requisition form now, and we can go over the instructions. Here you go. It explains everything in detail. Do you have any questions about the form or the process?
PATIENT: No, I think it's pretty clear, Doctor. "No food or sugary drinks for 8-12 hours." I can remember that. And the number to call if I have any problems. That’s all I need, I think. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. I really appreciate it. You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
DOCTOR: No, I believe that is all, Doctor. Thank you for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing we’re getting things checked out. Excellent. I will see you for a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Have a good day, Ms. Purtee, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
