DOCTOR: Good morning, Moshe. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Moshe. Well, it’s this tiredness, really. Daytime sleepiness. I’ve been treated for sleep apnea for a while now, and it should be fixed, but I’m still dragging myself through the day. It’s a bit of a nuisance, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Moshe, daytime sleepiness despite being treated for sleep apnea – that is a nuisance, and definitely something we want to look into. Twenty-two years in family medicine teaches you that "fixed" doesn’t always mean fixed, and there can be a lot of reasons for that lingering tiredness. First, let’s talk about the sleep apnea treatment. How long have you been on treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… about eight years now, I believe. Maybe a little more. It was back in 2017, I had a sleep study done, and they started me on the machine then. A CPAP, I think it’s called? It’s the one I wear at night with the mask. I’ve been pretty good about using it, most nights anyway. Sometimes when I travel, it's a bit awkward, but I usually manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight years of CPAP use, that’s good adherence overall, even with the travel challenges. That tells me it's less likely the apnea itself is the primary problem now. Let's dig a little deeper into this tiredness. Can you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I just fall asleep standing up, Doctor. It’s more… a heavy feeling. Like wading through water, you know? Everything feels like an effort. And I get these… moments. Little dips in energy, where I just have to pause. It's hard to concentrate when it happens, and it's frustrating. It’s especially bad in the afternoons. I used to love reading after lunch, but now I just… doze off. It’s just not the same.
DOCTOR: That “wading through water” feeling is a really helpful description, Moshe. And those little dips in energy, especially in the afternoon… okay. It sounds more than just simple sleepiness. Let's do a quick review of other things that could be going on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… appetite, not really. I eat about the same as always, maybe a little less now that I’m not as active. Weight… well, it’s crept up a bit, I suppose. A few pounds. Nothing dramatic, but enough that my trousers feel a little snugger. I used to walk more, but it’s harder when you’re tired all the time, you see. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a vicious cycle. It’s easy to get stuck in that pattern. A slight weight gain, reduced activity… alright. Now, I'm going to ask a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we’re managing?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I have some high blood pressure, the doctor has me on a pill for that. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, a bit of arthritis. Nothing too serious, I take something for it when they flare up. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that hasn’t bothered me in ages. I see Dr. Ramirez for my blood pressure, he’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, some arthritis, and gallbladder removal in the past. That gives me a good picture. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides those for your blood pressure and arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, sometimes I take a little something for my digestion. It’s an over-the-counter thing, helps with… well, you know. Not every day, just when I eat something a bit heavy. And sometimes a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, Dr. Ramirez suggested that. But that's it, I think. I try to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional digestive aid and Vitamin D supplements. Good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to worry about shellfish, but I eat it all the time with no problem. My wife, bless her soul, always checked everything carefully when we were married, but she passed away a few years ago now. So, no, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Moshe. It sounds like you had a wonderful partner. Okay, no known allergies. Let's move onto family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, my mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father… he had some heart trouble when he got older, needed a pacemaker. And my sister, she’s had high blood pressure, like me. So, there’s a bit of both, really. Not a very healthy bunch, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. That’s helpful to know. And finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she smoked for a while, but she quit years ago. It was a struggle, but she managed it. She was a strong woman. So no, no smoking for me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, Doctor. Maybe three or four times a week. Nothing heavy, just a little something to relax. I don’t drink beer or spirits, just wine. Red wine, usually. It’s a habit more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional red wine. That’s good to know. Thank you for being so thorough, Moshe. Let me just pull up your EHR information… Ah, here we are. I see you’ve been consistently refilling your blood pressure medication, and your last A1c was… 6.8. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I think it’s time for a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Six point eight, you say? I suppose that’s not ideal. I trust your judgment completely. Go ahead with the exam, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Hmm, 145/88. A little on the higher side, but not alarmingly so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Finally, I’ll quickly check your feet for sensation and circulation… Pulses are a little weak, but present. Sensation is slightly reduced in your feet, but not significantly. Okay, that’s all. Overall, your exam is relatively normal for your age, but the slightly reduced sensation in your feet, weak pulses, and elevated blood pressure are things we need to keep an eye on. Given your fatigue, history of sleep apnea, slightly elevated A1c, and these physical exam findings, I'm thinking we need to do some additional blood work to rule out other potential causes. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Absolutely. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I want to get to the bottom of this tiredness, if we can. Weak pulses… I hadn’t noticed, but that doesn’t surprise me. My feet do get cold easily. Go ahead with the blood work, please. The more information, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. I'm also going to order an HbA1c to get a more accurate picture of your long-term blood sugar control. And, given the weak pulses and slightly reduced sensation in your feet, I want to order an ankle-brachial index to assess for peripheral artery disease. The lab technician will come up shortly to draw the blood. The ABI test is non-invasive – we'll just measure the blood pressure in your arms and ankles. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend continuing your CPAP therapy as prescribed, and focusing on a healthy diet and regular exercise, as much as your fatigue allows. I’m also going to give you a referral to a podiatrist for a foot exam, just to be on the safe side. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very thorough. I appreciate you being so comprehensive. Podiatrist, yes, that’s a good idea. I haven't had my feet checked in years. I suppose I haven't paid them much attention. CPAP, I’ll keep doing that. It’s a nuisance sometimes, but I understand it’s important. Healthy diet… I’ll try. It’s harder when you’re tired, you know? But I’ll make an effort. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. Just hoping we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Moshe. It’s a process, and we’ll take it one step at a time. I'm optimistic that we can find the cause of your fatigue and get you feeling better. The lab technician should be here shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I feel much better knowing you’re looking into this properly. Thank you. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait for the lab technician, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Moshe. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the lab technician arrives. I'll let you rest quietly for a moment, and I'll check back in with you after the lab work is done.
PATIENT: .
