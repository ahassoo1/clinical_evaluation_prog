DOCTOR: Hi Louine, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this foot. It’s just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it won’t heal. I’ve tried everything my daughter told me to, but nothing seems to work. You’re a doctor, so I figured I should come see someone who actually knows things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been troubling you for weeks. That sounds frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Frustrating? That’s putting it mildly! It’s painful, young lady. And it smells. I don’t like talking about smells, but it’s…unpleasant. It’s on the bottom of my left foot, near my heel. Been getting worse, even with all the creams my daughter bought. She thinks I have…what does she call it? The sugar sickness? Diabetes, that’s it. She's always reading things on the internet. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s painful, smells, and is located on the bottom of your left foot near your heel. And your daughter is concerned about diabetes. We'll definitely look into that. First, let's focus on the sore itself. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was after I went to that church picnic. Lovely picnic, good food, but I think I walked a bit too much in those new sandals. Probably scraped it then, though I didn’t think much of it at the time. Maybe… six, seven weeks ago? It started small, just a little red spot, and I thought it would go away on its own. But it didn’t. And now… well, now it’s a proper sore. A very bothersome sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about six or seven weeks ago, after a church picnic, and you think it might have been a scrape from new sandals. Has anything made it feel better or worse since then?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things make it worse! Walking, of course. Standing for too long. Even just having my sock rub against it. Nothing makes it better, really. My daughter had me soaking it in warm water with Epsom salts, but that only helped for a little while. Then it just started hurting again. And the smell… honestly, it’s embarrassing. I have to wear thicker socks to hide it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So walking, standing, and friction aggravate it, and soaking it hasn't provided lasting relief. And you're noticing a smell. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore at all?
PATIENT: Drainage? Oh, yes. A bit. It's… not pleasant to look at, I assure you. It’s yellowish, sometimes a little brownish. And it gets on my socks, of course. That's why I've been using so much disinfectant. I try to keep it clean, but it's just… stubborn. My daughter keeps telling me I should go to a special doctor for my feet, but I don't need a special doctor. I just need someone to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish-brownish drainage. That’s good information. And you’re keeping it clean, which is important. Let's take a look at it. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine your foot?
PATIENT: Honestly. All this fuss over a little sore. Very well. But don't expect miracles, young lady. It's seen better days, that's for certain. There. Be gentle now, it’s quite tender. And try not to make a face. It’s not a pretty sight.
DOCTOR: Okay. It is a bit tender, as you said. I see some redness and swelling around the wound, and there is some drainage present. It appears to be about… two centimeters in diameter. I also notice some thickened skin around the edges. Do you have any pain in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, I'm 89 years old, dear. Of course I have pain! My knees ache, my back creaks, and sometimes my hands get a bit numb. But that’s just old age. What does that have to do with my foot? I came here about this sore, not my general aches and pains. Are you even going to fix it, or are you just going to ask me about everything that’s wrong with me? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: You're right to focus on the foot, and I apologize if I was getting off track. It's just important to get a full picture. The reason I ask about other pain is that diabetes can sometimes cause numbness or tingling in the feet and slow down healing, which is what your daughter was concerned about. Let me take a look at your medical record. Ah, okay. I see here you were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes several years ago. Is your diabetes well-controlled?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, that old thing. The doctor told me I had it, years ago. Something about sugar, I think. I tried taking those pills for a while, but they made me feel awful. So, I stopped. My daughter keeps nagging me about it, says I need to watch my diet and check my blood sugar. But honestly, I’ve lived a long life without worrying about every little thing. And it hasn’t bothered me much, until this sore, of course. Is that what’s causing all this trouble? This diabetes? A silly old disease ruining my foot?
DOCTOR: It's possible the diabetes is contributing to the slow healing of the sore. Poor blood sugar control can weaken the immune system and reduce blood flow to the feet, making them more susceptible to infection and slower to heal. To get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to order a blood test to check your current blood sugar levels. We should also test the fluid from the sore to see if there's an infection present. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, I feel like a pin cushion! But… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I just want this sore gone. I don’t want to lose my foot over a little bit of sugar. Yes, alright. Do what you have to do. But be quick about it. And try not to make a mess, I hate the smell of hospitals. And please, explain everything clearly. I don't want any of that fancy doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll order the blood test and a sample from the sore. The lab will need a small amount of fluid, which I can collect here in the office. It might sting a little, but it will be fast. While we wait for the results, I’m going to clean and dress the wound to keep it protected. I’ll also recommend you keep weight off your foot as much as possible, and we'll talk about how to manage your blood sugar. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Very well. Clean it and dress it, do what you must. But don't expect miracles, young lady. This sore is a stubborn one. And as for managing my blood sugar… I’ll try, but don't expect me to become a health fanatic overnight. I’ve lived a long life doing things my own way. And frankly, I’m not about to change now. But I suppose I can try a bit harder. Just get this sore fixed, that's all I ask. Now, let's get this over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's get started. As I clean this, I'm noticing it’s deeper than I initially thought. It’s possible there's a small infection present, which would explain the smell and drainage. The lab results will confirm that for sure. I'm going to order a blood test to check your glucose levels and a wound culture to identify any bacteria. I will also write you a prescription for an antibiotic ointment to apply to the sore twice a day after cleaning it.
