DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fabing. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. Just need to get some forms filled out, I think. Medicare sent me a bunch of stuff and I figured it’d be easier to do it here, with someone who could answer questions if I get stuck.
DOCTOR: Right. Medicare paperwork. It's… extensive. Okay. Well, I can help with that, I suppose. Though honestly, most of it should be pretty straightforward. But, before we dive into that mountain of forms, is there anything else you're hoping to address today?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the forms, thanks. I don’t want to take up too much of your time. Everything else is okay, health-wise. Just the usual getting older stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: "Getting older stuff." Right. Well, even "getting older stuff" can be worth mentioning, if something’s bothering you. But fine, we’ll stick to the paperwork then. Let’s start with this one – the Notice of Privacy Practices. Have you had a chance to look at it at all?
PATIENT: Nope, haven't even opened it. That's why I came, honestly. All those legal things… my eyes just glaze over. Is it about how you use my information? Like, with the insurance?
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. It explains how we protect your medical information, who we share it with – insurance being one of them, naturally – and your rights regarding it. It's standard procedure. Honestly, it’s mostly just legal boilerplate. But you do need to sign that you’ve received and understand it. I can quickly highlight the important bits if you’d like, though I doubt it will be enlightening.
PATIENT: Highlighting would be great, actually. I appreciate that. I just… I always feel bad signing things I haven’t read, even if I know it’s a hundred pages of stuff I don't understand. Could you just tell me the main things? Like, can they sell my information? That’s what I worry about the most.
DOCTOR: No, we cannot "sell" your information. That's… a rather sensational concern. This section outlines that we can share it for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. That means sending it to your insurance for billing, things like that. And with other authorized people if you give us permission. It also covers things like reporting certain conditions to public health authorities, as legally required. See?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. So, mostly stuff they have to share, or stuff I agree to? Not like… selling it to companies that want to send me stuff?
DOCTOR: Precisely. No unsolicited marketing schemes. Though, frankly, you should always be cautious about who you give your information to anywhere. Now, can we please move on?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, we can move on. Sorry to take so long with this one. It just… worries me, you know? All that stuff getting out there. What's next?
DOCTOR: This one is... slightly more involved. It asks about past illnesses, surgeries, medications, allergies, family history... the usual. Try to be as thorough as possible. And don’t worry if you don’t remember exact dates, just approximate if you can. Honestly, most people don't have a perfect recollection of everything. But do try. It helps me understand your overall health picture.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. I think I can do that. I remember most of it, I guess. Should I start with the illnesses, or the surgeries?
DOCTOR: Illnesses first, please. Chronological order is preferred, if you can manage it. We're trying to establish a timeline here, not a random jumble of ailments. And be specific. “Feeling sick” isn’t particularly helpful.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Uh… let’s see. When I was a little girl, maybe around six or seven, I had really bad strep throat. Had to be on penicillin for a long time. Then… I broke my arm when I was twelve, but that’s the surgery part, so I’ll skip that for now. After that… I had the flu a couple of times, just the normal yearly flu. Nothing serious. Then… I had pneumonia when I was in my twenties, that was pretty bad, I had to be in the hospital for a week.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia. Okay. Was that bacterial or viral, do you recall?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, I don’t. It was a long time ago. I just remember being really sick and having a hard time breathing. They gave me antibiotics, so maybe bacterial? I really don't know. It was at the hospital in Browning, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Let me pull up your records from Browning. It might have that information. Ah, yes. Bacterial pneumonia. Okay. Good. That’s helpful. Continue with your history, please. And try to be more precise with dates when possible. It really does make a difference.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, bacterial. Got it. Hmm… after the pneumonia, everything was pretty good for a while. Then I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. That was… laparoscopic, I think? They made little cuts. Not a big surgery, thankfully. And then… I had some problems with my blood pressure a couple of years ago, but it's been controlled with medication ever since. That's pretty much it, I think. For the serious stuff, anyway. I get the occasional cold, you know, but nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Controlled with medication… what medication, specifically?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. It’s a little white pill… Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril. 20 milligrams. I take one every morning. I’ve been on it for about two years now, and my blood pressure’s been good ever since. I get it refilled at the Indian Health Service.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, and I've taken all sorts of medicines over the years for colds and flu and stuff, and never had a problem. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing. Does that cover everything? This form is pretty long.
DOCTOR: Almost. Family history. Parents, siblings, grandparents. Any significant illnesses like heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Family history. Okay, well, my mom had diabetes. Type 2, I think. She was diagnosed when she was in her fifties, and it was pretty bad towards the end. She passed away about five years ago. My dad… he had heart disease. He had a bypass surgery when he was in his seventies, and he lived another ten years after that. I have one brother, and he’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. No major illnesses in his family, either. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: And finally – social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even tried it. It’s bad for you. My mom smoked for a while, but she quit years before she got sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. I think that covers it. Now, let’s see… Everything seems reasonably stable. Given your history, we should continue monitoring your blood pressure, and you should probably get your blood sugar checked annually. Otherwise… you’re fine. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thanks for your help. I really appreciate you explaining everything, even if it was a lot. I just wanted to get the forms done, and you made it a lot easier.
DOCTOR: Alright. Then, I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of your medications and a reminder for your annual blood sugar check. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if anything changes. Next.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Thank you again. Have a good day.
