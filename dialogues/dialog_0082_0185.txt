DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's my breath. It just... smells bad. I don't know what else to tell you. It's embarrassing. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand that can be quite distressing, Zelina. We'll certainly try to figure it out. It's good you came in. “Smells bad” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice the smell?
PATIENT: Ugh, when don't I notice it? Okay, fine. It's... mostly in the mornings, I guess. And after I eat. Especially if I've had... anything with garlic. Which, honestly, is a lot. Does that matter? I just like garlic. Look, I brush, okay? I really do.
DOCTOR: Garlic is definitely a factor, yes. It’s good you brush regularly. And mornings are common. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent change?
PATIENT: A long time. Like... since my divorce, honestly. It's just gotten worse, I think. Everything's been worse since then, to be fair. Is it, like, a psychological thing? Because I really don't need a lecture about stress. I just want something to fix it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Zelina. Stress can absolutely contribute to various things, but let’s focus on the breath for now. We’ll explore all possibilities. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you describe the smell itself?
PATIENT: Ugh, how am I supposed to describe a smell? It just... bad. Like, a rotten kind of bad. Not like onions, more... old. Like something’s decaying. Look, I'm not a perfumer, okay? Is that helpful? I just know it's not pleasant. It's really off-putting.
DOCTOR: "Rotten" and "old" are helpful descriptions, actually. Okay. And you mentioned it's worse after eating… are there any other foods besides garlic that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Everything, basically. Coffee, onions… anything really strong. Okay, maybe not everything. Salad doesn’t make it worse. But anything with, like, protein? Meat, cheese... definitely. It's just easier to list what doesn't make it worse, honestly. And don’t tell me I need to change my diet. I eat what I want.
DOCTOR: I understand. No dietary lectures, I promise. Okay, so protein-rich foods seem to be a trigger. Let's move on to other things. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like... what kind of symptoms? No, not really. I'm tired, but that's just life, okay? No cough, no sore throat, nothing like that. Just... bad breath. And a general feeling of… everything being awful. But that's not a symptom, is it? Look, I don’t get sick. I'm pretty healthy, for all the… stress.
DOCTOR: Alright. No cough, no sore throat, generally healthy… and you brush regularly. Have you noticed any changes in your gums?
PATIENT: Changes? Like... bleeding? No, not really. They feel fine. Sometimes they're a little sensitive, but that’s probably just because I brush too hard. My ex complained about that, actually. Said I was going to wear them away. Honestly, he complained about everything. It doesn’t matter. No, my gums are fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we've covered quite a bit. I’d like to take a quick look in your mouth, if you don’t mind. Just to check your gums and teeth, and maybe get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I have things to do. But yes, whatever. Just be quick about it, okay? I don’t want anything poked and prodded for too long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please open wide… and relax your tongue for me. Okay. Your gums are a little inflamed, and there’s some redness along the gumline. No obvious cavities, but there's some tartar buildup. Your tongue looks normal. It does appear there’s some mild gingivitis present. And I notice a slight odor even now.
PATIENT: Gingivitis? What does that mean? Is it serious? Look, I told you I brush. It's probably just… a bad day for my gums or something. You’re making a big deal out of nothing. Honestly, I don't have time for this. Is there a pill I can take or something? Just fix it, okay? I really don’t want to come back here.
DOCTOR: Gingivitis is inflammation of the gums, and it’s quite common. It’s usually caused by a buildup of plaque, which is a sticky film of bacteria. It’s not usually serious if addressed, but left untreated, it can lead to more significant problems. A pill won't fix it, unfortunately. It requires good oral hygiene and, in some cases, a professional cleaning. I’d like to recommend a professional dental cleaning. And I’ll also recommend improving your brushing technique and maybe using a mouthwash specifically designed to fight gingivitis. I can give you some pamphlets with information. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ugh, a cleaning? Seriously? More appointments? Look, I really don’t want to. And pamphlets? Are you kidding me? I can Google things, okay? I’m not an idiot. Honestly, this is just… great. Fine. Just… tell me how much the cleaning costs. And don’t try to sell me anything else, okay? I’m not made of money. This divorce has been expensive enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your frustration. A cleaning is the best first step, and it's a relatively quick procedure. The cost for a standard cleaning here at the clinic is $120. We also offer payment plans if that's helpful. I won’t try to sell you anything, I promise. I just want to help you address this issue. And I want to assure you, this is a very common problem. Would you like me to schedule that cleaning for you today?
PATIENT: $120? Fine. Whatever. Just schedule it. The sooner it's over with, the better. Don’t bother with a fancy time, just… anytime next week, I guess. I have things to do, okay? And don’t expect me to be happy about it. This is just… annoying. .
DOCTOR: Alright, I have you scheduled for a cleaning next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. You’ll receive a confirmation text with details. I’ve also printed out a pamphlet with information on gingivitis and proper oral hygiene techniques, and a list of local dental supply stores if you want to purchase a gingivitis-fighting mouthwash. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
