DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor, yes? Good morning. Look, I don't have all day. My chest... it feels funny. Like a bird flapping. And the nurse, she said my blood pressure was… high. Too high. I want to know what’s wrong. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand you’re concerned about a sensation in your chest and the blood pressure reading the nurse obtained. We’ll get to the bottom of this as efficiently as we can. When you say it feels “funny,” could you describe that sensation a little more?
PATIENT: Like… thump-thump, fast. Not regular. Like a fish out of water, maybe? It comes and goes. Sometimes when I walk, sometimes when I… just sit. It’s annoying. And I don’t like feeling like… like something is wrong. Is it my heart? Is it serious? Don’t tell me it’s my heart. My wife will worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Sobkowicz, and it’s good you're paying attention to these changes. It’s certainly possible it relates to your heart, but we need to gather more information before jumping to any conclusions. These sensations you describe – the irregular, fast thumping – are what we call palpitations. To help me understand better, can you tell me approximately how long these episodes typically last?
PATIENT: Episodes? What episodes? They just… happen. Maybe a few seconds. Maybe a minute. I don't keep track, Doctor! I have things to do, you know? I don't sit around timing my… thump-thumps. Just… not long. But long enough to bother me. And make me feel… weak. Is that important?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Sobkowicz. I didn’t mean to be insensitive. Of course you don’t keep track – I was simply trying to gauge the duration. Knowing it’s happening for seconds to a minute is helpful. And yes, feeling weak is important. Do you notice anything specific that triggers these palpitations, besides walking or simply sitting?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmm. My wife makes me angry sometimes. Does that count? No, seriously… I drink coffee. Maybe that. Not too much, just one cup in the morning. And I get… flustered. When people ask me too many questions. Like now. Is this going to take all day? I have a garden to tend to, you know. Tomatoes don’t grow themselves.
DOCTOR: Tomatoes do require dedicated attention, that’s true. And I appreciate your patience, Mr. Sobkowicz. We’re making progress. So, one cup of coffee in the morning, and feeling flustered can bring these sensations on. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with these palpitations and weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… head-light. And sometimes, my hands… they get cold. Especially when my wife is yelling at me. She worries too much. Always. Is that it? Am I done now? Can I go check on my tomatoes? They need watering.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. Dizziness and cold hands – those are helpful details. Before we conclude, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the nurse said something about that today. But before? No, not that I remember. Diabetes? No. Heart problems? No! I've always been strong. Worked hard my whole life. Emergency Management Director, you know. People depend on me. I don’t have time for… problems. My wife, she makes me go to the doctor every year. She worries too much. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s good that you have a yearly check-up. And it's understandable you've been busy. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
