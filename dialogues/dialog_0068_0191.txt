DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to talk about, but I wanted to get tested for HIV. I wanted to do it myself, you know, just to be sure. It's something I've been thinking about for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's good you're taking this step. To be clear, you're requesting an HIV test. And you said you've been thinking about this for a while... can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my husband and I… we haven’t been as careful lately as we should be. And I just… I worry. It’s not that I think anything has happened, exactly, but it’s better to know, isn’t it? Especially at our age. It's just peace of mind, really. I haven’t been feeling any different, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, peace of mind is important. So, no specific concerns or symptoms prompting this besides a change in… practices, let’s say?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. No symptoms at all. Just… a little anxiety. And my daughter, she’s a nurse, and she always says it’s best to be proactive about these things. She got me thinking, really. It’s good to catch things early, she says.
DOCTOR: Yes, your daughter sounds very wise. Alright. Before we proceed with the test, I'd like to ask a few questions, just routine, to get a clearer picture. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions… let me see. I don’t think so, Doctor. I’ve had vaccinations, of course, but I’ve never needed a transfusion. I had a very difficult childbirth with my first, but they didn’t give me a transfusion then, as far as I remember. Would they have told me if they did?
DOCTOR: Good question. They absolutely would have. Okay, no transfusions. And have you ever shared needles with anyone, or used intravenous drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I've never… I don't even know anyone who does such a thing. I'm a churchgoer, Doctor. And my husband… well, we both keep very clean lives. It's a firm no, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections – STIs – in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a… sensitive question. No, Doctor, I haven't. Not that I know of, anyway. When I was younger, things were… different. People didn’t talk about these things. But I’ve been faithful to my husband for many years, since we got married. We’ve been together a very long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're comfortable sharing this with me. Now, regarding your husband, is he aware you are getting tested today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, he isn’t. I wanted to… I wanted to get the results first. I didn't want to worry him unnecessarily. He’s… he’s a bit of a worrier, you see. And if everything is alright, then there’s no need to upset him. I was hoping for a bit of reassurance before I told him. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good to be considerate. Now, before we move on to the test itself, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s all. No other allergies, food or otherwise. I’m quite healthy, really, for my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, just to confirm, you have no known allergies, you take medication for blood pressure, no history of blood transfusions or intravenous drug use, and you've never been diagnosed with an STI. You’re requesting an HIV test due to a recent change in sexual practices and to ease your anxiety. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is a very fair summary. You’ve listened very well. I appreciate you asking all those questions, even if they were a bit difficult to answer. It makes me feel… safer, knowing you’re being thorough. Now, what kind of test will you be doing? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll be doing a blood draw. It’s a very standard procedure. There will be a brief pinch, like any other blood test, but it shouldn't be painful. We'll send the sample to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. We can discuss the different types of tests available and their accuracy if you'd like, but for initial screening, this will be sufficient. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood draw… yes, that’s alright. I’ve had those before, so I know what to expect. A few days, you say? And just a pinch? That’s good. I’d like to know what the different types of tests are, if you don’t mind. Just so I understand what’s happening. I like to be informed, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. There are a few different tests we can use. The most common is an antibody test, which looks for your body’s response to the virus. It can take a few weeks after infection for antibodies to develop, so it might not be accurate if you were recently exposed. We also have a combination test which looks for both antibodies and the virus itself – the antigen. That one is more accurate, especially soon after exposure. And there’s a newer test called an RNA test, which directly detects the virus, but it’s typically reserved for confirming positive results or for people with a high risk of recent infection. For today, given your concerns, we'll start with the combination test. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Antibodies… antigen… RNA… it’s a bit confusing, Doctor. The combination test… that sounds like the best option, then. The one that's most accurate, especially if… well, if something had happened recently. So that tests for both things? The body’s response and the virus itself? I think I understand. Yes, that's good. What happens after the blood draw? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. It tests for both. And no, you don’t need to fast beforehand. We'll just take a small sample of blood, send it to the lab, and they’ll notify us of the results. It usually takes three to five business days. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can explain before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. Three to five days… alright. Let’s just get it over with, then. Where do we do the blood draw?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll follow me, the phlebotomist is just down the hall. She's very experienced and gentle. She'll have you sit down, clean your arm, and take a small sample of blood. It will only take a few minutes. Do you have any questions before we go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I'm ready. Just a bit nervous, that’s all. A gentle phlebotomist sounds wonderful. Let’s go, then. Thank you again for being so kind.
