DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Barban is my name. I am here for... the check-up before the insurance starts, yes? Medicare sent me. It is a requirement, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kiwane, good to know. Yes, that’s right, Medicare often requires a welcome to Medicare physical exam when you first enroll. It’s a good way to get a baseline of your health. Let's get some information down, then we’ll do a physical exam. First, just to confirm, your date of birth is…?
PATIENT: It is... January 12th, 1997. Do not ask me to remember everything. It is... a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, January 12th, 1997. Got it. And your height and weight are listed as 188 centimeters and 90 kilograms, is that still accurate?
PATIENT: Yes. That is... correct. I have not changed. People always comment on my height, you know? It is... difficult to find clothes that fit.
DOCTOR: I can imagine! Being 6’2” definitely has its challenges. Alright, Kiwane, before we move on to the physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing... serious. I had the flu, maybe, when I was a boy. And a small cut once at the factory. They gave me a bandage. That is all. I am a healthy man. I work hard, eat... normally. Do not worry about me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. No major medical issues. And no surgeries at all?
PATIENT: No. Surgeries? No. I do not... need surgeries. My hands are for working, Doctor. Not for... being cut open. I do not understand why you ask so many questions. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Kiwane. It does feel like a lot of questions, and I apologize if it seems unnecessary. It’s just standard procedure to get a complete picture of your health, even if you feel perfectly healthy. It helps me understand what’s normal for you, so if something does change in the future, we can identify it quickly. Okay. How about your family?
PATIENT: My family? They are... in Yemen. Most of them. I speak to my mother sometimes. She asks about the weather. She worries too much. They are... farmers, mostly. Healthy people, also. They do not go to doctors much. It is... expensive. And unnecessary, they believe. Like me. What do you want to know about them?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Just generally, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant…? I do not know what you mean by ‘significant’. My grandfather... he had problems with his… legs. Old age, I think. My aunt, she had many children. That is all I remember. They do not discuss such things. It is… private. And far away. I do not know if it is… important. Is it important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Kiwane. It sounds like there isn't a strong family history of major medical problems that you're aware of, and that's good information to have. We don't need to worry about it further if you aren't sure. Now, I want to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I am a serious man. Smoking is… foolish. Alcohol… makes you weak. And drugs? Never. I have work to do. I need to be strong and clear-headed. I drink water. And tea, sometimes, with my lunch. Is this another test? Are you suspecting something?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health. You've answered perfectly. No smoking, no alcohol, no drugs – that's excellent. Okay, let’s move on to allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I eat everything. Except maybe… those strange American cheeses. They do not taste like real cheese. And I do not take any medications. I do not need medications. I work hard, I eat, I sleep. That is all. My mother sends me some… herbal tea sometimes, for colds. But it does not do much. Do you write all of this down? It seems like a lot of writing.
DOCTOR: I am, Kiwane. It is a lot of information, but it helps me build a complete record. No known allergies, no medications – that’s good. Okay, now let's do a quick physical exam. Just the basics - checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But do not take too long. I have work this afternoon. And please, be gentle. My hands are important. I need them for my job. What will you do exactly? I do not like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I promise no surprises! I'll start by checking your vital signs – that's your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I’ll also take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. I'll feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. And I'll do a brief neurological exam just to make sure everything is working properly. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: It sounds... thorough. I suppose it is necessary. But please, be quick. And do not poke too much. My hands… you understand. Begin, then. But I warn you, I am a strong man. Do not be surprised if I flinch. It is just… my muscles. They are always tense.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Kiwane. I’ll be as careful as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm… good. 128 over 76. That’s within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular. Take a few deep breaths for me… in… and out… good. Your lungs sound clear. A little pressure here… Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No discomfort. Just… pressure. My stomach is strong. I eat a lot of rice. It is... filling. Do not poke too hard. It is not necessary. You are taking a long time. Are you almost finished? I can feel my muscles getting tense. I need to work. My job is important. And my hands... they are the tools of my trade.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Kiwane. Just a quick neurological exam – I’m going to check your reflexes. Okay, good reflexes there. And I’ll just have you close your eyes and touch your nose. Good coordination. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, but I do want to order some routine blood work just to get a baseline. It'll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things. It's standard procedure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking? Is it necessary? I feel fine. My body is strong. But… if it is required by the insurance, I suppose I must. Just… tell me where to go. And how long it will take. I do not have much time. And make it quick, please. I need my hands. And I need to get back to work. This is… very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Kiwane. It is a little inconvenient, but it’s a good way to make sure everything is healthy. I’ll print out a lab requisition for you. The closest lab is at 142 Oak Street, it's a short drive from here. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes, and you don’t need an appointment. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks? That is… a long time. But I suppose it is necessary. Yes, two weeks is… acceptable. But if there is anything urgent, you will call me, yes? I need to know if there is a problem with my hands. They are… everything. Here. Do not hesitate to call. But only if it is important. I do not want to waste my time. And the time of the doctor, of course. This has been… a long morning.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kiwane. I will call you immediately if there’s anything urgent. And you can always reach me if you have any concerns. So, to recap: We’ve completed your welcome to Medicare physical exam, ordered some routine blood work, and scheduled a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I do not think so. I just… want to go home. And work. My hands… they need to work. This has been… a lot. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiwane. Get some rest and take care of yourself. And don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks. .
