DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. It’s about a letter, I think. Something about… a pet? My daughter, I believe, said I needed something from a doctor. Honestly, these things just… slip my mind. She handles most of it, you know? It’s probably for that little… fluffy thing she has. A dog, is it? I forget the breed.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see. Yes, I see here a request for a health certificate for your daughter’s dog, a Shih Tzu named Coco, for travel. It looks like she's planning a trip with Coco to Nigeria. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Nigeria, yes! That sounds right. She's always going back and forth. Honestly, I don’t keep up with all her travels. A Shih Tzu… is that one of those small, yappy ones? They shed everywhere, don't they? I just… don’t understand why anyone would want one. But, it’s her dog, I suppose. So, what does this letter need to say exactly?
DOCTOR: They can be a bit energetic, yes. Okay, so the airline requires a health certificate stating Coco is current on her vaccinations—specifically rabies—and is healthy enough to travel. It’s a pretty standard form. Have you taken Coco to a veterinarian recently?
PATIENT: A veterinarian… Hmm. I… I really can’t recall. She usually takes the dog, you know? I don’t do much with the animal myself. I think… maybe last year? Or was it the year before? Honestly, Doctor, it all blurs together. Is it necessary I remember?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's helpful to know roughly when Coco last had a rabies vaccine, as it needs to be current for the certificate to be valid. If we can’t confirm a recent vaccination, we’d need to give Coco a booster shot today and then wait a few days before issuing the certificate. Do you happen to have any vaccination records at home that your daughter might have given you?
PATIENT: Records? Oh, please. My daughter keeps everything digital, you know? I don't have time for paper clutter. And honestly, even if I did have something, I wouldn’t know where to begin looking. She handles all that. Is a booster… does that hurt the little thing? I don't want her upset with me.
DOCTOR: It's alright, don't worry. A rabies booster is a very small injection, and most dogs don't even notice it. There might be a tiny pinch, but it’s very quick. We can make Coco as comfortable as possible. To be sure, let's do a quick exam to check Coco's overall health. I'd like to listen to her heart and lungs, check her gums and teeth, and just make sure everything looks good before we proceed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, well, if it won’t bother the poor thing too much. But really, Doctor, she seems perfectly healthy to me. Runs around like a little maniac, if you ask me. But, I suppose you know these things. Fine, go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? And try to be quick about it. I have a luncheon later.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with listening to Coco’s heart and lungs. Can you tell me if Coco has any coughing, sneezing, or difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? Oh, goodness. I honestly don’t pay attention to those things. She just… yaps. A lot. I suppose if she was having trouble, my daughter would have said something. She’s very attentive to the dog. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not really the best person to ask about this. I mostly just avoid the shedding. Is it going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. We’ll keep it as brief as possible. I’m just checking to make sure there’s no swelling. Now, let’s take a quick look at her gums and teeth. Her gums look a bit pale, and I see some tartar buildup. Do you know if your daughter brushes Coco’s teeth regularly?
PATIENT: Tartar? Oh, dear! You mean she’s not keeping her teeth clean? Honestly, I've always said that dog needs more discipline. My daughter spoils her rotten. She probably lets her eat whatever she wants. I don’t know, Doctor. I truly don’t. She doesn’t tell me everything, you know? I just hope this isn't going to cost a fortune.
DOCTOR: Okay. The tartar buildup is something we should address with your daughter. It can lead to dental disease if left untreated. But for the health certificate, it’s not a major concern right now. Overall, Coco seems to be in relatively good health, but the pale gums are a little concerning. It could be due to a number of things – even just stress from being at the clinic. To be safe, I recommend we do a quick blood test to check her red blood cell count. It's a simple test, and it will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A blood test now?! Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous! It’s just a little dog! She’s always running around and yapping, she seems fine! I swear, my daughter is going to kill me if I come home with a bill for all of this. Is this blood test absolutely necessary for this letter? Can't we just… skip it? I really don’t think it’s worth all the fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Deloris. And you're right, it might not be necessary. However, the pale gums could indicate anemia or another underlying issue. A blood test would give us peace of mind and ensure Coco is healthy enough to travel, especially considering the long journey to Nigeria. It's a small precaution to prevent any problems along the way. If we skip it and Coco were to become ill during the trip, it could be a much bigger issue. We can proceed with just the vaccination update and the certificate if you prefer, but I strongly recommend the blood test for Coco’s wellbeing. It’s a quick and relatively inexpensive test. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. You're making me feel terrible now, aren't you? Fine. Fine! Do the test. But if it costs a fortune, I'm blaming you. And tell your assistant to hurry it up. I have a luncheon, you know. Honestly, a little dog… all this fuss… It's simply preposterous. .
