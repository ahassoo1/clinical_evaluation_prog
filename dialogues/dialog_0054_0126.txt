DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… excessively thirsty lately. And hungry. It’s quite bothersome, really. I seem to be drinking and eating far more than usual, and it’s not… satisfying the feeling, if that makes any sense. I was hoping you could have a look at it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Increased thirst and hunger can certainly be bothersome. Okay, so you've noticed an increase in both your thirst and appetite recently. When did you first start noticing this change?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… perhaps a month now? Maybe six weeks? It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual thing. I just found myself reaching for another glass of water more often, and feeling peckish between meals. At first, I thought it was just the warmer weather, but it hasn’t really let up, even with the cooler days we’ve been having.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a month to six weeks of gradually increasing thirst and hunger. And it's not clearly linked to the weather. Have you noticed any other changes alongside that?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I suppose… I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, now that you mention it. Just a general feeling of… sluggishness, I suppose. But I put that down to work, to be honest. Long hours, you know? I haven't really connected it to the thirst and hunger, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Fatigue can be caused by so many things. Let's try to see if we can narrow down what might be going on. Have you experienced any changes in your urination – frequency, amount, or color?
PATIENT: Urination… yes, I believe I have been going to the bathroom more often. I hadn’t really paid it much mind, to be honest. Just figured it was the extra fluids I’ve been taking in. No change in colour that I've noticed, and the amount seems… normal, I suppose. Perhaps a little more frequent, as I said. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve noticed that change in frequency. Increased urination along with increased thirst and hunger can be a sign of a few different things, and it’s important to investigate. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, I must confess. But… thinking about it, my clothes have felt a bit looser lately. Not a dramatic amount, mind you, but… enough to notice. Perhaps a few pounds? It’s difficult to say for certain. I haven’t been actively trying to lose weight, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible unintentional weight loss along with increased thirst, hunger, and urination. Let's move on to some other symptoms. Have you noticed any blurred vision, slow-healing sores, or frequent infections?
PATIENT: Blurred vision… no, not that I’m aware of. My eyesight’s always been a bit… questionable, so I’m used to things being slightly out of focus. Slow-healing sores… no, I haven’t cut myself or anything recently. And infections… no, nothing like that. I had a bit of a cold a few months ago, but that cleared up quickly enough. I suppose I've been a little more prone to getting colds recently, come to think of it. But I just put that down to the stress of work again.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions… I had a bout of indigestion a few years back, but it cleared up with some medication. I'm divorced, if that’s relevant. And I have private insurance, if you need to know that sort of thing. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I'm trying to recall anything that might be useful, but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. The divorce and insurance are good to know for administrative purposes, and no major medical history is good. Now, is there a family history of diabetes, kidney problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother had… well, she had some sort of illness when she was older. Something to do with her kidneys, I think. She was always a bit vague about it. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had… I believe it was diabetes. Type 2, I think. He was quite unwell towards the end. It was a long time ago, and my family isn’t particularly forthcoming with medical information, to be honest. They prefer not to dwell on these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible history of kidney problems in your mother and Type 2 diabetes in your grandfather. That's potentially relevant. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never been a smoker, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I work as a shipping, receiving, and inventory clerk, so it’s a fairly physical job. Long hours on my feet, mostly. Not much time for anything else, to be honest. Is that relevant? I’m simply trying to provide you with as much information as possible, so you can help me figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, thank you. Given your symptoms – increased thirst, hunger, urination, possible weight loss, family history of diabetes, and the fatigue – I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly sensible. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and investigate this properly. The sooner we figure out what's going on, the better. Please, go ahead with the exam and the tests. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let’s start with your vital signs. I’m just going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen feels normal. Given your symptoms and the family history, I’m going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel , a complete blood count , and a HbA1c test to check your average blood sugar levels over the past three months. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. A comprehensive panel, a count, and the… HbA1c, you said? Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to fast beforehand? I have work tomorrow, you see. I’m trying to minimise disruption as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Good. The HbA1c doesn't require fasting, but the CMP does. Ideally, we'd need you to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning before you go to work. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid sugary drinks. If you notice any significant changes in your symptoms – like increased confusion, dizziness, or excessive fatigue – please call the office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fast for eight to twelve hours, blood draw tomorrow morning, results in two days… avoid sugar. And call if things worsen. I've made a note of everything. Thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I’ll be sure to follow your instructions. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. No, I don't think so. Just try not to worry too much until we have the results. It’s important to rule out any potential underlying causes, and that’s what we’re doing. My assistant will schedule the blood draw and give you a printed copy of the instructions before you leave. If you have any questions after you’ve left, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Alright, if you’ll follow me, I'll have the assistant take care of scheduling the tests for you and we will go from there. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and assistance. I'll follow you, then. I trust your assistant will provide me with clear instructions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
