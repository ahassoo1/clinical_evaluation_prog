DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Auelua, you say? Hmm. Yes, well, it’s… a rather delicate matter, really. I don't quite relish discussing it, but my wife insisted. There's... a bit of a discharge. An unpleasantness, if you will. It’s been going on for... oh, I couldn’t say exactly how long. A while, certainly. It’s simply not dignified.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I appreciate you doing so. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of it. When you say discharge, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? Goodness. Well… it’s… moist. That’s the best way to put it, I suppose. Not a flood, mind you, but… noticeable. And… yellowish. A rather sickly yellow, actually. Not at all pleasant to look at. It doesn’t hurt, precisely, but it’s… irritating. A constant… awareness. I’ve been trying to keep things… clean, naturally. But it persists. Is that helpful, Doctor? I feel rather foolish describing this.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Krok, and you’re not foolish at all. It's important information. So, it’s a yellowish discharge, not causing pain, but more of an irritation, and you've been keeping the area clean. To help me understand a bit better, is this discharge coming from your urethra – that's the opening where you urinate – or somewhere else?
PATIENT: Urethra? Goodness me. Well, let me think… It certainly feels like it’s coming from… there. Where one… urinates, as you say. Though I haven’t examined it myself, naturally. I'm no medical man. My wife mentioned something about it being… inside? But I couldn’t possibly say with any certainty. Honestly, Doctor, I find this whole discussion rather… undignified. Is it necessary to be so… specific?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. I apologize if I'm being too specific. It is necessary, though, to get a clear picture so I can best help you. Just knowing it’s generally from the urethral area is a good start. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. Well, I have been feeling a bit… tired lately, but at my age, isn't everyone? And perhaps a little… shaky. But that could be the coffee. My wife makes it awfully strong. And… oh, yes. I’ve been going to the lavatory more frequently. Just a little at a time, mind you, but more often than usual. Is that what you mean by symptoms? It’s all rather confusing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, that’s very helpful. Tiredness, shakiness—which we’ll keep in mind could be related to the coffee—and increased frequency of urination. Have you noticed any burning or pain while you urinate, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Thank goodness for that. And no, no burning, either. Just… the frequent urge to go. It’s a mild discomfort, really. More annoying than anything. It doesn’t hurt, as I said. But… well, my wife has been rather insistent that I come see you. She says it’s a sign of something… serious. She worries terribly, you see. Always has. Is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your wife’s concern, and it's good she encouraged you to come in. It's certainly good you came to get it checked out. While those symptoms can be related to more serious conditions, they can also be caused by things that are easily treatable. Now, Mr. Krok, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a gentle external examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An examination? Oh. Goodness. Well… I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? I’m not a fan of doctors, never have been. But if you think it’s necessary… very well. Just… be gentle, if you would. And perhaps don’t say too much while you’re… examining. I'm a rather modest man, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. I understand your modesty, and I'll explain what I'm doing as I go. Alright, Mr. Krok, I'm just listening to your abdomen now. Do you feel any tenderness anywhere when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. Just… a bit uncomfortable being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind me saying so. It's not painful, precisely, but… unsettling. I've always been rather sensitive. My wife says I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, but I think she exaggerates. Just continue, Doctor. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, I’m just feeling around the area now. I’m not seeing anything visually concerning externally. There's a little bit of redness around the urethral opening, but nothing significant. No obvious swelling or masses. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to collect a urine sample. Would you be able to do that for me?
PATIENT: A urine sample? Oh, dear. Must I? It seems terribly… undignified. I suppose it's unavoidable, though. Is there a… private facility? I wouldn’t want anyone overhearing. And are there specific instructions? My wife is always fussing about proper procedures. She read something in a magazine once about… contamination, I think it was.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, there’s a private restroom just down the hall. And yes, proper procedure is important. I'll give you a sterile cup and instructions. It's a “clean catch” sample – that means we want to collect a mid-stream sample. I’ll show you exactly what that means, but basically, you’ll start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream into the cup. Do your best to avoid touching the inside of the cup. I have a pamphlet with detailed instructions as well, if you'd like. Let me know if you have any trouble. Would you like me to show you the restroom?
PATIENT: A pamphlet? Goodness me. It's all rather involved, isn’t it? Yes, please. A demonstration would be most helpful. I'm not as nimble as I once was, you see. And the idea of a… clean catch. It all sounds rather complicated. Lead the way, Doctor. I trust it's not too far? And is there somewhere to… wash one’s hands afterwards?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. It’s just down this hallway. The pamphlet details everything, but the important thing is to start urinating for a few seconds, then collect the sample mid-stream. That will help us get a cleaner result. And yes, there’s a sink and soap right here for washing your hands afterwards. Take your time. I'll be right here when you’re finished. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any assistance.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to follow your instructions to the letter. It's all rather… disconcerting, but I suppose it must be done. Don't hesitate to summon me if I’m unduly delayed. I haven't had practice with such procedures in… decades.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Just a moment, Doctor! I’m… attempting to comply with your instructions. It’s not as easy as it looks, you know!
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: There! I believe I've managed it. Though I daresay it wasn’t a particularly elegant performance. Here you are, Doctor. Handle with care, if you would.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. You did just fine. Really. That’s perfect. Now, I'll send this sample to the lab for analysis. It should take a couple of days to get the results back. While we wait, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… Hmm. Let me see. I had the measles as a boy, of course. And a rather nasty bout of influenza in nineteen-sixty-seven. Other than that… nothing much. My wife keeps telling me I should have gone for regular checkups, but I've always been rather… averse to doctors, you see. And surgery? No, never. Thankfully. I’ve always prided myself on my good health. Until recently, of course. Do you require any further details, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, that's good for now, Mr. Krok. And that’s understandable about being averse to doctors. You mentioned your wife – is she generally in good health?
PATIENT: Yes, thankfully. She's a bit of a worrier, as I mentioned, but otherwise quite robust for her age. She keeps active, always gardening or baking. Drives me mad sometimes, with all the fussing, but she means well. She was quite insistent I come here, you know. Said I was ignoring the problem. She's quite… persuasive, my wife. A strong woman, always has been.
DOCTOR: It sounds like she cares for you very much. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. A small white pill, once a day. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take a bit of ibuprofen. Nothing more, I assure you. I’ve always been rather careful about taking pills. Don’t like the idea of putting unnecessary chemicals into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. What about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me see… I don't think so. I've never had any particularly nasty reactions to anything. A bit of a sniffle sometimes with the pollen in the spring, but that's all. My wife is a bit allergic to cats, but I'm not, thankfully. Always liked a good purring feline myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, before we wrap up, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Goodness. Well, I'm retired now, of course. Used to be a mechanic, fixed tractors and such. Quite strenuous work, but I enjoyed it. Nowadays, I mostly potter about in the garden. And read. History books, mostly. A bit of a sedentary existence, I suppose. I enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning, and a small glass of wine with dinner. Nothing excessive, mind you. And I try to get a bit of fresh air whenever the weather permits. A simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok, that’s very helpful. Now, we’ll send your urine sample to the lab, and we should have results back in a few days. While we wait, it's possible this is a simple urinary tract infection. We'll have to confirm with the lab results. I'll call you as soon as they are back. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids – water is best. If you experience any fever, chills, or worsening pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough, I must say. Although… I do hope it isn't anything too serious. My wife will be terribly upset if it is. And she'll have a lot to say about it, I can assure you. But thank you for your time, Doctor. And your patience. It's not easy discussing such… delicate matters.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. I completely understand. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I’m glad you did. We'll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll call you as soon as the results are back. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, Mr. Krok.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
