DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. It's lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Ka Gegan. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Gegan. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received a letter about some tests… an examination of my stomach and intestines, I believe? The results weren’t entirely clear, and I was advised to come in for a discussion. It concerned me a little, so I thought it best to hear what you had to say directly. Perhaps you could explain it to me?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Denis. I understand your concern, and I'm happy to go over those results with you. Let me pull up your file here… Ah, yes, I see the report from the endoscopy and colonoscopy. Before we dive into the specifics, could you tell me a little bit about why those tests were ordered in the first place?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, for the past few months, I've been experiencing some… discomfort. Mostly in my stomach, a sort of ache that comes and goes. And, if I’m being honest, my… bathroom habits haven’t been quite regular. I apologize for being so blunt, Doctor, but I thought it best to be thorough. It wasn’t anything terribly alarming at first, just a little different than usual, but it persisted, and my previous doctor thought it prudent to investigate further. That’s when the tests were ordered.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Denis. It’s very important to be thorough, and I appreciate you sharing that information with me. It's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable discussing these things. So, this discomfort... could you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… difficult to pinpoint, exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a cramp. More of a dull ache, a heaviness. It tends to come and go, often after I eat. It doesn’t happen every time I eat, but frequently enough to be concerning. Sometimes it radiates a little to my back, but it's not a severe pain, just… noticeable. And it's worse when I lie down, I’ve found. It’s rather bothersome, really. I’ve been trying to manage it with antacids, but they don’t always provide much relief.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes, often after eating, radiates to your back sometimes, worse when lying down, and not fully relieved by antacids. That gives me a better picture. Now, regarding your bathroom habits – could you tell me a little more about what’s been different?
PATIENT: Well… it's been a change in frequency, mostly. I’ve been going less often than usual, and when I do go, it’s… harder. More straining, you understand? And the… consistency isn’t quite right, either. It’s not diarrhea, certainly, but not the usual solid form. A bit… looser, shall we say. And occasionally… there’s been a bit of blood. Not a large amount, mind you, but enough to notice on the paper. That, of course, is what prompted me to see the doctor in the first place, and then the tests. I haven't felt weak or anything like that, and my appetite is still good. But I do worry, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis, thank you for being so open. Change in frequency, straining, looser consistency, and noticing some blood – those are all important details. It's good that you haven't experienced weakness, but the blood is definitely something we need to address. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, but it's been well-managed with medication for many years. Other than that, nothing significant. I had a rather nasty bout of influenza a few years back, but I recovered fully. I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, of course, but that was many years ago and hasn’t caused any issues. My husband… he passed away five years ago, and I believe he had some heart trouble, but that was his problem, not mine. I’ve never smoked, and I only drink alcohol on very rare occasions – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, a few times a year. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I also walk every morning, if the weather permits.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Denis. So, well-controlled high blood pressure, hysterectomy in the past, and a generally healthy lifestyle. Now, let's talk about medications. You mentioned medication for your blood pressure – can you tell me the name and dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's Lisinopril, and I take 20 milligrams every morning. I've been on that dosage for about ten years now, and my blood pressure has been stable ever since. My previous doctor checked it regularly, and it was always within the normal range. I also take a daily multivitamin, but that’s just a general health supplement, nothing specific. And sometimes, when my stomach is particularly upset, I take an over-the-counter antacid, like Tums, but as I said, it doesn’t always help. I make sure to take my Lisinopril at the same time every day, as instructed by my doctor. I try to be very diligent about that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily, a multivitamin, and occasional Tums. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I can eat all sorts of foods without any problems, and I’ve never had any issues with insect bites or anything like that. I’ve always considered myself to be quite fortunate in that regard. My husband, however, was allergic to penicillin, but that’s not a concern for me. I’ve never had any skin rashes or breathing difficulties after taking any medication or eating any particular food. I’ve never had a problem with latex, either. I do try to avoid shellfish, simply because I don’t particularly like the taste, but that’s not an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Denis. No known allergies. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, there are a few. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she suffered with that for many years before she passed away. My father had heart disease, although he didn’t seek treatment until it was quite advanced. And my brother, he was diagnosed with colon cancer about ten years ago. He underwent surgery and chemotherapy, and thankfully, he’s been in remission for several years now. My husband’s side of the family… his mother had arthritis, and his father had high blood pressure, much like myself. I believe that’s the most significant medical history on both sides of the family. It does worry me somewhat, naturally, given my brother’s diagnosis. But I try to stay positive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Denis, particularly with your brother’s history of colon cancer. That definitely gives us something to keep in mind. Okay. Now, let's talk about the results of your endoscopy and colonoscopy. The report indicates some inflammation in the stomach and colon, and several polyps were found in the colon. The polyps were removed during the colonoscopy and sent to pathology. The pathology report shows that the polyps were adenomatous, which means they had the potential to become cancerous. Fortunately, they were removed completely, and there’s no evidence of cancer at this time. However, given your family history and the nature of the polyps, we need to monitor you closely.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Adenomatous… that sounds rather serious. So, the polyps weren’t cancerous, yet, but they could have become cancerous? And my brother… it’s all rather frightening. What does "monitor closely" entail, exactly? Will I need more tests? And is this… is this something I should be worried about? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I’m rather anxious now. It’s just… my brother, and the possibility of cancer… it’s all quite overwhelming. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms? I’m not very good with medical jargon, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you're anxious, Denis. It’s okay to be overwhelmed. And please, don't apologize for the questions at all. It's my job to explain things clearly. Let’s break it down. "Adenomatous" simply means the polyps had the potential to become cancerous over time. Think of it like a seed - it doesn’t mean there is a plant, just that it could grow into one. Fortunately, we found them and removed them before they had a chance to develop into cancer. "Monitor closely" means we'll need to do regular colonoscopies to check for any new polyps. The frequency will depend on the initial findings, but typically, we'd recommend one every 3-5 years. This allows us to catch anything early and remove it before it becomes a problem. Your brother's history is important, and it's good that you’re aware of it. It does increase your risk, but it also means we're being proactive in monitoring you. Think of it like a preventative measure. We're not necessarily expecting to find anything, but we're checking just in case. We want to catch anything early, if it does develop, so it's easily treatable. It doesn't mean you will get cancer, just that we’re taking extra precautions. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does make a lot more sense, Doctor. Like a preventative measure… a sort of early warning system. I understand now. So, regular colonoscopies, every three to five years, to check for any new polyps. And because of my brother’s history, it’s more important to be vigilant. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. It's still concerning, naturally, but I feel much less anxious knowing what to expect. What about the inflammation in my stomach? You mentioned inflammation… is that related to the polyps in the colon? And is there anything I can do to reduce the inflammation? I’ve been trying to eat a healthier diet, but perhaps I need to make some changes. Are there any foods I should avoid? Or any lifestyle changes that might help? I want to do everything I can to stay healthy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I'm glad I could clarify things. It’s excellent that you’re taking such a proactive approach to your health. Regarding the inflammation in your stomach, it’s likely not directly related to the polyps in the colon, although they can sometimes occur together. The inflammation could be caused by several factors, such as diet, stress, or an underlying condition like gastritis. We can investigate further with some additional tests, if you'd like. A simple blood test can rule out Helicobacter pylori infection, a common cause of gastritis. And we could consider an upper endoscopy to get a closer look at your stomach lining. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to reduce the inflammation on your own. Avoiding foods that irritate your stomach, such as spicy foods, acidic foods, and caffeine, can help. Eating smaller, more frequent meals can also be beneficial. And managing stress through relaxation techniques, like yoga or meditation, can make a big difference. We can also discuss some medications to help reduce stomach acid, if needed. Would you like to proceed with the blood test to check for H. pylori infection?
PATIENT: Yes, please, I would very much like to proceed with the blood test. H. pylori… it’s best to rule everything out, as you say. I’m happy to avoid spicy foods and caffeine, and I will certainly try to manage my stress levels. I do enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, but my health is more important. And I will definitely look into relaxation techniques. Yoga sounds… manageable. So, a blood test to check for this H. pylori, and then we can discuss the results and proceed from there. Is there anything else I should be aware of at this time? Any specific symptoms I should watch out for? Or any warning signs that I should report immediately? I want to be prepared, Doctor. I always feel better when I have a plan.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Denis. We'll get that blood test ordered right away. As for specific symptoms to watch for, pay attention to any persistent abdominal pain, especially if it's severe or accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or fever. Any blood in your stool, even a small amount, should be reported immediately. And if you experience unexplained weight loss or difficulty swallowing, please contact us right away. These are unlikely to occur, but it's always best to be vigilant. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or so to discuss the results of the blood test and develop a more detailed plan. In the meantime, continue to focus on healthy eating, stress management, and avoiding foods that irritate your stomach. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything for now, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and informative. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly and patiently. It’s reassuring to know that we have a plan, and that you’re being proactive in monitoring my health. I will schedule a follow-up appointment, and I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes. Thank you again for your time and expertise, Doctor Gegan. I feel much more at ease now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw the blood for the H. pylori test. Have a wonderful day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
