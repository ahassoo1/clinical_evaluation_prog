DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this…feeling full real quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a big meal. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It's kinda worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food, for about a month. That is concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe that feeling of fullness a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it’s not pain, exactly. More like…pressure, I guess? Right here, under my ribs. And it’s not like I can’t eat, I just…don’t want to. It feels like there’s no room, even when there should be. It’s a strange feeling. Like a balloon, almost, filling up too fast. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – pressure under the ribs, a feeling of fullness quickly, even though you haven’t eaten much. And it’s not painful, just uncomfortable. A "balloon" feeling is a good way to describe it. Now, has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. Lots of fish, some rice, vegetables when my wife makes ‘em. We don’t eat a lot of processed foods, thankfully. She’s a good cook. No, it’s not anything I’ve changed, that's for sure. I haven’t started eating anything new or different. Though…I think I’ve been a bit less active lately, with the weather being so hot. We haven’t been going for our usual walks as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes to your diet, but perhaps a decrease in activity level with the warmer weather. That’s helpful to know. And how about any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. I've been a bit tired, I suppose. Not sick tired, just…more worn out than usual. And sometimes, after I eat, I feel a little bit nauseous, but I haven’t actually been sick. Just a queasy feeling. And…oh, I’ve been burping more. A lot more. It's kinda embarrassing, to be honest. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important things to know, Mr. Obarr. The fatigue, nausea after eating, and increased burping – they all give me a better picture of what might be going on. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s fine, go ahead. Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, must be thirty years now. And I had high blood pressure for a while, but my wife keeps me on track with my diet, and it’s been pretty good lately. The doctor said it was under control at my last checkup…that was a couple of years ago, though. No other big things, not that I remember. I’ve been lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago and previously managed high blood pressure, currently well-controlled. That's good to know. And you haven’t had any surgeries other than the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that wasn’t a surgery. Just a cast. My wife always said I was too adventurous for my own good. She was right, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother had some trouble with her stomach, always complaining of indigestion. And my brother, he had ulcers when he was younger. Other than that, not much I can think of. My wife’s side of the family, they seem pretty healthy, for the most part. Long-lived, at least. I don’t think anyone had anything…serious, like cancer or heart trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of some stomach issues and ulcers, but no major illnesses like cancer or heart trouble that you're aware of. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. It’s a cream, I rub it on my hands and knees. Nothing I take by mouth. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little bit of melatonin. But that’s it. Really. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a topical cream for arthritis and occasional melatonin for sleep. That’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. My wife always checks before I try anything new, bless her. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I've been pretty lucky that way too, I suppose. She's a real one, she is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Obarr. Alright, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently feel your abdomen to see if we can get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know if anything feels…uncomfortable. I've been examined by doctors before, I'm not shy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Obarr, I'm listening to your heart and lungs now…everything sounds good. I’m feeling your abdomen now. I do notice some mild tenderness when I press here, under your ribs on the right side. It doesn't seem to be causing you any sharp pain, just a little discomfort, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. That’s where it feels…full, like I said. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s definitely uncomfortable when you press there. Like a pressure, almost. And it seems to bother me more after I eat, even just a little bit. It’s not terrible, but it’s there. It's been bothering me enough to come see you, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. I don't feel any masses or anything that immediately raises concern, Mr. Obarr. Based on what you've told me, and the mild tenderness I’m feeling, it sounds like you might be experiencing some early signs of gallbladder issues, even though you had it removed a long time ago. Sometimes, bile ducts can develop strictures or inflammation after gallbladder removal, and that can cause similar symptoms. Another possibility could be gastritis or a peptic ulcer, although the location of the tenderness makes that less likely. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and an amylase and lipase level. We may also need to consider an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, bile ducts, and pancreas. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an ultrasound…yes, that sounds sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. It’s a relief to finally be looking into this, to be honest. It's been worrying me. I'm happy to do whatever you think will help figure out what’s going on. When can we get those tests done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel that way, Mr. Obarr. We can get those tests done right here at the clinic today. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work, and the lab technician will come in shortly to draw the samples. I’ll also schedule you for an abdominal ultrasound for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any particularly fatty or greasy foods, as those can exacerbate your symptoms. And if you experience any sudden worsening of your pain, fever, or nausea, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. No fatty foods, and watch out for anything getting worse. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure this out. It makes me feel a lot better knowing we’re doing something about it. My wife will be pleased too. She’s been worried about me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help, and I’m happy to hear your wife is supportive. We'll get these tests done and hopefully have some answers for you soon. The lab technician will be with you shortly. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I'll just wait for the lab technician then. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If anything comes to mind after you leave, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. I’ll see you tomorrow morning for your ultrasound. Have a good day, Mr. Obarr.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again.
