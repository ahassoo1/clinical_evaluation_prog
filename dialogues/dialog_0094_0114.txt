DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Vanderwiele is the name. It's nice to meet you as well. I'm here because… well, it’s hard to explain. When I lie flat, I get very short of breath. It started a few weeks ago, I believe. Perhaps a month. It’s quite bothersome when I try to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. It sounds concerning that you're experiencing shortness of breath when lying flat. A month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly a month. Maybe a little longer. It doesn't happen all the time, just when I'm trying to sleep or rest on my back. I have to prop myself up with pillows, you see. Several pillows. It’s not very comfortable, but it’s better than… well, than not being able to breathe. I don’t know what's causing it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Propping yourself up with pillows is a good indication something isn't quite right when you lie down. And it's good you're paying attention to that. So, just to clarify, does this shortness of breath wake you up at night, or does it only happen when you try to lie down?
PATIENT: It usually happens when I try to lie down. I haven’t had it wake me up, thankfully. I usually notice it before I get too comfortable, and then I adjust my pillows. It’s… a preventative measure, you could say. I don't want to be gasping for air in the middle of the night. It frightens me to even think of it.
DOCTOR: That's very insightful of you to notice and adjust before it gets severe, Maribeth. And it's perfectly reasonable to be frightened by that possibility. Besides the shortness of breath when lying down, have you noticed any other symptoms – perhaps any swelling in your ankles or feet, or a cough, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Swelling... let me think. My ankles do feel a little puffy sometimes, but I always thought that was just from being on my feet too long. I do a lot of work at the library, you see. As for a cough... not really. A little tickle in my throat occasionally, but nothing that would concern me. And no, no chest pain at all. Just this…difficulty breathing when I’m lying down. It’s mostly that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild ankle swelling that you attribute to being on your feet a lot, a little throat tickle, and the primary issue being the shortness of breath when lying flat. That's helpful. Now, have you had any changes in your diet recently, or have you noticed any weight gain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all in my diet. I eat pretty much the same things I’ve always eaten. And no weight gain, either. I’ve actually lost a little weight, I think. It’s hard to say for sure, but my clothes feel a little looser. It's probably just old age, though.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Maribeth. Weight loss can be significant, even if unintentional, so it's good you've noticed that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had high blood pressure for a time, quite a few years ago. But the doctor put me on medication, and it’s been under control ever since. I don’t believe I have diabetes. And no heart problems, as far as I know. I see my regular doctor for check-ups every year, and he hasn't mentioned anything about my heart. Just the blood pressure, which, again, is managed with pills. I take them every day, without fail.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-managed hypertension is good to hear. And it sounds like you’re diligent about taking your medication. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, yes. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. That was in… 1987, I believe. A fairly routine surgery, as I recall. And I was hospitalized once when I was a child with pneumonia, but that was a very long time ago. Otherwise, no. No other surgeries or hospital stays. Nothing significant, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal in 1987 and a childhood case of pneumonia. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, lung problems, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult question. My mother had…well, she had some sort of heart trouble later in life, I believe. But she didn't go to the doctor much, so I don’t know the specifics. And my father… he was a healthy man, as far as I know. No lung problems or anything like that. My sister, she has arthritis, but that's about it. Nothing too concerning, really. We weren't a family that talked much about our health.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of some heart trouble in your mother, and arthritis in your sister. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None at all. I can take most medications without any trouble. And I haven’t had any allergic reactions to food, either. I eat pretty much anything. I’m quite fortunate in that regard. I remember my sister used to be terribly allergic to bee stings, but I’ve never had that problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me what medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take lisinopril, that's for the blood pressure. I believe it’s 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a calcium supplement, just to keep my bones strong. That’s about it. Two pills every day. Nothing fancy. I have them right here in my purse, if you’d like to see the bottles.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Maribeth. Lisinopril 20mg for blood pressure and a calcium supplement. No need to dig them out right now, I can access that information in your chart as well. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your ankles. That will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels…unusual.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Maribeth, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, both in the front and the back. Please breathe normally. Your breathing sounds a little diminished at the bases of your lungs, and I hear some mild crackles, particularly on the left side. Your heart sounds regular, but there’s a slight murmur, which we'll need to investigate further. Now, let's check your ankles for swelling. There’s some mild pitting edema in both ankles, but it’s not severe. Your pulses are good and strong, though. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some early signs of congestive heart failure. The shortness of breath when lying flat, the crackles in your lungs, and the swelling in your ankles are all consistent with that. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm that diagnosis. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, and I also want to check your blood levels of BNP, which is a marker for heart failure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? That sounds… serious. I haven't felt particularly ill, just… tired, and a little breathless. I didn’t realize it could be something so grave. Yes, of course, Doctor. If you think those tests are necessary, please order them. Whatever you believe is best. I… I suppose I always feared something like this might happen eventually, given my mother’s heart trouble. But I didn’t expect it to be me. Could you… could you explain a little more about what that means? And what we would do if… if it is congestive heart failure?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling anxious, Maribeth. It is a serious condition, but it’s also very treatable, especially when caught early. Congestive heart failure doesn’t mean your heart has stopped working, it means it’s not pumping as efficiently as it should be. This can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body, which explains the shortness of breath and swelling you’ve been experiencing. The tests I’ve ordered will help us determine the severity of the condition and what's causing it. The chest X-ray will show us if there’s fluid in your lungs, and the EKG will check your heart’s electrical activity. The BNP blood test will measure the level of a hormone released when your heart is under strain. If it is congestive heart failure, the treatment typically involves medications to help your heart pump more efficiently, reduce fluid buildup, and lower your blood pressure. We may also recommend lifestyle changes like reducing your salt intake, limiting your fluid intake, and getting regular exercise. In some cases, more advanced treatments may be necessary, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the chest X-ray and EKG. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: That…that does make me feel a little better, Doctor. Knowing there are treatments available is a relief. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. Salt and fluids…yes, I can certainly try to cut back on those. I do enjoy a little salt on my eggs, but I can manage. And I suppose I could drink a little less coffee as well, though that will be difficult! The tests… where will those be done? And how long will it take to get the results? I do have a library board meeting next week, and I wouldn’t want to miss that if possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Maribeth. Small changes can make a big difference. As for the tests, the blood draw will be done right here in the clinic. The EKG and chest X-ray will be done at the imaging center across the street – the nurse will give you the instructions and schedule those appointments before you leave. Typically, the results come back within a couple of days. I should have them by the end of next week, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them and create a treatment plan if needed. I will call you with the results as soon as I have them. I understand you have a library board meeting, and I will do my best to make sure we have the results before then so you don’t have to worry about it. Is there anything else on your mind right now, Maribeth?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve answered all my questions. Just…thank you for being so patient and explaining everything so thoroughly. It’s a great weight off my mind, even though I am still a little anxious about the results. I will go get the blood drawn and schedule the other tests now. Please… please don’t hesitate to call me if anything urgent comes up. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. You’ve been very brave through all of this. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you. And I will certainly call you immediately if anything urgent arises. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. .
