DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s get on with it. I need a quick check-up before I… well, before I get some work done. Cosmetic surgery clearance, is that what you call it? My daughter insisted I come. Honestly, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right. Cosmetic surgery clearance. Well, that does require a check-up, Mr. Orwin, despite your daughter's… concerns. It's not just a rubber stamp, you know. We need to make sure you're healthy enough for the procedure. So, tell me, what surgery are you planning to have?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's none of your business what I’m getting done. But if you must know, it’s a… a face lift. Getting a little saggy, you see. And it's distracting. I used to lay terrazzo, precise work, you understand. Can’t have a face that’s all… droopy. Is that alright? Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, a facelift. I understand wanting to maintain your appearance, Mr. Orwin. It is my business insofar as it impacts your health and ability to recover safely. Let’s start with your general health. Do you have any existing medical conditions – anything at all, like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor told me years ago, when my wife was still… around. Put me on pills for a bit, then said I didn’t really need them. Stopped taking them. Been fine ever since. Otherwise, no. I worked hard my whole life, laying terrazzo. Good, honest work. Keeps a man strong. What else do you need to know? I don’t go to doctors unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a history of potential high blood pressure, but currently not on any medications. That’s… good to know. And you said you haven’t been to a doctor regularly since then?
PATIENT: Regularly? Heavens, no. Last time was probably for a bad cough, ten years ago, maybe more. Waste of time, most of it. Just tell you to drink more water and get more rest. I do rest when I need to. After all, a man can’t lay terrazzo forever. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to talk about my life story?
DOCTOR: We are trying to gather necessary information, Mr. Orwin. A history of infrequent medical care is, unfortunately, relevant. Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My appendix, when I was a boy. Standard stuff. And… oh, a bad knee, years ago. Football injury. They patched it up. Nothing major, really. No other surgeries. I’ve been remarkably lucky, all things considered. I’ve always been a strong man. Built like a… well, you wouldn't understand. Terrazzo workers aren’t built like these… city folk.
DOCTOR: Right. Appendectomy and a knee repair. Okay. And what about medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis now and then. When it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think? The kind you get over the counter. Don't bother writing that down, it’s hardly important. A little ache in the joints, it comes with age. It doesn’t stop me from… well, it doesn’t stop me. Are we done yet? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. We'll make a note of it. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. A good Scandinavian diet, you know. Fish, potatoes… strong food. Never had an allergy in my life. My wife, bless her soul, she was the delicate one. Always worried about what she ate. Me? I'll eat anything put in front of me. Now, can we please get this over with? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. It's standard procedure. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure—despite what you said about it—and take a look at your overall health. Then we can discuss if you’re a suitable candidate for surgery. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Don't expect me to be impressed. I've had doctors poke and prod me before. But don’t take all day, alright? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned. And try not to breathe so heavily while you listen to my heart. It’s distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit back and relax. Your heart sounds… slightly irregular. A bit of a murmur. And your blood pressure is 145/90. That is elevated, Mr. Orwin. Your pulse is also a bit fast. And somewhat weak. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished. Okay. We need to run some tests before we can clear you for surgery. I want an EKG, a full blood panel, and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Tests? Now you're telling me tests? I told you, I haven’t got time for tests! I came here for a clearance, not a medical examination. My daughter said you’d just take a quick look. This is ridiculous. Look, can’t you just… sign off on it? I’m a strong man. I can handle a little face lift. I've laid terrazzo for fifty years, you know! That's harder than any surgery. This is a waste of my time. I'm leaving. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically clear you for surgery without knowing your current health status. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated, your heart sounds irregular, and your reflexes are diminished. These are serious concerns. I strongly advise you to get these tests done. I'm concerned about the risk of complications during and after the procedure. I will not sign off on this without further investigation. It would be irresponsible of me. Perhaps you should discuss this with your daughter. She may have legitimate concerns. .
