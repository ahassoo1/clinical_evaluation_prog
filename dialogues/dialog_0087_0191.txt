DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. That's a very responsible decision, Ms. Shaub. We can absolutely get that done for you today. To ensure we have a complete picture, I’ll need to ask a few questions first, if that's alright. It will help me understand your risk factors and ensure the most appropriate testing and follow-up. Do you have any concerns about discussing this information?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Ask away. I understand it's important, and I want to be thorough. I’m a pretty open person, so there's nothing I’m ashamed to discuss. It’s better to know, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It absolutely is. Let's start with a bit of your history. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. This is my first time. I… honestly, it wasn’t something people talked about much when I was younger. And… well, life gets in the way, you know? I kept putting it off. But I feel it’s important now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s never too late to get tested. Now, can you tell me a little about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That's a bit personal, isn’t it? I've been married for… forty years now, to my husband, David. We’ve only ever been with each other. However… David and I… we weren’t always faithful. A long time ago, early in our marriage, we both… made mistakes. It was a difficult time, and we haven’t spoken about it much since. It was… before we had children.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information with me, Ms. Shaub. It takes courage to be so open. Knowing this history is important. When did these… instances occur, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It must have been… the late seventies, early eighties. It was a very different time then. We were… young and foolish, I suppose. It was before the AIDS crisis really became well-known, before people understood the dangers. Honestly, it was a long time ago, and it’s… difficult to recall the exact dates. Perhaps… 1978 to 1982? It wasn’t a prolonged thing, thankfully. Just… a few regrettable moments.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And since then, you’ve remained exclusively with your husband?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Absolutely. Since then, it’s just been David and me. We’ve been very committed to each other since… well, since we worked through that difficult patch. We’ve raised our children, built a life together… it’s been forty years of… mostly happiness. We haven't… sought anyone else. I can assure you of that.
DOCTOR: Good. And have either of you ever shared needles with anyone, even for medical purposes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Definitely not. David and I… we’ve always been very careful with things like that. We’ve both had medical procedures over the years, of course, but everything has always been with new, sterile equipment. We wouldn't risk something like that. No, never.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of sexually transmitted infections, besides what you've already shared?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. We weren't very… active even before that period, and we’ve always been careful about protection when we… weren’t as careful as we should have been. We've never discussed anything, never experienced any symptoms. Honestly, it's been… a long time. I don't recall ever having anything like that. I would have known, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You would likely have known, yes. But it’s good to ask. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I’ve had the usual things over the years – a bit of penicillin as a child, some antihistamines for hay fever… but nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I've never needed a lot of medication, thankfully. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Good. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. My doctor prescribed amlodipine about five years ago. It keeps things stable, thankfully. Otherwise, just a multivitamin every now and then, and sometimes some ibuprofen for aches and pains. Nothing regular, really. Just those two things, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine. And do you have any significant medical problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, my blood pressure is what I mentioned, and I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, which is why I sometimes take the ibuprofen. Nothing too serious. I had a hysterectomy many years ago, but that’s all been resolved. And I used to have migraines, but those haven’t bothered me in years. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy for my age, I think. I try to eat well and stay active, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, finally, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any known cases of HIV or AIDS in your family?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. My family… we’re a fairly close-knit group, and something like that… we would have known. We haven’t had any… illnesses of that nature. My parents both lived long, healthy lives. My siblings are all doing well. It’s never been discussed, never been a concern. No, thankfully, there’s no family history of HIV or AIDS.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub. Thank you for being so thorough and open with me. That gives me a good understanding of your situation. Now, to proceed with the HIV testing, we will need to draw a small sample of blood. We'll also perform a rapid antibody test today. This will give us initial results within about 20 minutes, and then we'll send off a more comprehensive test to confirm. Do you have any questions for me before we move forward?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Twenty minutes isn't long at all. Will it be painful? I'm not a fan of needles, if I'm honest. And… what if it is positive? What happens then? I'm a bit anxious, I suppose. It’s been a long time, and… well, this is a bit scary.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, Ms. Shaub, and I commend you for facing this. The blood draw itself is a quick pinch – most people don't find it particularly painful. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it will be over before you know it. As for a positive result… if that were to happen, it wouldn't be a death sentence. HIV is a manageable condition these days. With medication, people living with HIV can live long, healthy lives. We would immediately connect you with a specialist who can discuss treatment options and provide ongoing care. We would also offer support and counseling to help you cope with the diagnosis. We would work with you every step of the way. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that… that does make sense. It's just… a lot to take in. I suppose I've been worrying needlessly all these years. And you say it's manageable now? Truly? I remember when… when it was a terrible, awful disease. Okay. Let's… let's get the test done. I want to know, one way or another. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shaub. You are very brave for doing this. Let me call the phlebotomist, and she will come in and take care of the blood draw. I’ll be right here in the office if you need anything at all. Please, just let me know if you feel faint or uncomfortable during the process. We will take good care of you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose there's nothing left to do but wait.
DOCTOR: She's ready for you now, Ms. Shaub. She'll explain the process briefly. I'll be just outside, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they are available. Remember, you can call out if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor.
