DOCTOR: Right. Cleo Rover, 47. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… well, it’s about… insurance. My wife, she… she used to take care of all that stuff. Long-term care, I think? Something about helpin’ with things later on. I got a letter, sayin’ I needed to come in for an assessment. It’s all kinda blurry, to be honest. I don't really remember the details.
DOCTOR: Insurance paperwork. Of course. Look, I'm a physician, not a benefits counselor. But… alright. So you received a notice for a long-term care assessment, initiated through your insurance. Do you have any idea why they’d be requesting this?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. She… my wife, bless her… she was always plannin’ ahead. Maybe she thought it was a good idea, just in case? We didn’t talk about it much, if I’m bein’ honest. I mostly just… did what she said. She handled all the important stuff. It's been… a while since she passed. Things kinda… faded after that.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, these assessments usually involve a review of your overall health and functional status. Are you currently experiencing any difficulties with daily activities?
PATIENT: Daily activities… let me think. I work down at the docks, movin’ freight. It’s… physical work. I can still do it, mostly. Some days my back aches somethin’ awful, and I get tired quicker than I used to. But I manage. I live alone now, so I gotta do everything myself… cookin’, cleanin’, stuff like that. It's… okay. I get by. Is that what you mean? Like, can I… take care of myself?
DOCTOR: "Getting by" isn’t quite specific enough for an assessment, Mr. Rover. Let’s try this: can you get in and out of a chair without assistance?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can. No problem. I mean… sometimes it's a little creaky, you know? My knees ain’t what they used to be. But I don’t need help. I can do it myself. I do it every day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about bathing?
PATIENT: Bathing… I can… I take showers. Every other day. Sometimes I get a little dizzy standin’ up, so I gotta hold onto the soap dish. But I can wash myself, get dressed, everything. It’s just… a little harder now, I guess. I don’t fall or nothin’. My wife always said I was steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you having any difficulty with remembering things?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… well, that’s… that’s been a thing, I guess. Not big things, you know? I forget where I put my keys sometimes. Or what I went to the store for. Little stuff. It’s just… gettin’ older, I figure. My wife, she used to remind me of things. Now… well, it slips my mind sometimes. It's not like I forget who people are, or nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. Just standard procedure.
PATIENT: That sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. My wife always said it was good to get checked out. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I got a delivery to make later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. 140 over 85… slightly elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, take a deep breath for me… and another… lungs sound clear bilaterally, but there's some mild age-related crackles. Reflexes are normal, strength is 5/5 in all extremities, coordination is slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age.
PATIENT: Okay… sounds good. Is that… bad? The diminished coordination? I haven't really… noticed anything. I mean, I still unload those crates just fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," Mr. Rover. It's a common finding with age, and it doesn’t seem to be interfering with your daily activities at this point. However, given your wife's foresight and the insurance assessment, it’s worth further investigation. I recommend a simple MRI of the brain just to rule out any underlying issues. And potentially a consult with a neurologist.
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? That sounds… serious. My wife, she always worried about everything. Is it somethin’ wrong? I just want to know if I can still… work. Can I still unload those crates? That’s what matters.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, I understand your concern. An MRI is simply a precautionary measure. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something wrong. As for your work, I'm not going to advise you on whether or not you can continue unloading crates. That’s your decision. However, I do recommend you proceed with the recommended tests to rule out anything serious. I’ll put in the referral for the MRI and neurologist consult. Do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. And… uh… I take somethin’ for my back. A little white pill. Doctor gave it to me a few years ago. Can't remember the name… starts with a “C”, maybe? I just take it when it really hurts. And… sometimes I take somethin’ for sleep, but not every night. That one’s blue. My wife got it for me, after she… well. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at rememberin’ things.
DOCTOR: Right. A white pill for your back starting with a "C" and a blue pill for sleep… that's not terribly helpful. We'll need to get a more accurate list of your medications from your pharmacy. I'll send a request to them. Okay, I’ve entered the referrals for the MRI and neurologist. The neurologist’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’ll document your current symptoms and medication list as best I can. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checkin’ me out. I just… hope it’s not somethin’ bad. I gotta get back to work, you know? People are dependin’ on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’ll receive information from the neurologist’s office soon. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness, dizziness, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, follow up with the neurologist as scheduled. Have a good day, Mr. Rover. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too.
