DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re with Burdette Clinic today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea why I’m here. My assistant scheduled this appointment… something about my… senses, I believe? It’s all rather muddled. I’m a very busy woman, you see, and I don’t have time to be bothered with… these things. Just get on with it, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. It appears your assistant scheduled this appointment for a general sensory evaluation. That’s perfectly alright; we can certainly proceed that way. To clarify, are you experiencing any changes or difficulties with your vision, hearing, sense of taste, smell, or touch?
PATIENT: Oh, now you mention it… yes. My vision has been… hazy, I suppose. And I can’t seem to hear as well as I used to. People mumble so! Though, they probably always have mumbled. Honestly, it’s difficult to say. It’s all so… recent. And bothersome. Do you really need all these details? I have patients waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Julie. These details are helpful in understanding what may be going on. “Hazy vision” and difficulty hearing are both important things to investigate. When did you first notice these changes – roughly how long ago?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t possibly say. A week? A month? Time seems to slip away these days. It’s… it’s not like it happened overnight. It was gradual. A slow… fading, perhaps. Really, I’m not good with specifics. I deal with life and death situations all day, not… blurry edges and quiet noises. Is there a quicker way to determine what’s wrong? I have a very important surgery scheduled this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Julie. Given your busy schedule and upcoming surgery, we will be as efficient as possible. A gradual onset of both vision and hearing changes is important information. To help me narrow things down, are these changes constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… yes, I think so. Sometimes it’s worse than others. Especially in the mornings, I believe. Though, truthfully, all mornings feel the same these days. A bit of a blur. It’s… irritating, more than anything. And it's interfering with my ability to properly assess my patients. That's the real problem, you see. I need to be sharp. Are you going to give me some sort of… medication? Something quick-acting?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Julie, and the importance of being sharp for your patients. It’s good to know the changes are intermittent and worse in the mornings. That helps us consider different possibilities. Before discussing medication, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your vision and hearing more objectively. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I suppose I have no choice. But do hurry, if you would. I have a reputation to maintain. And please, be gentle. I am a surgeon, you see. My hands are… rather important. Is this going to be uncomfortable? Because I absolutely cannot have anything interfere with my surgery.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. It will be a very quick and gentle exam – nothing that will interfere with your hands or your surgery, I assure you. We’ll start with your vision. Could you please follow my penlight with your eyes as I move it in front of you?
PATIENT: Get on with it, then. Honestly, the things I have to endure… And do try not to shine it directly in my eyes. It's rather… undignified. And if I blink, it doesn't mean anything is wrong, you understand. I simply have sensitive eyes.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m noting some mild constriction delay in your pupils, Ms. Julie, and slightly diminished visual acuity in both eyes. Nothing alarming, but something we’ll want to investigate further. Now, let’s check your hearing. I’m going to place some headphones over your ears and play some tones at different frequencies. Please indicate when you hear each tone, even if it’s very faint.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I can barely hear anything anyway. All these beeping noises… It’s quite distracting. And frankly, it's rather infantilizing. Just tell me what's wrong and give me something to fix it. I haven't got all day to sit here playing games. Do you really need me to press the button for every single faint little noise? Because honestly, I'm starting to feel rather foolish.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. Based on the limited testing we’ve done, it appears you have some degree of high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. The testing helps us quantify the extent of the loss, which is important for determining the best course of action. Given your upcoming surgery and the gradual onset of these symptoms, I recommend a comprehensive audiological evaluation and a referral to an ophthalmologist to assess your vision more thoroughly. Would you be open to those referrals?
PATIENT: Ophthalmologist and… audiologist? Honestly, Doctor, the things I have to do to get this sorted… Very well. If it must be done. But I expect a prompt turnaround. I cannot afford to be inconvenienced for long. And please, make sure they understand my schedule. I have patients relying on me. And I trust you’ll choose someone… reputable? I won’t have just anyone poking around in my ears and eyes. Now, is that all? I truly must be going.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I’ll arrange for referrals to a highly-rated ophthalmologist and audiologist, and I’ll ensure they are aware of your busy schedule. I’ll have the referral paperwork ready for you before you leave. In the meantime, I'll provide you with a summary of our findings today and a list of potential symptoms to watch out for that would warrant immediate medical attention. Would you like me to print that out for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. And make sure it’s concise. I haven’t the time to read through endless pages of medical jargon. Just the essentials, if you would. And honestly, Doctor, I do appreciate you trying to accommodate my schedule. It's rare these days to find someone who understands the importance of efficiency. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe that’s all I require for today. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. Here’s a summary of our discussion and the referrals. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best with your upcoming surgery and a swift recovery. It was a pleasure meeting you.
