DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s starting to get really annoying.
DOCTOR: Two days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Started Tuesday afternoon, I think it was after I laughed really hard at a silly video my niece sent me. Usually, they go away pretty quick, you know? A few minutes, maybe an hour. But these… they keep coming back. It’s exhausting, honestly.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, I can imagine. Alright. And besides the hiccups themselves, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. No pain, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. Just… hiccups. I've tried drinking water really fast, holding my breath… all the usual things people tell you. Nothing’s worked so far. I did have a bit of indigestion yesterday, but that could be from worrying about the hiccups, honestly!
DOCTOR: Okay. Indigestion… that's good to know. And you said it started after laughing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A really silly video my niece sent me. She lives in Cairo, you see, and she's always sending me funny things. It was a little cat trying to climb a curtain. Made me laugh so much my stomach hurt! And then, boom, hiccups started soon after. I haven’t had anything different to eat or drink, and I haven't been doing anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette. Let's just do a quick check of your heart and lungs, just to be on the safe side. It's probably nothing, but it’s always best to rule things out. Do you mind if I listen?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Go ahead. I appreciate you checking. It’s just… they’re really persistent, and I’m starting to get worried it’s something serious. I've never had hiccups last this long before.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out… good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… no wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Everything seems normal, thankfully. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen, just to make sure everything feels okay there. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That's good to hear. Go ahead. I’ll tell you if anything hurts. It’s just… I’m a bit sensitive on my left side sometimes, just a little. Old injury, you know? Nothing major. Ooh, that's a bit tender there, yes. But it usually is.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know about the tenderness. It seems localized, which is consistent with an old injury. Now, tell me a bit about your medical history, Ivette. Do you have any conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I don’t really have anything major. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been under control with diet and exercise. I walk every morning, usually around the park. I also had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago, but that's it, really. No diabetes, no asthma, nothing like that. And I don’t take any regular medications, except for a vitamin D supplement in the winter.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Controlled blood pressure and a hysterectomy fifteen years ago. Vitamin D supplement. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing I'm aware of. I eat everything, thankfully! I used to get hay fever as a child, but I haven’t had any problems with that in years. I even garden a bit, and I'm fine. It’s just… these hiccups! They are driving me mad. Hic! See? Right when I was talking!
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear you. Quite persistent, aren’t they?
PATIENT: Yes! They come and go, but they always come back. It’s really frustrating. And I have a dinner party on Saturday, and I don’t want to be hiccuping the whole time. It would be so embarrassing! Hic! Oh, dear. Do you think it could be something serious, Doctor? Like… my stomach or something?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be anything serious, Ivette, but we should rule things out. Given your history, the duration, and the localized tenderness, I’m going to suggest a few things. First, let's try a small dose of antacids to see if that helps with the indigestion, even if it’s mild. And I want to order a basic blood test, just to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying imbalances. It's a precaution, really. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you taking it seriously. Antacids and a blood test… yes, that's fine. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to get rid of these hiccups! Will the blood test tell us if there's something wrong with my stomach? Hic! Honestly, I feel ridiculous. It’s like a broken record.
DOCTOR: It can give us some clues, Ivette. It won't be a definitive answer, but it can point us in the right direction. We’ll be checking for things like pancreatic enzyme levels, which could be elevated if there was something going on with your pancreas. But, again, it's a precaution. And don't worry about feeling ridiculous, hiccups can be very disruptive. Now, I’ll write you a prescription for some over-the-counter antacids. Take them as directed, and we'll schedule the blood test for tomorrow morning. Then, we'll follow up once the results are in. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. Tomorrow morning is fine. And thank you for not dismissing it as just silly hiccups. It really is bothering me. Hic! Honestly, it’s like they’re mocking me now. Will the blood test take long? And should I avoid eating anything specific before it?
DOCTOR: They’re certainly persistent, aren’t they?
PATIENT: Yes! And I'm starting to think they enjoy my misery. Hic! Honestly, I feel like a cartoon character. What about the blood test? Will I need to fast beforehand? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Like… a special tea or something? I’ve read so many things online, it’s all so confusing!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, let's slow down a bit. You do need to fast for eight hours before the blood test – no food or drinks except for water. And you’re right, there’s a lot of information online, most of it unhelpful. Forget the special teas for now. We’ll go with the antacids and the blood test, and see what those tell us. If the hiccups continue after a week, despite trying those things, we can consider a referral to a gastroenterologist, just to be thorough. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds much more sensible. Eight hours fasting, antacids, and then we see what happens. And if they still don’t go away, we talk to a specialist. Okay, I can do that. Hic! Oh, honestly. You're right about the specialist. I just want them to stop! Thank you, Doctor Galena. I feel a bit better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. It's good to have a plan. Here’s the prescription for the antacids. Take two tablets after meals, three times a day. And the lab order for the blood test is already sent. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. Try to relax, and don’t worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. You've been very thorough and reassuring. Thank you again. Hic! Honestly, they’re determined to have the last word. I'll see you next week.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette. You take care now. And don’t let those hiccups get you down! We’ll talk next week. Feel free to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Goodbye.
