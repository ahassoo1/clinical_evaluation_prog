DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally, for a few months now. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little. It’s not a sudden thing, but it's definitely getting more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… a few months, you said. And is the weakness all over, or is it more in specific areas?
PATIENT: It’s… harder to say exactly. I think it started in my arms, maybe? Like, lifting things feels more effort than it used to. And I get tired quicker when I'm doing things around the house. It’s not like I can’t do things, but it’s… draining. It’s creeping into my legs a little now, too, I think. It’s hard to pinpoint, really. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Gradual onset is often tricky to pinpoint. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision, aside from the eyelids?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, I don't think. Everything seems clear enough. Although… now that you mention it, sometimes things look a little… double, maybe? But it’s fleeting. It doesn't happen all the time, and I just figured it was because I was tired. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent double vision is definitely something we should note. And when you say “tired,” are you sleeping well?
PATIENT: That’s… a complicated question, Doctor. I’ve never been a great sleeper. But it hasn’t changed much recently, no. I get about six or seven hours, usually. I wake up a few times, but I always have. It’s not like I’m suddenly struggling to fall asleep, if that makes sense. It's just… never been a sound sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Not a new problem with sleep, just not restorative. And have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been a bit more… irritable, maybe? My ex-wife would definitely agree with that one, I’m sure. But, honestly, that could just be the divorce. It’s still fairly recent. Oh! And I’ve had a little bit of trouble swallowing sometimes. Not every time, but occasionally food feels like it gets stuck. It’s… a strange sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability and difficulty swallowing occasionally… We're building a bit of a picture here. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, standard things like that. Nothing serious. I broke my arm when I was younger, but that healed fine. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I tend to just… push through things. Is that… foolish?
DOCTOR: It’s not foolish, Mr. Schaust. A lot of people are like that. But it's good you're here now. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had anything like that. Just the usual dentist appointments, of course. And vaccinations, when I was younger. I think I had all the standard ones. I can’t remember the specifics, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she passed away a few years ago. Cancer, unfortunately. Lung cancer. And my father… we don’t really talk. Long story. He’s… alive, but I don’t have much contact with him. I don’t really know about his medical history, to be honest. I never really asked. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, but we can work with what we have. Knowing about your mother’s cancer is helpful. Do you know what type of lung cancer it was, or anything about her treatment?
PATIENT: I… I think it was the… the kind that spreads quickly. She didn't… she didn't respond well to treatment. It was… quite fast, actually. She was diagnosed and… and gone within a year, I think. It was very difficult. I don’t remember the specifics of the treatment, I was… preoccupied, obviously. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… a painful memory.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schaust. It's perfectly alright. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never been a smoker. I've always been quite careful about my health, actually, even though I don't always go to the doctor. I avoid it as much as possible, you know? My mother… seeing her struggle… it put me off it completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe a couple, if it’s a weekend. Nothing excessive. It’s… a habit, more than anything. I don’t really drink to excess, if that makes sense. Never have. I'm not a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions, to my knowledge. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had any trouble with penicillin or any other common medications. I don't think I've ever had a rash or anything like that. I'm fairly sure I'm not allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I avoid taking medication if I can, as I said. I believe in letting my body heal itself if possible. I don't take any vitamins or supplements, either. Just… plain, ordinary me, I suppose. A bit weak, admittedly, but otherwise… just me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that’s helpful. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your reflexes, strength, and looking in your eyes and ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I understand it’s necessary. I’ll try my best to cooperate. I'm a little nervous, if I'm honest, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just sit up here for me. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little on the low side, but not terribly concerning. Pulse is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another one… Okay, good. Sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not dramatically. And finally, I’m going to check your strength… Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: I… I can squeeze, but it doesn't feel as strong as it used to. It's hard to explain. It feels like… effort. I'm trying, Doctor, honestly, I am. I just… don’t feel as strong as I once did. Is that… obvious?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is, Mr. Schaust. And that’s alright. We’re just gathering information. Your strength is noticeably diminished in both arms and legs, as you said. Now, I'm going to quickly check your eyes… Your eye movements are a little slow, and I notice some slight drooping of your eyelids, as you mentioned. Let me take a look in your ears… Ears look clear. Alright. I'm going to listen to your neck… Nothing remarkable there. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, you're presenting with symptoms consistent with muscle weakness, ptosis – the drooping eyelids – and some difficulty with eye movements. There are a few possibilities we need to rule out. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a test for certain antibodies. And I think an MRI of the brain and an EMG – electromyography – to assess your muscle function would be helpful. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot, Doctor. Blood tests are fine, I suppose. But an MRI… and an EMG… those sound… complicated. And probably expensive? I’m not insured, as I mentioned. Is there… is there any way to know what’s wrong without doing all of those tests? I mean, could it be… just stress? Or a vitamin deficiency? I eat reasonably well, I think. It's all a bit overwhelming, if I'm honest. I just want to feel better, and this feels like… a long road.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot, Mr. Schaust, and I apologize if it feels overwhelming. And you're right to be concerned about cost. Let's talk about that. The blood tests are relatively inexpensive, and we can explore options for financial assistance. As for the MRI and EMG… they are the most definitive way to determine the cause of your symptoms. While stress or a vitamin deficiency could be contributing factors, the combination of muscle weakness, ptosis, and slow eye movements raises concern for something more specific – potentially a neurological condition like myasthenia gravis, or something affecting the muscles themselves. I understand your concern about cost, and we can prioritize the blood tests first. If they are inconclusive, we can discuss the MRI and EMG in more detail, and I can help you explore options for reduced-cost imaging facilities or financial aid programs. We don’t have to do everything at once. Let’s start with the blood tests, and then we can re-evaluate. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… much better. Starting with the blood tests feels… manageable. And knowing you’ll help me look into options for the other tests… that’s a weight off my shoulders. I appreciate that. So, what do I need to do about the blood tests? Do I need to fast beforehand? And where do I go? I live just outside of town, so… accessibility is a bit of an issue, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Here’s a requisition form. You’ll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks except water. And you’ll need to go to Willow Creek Labs. It’s the closest lab, and they’re used to working with patients without insurance. I’ll write down the address and phone number for you. They are open from 7:30 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. I will also put in a note for them to contact my office if there are any issues with insurance verification, even though you said you’re uninsured. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all clear, Doctor. Willow Creek Labs, 12-hour fast, and then come back for a follow-up. I appreciate you writing everything down. It helps to have it in front of me. And… thank you for being understanding about the insurance situation. It's… a bit of a stress, to be honest. I’m not sure what I’d do without a little help. I think that’s everything for now, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for now, Mr. Schaust. And you're very welcome. I understand it can be stressful, and we'll do our best to navigate this together. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out. .
