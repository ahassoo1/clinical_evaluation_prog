DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it's… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you.
DOCTOR: Okay. That sounds… concerning. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what you were told?
PATIENT: Um… yes. The other doctor, she said I have… a growth. And it isn't a good one. She said I needed to see someone… a specialist, I believe she said. I’m not entirely sure what kind of cancer it is, honestly. It all happened very fast.
DOCTOR: Right, that does sound a bit overwhelming if it all happened quickly. No need to worry, we'll try to get things sorted out. Do you remember which doctor told you this information?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It was Doctor Ramirez, at St. Luke’s Hospital. She’s… a general practitioner. I saw her for a check-up, and she found… something. That’s when she sent me here. I believe she mentioned sending some papers over as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, Doctor Ramirez at St. Luke’s. Good, that's helpful. Let me just see if those papers have arrived yet… Ah, yes, here we are. It looks like Dr. Ramirez found a mass during a routine physical. The report indicates it's located… on your right breast. Do you mind if I ask a few more questions about it?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. You may ask anything you need to. It is located on my right breast, yes. I hadn’t noticed it myself, to be honest. It wasn’t painful or anything. It just… was there, apparently. It’s all a bit strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did Dr. Ramirez first mention noticing this mass to you?
PATIENT: It was… July 18th, I believe. Yes, that sounds right. The 18th of July. She called me with the results of some tests, and then she scheduled a follow-up appointment. At that appointment, she told me about the mass and sent me here. It was all very… clinical, if that makes sense. Lots of words I didn’t understand.
DOCTOR: It does sound a bit rushed and overwhelming, and I appreciate you telling me that. It’s perfectly okay not to understand all the medical jargon. So, to clarify, Dr. Ramirez found this mass on July 18th, and you’ve only just been referred to me now?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. July 18th. It did feel like a long time to wait to see someone, but she assured me it wasn’t immediately dangerous, and that’s why she wasn’t more… urgent about it. Though I must admit, I was still quite worried. I am a widow, you see, and… well, I don’t have family close by.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive about getting this checked out, and I’m glad you came in. And I apologize for any delays or lack of clarity you experienced. Being a widow and not having family nearby adds another layer of worry, I can imagine. To get a better understanding of things, could you describe the mass to me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it’s hard to describe. It felt… like a small, hard lump. Not very big, maybe the size of a grape? It wasn't really visible, you had to feel for it. And it didn't… move around much when I pressed on it. It just stayed in one place. I’m not sure if that makes sense. I haven’t really touched it much since Doctor Ramirez pointed it out, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. A small, hard lump, about the size of a grape, doesn't move easily. Okay. And have you noticed any changes to the area since Dr. Ramirez first found it?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… I have noticed a little bit of…dimpling on the skin, right above where the lump is. It's very subtle, and I only noticed it a few days ago. And… sometimes, I feel a little bit of tingling in that breast. It comes and goes, but it’s there. It hadn't happened before, not that I noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, dimpling and tingling… that's important to know. Thank you for telling me. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I just want to understand what is happening. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Great. I’m going to gently examine both of your breasts, and also check your underarms. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. Okay… I do feel a lump in your right breast, approximately two centimeters in diameter. It feels firm and irregularly shaped, and it doesn’t move easily, consistent with what you described. There's also some slight dimpling of the skin overlying the mass. I’m not feeling any significant enlargement in your lymph nodes at this time, which is good, but we will need further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What does that entail, Doctor? I'm… a bit anxious, to be honest. What kind of tests will I need? And… what are you thinking it might be? I understand if you can’t say for certain, but even a general idea would be helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. “Further investigation” in this case means we need to get a clearer picture of what this mass is. The next step would be a mammogram and an ultrasound of your right breast. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast, and the ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image. These tests will help us determine the size, shape, and characteristics of the mass, and whether it’s solid or fluid-filled. If the results of those tests are inconclusive, or if we need more information, we may need to perform a biopsy. That involves taking a small sample of the mass and sending it to a lab for analysis. Based on what I feel during the exam and what you've told me, the mass could be a benign cyst or fibroadenoma, which are common and generally not cancerous. However, it could also be something more serious, which is why we need these tests to get a definitive diagnosis. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but we need to rule out the possibility of breast cancer. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes sense, Doctor. A mammogram and ultrasound first, and maybe a biopsy if needed. To rule things out. That sounds… reasonable. It’s just… a lot to take in. Will Medicare cover these tests? I'm on Medicare, and I wouldn't want to have a large bill I can’t afford. I'm a widow, as I mentioned, and… my funds are limited.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot to take in, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. And you’re absolutely right to ask about Medicare coverage. Yes, Medicare will cover both the mammogram and ultrasound. You likely will have a deductible and a copay, depending on your specific plan, but Medicare typically covers 80% of the cost for these diagnostic tests. We have a billing specialist here at the clinic who can help you understand your specific costs and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. I can have them contact you directly after our appointment to discuss it. They are very good at navigating Medicare coverage. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. If you could schedule the tests, and have the billing specialist contact me, that would put my mind at ease. I really appreciate your patience and understanding. And for explaining everything so clearly. It means a lot. I’m… ready to get this done, if that makes sense. I want to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good that you want to get this sorted out, and I’m here to help you every step of the way. Let me just get some information down… Okay, I can schedule you for a mammogram and ultrasound at St. Luke’s Hospital – that’s where Doctor Ramirez sent you, right?
PATIENT: Yes, St. Luke’s is fine, Doctor. That is where Doctor Ramirez is, so it would be easiest. And… thank you again. I’m… feeling a bit better, just knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's see… they have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM sounds perfect. That gives me a bit of time to prepare, I suppose. Thank you for finding an opening so quickly. And... will I need to do anything special before the tests? Should I avoid anything? Like caffeine, or… certain foods?
DOCTOR: Good. Tuesday at 10:00 AM it is. And that’s a very good question. For the mammogram, you should avoid wearing deodorant, lotion, or powder on your breasts and underarms on the day of the test. These substances can interfere with the images. As for caffeine, it can sometimes cause temporary breast tenderness, so it's best to avoid it for a day or two beforehand if possible, but it's not essential. You don’t need to do anything special for the ultrasound, but it’s helpful to wear comfortable clothing. I’ll also write up a little information sheet with these instructions for you to take home. And I'll make sure the billing specialist gets in touch with you tomorrow. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered everything I was wondering. The information sheet sounds helpful, and I appreciate that. I believe that’s all for now. Thank you, truly. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re here to support you through this. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I'll have the nurse bring you that information sheet on your way out. Take care, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
