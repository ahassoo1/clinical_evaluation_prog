DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie Burdette. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly, I haven't the time for this. But my… assistant insisted. Something about not being able to see properly, and… sounds being muffled. It's quite inconvenient, really. I have a very full schedule, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your time is valuable. "Not being able to see properly and sounds being muffled," you say. Alright. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it was… some time ago. Perhaps a week? Two? It’s difficult to say. Things just… faded. And the noises… they weren’t as crisp. I assumed it was just… age. One doesn't recall such trivialities. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: "Just age" can encompass a great many things, Ms. Burdette. It’s important to be precise. A week or two… has it been getting progressively worse, or has it remained fairly constant?
PATIENT: Progressively… well, I suppose it’s slightly worse. Though I hardly notice such small things. I have patients to think about, you know. Very important little ones. It’s just… irritating, that’s all. It makes concentrating difficult. Now, are we finished? I have rounds to prepare for.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to clarify, is this affecting one ear, both ears, or is it more of a general muffling of sounds?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Both, I suppose. It's a general… dullness. Really, Doctor, must we dissect every single minute detail? I’m a surgeon, not a… a sound engineer. It’s both ears, yes. Now, can we please proceed? I haven’t all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in your ears, headaches, or any pain associated with this hearing loss?
PATIENT: Headaches? Goodness no. I haven’t the time for headaches. Dizziness… occasionally, perhaps. But that’s likely from standing for too long in the operating room. It's hardly relevant. And ringing… I suppose I may have noticed a faint… hum. But it's nothing significant. Truly. Are we still on this?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Burdette. I'd like to take a quick look in your ears and do a brief neurological assessment just to get a clearer picture. It won’t take long. If you could just lean back and look straight ahead…
PATIENT: Oh, really? Lean back? I suppose I must. Though I do hope you've thoroughly sanitized that… instrument. I have a very busy schedule, you see, and I can hardly afford to contract anything. Get on with it, then. And be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your ear canals are a bit blocked with wax, which could be contributing to the muffling. Your neurological exam is otherwise normal, but I did observe some slight difficulty with balance, though it could be due to many factors. I’m going to document “mild cerumen impaction bilaterally, slight balance impairment noted.” Now, Ms. Burdette, given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect this is likely due to a combination of cerumen impaction and possibly some age-related changes in the inner ear. However, to rule out anything more serious, such as Meniere’s disease or a more significant neurological issue, I'd like to order a formal audiogram, which is a hearing test, and potentially an MRI. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Really, Doctor. That sounds… excessive. And a hearing test? All this for a little wax and a slight… wobble? I suppose… if it will get me out of here sooner. But I expect a swift turnaround. I cannot have my schedule disrupted for long. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. Just get it done. Now, tell me how long this will actually take.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Burdette. The audiogram will take approximately 30-60 minutes. The MRI will require a referral and scheduling with the radiology department, so that could be several days to a week depending on availability. I’ll expedite the referral as much as possible. I’m also going to recommend we try a simple cerumen removal procedure in the office first. It’s relatively quick and often resolves the issue. Would you like to proceed with that today?
PATIENT: Cerumen removal… if it’s quick. And I mean truly quick. No prolonged procedures, understand? Just… get it over with. And then I’d like the referral for this… MRI. The sooner the better. Honestly, Doctor, I have patients waiting. Let's proceed. But be gentle. And fast. Very fast.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to use a gentle irrigation system to remove the wax. It may cause a slight sensation of fullness or pressure in your ears. If you feel any pain, please let me know immediately. There we go. I’ve removed a substantial amount of wax from both ears. Let’s see if that improves your hearing. Alright. That appears to have made a noticeable improvement. Your hearing is still not quite back to normal, but it is significantly better than it was. I'm documenting "bilateral cerumen impaction resolved, hearing improved post-irrigation, but remains suboptimal." I will now write the referral for the MRI, and I will also provide you with a copy of my findings and instructions to follow up with the radiology department. Do you have any questions before I conclude this visit?
PATIENT: Hmm. Slightly better, perhaps. Though it’s hardly a miraculous improvement. An MRI, you said? Very well. Ensure the report is sent directly to my office, and promptly. And… no, I don’t have any questions. Just… thank you for getting this over with. I have patients to see. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Burdette. The report will be sent directly to your office. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns. Have a good day, and best of luck with your patients.
