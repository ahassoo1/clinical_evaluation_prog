DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. My hand… it just kinda trembles now. Been happening for a bit, I guess. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things very well anymore. It’s why I’m here, I think. My daughter… she insisted.
DOCTOR: I see. A tremor in your hand. And it’s been occurring for some time, though you’re not certain of the duration. That’s perfectly alright; we’ll try to get a better understanding of it. Could you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s not… violent, not like a big shiver. More like a little wobble. Especially when I try to do something… like hold a cup. Or write. Makes things difficult, you know? It’s worse when I’m… still, I think. When I’m moving it’s not so bad. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Jezik. A tremor that’s more pronounced at rest and diminishes with movement. That’s helpful. Now, has this tremor been constant since it began, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… I think it’s gotten worse lately. It wasn’t always this noticeable. Earlier on… well, I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. But my daughter says it’s been getting worse for a few months now. She notices these things. I mostly just… try not to spill my coffee. It’s probably been constant for… oh, I don't know. A while now. A few months, maybe? Like she says.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset and progression over several months. And your daughter has observed a worsening of the symptom. Very good. Now, Mr. Jezik, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really. I get tired, I suppose. But I'm 79, Doctor! I'm supposed to be tired. My bones ache sometimes, but that's just old age, right? I don't think… no, I haven’t noticed anything else. Maybe a little… clumsy. But I always was a bit clumsy. Sorry, I'm not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are being perfectly helpful, Mr. Jezik. It's important to rule things out, and your observations are valuable. Fatigue and generalized aches are common at your age, as you said. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That's a tough one. I had… something with my blood pressure, years ago. High blood pressure, I think. They gave me pills for it. I don't take them anymore, though. Doctor said I could stop. And… I think I had a touch of pneumonia once, a long time ago. But other than that… nothing major, I don't think. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Too busy. Or… I was busy. Now… not so much. Sorry, is that useful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. History of hypertension, managed with medication in the past, and a previous episode of pneumonia. Do you recall what medication you were taking for your blood pressure, or approximately when you were taking it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name… it escapes me. A little white pill, I think. Everyone took pills back then. It was… a long time ago. Maybe… the 80s? Or early 90s? I really can’t say for sure. I stopped taking it… when I retired, I think. Doctor said my numbers looked good, so I didn’t need it anymore. I haven’t been back to see him since. It’s all a bit blurry, honestly. I apologize. This is probably incredibly frustrating for you.
DOCTOR: It is alright, Mr. Jezik. We will do our best to piece things together. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago, obviously. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. Had to have a cast on it. But other than that… no, I don't think so. No major surgeries, no other hospital stays. I've always been fairly… sturdy, I suppose. Until recently, that is. This shaking is… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Very well. Appendectomy and a wrist fracture. Now, Mr. Jezik, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he lived to be 85, I think. He was a strong man, worked on a farm his whole life. He didn’t have any… well, I don’t think he had any major health problems. My mother… she died when I was young, from… I think it was a heart problem. But I wasn’t very old, so I don’t remember much about it. No one in my family… as far as I know… had any shaking problems like this. Or… any nervous disorders. We were all pretty… practical people. Not much room for… that sort of thing. Sorry, I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: That is alright, Mr. Jezik. Any information is helpful. So, paternal history unremarkable, maternal history significant for cardiac issues at an unknown age. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I used to be very active. Worked in a water treatment plant for… oh, goodness, forty years. Lots of physical work. Then I retired. Now… not so much. I live alone. I try to stay busy, do a little gardening, read the newspaper. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink… a little beer with dinner, but I’ve cut back on that. Mostly just… I spend a lot of time sitting, I suppose. And worrying. About things. Old people worry, you know. It's what we do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. A history of physical work, now largely sedentary, no smoking, and minimal alcohol consumption. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had any problems with medications. I can eat anything. Bees, maybe? I don't like bees. But I don't think I'm allergic to them. Just… don't like them. No, I don't think I have any allergies. As far as I know. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. I’m just an old man with a shaking hand.
DOCTOR: You are not being vague at all, Mr. Jezik. You've provided me with valuable information. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and assessing your neurological function, including further evaluation of the tremor. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you would. I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things. I'm not good at sitting still for long periods, you see. And, uh… I get cold easily these days. But go ahead, please. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. Let’s begin. First, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, pulse is within normal limits. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, let’s assess the tremor. Could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There… you can see it, right? It’s worse when I try to hold them still. And it’s… it's been getting worse, like I said. It’s really bothersome when I try to write. Makes everything look… messy. It feels like… a little buzzing inside. A constant vibration. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see it. It appears to be a resting tremor, as you mentioned, diminishing with purposeful movement. Now, could you please tap your fingers together rapidly, and then alternate touching your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: It's… difficult. It's harder to do it quickly and smoothly. I used to be able to do this without even thinking about it. Now… it feels clumsy. And the shaking makes it worse. See? It’s not just my hand when it’s still. It affects everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about other possible symptoms. Have you noticed any stiffness in your limbs or trunk?
PATIENT: Stiffness… Hmm. Maybe a little. Especially in the mornings. It takes a while to… loosen up. I thought it was just old age, you know? Aches and pains. But now that you mention it… yes, maybe a little stiffness. Not severe, but… noticeable. Especially in my shoulders and neck. It's hard to say. I'm always a little creaky in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Changes in smell or taste… Now that’s a good question. I haven’t really thought about it. My sense of taste… I think it’s okay. Food tastes like food. But my smell… You know, now that you mention it, things don’t seem as… fragrant as they used to. Coffee doesn’t smell as strong. My wife used to make cookies… I can’t smell them as well anymore. Not like I used to. It's subtle, but… yes, I think my sense of smell has diminished. I hadn't even noticed until now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits or urination?
PATIENT: Changes in bowel habits or… Oh dear. Well, things aren’t as… regular as they used to be. I get… constipated sometimes. More often than I’d like. And… I have to get up at night to… urinate. More than once. It’s… irritating. I thought it was just old age again. I apologize for being so… detailed. This is a bit embarrassing. But you asked. And I try to be honest.
DOCTOR: You are not at all embarrassing me, Mr. Jezik. It is important to have a complete understanding of your symptoms. Based on your history and the physical examination findings, I am concerned about the possibility of Parkinson’s disease. The resting tremor, bradykinesia, stiffness, diminished sense of smell, and changes in bowel habits are all suggestive of this diagnosis. However, it is important to confirm this with further testing. I would like to order a DaTscan, which is a specialized imaging study that can help assess the function of dopamine neurons in the brain. I would also like to refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… Is that… bad? I’ve heard of it… people shaking, unable to move. Is that what I have? A scan… and a neurologist… It sounds… serious. I just want the shaking to stop. I don’t want to be a burden. But… if you think it’s necessary… then yes. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Just… please explain everything to me. I don't want any surprises. And try to be quick about it, if you can. I don't have much time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder, but there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. The DaTscan will help us confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the condition. I will refer you to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected neurologist in the area. She will explain everything to you in detail and discuss the available treatment options. I will also provide you with some information about Parkinson’s disease and support resources. As for the scan, we can schedule it for next week. I will have my nurse, Sarah, call you to arrange the appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or if you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Now, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think… I think you've explained everything. It's a lot to take in. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for trying to help. I suppose… I'll wait for Sarah to call. I should get going. I have… things to do. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. Take care. .
