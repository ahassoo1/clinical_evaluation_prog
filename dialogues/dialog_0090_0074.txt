DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, my blood pressure's been actin' up. My son, Dale, he keeps tellin' me to come get it checked. He worries somethin' awful. I reckon he's right, though. I just... don't always feel sick, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good Dale is looking out for you. It's common for blood pressure to rise without obvious symptoms. "Actin' up"... can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes my head just feels… full. Not a headache, exactly. More like… pressure. And my vision gets a little spotty sometimes. Not all the time, just when I stand up too fast, usually. Dale says I get real quiet when it's high, but I don't always notice. He has one of them machines, he checks it a lot. That's how he knows.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A machine at home, good. Do you happen to know what the readings have been, generally?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes, numbers aren't my strong suit, Doctor. Dale usually handles all that. He said somethin' 'bout it bein' over 140 a few times... and somethin' else. I don't rightly recall. He said that wasn't good, and that's why we made this appointment. I mostly just bake when I feel a little off, keeps my mind busy. Though even that's been harder lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll get a proper reading here and see what’s going on. Baking is good, keeps you active. Let's start with a basic physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your pulse. Then we’ll take your blood pressure, of course. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I've always been pretty healthy, even livin' this long. Just… old. And a little achy sometimes, like everyone my age. Dale says I have somethin' with my joints, but I don't pay him much mind when he starts talkin' doctor talk. He means well, though. He worries. Mostly just the achin', that's all. And my memory ain’t what it used to be, but who remembers everything these days?
DOCTOR: Alright, achiness and memory issues noted. We can certainly look into those too. Now, let's get started with the exam. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Just tryin' to stay comfortable. This chair's a bit hard, if you don't mind my sayin'. Get on with it, I suppose. The sooner we know, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Good. Heart sounds are a little… diminished, but not alarming for your age. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your pulse. Pulse is… regular, but a little weak. Now for the blood pressure. This may feel a little tight. Just relax your arm.
PATIENT: Oh, that is tight! Always hated these things. Reminds me of the dentist. Is it done yet? It feels like it's cuttin' off my circulation.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. Blood pressure is 158/92. As I suspected. That is elevated. And your pulse is 72. Now, have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: No chest pain, thankfully. And I haven't noticed any trouble breathin'. My ankles do get a little puffy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. I figured it was just from bein' on my feet too long bakin'. I usually put 'em up on a stool and it helps some. Is that somethin' to worry about, Doctor? I mostly just ignore it, like I said. I don't like fussin' about little things.
DOCTOR: "Little things..." Well, ankle swelling can be related to the blood pressure. It's good you elevate them. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothin' like that. My mama lived to be 95, and she was as healthy as a horse until the very end. I reckon I got good genes. The doctor back home used to say I had a strong heart, but that was a long time ago. I mostly just get regular checkups, you know, the usual stuff. And I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. Though I do love my pecan pie, if you must know. Dale tries to limit that.
DOCTOR: Pecan pie is understandable. Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And I broke my arm once fallin' out of a tree, but that was ages ago. Other than that, no. Never been much for hospitals. I prefer to stay home and take care of things myself. Dale's always fussin' about me tryin' to do too much. He means well. Does the tonsils matter, Doctor? I just don't see why it's important.
DOCTOR: It’s good to have a thorough history. No, the tonsils aren't likely relevant now. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mama, like I said, lived a long time. She passed away peacefully in her sleep. My daddy... he had some trouble with his heart, I think. Dale says somethin' about high blood pressure, but I don't rightly remember. He was a strong man, worked hard his whole life. And my brother... he had diabetes. That's about all I remember, honestly. It was a long time ago. My family's mostly gone now. Just Dale and his kids. Does that matter, Doctor? I'm terrible with remembering names and dates.
DOCTOR: It matters. High blood pressure and diabetes in the family is important. Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my joints. Dale buys it for me at the pharmacy. Some kind of glucosamine, I think he said. And sometimes I take a little Tylenol for aches and pains, but not very often. Mostly just when I've been bakin' all day. He worries about me takin' too much, so I try not to. He keeps a list of everything I take, so you can ask him if you like. He's real good with doctor stuff. He'd probably know more than I do. Is that alright, Doctor? I'm gettin' tired now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. We can review that list with Dale. Alright, Ms. Steines, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, your blood pressure is elevated. We also have a family history of heart disease and diabetes, and you're experiencing some symptoms like headaches and vision changes that could be related. Now, I want to order some blood work and a urine test to check your kidney function and sugar levels. It’s also a good idea to get an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. This will give us a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Land sakes, that's a lot of tests! Is it somethin' serious, Doctor? I don't like bein' poked and prodded. And I hate needles. Dale will probably want me to get all of 'em done right away, won't he? He always wants the worst-case scenario. Is it gonna cost a lot of money? I'm on a fixed income, you know. I mostly just want to go home and bake. Can’t we just give me somethin' for the pressure and see if that works? I'm gettin' really tired now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Steines. It is a lot of tests, and I apologize for that. However, it’s important to get a clear picture of your overall health so we can determine the best course of treatment. The tests will help us rule out any serious problems and prevent future complications. As for the cost, we can discuss that with the billing department and see if there are any options available. Regarding medication, I'm hesitant to start anything without knowing the results of the tests. Starting medication without a proper diagnosis could potentially cause more harm than good. It's not that I want to delay treatment, it's that I want to be certain we're making the right decision. We can discuss lifestyle changes you can make in the meantime, such as reducing your salt intake, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. Those can often help lower blood pressure. Would you be open to discussing those?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… Dale's always tellin' me that too. Less salt, more walkin'... it's just hard when you're old. My joints ache, you know? And bakin' is my stress relief! What's the point of livin' if you can't enjoy a good pecan pie? Alright, alright... I'll do the tests. But I want Dale to be here with me when you talk about the results. He's good at askin' questions. And I want to know how much all this is gonna cost before you do anything. I don't want any surprises. And please, don't make me walk too much. Just tellin' you now. I'm tired. Can we just get it over with? And can you be gentle with the needle?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. I understand. We will schedule the tests with Dale present, and I will make sure he’s included in the discussion of the results and costs. I promise to be gentle with the needle, and we can take things at your pace. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood and collect a urine sample now. Afterwards, we’ll schedule an EKG. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright... just get it over with. But don't poke too much. And tell that nurse to be gentle too. I hate needles. Hurry up, please. I just want to go home.
