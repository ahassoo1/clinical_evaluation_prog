DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it’s a bit… complicated. I’m here about getting surgery, I think? My wife helped me set this up. I don’t really… remember all the details. It has to do with my weight, she said. She was pretty worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's good your wife is involved and looking out for you, and we can definitely sort through things together. You mentioned surgery and weight… is this something you’ve been discussing for a while, or is this a relatively new concern?
PATIENT: Um, I think it’s been talked about for… a little while. Maybe a few months? I honestly don’t recall exactly. My wife, Layla, she's been more on top of it. I just… get tired easily, you know? And things are getting harder to do. She noticed it more than I did, I think. It's not something I actively wanted to do, if that makes sense. Just… trying to feel better.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bradlee. It sounds like Layla is a great support, and it's common for family members to notice changes before we do ourselves. It’s good you're here to explore options. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a bit more about what kind of things are getting harder to do?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. Well, walking is… tough. Not like, can't-walk tough, but I get winded really easily. Even just going up the stairs. And bending over is… a struggle. Getting dressed, tying my shoes… little things, you know? It's embarrassing. And I used to like gardening, but I haven't been able to do that for… a while now. It just feels like too much effort. Does that make sense? I feel… slow. Really slow.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Bradlee. It sounds frustrating to have those everyday tasks become more difficult. And it's okay to feel embarrassed, but you’re here to address it, and that's the important part. Let's talk about your weight for a moment. Do you happen to know roughly what you weigh now, and have you noticed any significant weight changes recently?
PATIENT: Uh… I think around 200 pounds? Maybe a little more? Honestly, I try not to look at the scale. It’s… discouraging. And yeah, it’s been going up, slowly but surely, for… I don't know, years, probably. It's hard to say exactly. Layla usually knows these things better than me. She keeps track. I just… feel it. I feel bigger. I used to fit into some clothes, and now… not so much. It’s just been gradual, so I haven’t really paid close attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Bradlee. It’s helpful to know it's been a gradual change. And it's perfectly alright if you're not precise with the numbers – we can get those accurately here. Before we go any further with discussing surgery, I’d like to get a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems, for example?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I think… Layla mentioned something about my blood sugar being a little high at one point? But I don’t really remember. And maybe… high blood pressure? I see a doctor occasionally, but I don’t really… retain much. I go when Layla tells me to. She worries a lot. I honestly couldn’t tell you if I’m on any medication for anything. I think… no. I don't think so, but I should probably double check with Layla. She has a list somewhere, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s very common to not remember details, especially when it comes to medical information. We can definitely look up your records to get a clearer picture. Do you mind if I take a moment to check the computer for your previous visit notes?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine. That would be great, actually. I really appreciate it. It’s a huge help. I feel bad always relying on Layla's memory. She deserves a break.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me pull up your information… Okay, here we are. Bradlee Kochubey, born… November 12th, 1987. It looks like you have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, confirmed about two years ago. And hypertension – high blood pressure – diagnosed approximately three years ago. You are currently prescribed Metformin 500mg twice daily for the diabetes, and Lisinopril 10mg daily for the blood pressure. There's also a note here about an annual physical scheduled, but it appears you haven’t been in for one in over a year. Does this sound right to you, even approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… yeah. Diabetes… that sounds familiar. And blood pressure… Layla always tells me to take the pills. Metformin and… Lisinopril. Those names ring a bell. Yeah, that’s right. I’ve been taking pills for… a while. I guess I just… block it out sometimes. A year since the physical? Oh dear. Layla will be upset. She's always on me about these things. So, she was right. Again.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to forget details, Bradlee. And it's great you’re being honest about it. It's good that you are on medication, and we'll make sure everything is up to date. Now, before we discuss surgical options, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like diabetes, heart disease, or obesity – that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My father… he had diabetes. Definitely. He was… not very healthy, towards the end. And my mother… she had heart problems. She was always tired, and… yeah, she had a lot of issues with her heart. I think… on my mother's side, there was… obesity? Several relatives were… larger. I’m not sure the specifics, honestly. It was never really talked about much. Everyone just… was.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Bradlee. It's helpful to know about the family history of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. That does give us a bit more information to consider. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And… I used to drink occasionally. Socially. But not much anymore. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then, but it’s been… a while. Layla doesn't really like me drinking, so I don’t bother. I’m not much of a drinker anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about physical activity?
PATIENT: Um… not much. Honestly. I used to enjoy gardening, like I mentioned. But that’s been… a while. I walk a little, just around the house or to the store if it’s close. But that’s about it. It’s hard to get motivated, you know? And I get tired easily. Layla tries to get me to walk with her, but I usually… make excuses. I feel bad about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being honest, Bradlee. It's good to get a complete picture. It sounds like you've been less active recently, and that can definitely contribute to feeling tired and having difficulty with weight. Now, before we move onto talking about potential surgical options, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. It's just a quick assessment to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 150/90. That's a bit elevated, given you're on medication. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but we should keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some fullness. No significant pain to palpation. Okay, that gives me a little more information. Your weight is 203 pounds and your height is 5’1”. Now, given your history of diabetes and hypertension, your family history, and your current lifestyle, it's important to address these factors before considering surgery. Surgery always carries risks, and these risks are higher with uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure. Would you be open to exploring options for better managing these conditions, like dietary changes, exercise, and potentially adjusting your medication?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Risks… I don’t want any risks. Adjusting… yeah, that sounds good. I mean, I want to feel better. Dietary changes… Layla is always trying to get me to eat healthier. Maybe… I should listen to her more. Exercise too. I guess I’ve just been… avoiding it. I’m willing to try. Whatever it takes, really. I just… I need help.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Bradlee. And it’s perfectly okay to need help – that's what I'm here for. We can definitely work on a plan together. The first step is to get your diabetes and blood pressure under better control. I'd like to order some lab work – a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an A1C test – to get a clearer picture of your current health status. Also, I’d like to refer you to our registered dietitian. They can work with you to create a personalized meal plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences. And I can provide you with some resources for exercise programs that are safe and effective for people with diabetes and hypertension. Does that sound like a good starting point?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… really good, actually. Lab work, dietitian… that's all good. A plan. I like that. A plan. Okay. Let's do that. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready. And… thank you. For not judging me, and for… just helping.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bradlee. And there's absolutely no judgement here. We're a team, and we'll work together to get you feeling your best. Okay, let's get the lab order sent to the lab across the street. I'll also have my nurse schedule an appointment for you with the dietitian. She’ll call you tomorrow to find a time that works. In the meantime, try to focus on small changes – maybe start by adding one serving of fruits or vegetables to each meal, and try to walk for 15-20 minutes a few times a week. And most importantly, be kind to yourself. It takes time and effort to make changes, and there will be setbacks along the way. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. Small changes… that sounds manageable. Okay. Just… when will I hear back about the lab results? I don’t want to just… wait around.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. The lab results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. My nurse will call you as soon as they are available. She’ll review the results with you over the phone and schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them in detail and finalize your treatment plan. Also, I'm going to send you a summary of today's visit and some helpful resources on diabetes, hypertension, and healthy eating. It will be available on the patient portal – my nurse can help you set that up if you’re not already enrolled. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Bradlee?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Okay. The patient portal… Layla can probably help with that too. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. I really appreciate your help. I feel… a little hopeful, actually.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bradlee. I’m glad to hear you’re feeling hopeful. Remember, small steps. We’ll get there. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse’s number is on the summary she'll be sending. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
