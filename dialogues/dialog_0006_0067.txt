DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… the pain. When I breathe deep. It hurts. It’s… hard to explain exactly. Been going on a little while now, I think. Not sure how long, really. Time… slips away.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with deep breaths. I understand. It can be hard to pinpoint things sometimes. “A little while now…” – would you say a few days, a week, longer than that?
PATIENT: Hmm… longer than a week, I think. Maybe a month? It comes and goes. Not constant. Sometimes it's just a little ache, other times… sharper. I mostly just try to take smaller breaths, you know? Avoid it. It's… frustrating. I used to be able to do so much work, building things...
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent pain, sharper at times, lasting longer than a week, maybe around a month. And you’ve been modifying your breathing to avoid it. Building things, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Construction. Managed crews, mostly now. Used to do more of the… actual building. Back when I was younger. Stronger. It's just… this pain makes it hard to think clearly, you know? Worrying about it is almost as bad as the pain itself. Does that make sense? I keep thinking it might be something serious.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Ruocco. Worry definitely complicates things. Okay, so we have intermittent chest pain, worse with deep breaths, and it's impacting your daily life and causing you some anxiety. Just to clarify, is this pain anywhere specific in your chest?
PATIENT: Specific…? Uh… It feels… all over, really. More on this side, maybe? But it's hard to say for sure. It kinda radiates, you know? Goes… everywhere. And sometimes… I feel it in my back a little. It's not a sharp, stabbing pain, usually. More of a… dull ache. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Ruocco. Don't worry about explaining perfectly; we'll figure it out. So, primarily left-sided chest pain, sometimes radiating, more of a dull ache. And it comes and goes, right?
PATIENT: Yes. Comes and goes. And it's worse when I… try to do something. Even just walking up the stairs… or bending over. Anything that makes me breathe harder. It’s been getting a little worse lately, I think. I don't want to be a bother. You have lots of patients, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mr. Ruocco, that’s what I’m here for. And it’s good you mentioned it’s been gradually worsening. Alright. Before we do a quick exam, let me ask a few more questions, if that's okay. Have you ever had anything like this before?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not really. Maybe a little muscle soreness after a long day of work, but nothing like this. Nothing that makes me change how I breathe. I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist… but that was different. This feels… inside. Deep down. I’m not sure… I don't remember ever feeling this before, honestly. Getting old isn’t easy, you know.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound like typical muscle soreness, and a broken wrist wouldn't explain this. Okay, so this is a new symptom for you. Now, just to get a full picture… do you have any other symptoms at all?
