DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clarke, please. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs… on my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda painful. Been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. “Bumps on your shins that are red and painful…” And how long have they been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… a couple of months now? It started with just one or two, and I didn’t think much of it. Thought I just bumped ‘em somehow. But then more kept showin’ up, and they got more sore. It’s not like a sharp pain, more… achy, you know? Especially when I’m standin’ a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, “achy pain, especially with prolonged standing.” Have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse besides standing?
PATIENT: Well, restin’ helps, of course. When I sit down and put my feet up, it feels a little better. And… I dunno if this means anything, but they seem a little worse after a hot shower. Not much worse, but I notice it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know – worse after a hot shower. Have you tried anything to treat them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, just some regular lotion, you know? Nothing special. Didn’t really do much, to be honest. That’s why I figured I should come see someone. I’m not good at guessin’ what things are. My wife usually takes care of that, but she’s busy right now.
DOCTOR: Okay. No specific treatment tried. Let's take a look at your legs. Could you please have a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. There you go. Be careful, they’re a bit tender.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. There are multiple raised, reddish lesions on your shins. They appear to be nodules. And yes, they are tender to the touch. No warmth or drainage that I can see at the moment. I'm going to ask you a few questions now, if that's alright. Have you had any recent injuries to your legs, even minor scrapes or cuts?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing I can remember. I work movin' stuff around, so I get little bumps and bruises all the time, but these don't feel like bruises. And I haven’t had any bad falls or nothin’. Just the usual workday stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, "usual workday stuff." Have you traveled anywhere recently, within the last few months?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. Just to the grocery store and back. My wife and I used to travel a lot more, but… well, gettin’ older, you know? Makes it harder to get around. We haven’t been on a plane or nothin’ in years. Mostly stay close to home these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent travel. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I see the doctor for a check-up every year, and they haven’t told me about anything like that. Blood pressure’s a little high sometimes, but they got me on some pills for that. Besides that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, well that’s good. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the blood pressure pill, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take some over-the-counter pain reliever for my arthritis, but not every day. Just when it flares up. Mostly ibuprofen, I guess. Oh! And a multivitamin, every morning. My wife makes sure of that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asks when they give me somethin' new, and they haven't had to write anything down yet. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to somethin', wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would. Okay, good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your family members have similar skin problems or any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My family's pretty big, and we don't keep track of all that stuff. My mother had arthritis, pretty bad towards the end. And my brother, he had some kinda rash when he was a kid, but it went away. Nothing else comes to mind, really. My wife knows more about that kinda thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. One last thing for now. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smokin' for me. Never got into that. And I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but not every night. Mostly water, to be honest. Gotta stay hydrated, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Based on what you've told me, and the appearance of these bumps, my initial thought is that these could be nodules due to stasis dermatitis. This is often related to circulation issues, and can be exacerbated by things like standing for long periods. However, to be sure, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out other possibilities. Specifically, I'd like to check your complete blood count, kidney function, and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh… alright. If you think it's best, Doctor. I don't really like needles, but I trust your judgement. So, stasis dermatitis, you say? That sounds… serious? Is it somethin' I gotta worry about?
DOCTOR: It's good you asked. Stasis dermatitis can be serious if left untreated, but it’s often manageable. The blood work will help us determine the extent of any underlying circulation issues, and whether any other conditions might be contributing. We can also assess if there's any inflammation present. It's a fairly common condition, especially with age, and we can discuss treatment options – usually compression stockings, elevation of the legs, and topical creams – once we have the results. I'll write you a lab order now. The phlebotomist will draw the blood, and we should have the results back in a few days. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Compression stockings, huh? Like… those tight ones? Oh boy. Well, if that’s what I need, I guess I’ll try ‘em. A few days, you say? Alright. And what happens after the blood work? Do I come back here?
DOCTOR: Yes, compression stockings. They can be a little uncomfortable at first, but they really help improve circulation. After the blood work, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Once we have those, we can determine the best course of treatment, which may include those stockings, topical creams, and lifestyle changes like elevating your legs when you rest. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we can get you scheduled for that follow-up. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. I guess I’ll let the nurse poke me then. Hopefully it doesn’t hurt too bad. Thank you, Doctor, for explainin’ everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Clarke. I'll have the nurse come in now. And don't worry, she's very good at what she does. If you feel any discomfort during the blood draw, just let her know. We'll get this sorted out.
