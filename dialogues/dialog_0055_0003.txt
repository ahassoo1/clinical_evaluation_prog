DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I am Dr. Eaddy. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, can we just get this over with? It's this hand, see? Shakes like a leaf. Been happening for…well, a while now. Don't have time for stories, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. A tremor, you say?
PATIENT: Tremor. Yeah, that's it. Makes things difficult. Dropping things, you know? Can’t even hold a coffee cup steady anymore. Used to be able to direct a whole movie, now I can barely pour myself a drink. It's…embarrassing. Honestly, I don't even remember when it started, exactly. Old age, I guess. Everything goes when you get old.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” as you put it, can certainly bring about changes, Mr. Baide, but we should investigate the cause more thoroughly. When you say it makes things difficult, can you describe the tremor?
PATIENT: Investigate? Look, I'm eighty years old. What’s to investigate? It shakes! That's what tremors do. It’s… worse when I try to do something precise, like…writing, or buttoning a shirt. Sometimes it’s just there, a little quiver, even when I'm resting. Honestly, it's not like it’s a new development. It’s been…gradual, you know? Like a slow leak. Don't know what else you want me to tell you. I've lived a full life, Doctor. Don't need a diagnosis to tell me I’m getting old.
DOCTOR: I understand your…frustration, Mr. Baide. However, a tremor that has been gradual in onset and is present both at rest and with activity warrants further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. There are several possibilities, and it’s important to rule out anything that could be addressed. Could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, at my age, everything hurts! My knees ache, my back cracks, I forget where I put my glasses… Is that what you want to know? Look, I'm not here to list every little complaint. It’s the hand. Just the hand. And frankly, I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting my time. Medicare pays for this, right? Just tell me if there’s a pill I can take and let me go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, while I appreciate your candor, dismissing this as simply “getting old” is not appropriate medical care. It is my responsibility to thoroughly assess your condition. Aside from the hand tremor and general aches and pains, have you noticed any stiffness, slowness of movement, or changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? Stiffness…Look, I walk a little slower, sure. Everything’s a bit creaky, you know? But changes? No, not really. Maybe I don't move as fast as I used to, but who does at eighty? Honestly, you’re asking me to remember things I haven’t even noticed. I’m a director, not a medical expert. I tell people what to do, I don't analyze my own body. It’s the hand, Doctor! Stop asking me about everything else. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. Let's focus on the hand, then. Has the tremor worsened recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Hmm…that’s a good question. Probably. Things always seem worse lately, don’t they? It's harder to…hold things, to write a check…even to eat soup without making a mess. I had to ask my…the lady who helps me out…to cut my steak last night. That was…humiliating. Yes, it’s definitely worse. But again, what does it matter? It’s just getting old. I'm not expecting a miracle. Just want to know if there's anything… anything at all…to make it a little easier. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I’d like to perform a brief examination of your hands and arms, Mr. Baide, just to get a better understanding of the tremor. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, I've had doctors poke and prod at me enough times in my life. Just don’t expect me to be able to hold still. It shakes, remember? This is going to be a waste of time, but alright. Do what you have to do. Quickly, if you don’t mind. I have…things to do.
DOCTOR: Please sit here, Mr. Baide. I’m going to ask you to extend your arms with your palms facing up. Now, please tap your thumb against each of your fingers. "Resting tremor noted in both hands, more pronounced on the right. Mild rigidity present. Bradykinesia observed during finger tapping. Reflexes appear normal, but gait is slightly slow and shuffling."
PATIENT: . Look, this is ridiculous. I’m already stressed and uncomfortable. You’ve poked and prodded enough. What are you even looking for? It shakes, alright? I told you that twenty minutes ago. I'm leaving. I've got a doctor's appointment in an hour and I'm already late. Give me something for the tremor, anything, and I'll be on my way. This is a waste of my time and frankly, your time too. Just…write me a prescription. I don't need a lecture, and I certainly don't need more poking.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, please remain seated. I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply prescribe medication without a proper assessment. Based on my examination, your symptoms are suggestive of Parkinson’s disease. I understand this is a concerning possibility, and further testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. I can arrange for a referral to a neurologist who can perform a more comprehensive evaluation and discuss treatment options with you. Ignoring the possibility and simply masking the symptoms could ultimately be detrimental to your health. I strongly recommend we pursue further investigation. I will get the referral information started for you.
