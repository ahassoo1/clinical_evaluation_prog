DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. Welcome. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s this cough. It just won’t go away. Been going on for… well, a little while now. And with my heart, you know, I get worried.
DOCTOR: Right, a cough. And you mentioned your heart – are you seeing a cardiologist regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Dr. Ramirez. A very good man. I see him every six months, give or take. He’s the one who told me I have… well, heart failure, he called it. It’s been about five years now, I think. It was a hot summer, just like this one, when it really started bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll make sure Dr. Ramirez is aware of what's going on here too. So, this cough… when did this particular cough start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little tickle. But it’s gotten worse each day. Now it keeps me up at night, and I'm getting tired just from walking to the kitchen. It’s a dry cough, mostly. No… I haven’t had a fever.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, getting progressively worse, dry cough, no fever. Have you noticed any shortness of breath with this cough, or at all?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A little. Not all the time, but when I try to do something… like carry groceries, or even walk up the stairs… I have to stop and catch my breath. It didn’t used to be that way, even with the heart trouble. It feels… different this time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s been happening too. Not terrible, but definitely more puffy than usual. I have to wear my wider shoes now. I thought it might be the heat, but it hasn’t gone down even when I keep my feet up. It's mostly in the evenings, I notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles swelling, worse in the evenings. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. I haven't weighed myself in a bit, to be honest. I try not to. It upsets me. But… my clothes are feeling a little tighter. I think I’ve gained a few pounds, yes. Just in the last week or so, maybe. It’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you been exposed to anyone with a cold or the flu recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I mostly stay home, you know? Just me and the television. Old Mrs. Rodriguez next door had something last month, a bad sniffle, but I haven’t been inside her house in ages. I waved to her through the window. I'm careful, Doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick exam, and then we can talk about what might be going on. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. A little stiff today, but I manage.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening to your lungs now. I do hear some crackling sounds, especially at the bases of both lungs. Your heart sounds a little irregular, as expected, but no new murmurs. And yes, there is some significant swelling in both ankles, plus some pitting edema when I press. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 150/90. Pulse is 88 and irregular. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a bit low.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? My oxygen low? Doctor, is that bad? I've been trying to drink plenty of water, like Dr. Ramirez says, but… I just feel so tired. All this swelling too… it makes it hard to get around. Is this my heart getting worse?
DOCTOR: It's good you're seeing Dr. Ramirez regularly. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like your heart failure might be worsening, and you’re likely retaining fluid, which explains the swelling and shortness of breath. The crackling in your lungs suggests fluid buildup there as well. Your oxygen level is a little low, which is concerning. I want to order a chest X-ray to confirm the fluid in your lungs, and I’ll also check your blood levels, including a BNP, which helps us assess heart failure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. A chest X-ray and blood tests… alright. Will the blood tests tell me how bad things are? And… will I have to stay in the hospital? I really don't want to be in the hospital. It’s so lonely there.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us a better idea of how well your heart is functioning and the severity of the fluid buildup. We'll also look at your kidney function. As for the hospital, let's not jump to that conclusion just yet. We'll see what the tests reveal. Depending on the results, we might be able to manage this with medication adjustments at home. However, if your oxygen levels drop significantly, or you become severely short of breath, we may need to admit you for closer monitoring and treatment. I’ll also call Dr. Ramirez to discuss these findings with him. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. Medication adjustments, if possible. That would be wonderful. And you’ll talk to Dr. Ramirez? That makes me feel much safer. He always knows what to do. Alright. Let’s do the tests. Where do I go for those? And how long will they take? I have my stories on television later, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The X-ray is across the hall from the lab. The lab work shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes, and the X-ray will be pretty quick, maybe 10-15 minutes. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available. A nurse will come get you when you're finished and bring you back here to discuss the results. And don't worry, we'll try to get you back in time for your stories. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll get the orders for the tests started.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time with me. Oh, and Doctor? If you happen to see Mrs. Rodriguez, tell her I said hello. She makes the best empanadas.
