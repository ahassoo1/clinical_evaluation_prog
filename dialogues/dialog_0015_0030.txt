DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in how I smell… my body odor, I guess. It’s just… different than usual. I can’t really describe it, but it’s enough to make me worry.
DOCTOR: Different how, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s the hard part. It’s not worse, exactly. Just… not me. I usually smell… clean, you know? Like soap. Now it’s… almost metallic? And sometimes a little sweet, which is weird. It started maybe a couple of weeks ago, I think. I don’t remember doing anything differently, though.
DOCTOR: A metallic or sweet odor… and it's been occurring for approximately two weeks. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this change in body odor?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no weight loss, nothing like that. I’ve been feeling… normal, if that makes sense. A little tired sometimes, but I’m always a little tired. I work hard, you know, laying floors all day. But nothing that seems connected to this smell. Is that… is that normal, to just smell different? I haven’t ever heard of this happening to anyone else.
DOCTOR: It’s not common, Ms. Purtee, but changes in body odor can be indicative of several things. Given your work – physically demanding labor – and the fact you haven’t noticed any other symptoms, we should rule out some simpler explanations first. Let's start with a basic review of your medical history. Have you had any recent illnesses or infections?
PATIENT: No, nothing recent. I had a cold last winter, but that was ages ago. And a bad back for a little while, but that’s just from work. I don’t really get sick much. I try to eat healthy, and I drink plenty of water. I'm on Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. They haven’t noticed anything unusual when they checked me before.
DOCTOR: Medicare… good. We can access those records easily. And no significant illnesses recently. Any surgeries, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Not even tonsils out or anything. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, honestly. Just a lot of aches and pains from the job, but nothing serious enough for a doctor to cut me open. I did have a really bad flu when I was a kid, but that was… well, a long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: No, a childhood flu is unlikely to be relevant at this point. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, and my brother has diabetes. But that’s about it, I think. No one else in my family has had anything major. My father… he passed away a long time ago, and I don’t really remember what he died of, to be honest. I was pretty young. We didn't talk much about health stuff back then. Is that something important, Doctor? Knowing what he died of?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, yes, Ms. Purtee, but not essential if you don’t recall. Now, regarding your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once when I was a teenager, didn't like it. And I don’t drink much alcohol either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I’m not much of a partier, if that’s what you mean. I prefer to be in bed early, honestly, so I can get up and go to work. Hard work is my hobby, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and I’ve never had a reaction. I’ve taken some over-the-counter pain relievers for my back, like ibuprofen, but never anything serious. I don't have any rashes or itching or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, as far as allergies go. Is this taking a long time, Doctor? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: We are almost finished with the history portion, Ms. Purtee. Just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. Like I said, just ibuprofen sometimes when my back flares up. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. It always makes me feel a little sluggish, and I need to be on my feet all day. I take a multivitamin every now and then, but that's about it. Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t take much medicine at all. This is… very strange, this smell thing. It’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and I'd like to take a look at your skin. This is just to rule out any obvious causes for the change in odor. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. I can’t keep smelling like… whatever this is. It’s embarrassing, and I don’t want people thinking I don’t take care of myself. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat on the table. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning in the context of your work. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I don't observe any visible rashes, lesions, or areas of unusual discoloration. I’m not detecting a significantly abnormal odor at this time. However, subjective perception of odor can be variable. We may need to consider further testing.
PATIENT: That’s… disappointing. I mean, I’m glad you don’t see anything wrong, but I know I smell different. It’s not just my imagination. What kind of testing are you thinking about? And will it be expensive? I’m on Medicare, and I don’t want to get a big bill. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Maybe use a special soap or something?
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover necessary testing, Ms. Purtee, but we'll verify that before ordering anything. The first thing I'd like to rule out is a metabolic cause. We'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. This will give us a baseline understanding of your overall health and help identify any potential underlying issues. We can also check your thyroid function, as thyroid imbalances can sometimes cause changes in body odor. In the meantime, avoid using heavily scented soaps or deodorants, as they can mask the underlying odor and make it more difficult to assess. Continue with your regular hygiene routine. We will have results within a few days. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: No, no latex allergies. That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. A few days… okay. I can manage a few days. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I need to be able to work. What if it is something serious? What kind of things are you looking for, with all these tests? It’s probably just stress, right? I've been working extra hard lately.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute to changes in body odor, Ms. Purtee, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. The tests will help us assess your kidney and liver function, blood sugar levels, and thyroid hormone balance. Abnormalities in any of these areas can potentially cause changes in body odor, as can certain infections or underlying metabolic disorders. However, I want to emphasize that these are just possibilities, and we don't have enough information to make any definitive conclusions at this point. I will call you as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss them in more detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, or changes in your urination – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me. It's just… been worrying me. I'm glad you're taking it seriously. I’ll wait for your call. And I’ll let you know if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Purtee. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will escort you to schedule your lab work. Have a good day.
