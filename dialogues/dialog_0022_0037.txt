DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It is very kind of you to see me. I… I have been having trouble with my breathing. It feels tight, and I make a whistling sound when I breathe. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble breathing and a whistling sound… that’s definitely worth looking into. Can you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe two weeks ago? It was not so bad at first, just a little tired when I walked. But the last few days… it is worse. Especially when I try to do my exercises. I like to walk every morning, you see. Keeps me strong. But now… now I get very out of breath.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's been gradually worsening over the past two weeks, and it's noticeably affecting your ability to do your exercises. That's helpful to know. Does anything specifically trigger it, besides exercise?
PATIENT: That is right, Doctor. It gets worse with the walking, yes. Hmm… let me think about what makes it worse… Sometimes, when the air is very warm and humid… it feels harder to breathe then. And… I think dust bothers it too. My daughter, she helps me clean, and when she is dusting… I have to go into another room.
DOCTOR: Okay, so warm, humid air and dust seem to be triggers. And it’s worse with exertion, like your walking. Do you notice it at any other times – for example, when you’re resting, or lying down?
PATIENT: When I am resting, it is usually okay. Not so bad. When I lie down to sleep, I am fine. No whistling sound then. But if I move too fast when I get up… sometimes I feel a little short of breath then, but it goes away quickly. It is mostly when I am trying to be active.
DOCTOR: Alright. So mostly with activity, and exacerbated by warm, humid air and dust. Have you had this happen before – any similar episodes in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. Let me think… I did have something like this… a long time ago. When I was younger, maybe twenty years ago? The doctor… he said it was my chest. He gave me something to breathe in, a little pump. I used it for a while, and it got better. But I stopped using it after a few months. I thought I was better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of something similar twenty years ago, treated with an inhaler. Do you remember what the doctor called it back then, if you recall?
PATIENT: No, I do not remember the name, Doctor. I am sorry. It was a long time ago, and I do not have good memory for such things. I just remember he said it was my chest, and the pump helped me breathe. My daughter, she might remember. She sometimes comes with me to the doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, no need to apologize. It's helpful to know it was something affecting your chest. We can always check your records if that's okay with you. Before we do that, let's talk about any other medical conditions you have. Do you have any other health problems that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have a little trouble with my blood pressure. The doctor says it is too high sometimes. I take a pill for that, every morning. And… I had a little surgery on my knee a few years ago. It does not bother me much now, but it gets a little stiff in cold weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage high blood pressure with medication, and you had knee surgery some years ago. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here it is. It is called… Amlodipine. Yes, Amlodipine. And I take 5 milligrams every morning. My daughter helps me make sure I do not forget.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Amlodipine 5mg daily. And your daughter is a great help! Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, and I take my pills without problem. My daughter always checks for allergies when she makes my appointments, so I am pretty sure I am okay.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And just to be complete, have you ever smoked cigarettes, or been around a lot of smokers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My husband… he smoked a little, a long time ago, but I never liked it. I always asked him to smoke outside. And now… now he is gone, and I do not have to worry about that anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no history of smoking. Now, can you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she had trouble with her heart when she was older. And my brother… he had diabetes. But my father… he was very healthy. Lived to be a very old man. I do not know much about my other family members. They lived far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your brother. That's helpful. Now, just a few more questions. Can you tell me about how much physical activity you typically get, besides your morning walks?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, the walking is most of it. I used to do some gardening, but my knee makes it harder now. I try to help around the house, you know, light cleaning, cooking. But I am not very active, to be honest. The walking is my main exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright. So walking is your primary activity. And finally, do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not drink alcohol. Never have. And I certainly do not use any drugs. I am a very simple woman. I like my tea and my walks. That is all I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mrs. Kilton. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your breathing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you to take good care of me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath in through your mouth and then exhale slowly, that would be great. Okay… I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale. That’s consistent with some narrowing of the airways. Your breathing rate is slightly elevated, and I can feel you working a little harder to breathe. Heart rate is a little elevated too. Now, I'd like you to do a quick breathing test for me. This little device measures how quickly you can blow air out of your lungs. It won't hurt at all. Just take a deep breath and blow into it as hard and as long as you can. I’ll show you how.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try. It sounds a little scary when you say narrowing of the airways. Is that bad? I do not want to cause any trouble. Show me how to use the device, please. I am not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Mrs. Kilton, try not to worry. Narrowing of the airways is common, and we can often manage it very well. This test will just give us a better idea of how much air you're able to move. Alright, so you take a deep breath in, put the mouthpiece in your mouth, and blow out as hard and fast as you can in one long breath. Don't worry if you can't get it right the first time. We'll do it a few times to get a good reading. Okay, let's try that one more time.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was not very good, was it? I feel a little dizzy now. I am not very strong today, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mrs. Kilton. Don't worry about it. It was good to try. You're right, it can be a bit tricky. And it’s okay that you feel a little dizzy. Let’s just sit here for a moment, and you catch your breath. Your blood pressure is a little elevated right now, but nothing too concerning. Your pulse is also a little fast. Based on what you've told me, and what I'm hearing in your lungs, and this slight difficulty with the test, I suspect you may be experiencing a flare-up of asthma, or possibly Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, COPD. It sounds like you had a similar episode years ago. Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: Asthma… yes, I think that is what the doctor said before. A long time ago. COPD… I do not know that one. Is it bad, Doctor? It sounds very serious. I just want to be able to walk again.
DOCTOR: COPD is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It’s a lung condition that makes it harder to breathe, and it can sometimes develop over time. It's more common in people who have smoked, but it can happen to anyone. It can be serious, but it’s very manageable with treatment. The good news is, we can definitely help you feel better and get back to enjoying your walks. I want to start you on an inhaler to help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. I’m also going to prescribe a short course of steroids to reduce any inflammation in your lungs. I’ll also want you to get a chest X-ray to rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. Would you be comfortable getting that done today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. An inhaler and the pills… I trust you. If it will help me breathe easier, I will take anything. And the X-ray… yes, if you think it is necessary. I want to feel better. I miss my walks.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’m prescribing Albuterol, which is a quick-relief inhaler to use when you’re feeling short of breath, and Prednisone, which is the steroid. I’ll also send an order to the radiology department for a chest X-ray. Here’s your prescription for the Albuterol and Prednisone. The pharmacy should be able to fill it right away. And here’s the order for the X-ray. They’re located just down the hall. I’m also going to give you a written plan of action, outlining when to use your inhaler, and when to seek immediate medical attention. It’s very important to read this carefully. I want to see you back in one week to see how you’re doing, and to discuss the results of your X-ray. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I will read everything carefully, and I will take the pills as you say. One week… yes, I can remember that. Just one question… will I be able to walk again? Will I be able to walk like I used to? That is what I worry about the most.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mrs. Kilton, and a very important one. It’s hard to say for certain, but with treatment, and by following the plan we’ve discussed, many people are able to return to their normal activities, including walking. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and adjust your treatment as needed. The key is to listen to your body, and to not push yourself too hard. And if you experience any worsening symptoms, or if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to get back to enjoying your walks. Now, if you’re feeling up to it, let’s get you to the radiology department for that X-ray. Do you need help getting there?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I can manage. Thank you for your kindness. And thank you for listening. I feel a little better now, knowing we have a plan. I will go to the radiology department. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. That’s what I’m here for. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. And please, take care of yourself. .
