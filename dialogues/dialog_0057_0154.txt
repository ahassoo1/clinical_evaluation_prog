DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my water. I keep getting trouble with it. Seems to bother me a lot. I don't really…remember exactly when it started, but it's been happening on and off. It's very inconvenient, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Trouble with your water” – can you tell me a little more specifically what kind of trouble you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specifically? Let me see… It burns when I…go. And I have to go so often. It’s…uncomfortable, to say the least. It’s just…a bothersome feeling, really. I don’t know what it is, honestly. It's not a new thing, but it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Alright. Burning with urination and increased frequency – that gives us a starting point. And you said it's been coming back, so it's not constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. Thank goodness! It will be fine for a little while, maybe a week, maybe two, and then…it starts again. It's hard to explain. It’s not always bad, but it’s never really gone gone, you know? I just wish it would stop! It makes traveling…difficult. I like my RV, but... oh.
DOCTOR: I do understand. It sounds frustrating to have something that keeps recurring like that. Okay, let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any pain in your lower abdomen or back with this?
PATIENT: Lower…abdomen? Sometimes, yes. A dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. And my back… well, I have a bad back anyway, from…gardening, I think. So it’s hard to say if it's that pain or…the water pain. It's all a bit muddled, really. I try not to pay too much attention, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. A dull ache in the lower abdomen along with the burning and frequency… okay. And you mentioned gardening. Have you noticed any blood in your urine at any time, even a little bit?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh my. I… I don’t recall. I think no. I really don't remember ever seeing blood. It's possible, I suppose. I don’t look carefully, you know? It's… unpleasant to think about. I'm not very good at examining things like that, if you understand. I just…go. And then hope it's over.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s perfectly alright if you haven’t specifically looked. Okay, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you're asking about…things. Let me see... my back, as I said. And…the doctor, a long time ago, said something about… my nerves, I think? Something tingling. But it wasn’t anything serious. He gave me some pills, and I took them for a while. I’m divorced, does that count as a medical condition? I really don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we’ll figure it out together. No, divorce doesn’t count as a medical condition! And tingling nerves…was that in your hands and feet, or somewhere else?
PATIENT: Oh, it was…my legs, I think. Mostly my legs. It wasn’t terrible. Just a bit…uncomfortable sometimes. It comes and goes, like… everything else, really. I don't know if that’s important. It hasn’t bothered me in years. I'm mostly here about… the water, remember? I just want it to stop happening. It is getting so tiresome.
DOCTOR: You’re right to remind me – we're focusing on the water issues. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications for anything, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Ah, here it is. I take something for my blood pressure. Just a little white pill. And…sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take… something else. A small one, too. I don’t remember the names. The pharmacist knows, I suppose. I don’t bother writing things down. Too much trouble. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: This is helpful, thank you. Lisinopril for blood pressure and… Trazodone for sleep, okay. And you said you don’t remember any allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I’ve always been quite…robust, I think. I don't have allergies, not that I'm aware of. I eat everything, more or less. Although… shellfish doesn't agree with me, but that's just common sense, isn’t it? I haven't had shellfish in years. Is this going to be much longer, Doctor? I have… plans.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the shellfish. No, we're getting close to finishing up this part. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you’re comfortable with that. Just checking your abdomen and possibly a quick neurological check, just to rule out any nerve-related issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A…physical exam? Oh dear. I suppose…if you think it's necessary. But please be gentle. My back isn't what it used to be. And I don’t like being poked and prodded. It makes me anxious, you see. But...if you must. Just…be quick about it. I really don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible and as quick as I can. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen, then just a gentle palpation. I'll explain everything as I go. First, if you could lie down on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But please… no surprises. I really dislike surprises. Hurry up, Doctor. I've got a garden to tend, you know. And a lovely RV waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. Just going to listen to your abdomen with this stethoscope. It doesn't hurt, just feels a little cool. Take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, sounds normal so far. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness. Tell me if anything feels painful. Starting on your right side here… And how about there?
PATIENT: Ooh! A little bit tender there, yes. Not terribly painful, but… uncomfortable. It's always been a bit sensitive, to be honest. I don't remember why, exactly. I just know it's never been very… robust. The rest is alright, I suppose. Just that spot. Please don't press too hard, Doctor. I might have old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. Just a little tenderness in the lower left quadrant. That’s good to know. No major guarding or rebound tenderness, which is reassuring. Now, I'm just going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Just follow my instructions, okay?
PATIENT: Neurological? Oh dear. What’s that even mean? Alright, alright. Just… get it over with. But be gentle, remember? I'm an old woman, not a…a test subject! I’ll try to follow your instructions. But I don’t promise anything. I’m not very coordinated, you know. What do I have to do exactly?
DOCTOR: It just means I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation. It's very simple. First, can you sit up and let your legs dangle over the side of the table?
PATIENT: There. But I'm not very stable. And I have… varicose veins, you know. They're rather unsightly. Now what? Don’t poke them!
DOCTOR: I won’t poke your varicose veins, I promise. Now, I’m just going to tap your knees with this little hammer. This tests your reflexes. Just relax your legs. Okay, good reflexes on both sides. Now, I'm going to lightly stroke the sides of your legs with this cotton ball. Tell me if you can feel that, and where you feel it.
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, I feel it. A little ticklish, to be honest. Here, on both sides. But it's not very strong. It’s… faint, I think. Like everything else, really. It's getting old, you see. This leg isn’t what it used to be. Are we almost finished?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are almost finished. Just one last thing. Can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: There. But it’s not very… enthusiastic, is it? They're a bit stiff, you see. I don’t wear proper shoes anymore. Sandals mostly. It's much cooler in the summer. Are you sure you're almost finished, Doctor? I’ve got a garden to tend, you know. The tomatoes are ripening!
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. You have a lovely garden! And we are finished with the exam now. Everything seemed within normal limits, though your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be normal with age. Now, based on what you’ve told me – the burning with urination, the increased frequency, the occasional dull ache, and the tenderness in your lower left abdomen – it sounds like you likely have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, to be certain, we need to do a urine test. I'm going to order a urinalysis and urine culture to check for bacteria. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A urine test… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And it doesn't involve any poking. I hate poking! A UTI… is that serious? I’ve never had one before, or I don't remember having one. What do I do about it? Will I need… shots? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: No shots, I promise. A UTI is common, especially in women, and usually easily treated with antibiotics. We’ll start you on a course of antibiotics once we get the results back from the urine test. To help you feel better while we wait for the results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids—water is best—and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and sugary drinks. Also, try to urinate frequently—don’t hold it in. I'm going to give you a container to collect a urine sample before you leave. And I'll write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help with the discomfort. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Fluids… no caffeine. I can manage that. Pain reliever… good. And antibiotics… I hope they don't have too many side effects. I'm rather sensitive, you see. So, just collect a sample and then… wait for the results? How long will that take? And will I have to come back here? Oh dear. I really don’t like coming to the doctor. I've got a garden to tend, you know. And tomatoes are ripening!
DOCTOR: Yes, just collect a urine sample. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. We'll call you with the results as soon as we have them. If it is a UTI, we’ll prescribe antibiotics over the phone, and you can pick them up at your local pharmacy. You shouldn't have to come back in unless the results are unclear or your symptoms don't improve. Here's the container for the urine sample. Try to collect a "mid-stream" sample – that means start urinating, and then collect the sample mid-way through. I’ll also print out instructions for you. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Mid-stream… alright. As long as it doesn’t involve any… complicated procedures. No, I don't think so. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results. I really don’t want to be in pain any longer. And please don’t make me come back here unless it’s absolutely necessary. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a garden to tend. And tomatoes are ripening!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Claudene. I understand about the tomatoes! We’ll call you as soon as we have the results. Please don't hesitate to call us if your symptoms worsen before then. Have a good day, and enjoy your garden.
PATIENT:
