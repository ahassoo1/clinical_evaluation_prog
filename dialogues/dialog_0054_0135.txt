DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I am here… because of my ear. It is… leaking something. A little bit of liquid comes out. It is not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing some discharge from your ear, and that's concerning you. That’s a good reason to come in. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… maybe three days ago? It is clear liquid, mostly. Sometimes… a little bit of white. Not much, but it is there. It does not hurt, but it feels… strange. Like something is wet inside. And I hear… a little bit of ringing. Not loud, but it is there too.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started about three days ago, clear liquid mostly with some white discharge occasionally. No pain, but a feeling of wetness inside, and some ringing in your ear. That's helpful. Is the ringing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly when I am quiet. When I watch the television, or talk to someone… I do not hear it so much. But when I am trying to sleep… or just sitting… then I hear it. A small ring. Like… a tiny bell, maybe. Not a loud bell, a small bell.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small bell sound, mostly noticeable when it's quiet. That's good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think… maybe I do not hear as well as before. Not much different, but sometimes… when someone speaks softly, I have to ask them to repeat. My wife… she says I turn the television up too loud. Perhaps it is because of this ear? It is hard to tell.
DOCTOR: It certainly could be related to the ear issue. It's good that you and your wife have noticed that. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to take a look at your ear. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good. Please look. I want to know what is happening. I hope it is not serious. I need my ears. It is important for my work. I teach students. I must hear them.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We'll do our best to figure it out. Okay, Mr. Radillo, I'm just going to look into your ear with this instrument. It won’t hurt, but please let me know if you feel any discomfort. I'm looking for any redness, swelling, or anything unusual. Okay, I see some slight redness inside your ear canal and a small amount of fluid. Your eardrum itself doesn't appear to be perforated, which is good. And now the left ear… Similar findings here – some redness and a bit of fluid. It appears you have some inflammation in both ear canals. Based on what you've described and what I'm seeing, it’s likely you have otitis externa, or an outer ear infection. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Yes, you say infection? Is it… bad? I do not understand all the words. Will I… lose my hearing? Will it go away? And… what do we do to fix it?
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s not usually bad in the sense of permanent damage. Otitis externa is an infection of the outer ear canal – the passage that leads to your eardrum. It's fairly common, and usually treatable. It doesn't usually cause permanent hearing loss, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your hearing temporarily while it's active. The redness and fluid are signs of the infection. To fix it, we'll likely use ear drops—antibiotic and/or anti-inflammatory drops—to clear up the infection. I'll also give you some pain relief if you're experiencing any discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ear drops… that sounds good. I do not like feeling wet inside my ear. And the ringing… if the drops stop the ringing, that would be very good. Pain relief… yes, if I need it. How long… how long will it take to get better? I have classes… I must teach my students. Can I still go to work?
DOCTOR: That's understandable. The ear drops should help with the wetness and the ringing as the infection clears. Typically, you should start to see improvement within a few days of starting the drops. Full resolution usually takes about a week, but it can sometimes take a little longer. As for work, it depends on how you’re feeling. If you're able to hear adequately and aren’t in significant pain, you can likely continue teaching. However, it’s important to avoid getting water in your ears while the infection is healing. If your job involves a lot of noise, or if you’re concerned about being able to hear your students clearly, you might want to consider taking a few days off to rest and allow the infection to heal. I will write you a prescription for the ear drops, and I'll also give you instructions on how to use them properly. I'll also write a note for your employer, explaining the situation, just in case you need to take some time off. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… very helpful. A note for my employer… thank you. And instructions… very important. I do not want to do it wrong. I will avoid water. And I will listen carefully to your instructions. Thank you, Doctor Dashevsky. I feel much better knowing what is happening. And I hope… I hope the drops work quickly. Is there anything else… anything I should do or not do?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Let’s go over a few “do’s and don’ts” to help ensure a speedy recovery. Do use the ear drops as prescribed—usually twice a day for seven days. Do keep your ear dry. When showering or bathing, use earplugs to prevent water from entering the ear canal. Do gently clean the outside of your ear with a washcloth, but avoid inserting anything into the ear canal. Don’t use cotton swabs or other objects to clean inside your ear, as this can worsen the infection or damage your eardrum. Don’t swim or engage in activities that could get water in your ear until the infection is completely healed. Don't stop using the drops even if your symptoms improve before the seven days are up, as the infection may not be fully cleared. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few days of treatment, please contact the clinic, and we’ll reassess the situation. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… very thorough. I understand. Keep it dry. No cotton swabs. Seven days. I think I have it. Thank you very much for your help. I will follow your instructions carefully. I believe… that is all. Thank you again, Doctor Dashevsky. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions. Get well soon, and I hope to see you feeling better soon! .
