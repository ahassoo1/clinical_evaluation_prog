DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doc... it's my stomach. Been bleedin', see? Not like a cut or nothin', but... well, you get what I mean. It ain't pretty. And frankly, it's a bit unnervin'. Happened a couple times now, over the last week.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. Right. And how much bleeding are we talking about, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, don't give me that look, Doc. Like I'm supposed to measure it. It's enough to turn the toilet water... well, you don't need the details. Let's just say it's more than a little. Enough to worry a man, certainly. And it's dark, see? Not bright red. Dark. Makes you think, don't it? It’s not like I’m eatin’ anything strange. Just regular food, mostly. Though… maybe a bit of spicy stuff now and again. Yemenis like their spice, you know.
DOCTOR: "Regular food" is rather vague, Mr. Gentz. And "a bit of spicy stuff" doesn't help me much either. Dark blood… that usually indicates it's coming from higher up in the digestive tract. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or feeling weak?
PATIENT: Weak? Yeah, a little. Not like I’m fallin’ over or nothin', but… tired. More tired than usual. And yeah, a bit queasy sometimes, but I just chalked that up to… well, life. Things happen, right? As for vomit… not really. Just… the tiredness and the… the color, that's what bothers me. And honestly, Doc, I haven’t been feelin’ right for a while now. This bleedin’ just kinda put the cherry on top, if you get my drift. This ain't somethin' to brush off, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not something to “brush off.” Though frankly, people come in here with everything. You say you haven’t been feeling “right” for a while. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Well, let me think. Just… generally unwell. A bit of a stomach ache on and off, nothin' serious. And… harder to keep weight on, I suppose. I’m a thin fella, always have been, but… seemin’ thinner lately. And… oh, and the heartburn. Bad heartburn. Thought it was just somethin’ I ate, you know? Always liked a good spicy meal. Honestly, Doc, it’s a lot of little things. Things I usually just… deal with. But the bleedin’… that's new. And that’s what got me comin' here, finally. It’s not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gentz, it’s not “normal.” Given your weight loss, heartburn, and now bleeding, we need to rule out a few things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not ever. My wife… bless her soul… she always handled the medicine. I just took what she gave me. Haven’t really needed much medicine in my life, to be honest. Tough as nails, always have been. But… she’s gone now. Been a couple years. So, I’m kinda… on my own with this whole health thing. Point is, no allergies. Never had any problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your abdomen. Press here… does that hurt?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little. Not terrible, but… yeah, that’s tender. Right… about there. Feels… kinda hard, actually. Not usually like that. I mostly just ignore aches and pains, Doc. Always figured it was just somethin' I ate. You think it's somethin' serious? Don't tell me it’s somethin’ I gotta worry about.
DOCTOR: There’s some guarding here, and a slight rigidity. And your bowel sounds are… diminished. Given your history, weight loss, and these findings, I’m concerned about a possible gastric ulcer or, less likely, something more serious. I want to order some blood work – a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a stool test to check for blood. And I also want to schedule an endoscopy. We need to see what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Endo… what now? A scope? You’re gonna… look inside me? With a camera? That sounds… invasive, Doc. And frankly, a bit unpleasant. Is it really necessary? I mean, can’t we just… try some medicine first? Something for the heartburn? I don’t like the sound of that at all. And how much is all this gonna cost, anyway? I’m not exactly rollin’ in dough, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, you are bleeding internally. "Trying some medicine" is not a viable option at this point. An endoscopy is the only way to determine the source of the bleeding and whether there’s a more serious underlying problem, like cancer. It’s standard procedure. As for the cost… I can have the billing department speak with you about payment options. But frankly, your health is far more important than the money. We need to rule out anything serious, and delaying this will only make things worse. I am ordering the tests. Do you have any questions about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Cancer? You think… you think I have cancer? No… no, that can’t be. I feel… tired, sure, but… cancer? My wife… she had cancer. It was… awful. Look, Doc, I don't want no scope. I really don't. And I don’t have insurance, you know? I can't afford this. I just want somethin’ for the heartburn. Maybe some antacids? A stronger prescription? Please, Doc. Don't tell me I gotta do this scope thing. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, you are being irrational. I understand you’re scared, and I understand your financial concerns, but ignoring this problem will not make it go away. I am recommending this endoscopy because it is the responsible thing to do. As for the cost, we have options. I will speak with the billing department again and see what assistance programs are available. But I will not dismiss potentially life-threatening symptoms because you are afraid of a procedure. I strongly urge you to reconsider. And frankly, if you refuse to pursue appropriate medical care, I cannot be responsible for the outcome. We will schedule the endoscopy. Do you want me to give you the paperwork for the consent form, or should I have a nurse bring it to you?
