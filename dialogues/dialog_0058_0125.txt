DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. I, uh… I wanted to get tested for HIV. Just… you know. Better safe than sorry, right? I figured I should just get it checked. It’s not like it’s a big deal to know, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. “Better safe than sorry.” I suppose that’s a reasonable approach. It’s certainly not a “big deal” to know your status, as you say. It's good you’re thinking proactively. Okay. And is there anything specific that prompted this testing request now?
PATIENT: Prompted? No, not really. Just… a friend was talking about it. And then I saw something online. It just made me think, you know? I don't think I've done anything, but… well, you hear stories. It’s just… sensible, isn't it? To be sure. People are… careless, these days.
DOCTOR: Sensible, yes. A good level of… awareness. Though, honestly, the “careless” part is… a bit of a generalization. We all make choices, and responsible behavior is key, regardless of what others are doing. Let's go through a few questions, just to get a clearer picture. Have you had any recent sexual activity?
PATIENT: Recent? What do you mean by recent? Like, last week? Look, I'm married. Happily married. For… eight years now. So no. Not recently. And frankly, I find the question a little… intrusive, don't you think? It’s just a routine check, right? Not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: “Intrusive” is a strong word, Mr. Belan. It's standard procedure to assess risk factors, and sexual history is a pertinent risk factor for HIV. It's not a judgment, simply information gathering. Eight years of marriage is… reassuring, certainly. But have there been any instances of potential exposure outside of your marriage, however unlikely?
PATIENT: Potential exposure? Are you suggesting something? Look, my wife and I have a perfectly good relationship. We haven’t… needed anything else. Honestly, this is getting a bit ridiculous. I came here for a test, not a lecture on my personal life. And I specifically said I don’t think I’ve done anything. So, can we just get on with it, please? I have things to do. It's not like I'm some… irresponsible person. I work in compliance, for goodness sake!
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. Since you’re so adamant, we can proceed with the test request. However, I feel it’s my professional duty to inform you that even a single instance of unprotected exposure carries risk. And dismissing potential scenarios based on your personal perception is… unwise. Let’s move on to some general medical questions then. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I’m aware of. I eat everything. Seriously. I have a pretty strong stomach. I've traveled a lot, eaten all sorts of things… never had a problem. Look, I’m a pretty healthy guy. I don't need to worry about… pollen or peanuts or whatever it is people are allergic to. It’s… rather simple, really. I’m not some delicate flower. Can we just get this over with? This is taking forever. I bet my wife is wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. And do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't believe in all that stuff. I eat well, get enough sleep... that's all you need. I had a little indigestion last year, but I just… adjusted my diet. No pills, no potions, no… fancy remedies. I'm perfectly fine. Really. I don't like putting unnecessary things into my body. It's...unnatural. I work in compliance, remember? I know about regulations. And I’m pretty sure loading up on medications without needing them is… questionable, at best. Can we please proceed with the actual test now? This is becoming rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your insistence on your excellent health and lack of any medical history, we will proceed with the HIV test. We'll do a blood draw. It’s a standard procedure. I need to inform you that the results will take approximately one to two weeks to come back. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: One to two weeks? That seems… excessive. Couldn't you do it faster? I have a busy schedule. Honestly. I suppose not. No, I don't think so. Just… get it over with. And please be gentle. I don’t like needles. Although, I managed perfectly well in compliance, so… I can handle a little prick, I guess. Just… hurry. And try not to mess it up. It’s… rather important to get this done quickly. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: “Mess it up”?
PATIENT: Well… you know. I just mean… don’t miss the vein or something. Or… make a mess. It’s just… I don’t like seeing blood. Not my favorite thing. Honestly, it's a bit silly, I know. I handle complicated regulations all day, but… needles. It’s irrational. But please, just be careful. And quick. Is that too much to ask? My wife is probably wondering where I am. She’s very… observant.
DOCTOR: There. It’s done. And I assure you, I am quite capable of drawing blood without incident. The lab will contact you with the results in one to two weeks. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s all. Just… thank you. I suppose. I really hope it's negative. It would be… inconvenient if it wasn't. Honestly, the whole thing is just… a bit unsettling. But, you know. Better safe than sorry, right? As I said before. Right. Well. I should probably go. My wife… she's expecting me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Belan.
