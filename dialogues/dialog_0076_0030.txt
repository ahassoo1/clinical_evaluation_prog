DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, you're Kerriann Purtee, 49 years old. And you’re here… why exactly are you here today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's right. Um, well, it's a little embarrassing, to be honest. I've noticed a change in my body odor. It's not… normal for me. I usually don't have much of a smell at all, really. But lately, it’s… different. And stronger. It started maybe a couple of weeks ago?
DOCTOR: Right. A change in body odor. Two weeks, you say. Hmm. Okay. And is this… localized?
PATIENT: Localized? You mean, is it just one place? No, not really. It seems to be… all over, I guess. Under my arms, definitely, but also… just generally. Like, I can smell it on my clothes even after I shower. It's hard to explain. It’s not like… a strong sweat smell, either. It's… different. Almost musky? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Musky. Right. Well, some people just… smell different. Have you changed anything recently?
PATIENT: Changed anything? Let me think… not really. Oh! Well, I switched laundry detergents about a month ago. A new brand, one with… essential oils, I think. It smelled nice in the bottle, lavender and something else. Could that be it? I haven’t used it that long, though, and I’d think I’d notice right away if that was the cause. Otherwise… no. Same soap, same deodorant, same diet, same everything. It's just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Essential oils…people put ridiculous things on their skin these days. Alright. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me see… No fever, no chills. No rashes, no sweating more than usual, just… the smell. I feel fine, otherwise. A little tired sometimes, but I always am. I’ve been a floor layer for a long time, it’s hard work! No night sweats or anything like that. I guess that's it. It’s just… concerning, because it’s not me.
DOCTOR: Floor layer...right. Okay. Do you have any medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um, just the usual things for someone my age. A little arthritis in my knees, nothing major. And my blood pressure runs a bit high, but I take medication for that. Otherwise… pretty healthy, all things considered. I have Medicare, so I get regular checkups. They haven’t mentioned anything about a smell, though. Honestly, I'm a little embarrassed to even bring it up to them. It just seems… silly.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… alright. And any family history of… unusual smells?
PATIENT: Unusual smells? That's... a strange question. Let me think. Not that I know of, no. My mother didn't have anything like that. My grandmother… well, she was old, and things sometimes smelled a bit off, but I figured that was just… old age. Nothing anyone talked about, though. No genetic conditions that I'm aware of, either. My family's pretty healthy, generally. We just… get old, like everyone else. Is that… a common thing? People having family history of body odor? I've never heard of that.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history...unlikely. Let me just… Okay. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a quick look at your skin. Just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. Do I need to take anything off? Or just… stand here?
DOCTOR: Just stand. And try to relax. Heart sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Skin appears unremarkable. No rashes, no obvious lesions. Hmm. This is… puzzling. Do you take any other medications besides your blood pressure medicine?
PATIENT: No, just the one for my blood pressure. I've been on that for a few years now, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, but not every day. Just when my knees are really acting up. I don't understand why this is happening. It's really bothering me. I feel like people are noticing, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, sometimes medications can cause… changes. Though Lisinopril isn’t typically associated with this. And ibuprofen… no. Look, this could be a lot of things. Stress, diet… it could even be a temporary thing. I'm going to order some basic blood work, just to rule out anything obvious. CBC, CMP… and a TSH. Just to be thorough. Come back in a week, and we’ll see what the results say. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, blood work sounds good. I appreciate you doing that. A week, alright. CBC, CMP, TSH… I'll try to remember. Will I need to fast before the blood work? I always forget these things. And where do I go to get it done? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, you need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work. No food, no drinks except water. And you can get it done at the lab down the hall, room 203. They’ll give you the paperwork there. Honestly, this is all pretty straightforward. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, 12 hours. Got it. Room 203, down the hall. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you for seeing me. It's good to get it checked out, even if you don't know what's going on yet. I’ll see you next week, then. .
