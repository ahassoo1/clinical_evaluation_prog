DOCTOR: Hi Kahrin, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Hi. Just the results, please. I’m really busy, so if we could just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all. I completely understand. Let me pull up your results here… It looks like we have the complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and thyroid panel back. Are you comfortable going over them now, or would you prefer a summary at the end?
PATIENT: Just… tell me what it all means. No need to read off a bunch of numbers. Is everything okay? That’s what I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. Let's focus on what it all means. Overall, your results are quite good. Your complete blood count looks normal – no signs of anemia or infection. Your basic metabolic panel, which checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar, is also within the normal range. And your thyroid panel came back normal as well, so there's no indication of thyroid issues. Essentially, all the standard tests we ran look healthy. Is there anything specific you were worried about, or a particular reason you wanted these tests done?
PATIENT: No, not really. My employer just requires annual checkups. Everything’s good then? I can go? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, from what we've seen today, everything looks good. Your results are all within normal limits, so you've passed the annual checkup requirements as far as we can tell. However, just to be thorough – and since this is a general checkup – have you noticed any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Same as always. Look, is there anything else? I don't want to take up more of your time.
DOCTOR: No, not at this point. We’ve covered everything based on the tests performed. I will document that this was a normal annual physical, and you meet all requirements. Since you’re uninsured, I want to offer a quick resource. There’s a local community health center that offers free or low-cost preventative care if you ever need it. Would you like me to write down the information for you?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh, no, that's okay. Really. I appreciate it, but I’m good. Just… thanks for not making me sit here all day. I should probably get going.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. Well, that's great to hear then. If anything does change, or if you develop any concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here’s a copy of your results for your records. Have a good day, Kahrin, and get back to work safely!
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks. You too.
