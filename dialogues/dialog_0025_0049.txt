DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s me ears, you see. They ain’t what they used to be. Things are gettin’ muffled, like talkin’ underwater. It's been happenin' for a while now, I reckon. Hard to say how long exactly… time slips away, don’t it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Muffled,” you say. And it’s been going on for a while…difficult to pinpoint how long. Okay. Is it in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both, I think. Yes, both. Though… maybe one’s a little worse than the other. It's hard to tell. I mostly notice it when people aren't right in front of me, you know? When they're across the room, or on the phone. It's just… fainter. Like they're further away than they are. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It sounds like it could be a gradual hearing loss. Now, have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises?
PATIENT: Loud noises… let me think. Well, I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years! Lots of machines, clatterin’ and hummin’ all day long. Big ol’ pressin’ machines, that’s what I operated. Always had to wear earplugs, but… I don't know if they were good earplugs, if that makes any difference. It was a long time ago, though. They didn’t worry about things like that as much back then, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Fifty years in a shoe factory with machinery… that certainly could be a contributing factor. And you're correct, hearing protection wasn’t always prioritized in the past. Do you experience any ringing in your ears, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Ringing… sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It’s like a… a high-pitched whistle, maybe? Faint, though. Comes and goes. Dizziness… now, I have felt a little unsteady on me feet lately, but I figured that was just gettin’ old. I trip over things now and then, but who doesn’t at my age? I don’t get spinning dizzy, if that makes sense. Just a little wobbly sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ringing, occasional wobbly feeling, not spinning. Okay. And have you noticed any pain in either of your ears?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Never any pain. That’s good, right? It's just… quietin' down, that's all. Makes it hard to hear the telly sometimes, and talkin' with folks is a strain. My daughter, bless her heart, she has to repeat herself a lot. It's not her fault, of course. Just… frustrating, that's all.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No pain, just the gradual hearing loss and the occasional wobble. Let's do a quick ear exam. I’m going to use an otoscope to look inside your ears and get a better idea of what's going on. I'll also do a quick hearing test—just to get some baseline numbers. It won’t be a full audiogram, but it will give us a starting point. Do you have any wax buildup in your ears that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Wax… hmm. I used to get a little, years ago. My mother always told me not to stick anything in me ears, so I never did. I think… I think I have a little bit now, maybe? It's hard to see, of course. I don’t really mess with them much. Just leave 'em be, mostly. Is wax a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay. You do have some cerumen—wax—in both ears, it's obstructing the canal somewhat. And the quick test confirms some hearing loss, as you suspected. It’s primarily high-frequency hearing that’s affected, which is common with noise exposure. I'm not seeing any signs of infection or anything alarming, thankfully. Given your history and the exam findings, it appears we’re dealing with age-related hearing loss, likely exacerbated by your years in the factory. The wax is contributing, so let’s start by removing that. Would you be comfortable with me gently removing the wax in the office today?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds sensible. Gettin' rid of the wax first, that is. If it’s blockin’ things up, I reckon that's a good idea. Yes, I'm comfortable with that, Doctor. Gently, mind you! I don’t want you pokin’ around too much in there! But if it’ll help me hear better, I'm game. What will you do exactly?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. I understand your concerns. It will be a gentle irrigation—using warm water to soften and flush out the wax. I’ll use a small bulb syringe and irrigate one ear at a time. You may feel a little pressure or fullness, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'll stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. We’ll start with your right ear, and I'll let you know what I see. Just relax and let me know if anything feels off.
PATIENT: .
