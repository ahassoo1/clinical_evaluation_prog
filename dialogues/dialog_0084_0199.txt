DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Chayer. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it's my breathing. I've been getting really short of breath lately. It's hard to explain, honestly. It just... happens. I feel like I can't get enough air sometimes. It’s been going on for a bit now, but it feels worse recently.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Short of breath,” that’s a good place to start. And you said it's been happening for a "bit now," and worsening recently. Can you tell me roughly how long it's been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that's the hard part. Dates... they don't stick with me very well. I want to say… maybe a couple of months? Three, four? It's fuzzy. Definitely before the really hot weather started, if that helps. It was kinda gradual at first, just getting winded easier. Now… well, now it's a bit scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, before the hot weather. That’s helpful. And you mentioned it’s getting “scary” now. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… like something’s tight in my chest. Not painful, exactly. More like… pressure. And then I just… have to really work to breathe. It makes me kinda dizzy sometimes, and my heart races. It happened when I was walking up the stairs at home the other day, and I had to just sit down. That scared my wife a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness, racing heart, dizziness… and it happened with exertion, like walking up the stairs. That’s important. Do you notice anything specifically that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really? I mean, like I said, stairs definitely. Walking any distance, I guess. But sometimes it just… happens when I’m sitting. Or even when I’m trying to sleep. It’s weird. I don't think it’s linked to anything specific. I’ve been trying to avoid doing too much, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it seems to happen somewhat randomly, even at rest. Have you had any cough associated with this, or wheezing?
PATIENT: Cough… sometimes. Not a bad cough, just… a little tickle in my throat. And no, I don’t think I’ve been wheezing. I don't even know what that sounds like, to be honest. My wife hasn't said anything about it, and she usually tells me if something sounds off.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant cough or wheezing. And your wife hasn't noticed anything unusual. Now, let's back up a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I’ve been to the doctor a few times, for colds and stuff, but nobody ever said anything about my lungs. I honestly can’t recall ever being told I had anything with my chest. My health… hasn't been great, but it’s never been… lungs.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever smoked, or been around a lot of smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. And I try to stay away from smoke whenever I can. It always made me cough, even secondhand. I worked around some construction sites for a while, so there was dust sometimes, but nothing major, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking history, minimal smoke exposure. Now, I’m going to ask about other medical conditions. Do you have any problems with your heart, like high blood pressure, or have you ever had any chest pain not related to this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned it once, a while back. Said I should watch my salt intake. But I haven’t been taking any medicine for it. And no, no chest pain, other than this feeling when I get short of breath. It’s not really pain, like a sharp ache or anything. More like… pressure, like I said before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure but currently unmanaged. And no sharp chest pain. Now, let’s talk family history. Does anyone in your family have asthma, COPD, heart problems, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… that’s a tough one. My family… we don’t really talk about health much. My mother… she had some problems with her legs, swelling, I think. But I don't know what it was. And my father… he just… wasn’t very healthy towards the end. But I don't remember any specific illnesses. I don’t think anyone had asthma or COPD.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history available. Now, one more set of questions, and then I'm going to listen to your lungs. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, but that's about it. Nothing regularly. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Okay, Mr. Chayer, I'm going to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Please take a deep breath in and out for me when I ask.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. I just hope you find out what’s going on. This is kinda worrying my wife a lot, and I don’t want to keep her worried any longer.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll do our best. Okay. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, mostly on the left side. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. I also notice you're slightly elevated heart rate right now, which could be from the shortness of breath. Now, I'd like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen level is 93%, which is a little low. That's concerning.
PATIENT: 93%… is that bad? I don't even know what that means. This is starting to sound… serious. My wife is going to freak out.
DOCTOR: It’s a little lower than we’d like to see, yes. Normal is usually 95% or higher. It means your body isn't getting quite enough oxygen. It's not an emergency right now, but it’s definitely something we need to investigate. Given your symptoms, the wheezing, and the lower oxygen saturation, it could be several things. It could be asthma, even if you haven’t been diagnosed before. It could be bronchitis, or even something else. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to check for inflammation. Would you be able to get those done today?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood test… okay. Yes, I guess I can. But… will they hurt? And how long will it take? I really don’t want to spend all day here. My wife is waiting for me. And… how much will it cost? I don't have insurance, so...
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s address your concerns one at a time. The X-ray is painless—you’ll just stand or sit while a machine takes a picture of your chest. The blood test will be a quick prick of your finger or arm, and it shouldn’t take long at all. As for how long it will take, the tests themselves are quick, but the results will take a few hours to come back. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and send it to the lab, and we’ll get the X-ray done as well. As for the cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. I'll have the billing department give you a breakdown of the costs and see if there are any assistance programs available. It's difficult to give you an exact number right now without knowing the specifics, but they can definitely help. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of albuterol, which is a rescue inhaler. It can help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It’s not a long-term solution, but it can provide some relief. Would you be comfortable trying that?
PATIENT: An inhaler… okay. If it helps me breathe, then yeah, I’ll try anything. I just… I don't want to be stuck taking a bunch of medicine if I don't need it. And I really hope this isn't something serious. My wife is going to be so worried. So, X-ray, blood test, and an inhaler… what do I do first? And… how long will I have to wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's get you started. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood for the tests. After that, we'll send you over to radiology for the chest X-ray. I'll write you a prescription for the albuterol inhaler now, and you can pick that up at the pharmacy after the X-ray. The lab usually takes a few hours to process the results, so I'd estimate we'll have them by late this afternoon. We can call you as soon as they're available, or you can check back with the front desk. I'll also have the nurse give you some written instructions on how to use the inhaler and what to watch out for. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate to seek help if you're concerned. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Blood test, X-ray, inhaler… and call when the results are back. And go to the emergency room if things get worse. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I just… I hope it's nothing too serious. My wife… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Chayer. I understand your concern, and we’re going to do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. Let's get those tests done, and we’ll take it from there. The nurse will be with you shortly. In the meantime, try to stay calm and avoid any strenuous activity. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results are back.
