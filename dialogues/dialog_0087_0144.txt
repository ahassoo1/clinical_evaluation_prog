DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Soodeen, is it? Hmm. Well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, thought I should just… get checked out. She worries too much, that one. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just… old, I suppose. Is that something you check for? Being old?
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your daughter, Ms. Calvery. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, even if you’re feeling generally well. And yes, we absolutely address the changes that come with age. It’s a common reason people come to see me. “Feeling old” can encompass a lot of things. Perhaps you could tell me a little more about what specifically makes you feel that way?
PATIENT: Well… it’s just everything, isn’t it? My knees ache when it rains – though they’ve been doing that for years, so nothing new. And I forget things. Not important things, usually… just where I put my glasses, or what I had for lunch. Though, come to think of it, was it tuna? I do love tuna… Anyway, it’s just… things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, you know? It’s probably nothing. Honestly, I’m probably wasting your time. You see young people with real problems all day, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like you’re wasting my time at all, Ms. Calvery. Changes in memory and aches and pains are very common as we get older, but it’s important to understand why they’re happening and rule out anything concerning. We want to make sure you’re as comfortable and healthy as possible. You mentioned your knees ache with the rain. Is that pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Mostly with the weather, like I said. Dampness is the worst. Though sometimes, if I’ve been on my feet too long… gardening, mostly. I used to have a beautiful rose garden, you know. Not so much anymore. It’s just… harder now. But the pain isn’t terrible, really. Just… annoying. And it makes me feel old, complaining about my knees! Honestly, I probably just need to sit down more. Though then my daughter says I’m getting weak… it’s a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily activities, which is important for us to address. And it’s good you’re aware of the cycle. We can certainly discuss ways to manage the pain and maintain your activity level. Now, about your memory… you mentioned forgetting where you put things or what you ate. Has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to start suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I think… gradual. Yes, definitely gradual. It hasn’t been like, overnight or anything. It’s just… little things. Like, I’ll walk into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and can’t quite remember their name, even if I’ve known them for years. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to have such a good memory! I could remember everyone’s birthday, all the dates… Now? Forget about it. Though, to be fair, I’ve got a lot on my mind. Just… life, I suppose. It piles up, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does pile up, Ms. Calvery. Those kinds of changes can be frustrating, and it’s good you’re noticing them. It’s also common with age. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if these memory issues are interfering with your ability to manage your daily life – things like paying bills, taking medications, or keeping appointments?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, nothing like that. I’m perfectly capable, thank you very much. I still handle all my own finances, and I take my medications every day. My daughter worries about that too, but I haven’t missed a dose yet. And I remember my appointments… mostly. I write them down, of course. I’m not that forgetful. It’s just… little lapses. Like, I might go to the store and forget what I went there for, but I always remember to lock the door when I leave. Does that make sense? It’s not like I’m wandering around lost or anything. Honestly, I think people make too much of these things. It's just… getting old. I keep telling you! Though, I suppose it’s good to check, just in case. But I assure you, I’m perfectly fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you’re still managing so well on your own, Ms. Calvery, and that you’re so organized. It sounds like these are more mild lapses, which is helpful information. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking about things I barely remember! Let me think… My husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure. But me? I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was… well, a long time ago. And I think the doctor mentioned my cholesterol was a little high at one point, but I don’t really remember taking anything for it. I see a lot of doctors, you know? It’s hard to keep track. Honestly, I probably should have brought a list. But my daughter just said, “Go get checked out!” and I didn't really think it through. Is it important? Because if it isn't, I'm sure it's just fine. It’s probably just… old age. Really. It’s what everything comes down to, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. That’s why we’re here – to sort through things. And you’re right, it’s good to get a clear picture. We can access your medical records electronically, so we don’t need a list. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get hives as a child, but that was ages ago. And I’m pretty careful about what I eat. I don’t eat a lot of processed food, and I always cook things thoroughly. My mother always said, "Better safe than sorry!" She was a very practical woman. Though, now that I think about it, I did have a bit of a rash last year after using a new hand lotion. But it went away on its own. Honestly, I don't think that counts. Is this important? You're asking a lot of questions. It’s not that I'm trying to be difficult, it’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? It's probably just… old age. Really. It’s what everything comes down to, isn’t it? I'm starting to sound like a broken record.
DOCTOR: You are not at all being difficult, Ms. Calvery. It’s perfectly understandable, and I apologize if I’m overwhelming you with questions. We just want to be thorough. And you're right, it’s good to rule things out. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. A tiny white one. And… let me see… I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was low on it. And sometimes, I take fish oil for my joints. My daughter recommended it. She reads a lot of articles online. I also take something for… is it cholesterol? Yes, I think so. A little orange pill. Honestly, they all look the same after a while. I keep them in a little container, but I don’t always remember which one is which. And sometimes, I take a pain reliever for my knees when they’re really bothering me. Ibuprofen, I think. Is that everything? It's hard to keep track! Honestly, you're right. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s probably just… old age. Really. It’s what everything comes down to, isn’t it? I think I'm ready for a nap.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you’re taking several medications and supplements, which is good to know. It’s important to review these periodically to make sure they’re still appropriate and not interacting with each other. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well… alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. And I’m a little sensitive. Honestly, I just want to make sure everything is… normal. As normal as can be, for my age, of course. It's probably just… old age. Really. It’s what everything comes down to, isn’t it? But yes, go ahead. If you must. Just be gentle, dear.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. We’ll also do a quick neurological assessment and check your reflexes. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. It can fluctuate, so we'll monitor it over time. Your lungs sound clear, but I'm hearing a slight gallop in your heart rhythm. It's subtle, but something we’ll want to investigate further. Your ears, nose, and throat all look normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'd like to assess your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees! Alright, alright, I'll walk. Slowly, though. Very slowly. It's hard, you know? Getting old. I feel like I'm wobbling. There. I walked. Am I supposed to do anything special? Twirl or something? Honestly, I'm feeling a little dizzy now. It's probably just… old age. Really. It’s what everything comes down to, isn’t it? I'm not very good at this walking business. And my knees are killing me. Can I sit down now?
DOCTOR: Yes, please, have a seat. That was very good, Ms. Calvery. I just wanted to assess your balance and gait. It appears you have a slightly unsteady gait, which is not uncommon with age, but we should investigate further. Based on your history and the physical exam, I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and vitamin levels. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm, given the slight gallop I heard. And finally, I think it would be beneficial to get a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. More tests? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a science experiment. Blood tests, EKGs, metabolic panels… It’s a bit much, isn’t it? I just came in for a little check-up, and now I need a whole battery of tests? I suppose… if you think it's necessary. But are they going to hurt? And will they take a lot of blood? I don't like needles, you know. It’s probably just… old age. Really. It’s what everything comes down to, isn’t it? But alright. Do what you have to do. Just be gentle, dear. And try not to poke too much. My daughter will be relieved, I suppose. She always worries about these things. Honestly, I think she's the one who needs a check-up, not me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery. It’s not about thinking something is necessarily wrong, it’s about getting a baseline and making sure we’re addressing any potential issues proactively. The blood draw will only take a small amount of blood – a few vials. The EKG is painless; we’ll just place some stickers on your chest. I’ll write up the orders now, and the nurse will come in to explain the process and draw your blood. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmmm. Questions… Well, what will these tests tell you? I mean, what are you looking for? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to have to come back here every week, you know. And will they need to poke me again? Honestly, I just want to know if I’m going to be alright. Is my heart okay? And are my knees going to keep aching? It's probably just… old age. Really. It’s what everything comes down to, isn’t it? But alright. Tell me what you think. And try not to use too many complicated words, dear. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know? Honestly, I think I need a nap. All this talking is exhausting.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ms. Calvery. The blood tests will give us information about your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and vitamin levels. This helps us understand your overall health and identify any potential imbalances. The EKG will assess the electrical activity of your heart, to make sure it's beating regularly and efficiently. As for your concerns about your heart and knees, we need the test results to get a clearer picture. The EKG will help us determine if your heart is functioning normally. As for your knees, we can discuss potential causes of your pain, such as arthritis or wear and tear. We can also explore treatment options, like pain medication, physical therapy, or injections. It usually takes a few days to get the test results back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I'll call you if anything urgent comes up. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Honestly, you've explained it very well, dear. And you’re very patient with an old woman like me. I suppose I should just get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can stop worrying. It’s probably just… old age. Really. It’s what everything comes down to, isn’t it? But alright. Tell the nurse I’m ready. And please, be gentle with the needle. I do hate needles, you know. Honestly, I think I need a cup of tea. All this worrying is exhausting. .
