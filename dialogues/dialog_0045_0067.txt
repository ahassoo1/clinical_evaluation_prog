DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, good to see you… or, well, meeting you is more accurate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… right. The… the breathing. It hurts when I take a deep breath. Not all the time, just… when I try to take a big one. It’s been happening for… a little while now, I think. I don’t really keep track of dates so well anymore.
DOCTOR: “A little while” isn’t terribly specific, Mr. Ruocco. But we’ll get there. And it only hurts when you try to take a big breath?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Sometimes it feels… tight, even when I’m not trying. But the pain… the sharp pain is when I really try to fill my lungs. Like… like when I used to haul lumber, you know? But I don't… I don’t do that anymore. It’s been years. A long, long time. Is that… is that helpful? I forget what’s important to tell you.
DOCTOR: It’s… something. Alright. So, tightness at times, sharp pain with deep breaths, and you used to do manual labor. Any cough with this?
PATIENT: Cough? Hmm… sometimes. Not a bad one, just… a little tickle in my throat. Nothing that keeps me up at night, or anything. Mostly just when the air is… dusty. I used to work construction, you know? A lot of dust. But that was a long time ago. I don’t… I haven’t done that work in decades. Do you need to know what kind of construction? I can’t really remember all the details…
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Ruocco, the type of construction isn’t crucial right now. Just trying to get a picture here. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or emphysema?
PATIENT: Asthma… emphysema… Oh, goodness. Those are… big words. I don’t think so. The doctors… I saw doctors a long time ago, when my wife was still… well, that was a long time ago. They didn't say anything about those things. They mostly just told me to… to take it easy. And I have been, mostly. Old age does that to you, you know? Everything hurts eventually. I'm not sure what those words mean, exactly. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll stick to what you're feeling. Do you have any history of smoking?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh, yes. A long time ago. When I was young, everyone smoked. It was… normal. I quit though. A very long time ago. Before… before a lot of things happened. Decades, I think. Maybe thirty years? It's hard to remember, really. I don't smoke anymore, not even a little. Does that… does that matter? I'm trying to tell you everything I can, but the years… they all run together.
DOCTOR: It matters. Thirty years is good. Now, any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… not really. Like… a soreness sometimes, in my chest. But it’s not… sharp. It’s more of a… ache. Like when I lift something heavy, even though I don’t lift things anymore. I try not to lift things anymore. It’s just… a dull ache. Not the same as the pain when I breathe. Does that make sense? I don't know if I'm explaining this right. Everything feels a little… fuzzy today.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and another. Good. Okay. Sounds… a bit diminished on both sides. Not wheezing, but… less air movement than I'd expect. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Hmm. Not that I've noticed. I don't really check my temperature, you know? I just… if I feel warm, I put on a sweater. And night sweats… well, I sleep hot sometimes, even without trying. Old age, probably. It's hard to tell what's normal and what's not anymore. It just feels… warm sometimes. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this. Everything feels a little… jumbled today. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your history… and what you're describing… it’s likely some degree of chronic bronchitis, potentially exacerbated by previous smoking. We'll need a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious. And I'm going to order a basic metabolic panel just to get a baseline. I'll write the orders now. Don’t push yourself, and if the pain gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, go to the emergency room immediately. I'll also give you an albuterol inhaler to try. Stop using it if it makes you feel too jittery. Do you understand?
