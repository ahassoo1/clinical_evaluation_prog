DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…want to get this done quick if okay? It’s for…referee stuff. Fitness check. I need paper say I’m good.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. I understand you need a fitness-to-referee form completed. We can definitely work through that. To be thorough, even for a routine check, I’ll need to ask a few questions about your overall health and history. It shouldn’t take too long. Let’s start with the reason for the check-up today. You mentioned it’s for refereeing – is this a new requirement, or is this a regular check-up you do annually?
PATIENT: New. New rule this year. They want…paper. Before, no need. I’ve been refereeing…ten years, maybe more. Long time. Never had problem before. Just…paper now. Want to get it done so I can keep working.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Ten years of experience is excellent! It sounds like you’re generally very healthy, and this is mostly a formality. Still, we need to ensure everything is in order for the form. To start, can you tell me about any current medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I… work hard. Refractory… it's hot work. Sometimes back hurt. But just…work. No doctor for long time. Not sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medical conditions. And you mentioned some back pain related to work. Is this a recent development, or has this been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Many years. Not…bad bad. Just ache. Rub good, feel better. I lift… heavy things. Big bricks. That’s my job. Sometimes… feel it more. But I can still run. Need to run for referee.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chronic back pain related to your job as a bricklayer. That's good to know. And you're still able to run without significant issue?
PATIENT: Yes. Run okay. Not…fastest, but can run. Enough for job. They test… short runs. Need to pass. That’s why I’m here. Want paper. Is…will I pass? I don't want to lose work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Shanor. We'll do our best to get you the documentation you need. To help me assess things, let’s go through a brief review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. No high blood…nothing like that. I eat okay. Work food. Rice, meat. Not much sugar. No…heart problem. I feel strong. Sometimes tired, but work is hard. Never been told anything wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior diagnoses. That’s good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. No hospital. Cut finger once when I start job. Very small. Stitch it up. That's it. Never anything serious. Just…work accidents. Small things. Not need hospital. Just…bandages.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant surgical history or hospitalizations. Just a minor finger injury. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… water. And… sometimes, when back very sore, I rub… medicine on skin. Tiger Balm? You know? Red bottle. But I don’t take pills. Never. Not good for body. I work. That’s better than pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just topical Tiger Balm for your back pain when needed. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergy. Never. I eat everything. Spicy food. Everything. Not problem. Not sick from food. Not sick from… anything. Never had allergy. Wife… she had allergy to cats. But I… not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do either of your parents or siblings have any significant medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer?
PATIENT: Um… my wife… she had… cancer. Long time ago. Passed away. My parents… they both gone now. Old age. Not sick. Just… old. No heart problem. No… sugar problem. They work hard farmer. Strong people. No… special sickness.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Shanor, and your parents. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. Never drugs. Sometimes… small glass of beer. With dinner. Not much. Maybe… once a week. Just… relax. Not every week. Sometimes month. Not problem. I need sleep. Work hard, need sleep. No… bad habit. Just… beer sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of beer. That’s good to know. Finally, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Um… I think… one meter seventy four. Maybe. And… about sixty three kilograms. I weigh myself sometimes. Not much. Not fat. Just… strong. Is that okay? Is that enough? I need to pass the test.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Shanor, that's perfectly fine. 1.74 meters and 63 kilograms. That gives you a BMI within a healthy range. Alright, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and a basic musculoskeletal assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Whatever you need. Get it done. Fast. I have… work later. But okay. Do it. Just… don't take too long. I want paper.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I’ll wrap the cuff around your upper arm. Okay, I’m inflating the cuff now. Just breathe normally. … 130 over 80. That’s within a normal range. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation on both sides. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. Not so good. Back… tight. Not go all the way. Like always. I can still run. But…bend not so good. Old work injury. Very long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There's some mild tenderness to palpation in your lower lumbar region. No signs of acute injury, but it seems to confirm some chronic muscle tension. And you said you can still run without significant issues?
PATIENT: Yes. Run okay. Short distance. Referee, not marathon. They need quick run. Stop and start. Can do. Not pain when run. Just… ache after. Rub good, feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. Based on the physical exam, your vital signs are within normal limits, your heart and lungs sound clear, and you have some chronic lower back muscle tension, consistent with your work history. You're able to run without significant pain, which is good. To complete the fitness-to-referee form, I'd like to order a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function, just as a precaution. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood…test? More time. More money. I just need paper say I’m okay. Referee. Is…can you just… write okay? I don’t want blood test. I need work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Shanor. I want to be thorough and ensure you're completely healthy, and a basic blood panel is the best way to do that. However, I also respect your wishes and understand your need to return to work quickly. Given your history, the results of the physical exam, and your ability to perform the required physical activity, I can complete the form stating you are medically cleared to referee. However, I strongly recommend you follow up with your primary care physician for a comprehensive health check-up in the near future. Would you like me to proceed with completing the form based on my examination today, with the understanding that a more thorough evaluation is recommended?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Please. Just… write okay. I will… try to see doctor later. But right now… work. Need money. Yes. Write okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. I'm happy to help. Here you go. This form states that you are medically cleared to referee. I have also noted my recommendation for a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Thank you again, Doctor. You are very good. I go now. Have good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Shanor. You have a good day as well, and please take care of your back. .
