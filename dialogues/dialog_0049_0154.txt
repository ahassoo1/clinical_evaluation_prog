DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks, I suppose. They bother me. A lot. It’s been happening on and off, but… more on lately, if that makes sense. I don’t… I don’t recall exactly when it started, truly. Just… troublesome.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. And when you say “troublesome,” could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… Oh dear. It burns, mostly. When I… when I go to the bathroom. And I have to go so often. It’s… very inconvenient. I find myself… rushing, you know? I don't… I don't know what else to tell you. It's just… uncomfortable. And sometimes… a little ache. Down low. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Burning with frequency, and some lower abdominal discomfort. Alright. And has this been accompanied by any fever, chills, or back pain?
PATIENT: Fever…? Oh, goodness. I don't think so. No chills, certainly. Back pain… sometimes, a little. But I have a bad back anyway, from years of… well, fixing things. I used to work on those… those big camper things. Recreational vehicles, they call 'em. But I don’t know if the ache now is from that, or from… this. It’s all rather muddled, to be honest. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Muddled is… not ideal. Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any changes in the smell or color?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh, no, no blood. I… I think not. The color… it's usually… usual, I suppose. A bit darker sometimes, maybe? But I don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing. The smell… I haven’t noticed anything different, no. Honestly, Doctor, I just want it to stop bothering me. It's… a nuisance. A very persistent nuisance. I don't remember the last time I slept a full night.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a quick look at your history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh, dear. I… honestly, I can't recall. I don’t take much, usually. A pain reliever now and then for my back, but… nothing regularly. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… I really couldn’t say for certain. It’s been a long time since I’ve needed anything, truthfully. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It's… prudent to ask. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… The doctor before… years ago, he mentioned my blood pressure was a little high, once. But he said it was just from stress. I don't think I have… what was it? Diabetes? No, I don't think so. I used to be very active, fixing those vehicles. Lots of lifting and bending. But… things slow down as you get older, you know? I don’t really go to the doctor much. I prefer to handle things myself, usually. It's… embarrassing, to be honest, coming in for something like this. A nuisance, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Wease, given your symptoms – the burning, the frequency, the lower abdominal discomfort – it could be a simple urinary tract infection. However, without a urine sample, it’s difficult to say for certain. We'll need to rule out other possibilities, as well. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count. Do you have any family history of kidney problems or bladder issues?
PATIENT: Oh, a sample… Yes, I suppose. That makes sense. Kidney problems…? Oh, my mother… she had some sort of trouble with her… waterworks, too, when she got older. But I don't recall the details. She didn’t talk much about it. And my father… he was a strong man, very healthy. No problems, as far as I know. It’s all… a bit hazy, I'm afraid. It was a long time ago. Is this going to be a long process, Doctor? I do have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Well, it's hardly a complex undertaking, Ms. Wease. A simple urine sample and blood draw. It will take a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water – at least eight glasses a day – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. We'll go from there once we have the results. Now, let’s get that sample. The nurse will show you to the restroom. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Eight glasses… Yes, I can manage that. Water. No caffeine… I don’t drink much, anyway. Alright. A nurse, you say? Very well. I suppose I’ll… go then. I just want this sorted out, you know? It’s… disruptive. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: We'll do our best. The nurse is right this way.
PATIENT: .
