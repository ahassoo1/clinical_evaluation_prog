DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudeney, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't even know why they sent me. I feel fine. Mostly. It's probably just stress, you know? From… things.
DOCTOR: “Stress,” right. Well, we take all reports seriously, even if you feel fine. It’s good you’re here to get it checked out properly. Now, when did someone first mention this high blood pressure to you?
PATIENT: My husband's coworker, actually. He's a… well, he's a bit of a health nut. Always going on about numbers and stuff. He got one of those machines and kept bugging us to check our pressure. Said my husband's was a little high, and then he made me check, and that's when he said it was too high. I told him he was probably just messing with the machine. It’s just a machine, right?
DOCTOR: Machines can be… unreliable, yes. But they can also be a good starting point. It's good your husband is looking out for you. Still, we need to confirm what that machine told you. Before we do that, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Honestly, I don’t see the point in wasting time if I feel okay. It's just… a lot of fuss over nothing, usually. I eat normal, I don’t smoke, and I definitely don’t drink much. I work, I go home, I sleep. That's it. What's there to diagnose?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is subjective, Ms. Dudeney. And even people who feel perfectly healthy can have underlying issues. High blood pressure often has no symptoms, which is why it’s called the “silent killer.” It’s not about wasting time, it's about preventative care. Let’s just get a baseline reading and we can go from there. Now, tell me about your diet. You said "normal," but can you give me a typical day?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. What do you want to know? Okay, breakfast is usually coffee and a piece of toast. Sometimes cereal if I have time. Lunch is a sandwich, usually ham and cheese. And dinner… depends. My husband does most of the cooking. It’s usually something with meat, potatoes, and a vegetable. We like fried chicken a lot. And… I do like sweets. Cookies, mostly. Is that what you want to know? Just tell me what I have to say.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And water intake?
PATIENT: Water? I drink… when I’m thirsty. Look, I don’t sit around sipping water all day. I drink juice sometimes. And coffee, like I said. Is there a right amount of water I'm supposed to be drinking? I really don't pay attention to that stuff. It feels like you're trying to find something wrong with me.
DOCTOR: It’s not about finding something wrong, Ms. Dudeney. It’s about gathering information. Hydration is important. Alright. Let’s move on. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe ibuprofen for a headache sometimes, but that’s it. And I haven’t had a headache in… well, I can’t even remember the last time. Honestly, I feel perfectly healthy. This whole thing is ridiculous. Can we just check the pressure and be done with it? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s get this over with. Please, have a seat here. Try to relax. I'll need you to remain still and quiet while I take your reading.
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally. Don’t talk. Alright. Your blood pressure is… 158 over 92 on the right arm, and 160 over 94 on the left. Your pulse is 78 and regular. That is… elevated. Significantly. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now, just to get a more complete picture. Please, take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Elevated? See? That machine was probably wrong. My husband’s coworker just likes to worry people. It’s probably just from… being here. The doctor’s office always makes me nervous. It's stressful, you know? You’re poking and prodding and asking questions. Of course my blood pressure is going to be high. It's common sense.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds normal, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear. While those readings could be slightly elevated due to being in a clinical setting – what we call "white coat hypertension" – these numbers are high enough to warrant further investigation. You're right, it's good you're here to get this checked out. We need to rule out any underlying causes. I'd like to order some blood work: a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG. Also, given your age and history, we need to check your kidney function and rule out any secondary causes of hypertension.
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? You're kidding me, right? I just want to know if my blood pressure is a little high because I'm stressed. I don't need a whole battery of tests. My husband will be furious if I have to spend all day at some lab getting poked and prodded. It's just a waste of time and money. Honestly, I think I'm just going to go home and take some deep breaths. This is ridiculous. Can't you just… prescribe me something for the stress?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand your reluctance, but prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. We don't know why your blood pressure is elevated. It could be stress, absolutely, but it could also be a sign of a serious underlying medical condition like kidney disease, heart problems, or hormonal imbalances. Simply masking the symptom with medication won’t address the root cause, and could even delay proper treatment. Ignoring this could lead to stroke, heart attack, or kidney failure. The blood work and EKG are standard procedures to rule out these possibilities. It's not about wasting time or money, it's about ensuring your health and preventing serious complications. I strongly recommend you follow through with these tests. I can order them for you now and provide you with a lab slip. The lab is located downtown, and the tests should only take about an hour. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. But if those tests come back normal, I'm not coming back. And tell your lab not to poke me too much. I hate needles. Just… write the slip. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the lab slip. The orders are for a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG. The lab should be able to accommodate you today, but it’s always best to call ahead to confirm their hours. I also want to emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications: reducing sodium intake, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. I want to see you back in one week to discuss the results. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or vision changes before then, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
