DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Trestrail. Well, I've been getting chills lately. It’s a bit weird, honestly. Not a fever, just…cold. Like when you're getting a cold, but without the other stuff.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Chills without a fever or other cold symptoms. And how long have these chills been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe a week? It comes and goes, not constant. Some days I barely notice it, others I’m just…brrr. It doesn’t feel bad bad, just uncomfortable. I was hoping it would go away on its own, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: A week, intermittent chills. Alright. And are these chills accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t these days? I don’t have a cough, no sore throat, no body aches… just the chills and feeling a bit worn out. I’ve been drinking plenty of water, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Actually… yeah, I think my appetite has been a little off. Not huge, but I haven't been as hungry as usual. I haven’t weighed myself, though, so I don't know about weight changes. I've been kinda stressed with things, maybe that's it?
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly affect appetite. Now, let’s go through a bit more of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else, and broke my arm once when I was little, but nothing major. No surgeries or anything like that. I generally stay pretty healthy, to be honest. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. Is that enough information? I can try to remember more if you need me to.
DOCTOR: That's a good start. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tricky one. My mom has high blood pressure, and my grandma had… something with her heart, I think? It was a long time ago and my family doesn't really talk about health stuff much, so I don't have a lot of details. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s mostly just the usual aging things, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies, thankfully! I can eat whatever, no reactions to any medications or foods that I’m aware of. I haven't had any issues with pollen or animals or anything like that either. I’m pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I'll usually just rest and drink fluids if I'm not feeling well. I did take some ibuprofen a few times last month for a headache, but that was it. Does that count? It was a really bad headache, honestly.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen for a headache, that’s good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol - maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, and definitely no recreational drugs. I try to live a pretty healthy life, all things considered. I work as a health education specialist, so I kinda have to, haha.
DOCTOR: Right, a health education specialist. That is ironic, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Haha, you’re telling me! It’s a bit embarrassing, really. I tell people what to do all day and then I’m the one sitting here with chills. Makes it hard to be convincing sometimes, you know? But yeah, I try my best. Hopefully, this isn't anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Dr. Trestrail. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 118/72. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. No palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen... No tenderness or masses noted. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. However, given your reported fatigue and chills, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel should give us a good baseline. I’ll also check your thyroid levels, just to be sure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, thank you. Blood work sounds good. I just want to know what’s going on, so whatever tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to do them. I’m a little worried it might be something serious, but I guess that's why I came to see you! Where do I go to get that done?
DOCTOR: It’s wise to be proactive. You can go to the lab just down the hall, room 203. The lab technician will need a copy of this order, which I’m sending electronically now. They’ll draw a small amount of blood. It shouldn't take long. While we wait for the results, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. If your symptoms worsen—specifically, if you develop a fever, severe fatigue, or any other concerning symptoms—please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Room 203, get plenty of rest, and contact you if anything gets worse. Thank you, Dr. Trestrail. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run those tests. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I will let them know my name is Jailenne Aslan when I get to the lab. Is there anything else I should do or know before I go?
DOCTOR: No, that covers it. They will have your information on file. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they are available, likely within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, try not to worry unduly. Often, these things resolve on their own, or are easily treatable. I'll see you back here if the results warrant further discussion.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Dr. Trestrail. I will wait for your call. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Aslan. You too. .
