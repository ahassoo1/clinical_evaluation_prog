DOCTOR: Hi Norval, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It’s… this is a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I just… I get full awful quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what I’m eating, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I could burst. It’s been going on for a few months now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is frustrating, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. No need to be embarrassed at all – we deal with all sorts of things here. So, a few months now… and it’s with most foods?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much most foods. Maybe not soup as bad, you know, 'cause you sip it. But a plate of anything solid… fish and rice, bannock, even just a sandwich… a few mouthfuls and I’m done. Used to be able to put away a good plate, I tell ya! My wife keeps saying I’m losing weight, which… well, she’s not wrong. I just don't have much appetite anymore 'cause of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's affecting your appetite because you get full so quickly. And your wife has noticed some weight loss. That’s helpful to know. Is there any pain or discomfort when you're eating, or just after?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Just… that stuffed feeling. Like someone put a rock in my belly. It’s not a bad ache, just… uncomfortable. And it comes on so fast! I used to enjoy my meals, you know? Now I'm just picking at things. It's a bit of a nuisance, honestly. I don’t feel sick, just… full. Very quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just a quickly-onset feeling of fullness and discomfort. That’s good information. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I’ve been a bit more tired, maybe? But I'm 88 years old, Doctor! What isn’t tired at 88? I don't know if that's related or just… old age creeping in. My wife says I nap more, that's for sure. Nothing else I can think of, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased fatigue and napping, which could be age-related, but we’ll keep it in mind. Now, have you had any trouble swallowing at all?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing. Everything goes down just fine. It’s after it goes down that the trouble starts! A few bites, and then… boom. Full. It’s not like it’s stuck or anything. Just… too much, too soon. It’s a strange feeling, I can tell you. I’ve never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a broader picture, have you had any changes in your bowel movements – anything different with constipation, diarrhea, or the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re asking a lot, Doctor! Let’s see… no, nothing really different there. Regular as clockwork, if you know what I mean. Maybe a little… darker, sometimes? But I eat a lot of berries, so… could be that. Nothing majorly different, no. Sorry if that's too much information.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! It's important information, and I appreciate you sharing. Darker stool with berry intake is perfectly reasonable. Okay, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I had a bit of a scare with my heart years ago, maybe 20 years back. They said it was just a flutter, nothing serious. Had it checked out regular for a while, but the doctor said it cleared up on its own. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. Arthritis in my hands, mostly. Nothing major. No diabetes or anything like that, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a heart flutter that resolved on its own, and some arthritis in your hands. Good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I’ve been lucky that way, I suppose. My wife keeps telling me I should get my cataracts done, but I can still see well enough for now. I’m a bit nervous about going under the knife, if you know what I mean. Always been a bit of a worrier, that’s me. But no, no surgeries. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, a small pill. Doctor gave it to me a few years back. Helps keep things even, he said. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis when my hands are really bothering me, but that's just now and then. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for blood pressure and something for arthritis as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things, berries, fish, bannock… my wife makes a mean salmon pie, and I enjoy every bite… well, used to, before this started. No allergies at all. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to finish up with the history, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother lived to be 92, a strong woman. My father passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. My brother had some problems with his stomach when he got older, but I don't know exactly what. Nothing else really stands out, to be honest. We weren't big on talking about medical things when I was growing up. A bit of a stoic family, if you know what I mean. We just… dealt with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother lived to 92, father passed from heart trouble, and brother had stomach issues. Alright, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a few things like that. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. Go ahead. I’m used to doctor visits at my age, I suppose. Just let me know if anything feels… odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you’re generally active. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything is tender. Okay… It's a little soft, not rigid. No masses that I can feel. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here on your left side?
PATIENT: No, that's alright. Feels… normal. A little pressure, but nothing painful. Like you said, a little soft. My wife always says I have a bit of a belly, but that's just from enjoying good food, I suppose. Nothing unusual there. Not tender at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And just to get a complete picture, I’m going to check your reflexes. Everything seems normal there as well. Alright, Norval, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, there are a few possibilities we should consider. Given your age and the rapid fullness you experience, it could be something relatively minor like decreased stomach motility – meaning your stomach isn't emptying as quickly as it used to. However, we also want to rule out anything more serious, such as early satiety due to a possible gastrointestinal issue. I'd like to order a couple of blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any deficiencies. And I’d also like to order a stool test to check for any abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood tests and a stool test… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to enjoying my meals again. I miss a good plate of salmon and rice, I tell you. So, yes, go ahead with the tests. How do we go about that?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll get the lab requisition forms filled out for you. You can take them to the lab just down the hall, and they’ll draw the blood and give you a container for the stool sample. They're open until 5pm today. The blood tests will check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and thyroid levels. The stool test will check for infection and inflammation. Once we have the results back, we can discuss them and figure out the next steps. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get everything back. In the meantime, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals and trying to avoid foods that seem to trigger the fullness quickly. Also, make sure you’re staying hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Smaller meals, stay hydrated… alright. Sounds sensible enough. And wait for the results. 3-5 days, you said? Alright. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time to figure this out. I appreciate it. I'll go down to the lab now and get this done. Is there anything else I need to know before I go?
DOCTOR: No, that's it for now. Just take the requisition forms to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. The results will be sent directly to me, and my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re back. Here you go. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment. It was good meeting you, Norval. I hope you feel better soon. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll see you in a few days, then.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Norval! Take care.
