DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. It’s my hearing, on one side. Went suddenly. And my face… feels a little droopy on that same side. It started yesterday morning, just… noticed it. Is that enough detail for you to start, or do you need me to draw a picture?
DOCTOR: No, that's a good start, thank you. Sudden hearing loss and facial droop – that’s definitely something we need to investigate. It’s good you came in right away. Just to be very clear, is the hearing loss complete, or is it muffled?
PATIENT: Complete. Absolutely nothing. It’s… unsettling. And the face thing isn’t dramatic, if that makes sense. I don't look like I’ve had a stroke, but it's definitely not symmetrical when I smile. It’s on the left side, by the way, if that matters. Left ear is the deaf one, left side feels… weaker. Honestly, I just want to know what it is and what you’re going to do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, left ear hearing loss and facial weakness on the left side. That's helpful. It’s good you noticed it quickly. It sounds like we need to rule out a few possibilities. We’ll start with a quick exam. I'm going to take a look in your ears and do a brief neurological assessment, just to check your facial nerve function and some other basic reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get on with it, please. I have a very busy schedule, you know. And please, try not to poke around too much. I don't enjoy having things stuck in my ears.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as gentle as possible. I'm just looking to rule out any obvious blockage or infection. The ear canal appears clear. The tympanic membrane looks normal in color and position. Now, I'm going to test your facial nerve function. Could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It's… difficult. It feels tighter on the left side. Are we nearly done? I really don't have time for a lengthy investigation.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I’m noticing some weakness on the left side of your face, as you’ve described. It’s subtle, but present. It seems to affect your forehead, cheek, and around your mouth. Based on what you've told me and this quick exam, the most concerning possibility is Bell’s palsy, which is a temporary weakness of the facial nerve. However, we need to rule out other causes, like a stroke or a tumor, to be certain. To do that, I'd like to order an MRI of your brain. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Do you have any history of allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: MRI? Really? That sounds… excessive. I just have a droopy face and can’t hear on one side! But… no, I don't think so. I've had scans before for old injuries, and never had a reaction. Though, honestly, I don't spend a lot of time memorizing medical details about myself. It's just… a waste of time. Is it going to take long? And will I have to lie flat for hours? Because that is not an option.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It does sound concerning, and while Bell’s palsy is the most likely possibility, given your sudden symptoms, we have a responsibility to rule out more serious causes, such as a stroke or, less commonly, a tumor pressing on the nerve. An MRI is the safest and most accurate way to do that. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes, and you will need to lie flat. However, it's not for hours – usually just that timeframe. The technician will be able to give you headphones to listen to music to make it more comfortable. Since you haven’t had a reaction to contrast dye before, that's good. We'll still ask you a few questions to confirm. In the meantime, while we wait for the MRI results, I can prescribe a short course of oral steroids. These can sometimes help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of a full recovery, especially if it is Bell’s palsy. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Steroids… hmm. I’ve heard things about those. Side effects, weight gain… Look, I’m a radiologist. I know what scans show, I know what treatments do. I appreciate the thought, but frankly, I’d rather hold off on medication until we have the MRI results. I don’t want to be dealing with side effects if it turns out to be something else entirely. Just… get me the MRI. And make sure it’s a fast one. I have patients waiting, you know. And frankly, I’m not thrilled about being stuck in a tube all afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand your perspective, and I respect your informed decision. We’ll proceed with the MRI as quickly as possible. I’ll put in the order now, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll request a fast protocol, as you requested. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: No. Just the MRI, and make sure someone competent is reading the results. I don’t want a junior resident misinterpreting something. That’s all. If you’ll excuse me, I really must get back to my practice. I have a waiting room full of people who are actually sick. Thank you for your time. Though, honestly, I don’t know why I even came. I could have just booked the scan myself.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for any inconvenience. I can assure you a senior radiologist will be reviewing the scan results. The radiology department will contact you directly with the scheduling details and to discuss the findings. I hope you have a good rest of your day, and I wish you a swift recovery. .
