DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hello. Look, to be honest, I barely remember why I booked this appointment. Something about… not sleeping great? And feeling a bit…flabby, I suppose. My wife usually handled all this sort of thing. She knew what was what. I just…showed up, I guess. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. It happens! We can definitely sort things out. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with sleep and perhaps some concerns about your physical condition. "Flabby," as you put it, can mean a lot of things, so we'll get a better understanding of that. Let’s start with the sleep. How long have you been having trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, ages. Honestly, since…well, since she passed. It’s all a bit of a blur. I wouldn't say it's keeping me up, exactly. More like… restless. I toss and turn. Don't feel properly rested when I do finally drift off. It’s not like I’m exhausted all day, just…not sharp, you know? Like my brain’s a bit foggy. Is that…normal? I wouldn't know. I haven't had to worry about this sort of thing before.
DOCTOR: That sounds very difficult, Mr. Redfern. I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s completely normal to experience changes in sleep patterns, and feeling foggy-headed, after a significant life event like that. Grief can affect us in many ways, both physically and emotionally. So, it sounds like this has been going on for some time, since your wife passed. Has anything changed recently that’s made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse, definitely worse. There was a spell, a few months back, when I thought things were calming down. I even managed a full eight hours a couple of times. But then… my nephew started coming round a lot. Nice lad, he is, but… loud. Always fiddling with something, playing music, talking about… I don’t know, computers and things. It’s just…disruptive. Not his fault, mind you. I just need quiet. I used to have a very peaceful home. Very peaceful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a change in your environment has made things more challenging. It’s completely valid to feel disrupted when your routine or peacefulness is disturbed, even if it's by someone well-intentioned. Let’s talk a little more about the sleep itself. When you are able to fall asleep, about how many hours would you say you typically get?
PATIENT: Oh, not much. Four, maybe five, on a good night. But it’s not solid sleep, you know? I wake up a lot. Check the time, have a drink of water, maybe… just think for a bit. It’s not like I'm getting up for hours, just… little breaks. Enough to feel like I haven’t really slept at all when the alarm goes off. And I don’t even need much sleep usually. Always been a light sleeper. My wife used to say I was like a cat.
DOCTOR: Four to five hours of fragmented sleep… that can definitely impact how you feel during the day. And the fact that you typically haven’t needed much sleep makes it harder to pinpoint what's "normal" for you. Okay, let's broaden the picture a little. Besides the sleep and feeling less sharp, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been… less motivated, I suppose. Used to spend hours in the workshop, restoring instruments. Now… I just sit there. Fiddle a bit, then wander off. Not enjoying it like I used to. And I’ve put on a bit of weight, haven’t I? Not that I’m obsessed with my appearance, but… my clothes are getting tighter. And I get winded easily. Climbing the stairs is a bit of an effort now.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased motivation, weight gain, and shortness of breath with exertion. These are all things we should investigate. It sounds like there's quite a bit going on. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My wife always took care of all that. Went to the doctor regularly, yearly check-ups, the whole lot. I only went if something was seriously wrong. She always said I was a stubborn one, didn't like doctors. And honestly, I felt fine. Always healthy as a horse. Never had any major illnesses or anything like that. Just the usual colds and flu, I suppose. Nothing worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think…oh, when I was a boy, I had my tonsils out. That's about it. And… a sports injury when I was younger. Broken collarbone playing football. Nothing major, healed up fine. Definitely haven’t had any surgeries since then. Probably forty years ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken collarbone a long time ago. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father had a bad heart, I think. Died young, quite suddenly. My mother… she lived a long life, but… she had arthritis, I remember that. Always complaining about her joints. And my sister… she’s fine, as far as I know. Lives in Damascus. Haven’t seen her in years. We don't really talk much. Not a particularly healthy family, if I’m honest. Mostly just…old age and aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart problems, mother with arthritis, sister currently healthy but limited contact. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never liked it. My wife hated it too, of course. Always said it was a filthy habit. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing more than that. Rarely even that, these days. It just…doesn’t appeal to me anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional glass of wine. And how about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not great, I’ll admit. Used to love cooking, making proper Syrian food. But… since my wife died, I mostly just…eat whatever’s easiest. Ready meals, sandwiches, things like that. I try to eat fruit, but I don't have much of an appetite these days. And I do enjoy a good kebab when I’m feeling up to it. Not very healthy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Never been much of a one for pills. Didn’t even take painkillers after the collarbone. Just… toughed it out. My wife… she took a few things for her arthritis, I remember that. But me? Nothing. I prefer to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Redfern. That gives me a much clearer picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at a few other things. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I suppose it's all necessary. Just… don't expect me to be particularly helpful if you ask me to lift my arm or anything. My shoulder’s been a bit dodgy lately. Old injury, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll be mindful of your shoulder. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. … 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear some mild crackling in your lungs. Not terribly concerning, but something we'll keep an eye on. Now, let’s just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear. Throat looks a bit dry. Finally, let’s check your weight and height. Just stand still for a moment. Okay, 190 centimeters, 105 kilograms. That puts your BMI at 29.1, which is considered overweight. Alright, Mr. Redfern, that gives me a good starting point. Everything seems relatively stable, but there are a few things we need to address.
PATIENT: Overweight, you say? Well, I’ve always been a big fellow. Never bothered me much. Crackling lungs and a dry throat… probably just the air conditioning. It’s always freezing in here. So, what’s the verdict? Am I dying or something? Just tell me straight. I don’t have time for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Redfern, you are absolutely not dying. But your symptoms and the findings from the exam suggest a few possibilities. Your sleep disturbance, decreased motivation, weight gain, shortness of breath, and elevated blood pressure could be related to a number of things. One possibility is simply deconditioning – a loss of physical fitness due to decreased activity. Grief can certainly contribute to that. Another possibility is that we’re dealing with early signs of a metabolic issue, like pre-diabetes or mild heart failure. The crackling in your lungs could indicate some fluid buildup, and the elevated blood pressure needs to be investigated. I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your blood sugar and kidney function, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, and an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. We should also consider a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… Honestly, I was hoping to avoid all this fuss. But… I suppose if you insist. I haven’t got much else going on. Just tell me where to go and what to do. And try to keep it brief, alright? I don’t like spending too long in hospitals. They always smell of disinfectant and sadness.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Redfern. I’ll do my best to keep it as streamlined as possible. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and explain the process in more detail, and she’ll give you the lab requisition forms. The lab is just down the hall, on the left. You don’t need an appointment. You can go at your convenience. The chest X-ray will require a separate order, and Sarah can help arrange that for you as well. It’s at the imaging center across the street. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate a little bit more physical activity into your daily routine, even if it's just a short walk. And try to focus on eating a healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A walk… alright, I can manage a walk. Used to walk miles back home. And a healthier diet… I’ll try, I suppose. But don’t expect miracles. I’m not a chef, you know. Alright, so… tests, walk, eat better. Seems simple enough. How long will these tests take? I’ve got a workshop to get back to, you know. Instruments don’t repair themselves.
DOCTOR: The blood work should take about 30 minutes, and the EKG will be another 10-15 minutes. The chest X-ray is usually pretty quick – maybe 15-20 minutes including the paperwork. So, all in all, you're looking at around an hour to an hour and a half. Sarah will be in shortly to get you started. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… try not to give me too much bad news, alright? I’ve had enough of that lately. I’m a simple man, really. Just want to get back to my workshop and my instruments. That’s all. Tell Sarah to be quick, will you?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Redfern. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I'll do my best to explain everything clearly. I will tell Sarah to be quick. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Redfern. I’ll see you soon.
