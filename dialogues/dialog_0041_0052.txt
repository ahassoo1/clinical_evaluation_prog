DOCTOR: Hi Aurthur, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good to meet ye too, Doctor Polczynski. Well, it's this morning sickness, really. Bit of a strange thing for a man my age, eh? But it's been happenin' for a few weeks now, and the nurse suggested I come see someone. It's… well, it's mostly just feelin' queasy when I wake up. And I have a bit of trouble with my heart, so I thought best to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Morning sickness… right. That is unusual, you’re right to get it checked out, especially with your heart condition. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Aye, somethin' like that. Maybe six, seven weeks? It comes and goes, not every mornin', mind ye. Some days it's just a wee bit of discomfort, others I can barely keep anything down. Mostly just toast and tea if I can manage it. It’s… it’s not as bad as it sounds, but it's worryin' me all the same, knowin' my heart isn't the strongest.
DOCTOR: Okay, six or seven weeks of intermittent nausea… and it's worse in the mornings, but not every morning. And you've been sticking to toast and tea when you can keep things down. Alright. Now, when you say trouble with your heart… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Aye, sure can. It’s… it’s heart failure, they told me. Years ago now, maybe ten years. I’ve got a bit of shortness of breath, especially if I'm walkin' uphill. And my ankles swell up somethin' awful if I'm on my feet too long. I’m on some medication for it, but it hasn’t been… perfect, if ye ken what I mean. It keeps it stable-ish, but I still get flare-ups from time to time. And this nausea… I just wondered if it was linked to that, maybe a side effect of the pills, or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart failure for ten years, with shortness of breath and ankle swelling… and you’re wondering if the nausea could be related to your heart medication. That’s definitely a reasonable thought. Do you remember the name of the medication you’re taking?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. It's… Lisinopril, I think it is. Small white pills. And… and there's another one, a water pill, Furosemide, I believe. I’ve been takin’ ‘em both for years now. Doctor McTavish, he prescribed ‘em, but he retired last year, and I haven’t really seen a proper doctor since, just the nurses for check-ups. They’re good folk, mind ye, but they're not doctors. And this nausea… it just seems different than anything I've felt before.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Furosemide… yes, I see that here. Both can, in rare cases, cause nausea as a side effect, though it's not common. And it’s good you brought up the change in doctors – it’s always best to have someone keeping a close eye on things, especially with your heart condition. Now, besides the nausea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Aye, that's what I was thinkin'. Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, just generally feelin' run down. And my appetite’s been… off, even besides the nausea. Not that I’ve got much of an appetite to begin with these days. And… oh, and my weight’s been droppin' a wee bit. Not much, mind ye, but enough to notice. I haven’t been weighin' myself regularly, but my trousers feel a bit looser than they used to. It's not a worryin' amount, but it’s… somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, decreased appetite, and some weight loss… that's helpful. How much weight would you estimate you’ve lost over the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Och, it's hard to say for sure, Doctor. I’m not one for weighin' scales. But… maybe five or six pounds, I reckon. It's not a drastic amount, like I said, but it's enough to make me think twice. I used to be a hearty eater, but now… I just don't have the same appetite. And I'm not as active as I used to be, mind ye. I used to enjoy a good walk in the hills, but these days I'm mostly pottering about the house. It’s a bit of a vicious circle, really. I feel tired, so I don't eat much, which makes me even more tired. And the nausea doesn't help, o' course.
DOCTOR: Alright, five or six pounds of unintentional weight loss… I understand. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Aye, that's fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've nothin' to hide. I'm used to bein' poked and prodded, o' course, with the heart condition and all. Just let me know if ye need me to do anything, like breathe deep or such. I'll try and stay as still as I can. Just… be gentle, eh? Old bones, ye ken.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Now, if you could just lie back for me… Okay… your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, and I'm hearing a murmur. Your lungs sound a bit congested, with some crackling. And your abdomen is a bit tender. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 88. Now, all of these things could be related to your heart condition, but given the nausea, fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal tenderness, I think we should run some blood tests just to be on the safe side. I want to check your kidney function, liver function, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Check all ye need to check. I'd rather be safe than sorry, o' course. I’ve not got a lot of experience with blood tests, mind ye, but I’ll do what ye ask. I’m not too keen on needles, but I’ll try and be brave. What sort of blood tests are we talkin' about, if ye don't mind me askin'? Just so I know what to expect. And... will it take long to get the results? I've a bit of a schedule, see. Not important, mind ye, just... I like to know these things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll be doing a complete blood count – that checks your red and white blood cells. A metabolic panel, which looks at your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And we’ll also check your thyroid levels, just to rule that out. It's a fairly standard set of tests, and it shouldn’t take too long. The lab usually gets the results back within 24 to 48 hours. I'll give the nurse a call as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds grand, Doctor. Within 24 to 48 hours… I can manage that. And ye’ll give the nurse a call… that's good to know. I’m not too fond of makin' phone calls these days, so havin’ the nurse do it is much appreciated. So, just to be clear, we’re checkin’ my kidneys, liver, blood sugar, and thyroid… and somethin’ about my blood cells. Right enough. I suppose it’s best to get it all checked, even if it turns out to be nothin’. Alright then. Let's get on with it. Where do I go for these blood tests? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for them? Like, should I fast beforehand, or…<>
