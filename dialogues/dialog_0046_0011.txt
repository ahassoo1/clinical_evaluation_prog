DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. I need somethin’ signed… a paper, for… well, for a little fixin’ up. Cosmetic, they called it. Don't rightly remember all the details, truthfully. Just need the okay from a doctor. Is that what you do here? Sign papers?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. Yes, I can certainly review paperwork and provide medical opinions when appropriate. However, to do that responsibly, and to ensure it’s medically safe for you, I need to understand what the paperwork is for. Could you tell me a bit more about this “fixin’ up” – what kind of procedure are they referring to, and why are you seeking it?
PATIENT: Look, it ain't important. Some fellas down at the… the shop, they mentioned it. Said it’d be easier with a doctor’s note. Somethin’ about… lines. On my face. I ain't obsessed with lookin’ young, but… well, they said it’d help with business. Ain't got time for explanations, truly. Just need a signature, if it ain’t gonna cause any trouble. Don't recall the name of the place, either. Lots of places offerin' things these days.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re referring to cosmetic procedures – potentially dermal fillers or Botox injections to reduce the appearance of lines on your face. While I understand you’d like a quick signature, I have a medical and ethical responsibility to ensure any procedure you undergo is safe and appropriate for your health. Before I can consider signing anything, I need to ask a few questions to understand your medical history and whether this is a suitable option for you. It’s not about causing trouble, it's about protecting your well-being. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Protectin' my well-bein'? Doctor, with all due respect, I've been climbin' towers and fixin' radios since before you were born. I think I can handle a little… face touch-up. But… alright, alright. Ask your questions. Just make it quick, please. I got appointments. And… truthfully, I don't remember much about doctors askin’ me things. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. I appreciate your willingness to answer a few questions. We’ll keep it as concise as possible. To start, do you have any known allergies to medications, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. Never really paid it much mind, truthfully. Dust, maybe? Gets my eyes a little itchy sometimes when I'm workin' on the old equipment. But nothin' serious enough to keep me from workin'. Never been one for fancy pills or nothin’. Mostly just… water and a bit of coffee to keep me goin’. Does dust count?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, and a possible mild sensitivity to dust. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else that a doctor has diagnosed?
PATIENT: Doctor… honestly, I don't rightly recall. Been workin’ so long, I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, decades, probably. Used to be a bit of a cough, back in the winter. But it always cleared up. Ain’t been nothin’ serious, truly. I'm a strong fella, always have been. Keeps me movin’. But… old age is catchin' up, I suppose. A little ache here and there. But nothin’ a bit of work can't fix. Do aches count? I mostly ignore ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no known chronic medical conditions, occasional cough in the winter, and some general aches and pains. That’s good information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Lord, no. I ain't one for all those fancy pills. Coffee, like I said. And sometimes… sometimes a little somethin’ for the pain, when it gets really bad. But it’s… I don't recall the name. Got it from a fella down at the shop. Said it'd help. Just a little somethin', truly. And not regular-like. Only when I need it. Mostly just try to push through. Don't like bein' weak.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you occasionally use an over-the-counter pain reliever obtained from a friend, but aren’t on any regular medication. It’s important we identify what that pain reliever is, Mr. Honcoop, as it can interact with other treatments or have potential side effects. Do you happen to remember what it looked like - the packaging, the shape of the pill, anything at all?
PATIENT: Lord, Doctor, you’re askin' too much. It was a little white pill, I think. Roundish. Came in a plastic bottle, but… the label was mostly gone. Old man gave it to me, said it'd help with the aches. I ain't one for rememberin' labels or bottles. Mostly just cared that it took the pain away. It weren't nothin’ fancy, truly. Just a little somethin’ to get me through the day. I think… maybe it had an 'M' on it? Or somethin' like that. Honestly, my memory ain’t what it used to be. You're makin' me think too hard. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. A small, round, white pill, possibly with an 'M' on it, obtained from a friend. That’s…not a lot to go on, Mr. Honcoop. It’s difficult to assess the safety of a medication without knowing exactly what it is. Now, I understand you are seeking this procedure for cosmetic reasons, and you are concerned about your business. However, given your limited recall of your medical history and the medication you occasionally use, I’m concerned about your overall health and potential risks. Before I can consider signing anything, I strongly recommend a basic blood workup to assess your kidney and liver function, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Blood work? Doctor, you’re makin’ this awfully complicated. I just want a little fixin’ up. This is gonna cost me a fortune, now, ain’t it? And… well, I ain't got insurance. Never really needed it. Always been a strong fella, like I said. But... alright. Alright, fine. If you absolutely need it… I suppose I can get some blood work done. But I ain't promisin' I can pay for it, truly. This is gettin' expensive, and I got bills to pay. Just… get it over with, quickly, if you can. I got appointments to keep. But I'm tellin’ ya, I don't like this one bit. It's all a bit much. And I still don't see why I need it. It's just a little face touch-up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Honcoop, and I apologize for the added complexity. I assure you, I am simply prioritizing your safety. We can discuss payment options and potential assistance programs after the blood work is completed. Okay, let's proceed with the blood draw. I’ll write you a lab requisition, and you can take it to the lab across the street. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if this procedure is safe for you. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. .
