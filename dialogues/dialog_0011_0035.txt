DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. My name is Dr. Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re…persistent. Quite a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be disruptive. Could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a constant thing, not like hiccup, hiccup, hiccup all the time. More like…a few every hour, maybe? And sometimes they come in little bursts, three or four close together, then nothing for a while. It doesn’t really seem to matter what I’m doing – eating, sitting, even just thinking! I tried drinking water quickly, like you always see in the movies, but that didn’t do a thing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Ms. Sucich. It’s helpful to know they aren’t constant and that the usual remedies haven’t been effective. When did you first notice them start?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was having my usual breakfast – a little papaya and some toast – and just… hic. Started right in the middle of a bite. Didn't think much of it at first, you know? Just figured it would pass. But it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Tuesday morning, alright. And you said it began during breakfast?
PATIENT: Yes, right in the middle of breakfast. Funny thing is, I hadn’t changed anything about my breakfast routine. Same papaya, same toast… everything normal. I even used the same brand of tea! It’s just…started. Maybe it was something I thought about while I was eating? I was remembering a story my grandmother used to tell, a bit of a scary one, actually.
DOCTOR: Interesting. And have you noticed anything else coinciding with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it… my stomach has been a little unsettled. Not painful, exactly, but just… queasy. It started about the same time as the hiccups, I think. And I haven’t been as hungry as usual, which is very strange for me. I usually enjoy my meals so much!
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. A bit of nausea and decreased appetite alongside the hiccups is certainly relevant. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… no fever, no cough, no aches or pains. I haven't felt dizzy or anything like that. My usual aches and pains, you know, the old lady stuff, but those are always there. No trouble breathing. Just the hiccups and this little bit of upset stomach. Oh! And I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to my age, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, cough, dizziness, or shortness of breath. Usual aches and pains are present, and a little more fatigue. Thank you, Ms. Sucich. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I take a small dose of losartan for my blood pressure, and sometimes ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it’s really acting up. That’s about it, really. Nothing fancy. And I don’t take any vitamins or supplements, just the occasional cup of chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: Losartan for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Good to know. And no vitamins or supplements. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Never had one in my life, thankfully. I used to worry about it as a child, but I've been just fine. I can eat anything, take most medicines… no problems there. I always tell people I’m a very simple woman with simple needs!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Sucich. And have you had any recent changes to your diet, any travel, or any significant life events that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no significant life events! Just my usual quiet life. No travel, nothing exciting. Diet…well, I did try a new brand of papaya last week, just a different grower at the market. But I switched back after a couple of days when it didn't taste quite right. I suppose that could be something? It was a bit…bland. But I doubt it would cause hiccups.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sucich. Alright, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. Just let me know if anything feels…uncomfortable. I'm an old woman, but I still have some feeling!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I appreciate that. And rest assured, I will be gentle. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here we go… a bit creaky, but I'm on!
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart sounds regular and within normal limits. Your lungs are clear bilaterally – no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t hear any concerning bruits or bowel sounds. Is there any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness there, Doctor. Just a little…squishy, I suppose, if you poke around! That’s probably just old age, though. Everything’s a bit softer these days. You're very gentle, I must say.
DOCTOR: That’s normal, Ms. Sucich. And you are right, some softness is common. Now, let’s check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is also common with age, and your strength is good in all extremities. Do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No difficulty swallowing at all, Doctor. I enjoy my food too much to have trouble swallowing! I can polish off a plate of papaya like nobody's business. Everything goes down just fine, thank you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Based on the physical exam, everything appears normal, Ms. Sucich. Given the persistent hiccups, nausea, and decreased appetite, along with the fact that simple remedies haven’t helped, I’d like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. This will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it will help figure out what's causing these pesky hiccups, then absolutely. Blood tests are no problem at all. I’ve had plenty in my time. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll need a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The nurse will draw the blood right here in the clinic. It should only take a few minutes. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to eat small, bland meals to help with the nausea. And if the hiccups become significantly worse or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Small, bland meals… I can manage that. And I will definitely let you know if anything changes. Small, bland meals and no panicking. You've put my mind at ease, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old woman and her hiccups.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It is my pleasure. And please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. We'll review the results as soon as they come in and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to rest and take it easy. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I’m just relieved someone is taking this seriously. I was starting to think I was going mad! Thank you again for your kindness.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It is completely understandable to be concerned with persistent hiccups, and we will work together to get to the bottom of this. I'll leave you to rest for a moment while we wait for the nurse. Please let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
