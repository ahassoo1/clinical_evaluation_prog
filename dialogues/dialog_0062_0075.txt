DOCTOR: Hi Moshe, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here because… honestly, I’m still tired. Really tired, even with the machine. They said I had sleep apnea, and the machine helps, but I’m just… dragging all day. It’s a bit frustrating, you know? I thought this would fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Moshe. It is frustrating when something doesn’t quite solve the problem as expected. It's good you're using the machine – that's a really important first step. Let's try to figure out what's going on. When you say "tired," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s not like I can’t stay awake, if I need to. But everything feels like… wading through water. You know? Like a lot of effort for not much done. And I find myself dozing off during the day, even when I’m trying hard to focus. Like, reading, or watching television… sometimes even just sitting and talking. It’s not a sudden falling asleep, usually. More like… fading out. It worries me a little, to be honest. I’m a retired professor, you see. I like to keep my mind active.
DOCTOR: Okay, “wading through water” is a really helpful way to describe that, Moshe. And it’s good you're aware of the daytime drowsiness. Fading out while trying to focus is definitely something we need to look into. Just to get a clearer picture, how long has this been going on, even with using the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I started using the machine, I believe it was… March? Yes, March of this year. So, about five months now. And honestly, it was maybe a little better for the first month or so. But it’s gradually gotten worse again. It’s not a huge difference, but noticeable. It’s just… persistent. I still feel this dragging, this tiredness, almost every day. And that fading out… it's been happening for the last month or so, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, five months of machine use with initial improvement followed by a return of symptoms… that's helpful. And the daytime drowsiness increasing over the last month. Do you know what your AHI was before you started the machine, and what it is now, if you’ve had it checked recently?
PATIENT: AHI…? Oh dear. That’s one of those numbers they told me, isn't it? I’m terrible with numbers, always have been. I remember they said it was… bad. That’s about all I remember. They said the machine would bring it down. I don’t know what the number is now. I haven’t had it checked recently, no. I just assumed the machine was doing its job, you see. Is it important? Should I have been checking it myself? I feel a bit foolish now, not knowing this.
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely okay, Moshe, don’t feel foolish at all! There’s a lot of information to take in, and it’s our job to help you understand it. Knowing the AHI is important because it tells us how well the machine is controlling your sleep apnea. Let me pull up your records… Okay, here we are. Your initial AHI was 32. That is quite high. And… hmm. It looks like your last AHI check was three months ago, and it was 18. That's an improvement, but still not in the ideal range. Do you happen to know what pressure setting your machine is set to?
PATIENT: Pressure setting…? Oh, goodness. More numbers. I really am hopeless with these things. They adjusted it once, I think, a couple of months ago. Something about it not being quite right. I just let them do it, to be honest. I don’t recall what the number was before or after. It’s a little box, you see, and they fiddled with the dial. I just hope it's doing something! Is this normal? That they change it and I don't know what it is? I feel like I should be more involved in this whole process.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel like you should be more involved, Moshe. It's perfectly reasonable to want to understand what's going on with your treatment. And it is normal for them to adjust the pressure, sometimes multiple times, to find the right setting for you. Okay, your current pressure setting is 12 centimeters of water pressure. Let's shift gears for a moment. Besides the tiredness and the fading out, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, my mouth is often dry in the morning. Very dry. And I’ve been getting… not exactly headaches, but a sort of dull ache at the base of my skull sometimes. Not every day, but maybe two or three times a week. And… this is a bit embarrassing, but my wife complains I snore sometimes, even with the machine on. She sleeps in the other room most nights, thankfully. I thought the machine was supposed to stop that! She says it’s not as loud, but it’s still there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Moshe. The dry mouth, the dull headache, and the continued snoring are all things we need to consider. The dry mouth and headache can be side effects of the CPAP machine itself, and the continued snoring suggests it might not be fully controlling your apnea. Let's listen to your lungs, just to make sure everything sounds clear. Deep breaths in and out for me, please. Okay, lungs sound clear. Now, could you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here you go. Is something wrong? I do have a bit of a receding gum line, if that’s what you’re looking for. The dentist keeps telling me to floss more, you know. A lifetime of bad habits, I suppose. I do try, but it’s hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. Your gums do appear a bit inflamed, and there is some recession. It's good you're trying to floss, even if it's difficult. We'll note that for your general health record. Now, I’m just going to gently feel around your neck. Let me know if anything feels tender. Okay, a little bit of tenderness along your jawline, but nothing too concerning. Alright, Moshe. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, here’s what I’m thinking. The AHI is improved, but still not optimal. The continued snoring and daytime sleepiness, along with the dry mouth and headache, suggest we need to investigate further. We want to make sure the machine is the right fit, and that there isn’t another contributing factor to your fatigue. Would you be willing to consider a sleep study to re-evaluate your apnea and rule out any other sleep disorders?
PATIENT: A sleep study? Oh dear. Another night in a lab? I had one before, to diagnose the apnea in the first place. It wasn’t the most comfortable experience, I must say. Wires and sensors everywhere… but if it will help, I suppose I can do it. I really just want to feel normal again, you know? To be able to read a book without fading off halfway through a page. If that’s what it takes, then yes. Yes, I’m willing to consider another sleep study. But… will it be as uncomfortable as the first one? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Moshe. It’s understandable to be hesitant about another sleep study, especially if the first one wasn’t comfortable. Fortunately, sleep studies have improved quite a bit since then. They often use smaller sensors now, and the technicians are very good at making you as comfortable as possible. I'm going to go ahead and schedule you for a follow-up sleep study at the Sleep Center here at the hospital. It will be a full overnight study, just like the first one. They will monitor your breathing, brain waves, and other vital signs to get a more accurate picture of what’s going on while you sleep. The results usually take about a week to come back. And while we wait, I’m going to prescribe a humidifier to use with your CPAP machine. That should help with the dry mouth. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. A humidifier is a good idea, thank you. And a week for the results is… manageable, I suppose. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. I feel a little bit better knowing we're trying to figure this out. It’s just… frustrating, you know? To be tired all the time, even with the machine. I hope this sleep study gives us some answers. Well, thank you again, Doctor. I think that’s everything for now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, Moshe, and you're right to want answers. I understand completely. And you're very welcome – that’s what I’m here for. Yes, I think that’s everything for today. The nurse will come in shortly to give you the prescription for the humidifier and schedule the sleep study. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I'm optimistic that we'll get to the bottom of this and help you feel like yourself again. It was a pleasure meeting you, Moshe.
