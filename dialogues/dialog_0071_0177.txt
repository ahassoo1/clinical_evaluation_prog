DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. Or… good afternoon, actually. Time does fly, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: Eh, good afternoon to you too, doc. Time… yeah, it does. I just… I got somethin' botherin' me. Been botherin' me a little while now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what exactly is botherin' you, Mrs. Genard?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… down there. My… you know. It’s kinda… leaky. Not all the time, but enough to be a bother. And it smells funny, too. Not good funny. I ain’t been sleepin' good thinkin' 'bout it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some urinary leakage, and some odor, that’s keeping you up at night. That’s definitely something we should look into. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this leakage happens?
PATIENT: Leakage? Is that what you call it? Fancy words. It just happens when I… when I gotta go, sometimes. Or even when I don’t! It’s awful. And it’s not like a whole lot, but enough to make a mess, you know? Especially if I'm wearin' my good shorts. I don’t go out much anymore 'cause of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it happens both when you feel the urge to go, and sometimes unexpectedly. And it's causing you to limit some of your activities… that's good to know. Has this been happening for a long time, Mrs. Genard, or is it something that's developed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a long time. Years, I think. But it’s been worse lately. I just… kinda got used to it, y’know? Figured it was just old age creepin' in. But then it started smellin'… worse. And I thought, maybe I should get it checked. I don't even know why it smells. It's… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It's very good you came in, Mrs. Genard. It is important to get this checked out, and you're absolutely right to be concerned about the odor. Sometimes it can be a sign of an infection, which we need to rule out. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. It's not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s not quite right. And sometimes it feels… itchy. Not all the time, but enough to be annoying. I just put some powder on it usually. It's… private, you know? I don't like talkin’ about this.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mrs. Genard. It is a private matter, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. The itchiness is good information. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What's that got to do with… this? I go to the bathroom when I gotta go, same as always. Sometimes a little constipated, but that's just 'cause I don't eat enough fruit. I don't see how that'd affect… down there. You askin' me somethin' silly, doc?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mrs. Genard. Sometimes changes in bowel habits can be connected, but you're right, it may not be relevant here. It's just part of getting a complete picture. Now, before we move on, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yeah. Doc told me a long time ago, but I don't take nothin' for it. Makes me sleepy. And… I had a bad infection in my leg once, years ago. Had to stay in the hospital. But that's it, I think. I don't go to the doc much. I like to keep to myself. They gave me a lot of pills, but I don’t remember what for.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, and a previous leg infection. We can talk about managing that blood pressure later. And it’s good to know about the infection. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just that powder, for… you know. It helps with the itch sometimes. And I take a little bit of Tylenol when my joints ache, but that's it. Nothin' regular. I don't like all those pills. They just make me feel worse. My mama always said, let nature take its course. That's what I try to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, just Tylenol as needed and the powder. And that’s perfectly reasonable, Mrs. Genard. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family had problems with bladder issues or urinary infections?
PATIENT: Bladder issues… hmm. My sister, Luisa, she always complained about havin' to go to the bathroom all the time when she got older. But that was just old age, I figured. She didn't go to the doc 'bout it. And my grandma… she had some kinda trouble, but I don’t remember what. Things were different back then, you know? Nobody talked about these things. Family history... it's all a blur.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mrs. Genard. It's often difficult to recall those details. Okay, one last thing before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a little itchy when I touch poison ivy, but that's all. And I can't eat shrimp. Makes my tongue swell up. But that was a long time ago. I haven't had shrimp in years. Not much bothers me these days. I’m a tough old lady.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies, just a sensitivity to shrimp and poison ivy. That's good to know. Now, Mrs. Genard, I would like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief external examination of the area to check for any abnormalities. It’s a pretty straightforward exam, and it will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam…? You want me to… take my clothes off? I ain't doin' that. I don’t like people touchin' me. Especially not… down there. I don't see how lookin' at it’s gonna help anyway. I think I’m good. I just… I want to know if it’s somethin' serious, that's all. I don’t need no exam.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mrs. Genard, and I completely respect your comfort level. I certainly wouldn’t ask you to do anything you're not comfortable with. A full internal exam isn't necessary right away. However, even a quick listen to your abdomen and a brief external exam can sometimes provide valuable information. We can absolutely skip the exam if you prefer, but it might make it harder to get a definitive answer. To be sure, we can order a urine test. That can help us rule out an infection and give us a better starting point. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… urine test? Just pee in a cup? That I can do. That don’t sound too bad. As long as you ain’t touchin' nothin'. Just look at the pee. Yeah, I’m okay with that. Get that done. And tell me if it’s somethin' serious, doc. I ain’t got time for long stories, just the truth.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Genard. Just a urine sample, no problem at all. We’ll send that off to the lab, and I’ll call you as soon as the results are back. It usually takes a few days. In the meantime, I’ll write you a referral to a specialist - a urologist - just in case we need more in-depth testing or treatment. They specialize in these types of issues and can provide the best care. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: A… specialist? More doctors? Oh, goodness. Seems like all you people do is send me to other people. No, that's all. Just get the test done and tell me what it says. And please, no more doctors. I just wanna be left alone.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mrs. Genard. I assure you, this is just a precaution. Seeing a specialist doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It just means we’re being thorough. I'll get the order for the urine test sent to the lab right away, and a nurse will be in shortly to explain the process. They will also give you instructions on how to schedule an appointment with the urologist, if we feel it's necessary. Thank you for coming in today, Mrs. Genard. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results.
