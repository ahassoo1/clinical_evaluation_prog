DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Verrall, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Smith Verrall. Good to meet you, Doctor... Ruocco, was it? I think I read that on the door. It's a nice clinic, very… quiet. I’m here about… well, my daughter is thinking about having a baby. And she thought I should come talk to someone first. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ruocco. Look, I’m a bit swamped today, so let’s get straight to it. Your daughter wants you to come here about… her potential pregnancy?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. She’s… she’s a good girl. First baby, you see. And she’s… well, I’m older, and she thinks maybe there’s things I should know, or… things she should know. I don’t… I don’t really know where to start, to be honest. Is this about… family problems? I don’t have much family left.
DOCTOR: Family problems?
PATIENT: Not exactly problems… just… not many people left. My wife… she passed a long time ago. And my brother… we don’t speak anymore. It’s a long story. But my daughter, she worries about… things being passed down, I think. Like… illnesses, or… things like that. She said it was important to check before… before everything happens. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Right. So, potential genetic predispositions. Look, I need to know a bit more. Let's start with your medical history. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… hmm. Let me think. I had the flu a few times, of course. And… I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Oh! And I had my appendix out, many years ago. That was… uncomfortable. But nothing… chronic. I don’t feel like I’ve had anything chronic. Does that help? My daughter is the healthy one. Always been strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix is good to know. But "not feeling" sick isn’t a medical history. Any heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems… no. Not that I know of. I get a little… breathless sometimes when I walk uphill, but I think that’s just my age. And… I used to smoke, a long time ago. I stopped… oh, maybe twenty years ago? I don’t remember exactly. My wife didn’t like it, so I gave it up. Does smoking cause heart problems? My daughter never smokes, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Yes, smoking does cause heart problems. And lungs, and… Never mind. Alright. Any other habits?
PATIENT: Habits? Well, I like my tea. Strong tea, with a little sugar. And I used to drink… a little bit of whisky sometimes, in the evenings. But not much, not anymore. I mostly just… read now. History books. And I like to walk, when the weather is good. But I wouldn't call any of that a bad habit, would you? Is tea bad for you? She makes me a lovely cup in the mornings.
DOCTOR: No, tea is not the issue here, Mr. Verrall. Look, I’m going to need to access your records. Do you have any idea what your past medical tests were?
PATIENT: Records? Tests? I… I don't really keep track of those things. My wife used to handle all that. And… after she passed, it all got… mixed up. I think I had some blood tests at some point, but I don't know where they are now. Maybe with my old doctor? I saw a doctor when I moved here, about ten years ago, but I can’t remember his name. This is probably not very helpful, is it? I’m sorry. My mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, without any records, there’s not much I can do for you today. It's best if your daughter comes in herself. She can provide a thorough family history. And, frankly, I think she's the one who actually needs the consultation. I suggest she makes an appointment. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have other patients.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Well… that's… disappointing. She just thought it would be good if I came, to be… supportive. And to make sure everything was alright. But if you need her to come… that’s fine. I'll tell her. Thank you, Doctor. Even though… well, even though it didn't work out. .
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Goodbye.
