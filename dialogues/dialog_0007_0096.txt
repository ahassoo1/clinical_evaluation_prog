DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hey Doc, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s kind of hard to explain, but I’ve been getting really bothered by the light lately. Like, really bothered. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s making things tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, “really bothered by the light”… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It’s not just bright sunlight, though that's the worst. Even, like, regular room lights, or even the screen on my phone... they just feel… painful, almost. Like they're burning my eyes. And it makes me squint a lot. I’ve started wearing sunglasses inside sometimes, which feels a bit silly, but it helps. It’s just… uncomfortable. I don’t know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Arbin. That sounds really frustrating. And wearing sunglasses inside isn’t silly if it's providing some relief. So, a few weeks now... has this come on suddenly, or gradually?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I think it was pretty gradual, actually. Started with just noticing the sunlight felt a bit harsher than usual. Then, a week or so later, it started bothering me indoors too. So, not like one day it just happened, you know? It kind of crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset. And is it just the brightness that bothers you, or is there any other symptom with it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmmm… let me think. Well, sometimes my eyes feel a little gritty, like there’s something in them, even when I know there isn't. And… and I think they’ve been a bit red sometimes? Not always, but yeah, I've noticed that in the mirror a few times. Oh! And blurry vision, a little bit, especially after staring at something for a long time. But that could just be needing new glasses, to be honest. I haven't had my eyes checked in… oh gosh, it must be almost two years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, gritty feeling, redness, and some blurry vision, especially with prolonged use. Two years since your last eye exam is definitely something to consider. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, Arbin?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean… I lost my wife a few years back, so… that’s been hard. But physically, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well, I walk when I can… nothing major, no diabetes or high blood pressure or anything like that. I have Medicare, if that helps? I always forget what they need to know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Arbin. I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. That's a huge thing to go through. And thank you for mentioning Medicare, it’s helpful to know. Just to be thorough, any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Nope, nothing. I used to think I was allergic to cats when I was a kid, but it turned out I was just sensitive to the dust in my aunt’s house. So… no, I can pretty much eat and take anything, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, Arbin?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I don't take anything regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers now and then for a headache, but that’s it. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can. I’d rather just rest, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'm going to check your vision, and take a look at your eyes with a light. It's a pretty standard exam, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. No problem at all. I trust you. I’m a little nervous, but I figured I needed to get this checked out. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, reading the top line... and the next... how about this line?
PATIENT: Okay… um… let me see… E… F… P… H… T… okay, I can read those. The next line… that’s a little blurry… uh… C… L… V… N… Oh, that one’s hard. I think it’s… P? No, maybe… B? I’m not sure. It’s getting tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. We'll note that vision is slightly reduced. Now let's check each eye individually. Okay, covering your left eye… read this line for me. And then we'll do the same with your right eye covered.
PATIENT: Alright… covering my left eye… let me see… E… F… P… H… T… C… L… V… N… Okay, I can read down to the ‘N’ line pretty easily with this eye. Now covering my right eye… um… it’s… a lot blurrier with this one. I can only get to the first line, maybe the second if I really squint. It’s significantly worse with this eye. I think something’s off with my right eye.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin, that’s very important information. Significant difference in vision between your two eyes. Alright, let me take a look… Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, which is good. There is some mild redness in both eyes, but nothing alarming. However, when I look at the back of your right eye, I notice some clouding of the lens… and a bit of what looks like early cataract formation. It’s still early stages, but it explains the blurry vision and the difference you're noticing. It also explains why your right eye vision is reduced.
PATIENT: A… a cataract? Oh dear. I’ve heard of those, but… I didn’t think I could get one. Is that… is that serious? Will I go blind? What does that mean for my photosensitivity? Is it connected?
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin, let's take this one step at a time. Cataracts are very common, especially as we get older, though they can happen earlier too. It’s a clouding of the natural lens inside your eye, and it can cause blurry vision, glare, and difficulty seeing at night. It’s not an emergency, and it doesn’t mean you’re going to go blind immediately. However, left untreated, it can lead to significant vision loss over time. As for the connection to your photosensitivity… it’s possible. Cataracts can scatter light, making you more sensitive to bright light and glare. That, combined with the early stages of cataract formation, could explain why you've been experiencing the discomfort. I want to get a more detailed assessment of your vision and the cataract. I’m going to recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist – an eye specialist. They can perform more specific tests and determine the best course of treatment. It might be as simple as a new glasses prescription, or it could eventually require surgery to remove the cataract and replace the lens. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… a lot to take in. But thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doc. A specialist… yeah, that sounds good. Definitely. I’d rather know for sure what’s going on, and get it taken care of if I need to. What about the photosensitivity in the meantime? Is there anything I can do to make it easier while I’m waiting for the appointment? Should I just keep wearing sunglasses inside?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you feel that way. While we wait for the appointment, there are a few things you can do to manage the photosensitivity. Definitely continue wearing sunglasses indoors, especially in bright light. Consider a wider-brimmed hat when you're outside. You can also try using artificial tears to keep your eyes lubricated, as dryness can worsen the discomfort. And avoid straining your eyes – take frequent breaks if you’re looking at a screen or reading for a long time. I'll write a referral to a highly-rated ophthalmologist in the area, and I'll also include a note detailing my findings. They’ll likely want to do a comprehensive eye exam, including measuring your vision, checking your eye pressure, and examining the back of your eyes more closely. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, Arbin?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds really helpful. Artificial tears, breaks, sunglasses… I can do all of that. Thank you, Doc. Um… one question, actually. About the surgery… if I did need it, would it… would it hurt? And how long would I be out of commission? I don't have a lot of people I can rely on to help me out, so… I'm a little worried about recovery.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Arbin. It's good you're asking about that now. Cataract surgery is actually a very common and generally safe procedure. The surgery itself is typically done under local anesthesia – meaning you'll be awake, but your eye will be numbed, so you won't feel any pain. You might feel some pressure during the procedure, but it shouldn’t be painful. The recovery time is relatively quick. Most people can go home the same day, and their vision starts to improve within a few days. You'll need to use eye drops for a few weeks to prevent infection and inflammation, and you'll need to avoid strenuous activity for a week or so. While you shouldn't need someone to be with you constantly, it's helpful to have someone drive you home and help with things around the house for the first day or two. And you'll need to follow the ophthalmologist's instructions carefully to ensure a smooth recovery. I’ll make a note of your concerns in the referral, and the ophthalmologist can discuss the risks and benefits of surgery with you in more detail. Does that ease your mind a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help a lot, thank you. Knowing it’s not a huge ordeal… and that it's usually quick… that’s good. Okay, I think that’s everything for now. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, Doc. And thank you for being so patient. I was a little nervous coming in. I guess I’ll just wait for the specialist to call, then? And I’ll try to remember everything you said about the sunglasses and the drops.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could help. And you're right to be prepared, and it's perfectly okay to be nervous. Yes, just wait for the specialist to call and schedule an appointment. They’ll likely send you some information in the mail or via email beforehand. I’ll also send the referral electronically to ensure they receive it quickly. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, if you experience any sudden changes in vision or severe eye pain, seek medical attention immediately. Take care, Arbin, and I hope everything goes well with the specialist.
