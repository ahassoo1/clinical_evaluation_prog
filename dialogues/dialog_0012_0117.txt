DOCTOR: Hi Devin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah. It's... a cough. Been coughin’ a bit. And… there’s some… stuff. Red stuff. When I cough. I smoke, you know. Always have. Don’t remember much else about it, really. Just… the cough and the red.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some red… “stuff” when you cough. Thanks for letting me know about the smoking, that’s important information. When did the cough start, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Gosh… a while. Maybe… spring? Or was it summer? It comes and goes, see. Not all the time. Hard to say, really. Don’t keep track of things like that. It just… started. It ain't been long long, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, so sometime in the spring or summer, and it's been present intermittently since then. It’s good you mentioned it comes and goes. Can you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Uh… it's a… chest cough. Deep down. Not like a tickle in my throat. More… rattly. Yeah, rattly. And… wheezy sometimes. Especially when I try to… do things. Walkin’ up hills, that kinda stuff. I get outta breath easy now, too. Always been pretty active, but… not so much lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep, rattly, sometimes wheezy chest cough that's worse with activity and makes you short of breath. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, regarding the red “stuff” you mentioned—is it bright red, or darker, like old blood?
PATIENT: Bright… I think so. Yeah, bright red. Not… brown or anything. Fresh, I guess. Comes up with the mucus, see? Not a whole lotta it, but enough to… worry me a bit. Like I said, I smoke, so… maybe it's nothin’. But it ain’t been happenin’ forever, so… thought I’d get it checked.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you came in to get it checked. Smoking definitely factors into things, but we still need to figure out what’s going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough and the red mucus?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… I get tired easy. More than usual, I mean. And… sometimes I get kinda… achy. My bones hurt, I guess. Like when you got the flu, but not as bad. Oh, and I’ve lost a little weight, I reckon. My clothes feel a bit looser. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, some bone aches, and unintentional weight loss along with the cough, red mucus, and shortness of breath. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical… Gosh. Not… that I remember. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. Had the usual colds and flus, you know? Nothing serious. No… I don't think so. I go to the doctor when somethin' really bothers me, but… not much ever has. Should I have somethin’? I don’t really keep track of that stuff. Medicare sends me papers, but… I just toss ‘em.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Devin. It's common to not have a detailed medical history readily available. We can work with that. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgery… Nope. Not that I recall. Maybe when I was a little kid? But I don’t… remember it. Never been in the hospital. Not once. Always been too stubborn to stay put long enough to need one. I just try to tough things out. Don't like doctors much, to be honest. No offense.
DOCTOR: None taken at all, Devin. Many people feel that way. Okay, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Not much family left, to be honest. My parents… gone a long time now. Had a brother, but… haven't seen him in years. We don't talk. They… weren’t sick folks, as far as I remember. My dad smoked, too. A lot. But I don't know what happened to him. Never really asked. It's… a long story. Not important, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing what you're comfortable with. Now, could you tell me about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social… What do you mean? I live alone. Always have, pretty much. Retired, so… don’t really go anywhere. Smoke on the porch. Watch TV. That's about it. You askin' if I drink? Don’t drink much. Maybe a beer now and then. Not much of a social person, never was.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, retired, and smoke on the porch. You drink alcohol occasionally. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I take somethin' for my blood pressure, I think. Little white pill. But… I don’t remember what it is. The doctor just gives it to me. I don't really pay attention to those things. I wish I was better at rememberin' stuff. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Devin, and we can look that up in the system. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Uh… a physical exam? What does that involve? I don’t… I don’t really like bein’ poked and prodded. Is it necessary? Can't we just… get some pills or somethin'? I’m not good with doctors, like I said.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Devin. A physical exam will help me get a better idea of what's going on and rule out potential causes for your cough and other symptoms. It's nothing major – I'll just listen to your lungs and heart with a stethoscope, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears and throat. I'll also feel your lymph nodes. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. It will help me determine the best course of action for you. Would you be willing to let me do that?
PATIENT: … Alright. But… be quick, okay? And… gentle. I really don't like bein' poked and prodded. Just… get it over with. I got things to do. And tell me what you're doin', so I don't get too nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, Devin. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs with this stethoscope. Take a deep breath in and out. Okay, good. And again… I'm also going to listen to your heart now. Deep breath in… and out… Okay. I hear some… wheezing in your lungs, and your heart sounds a little… irregular. Is this something you've noticed before?
PATIENT: Wheezin'? Not… really. I mean, I get outta breath easy, like I said, but I didn't know it was wheezin'. The irregular heart… No, never noticed that either. I don’t really pay attention to… sounds. Is that bad? What does it mean? I just want somethin' to make this cough go away.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re letting me know what you notice, Devin. Wheezing suggests some narrowing of your airways, and the irregular heartbeat warrants further investigation. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, I'm just going to quickly look in your ears and throat. Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little…red, but nothing too concerning. Finally, I’m going to gently feel your lymph nodes in your neck. Your lymph nodes feel… slightly enlarged. Okay, that completes the exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. These will help us figure out what’s causing your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? That sounds… serious. Is it somethin’ bad? I just have a cough, doc. Do I… do I need to go to the hospital? This is gettin’ complicated. I just want a pill. Can't we just try a pill first? I don't like tests. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Devin. It’s natural to be nervous about tests. An X-ray is a quick and painless imaging procedure that allows us to see what’s going on in your lungs. The blood work will help us check for any infections or other underlying issues. These tests aren't necessarily indicating anything serious, but they're important to rule things out and ensure we give you the best possible care. I’m not thinking you need to go to the hospital at this time. We can do these tests here at the clinic. I want to be thorough and understand the cause of your symptoms so we can get you feeling better as quickly as possible. Considering your smoking history, the cough, and these findings, it’s important to investigate further. Would you be willing to let me order these tests?
PATIENT: … Alright. Fine. But… tell me everything before you do it, okay? What are you lookin' for? And… how long will it take? I got things to do, you know. And… will it hurt? Just… get it over with, I guess. But explain it to me first. Please. I don't like bein' in the dark.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Devin. I’ll explain everything. The chest X-ray will help us look for any signs of pneumonia, bronchitis, or other lung issues. It can also reveal any masses or fluid buildup. The blood work will help us check for infection, inflammation, and assess your overall health. It will also help rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. The X-ray itself takes just a few minutes and doesn’t involve any pain. You’ll simply stand in front of the machine while a technician takes a picture of your chest. The blood work will involve a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. It may feel like a quick pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. The results usually take a few days to come back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: … No, I think that’s it. Just… get it over with. I just wanna feel better. What do I need to do now? Who do I see? And… will it cost a lot? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Just… tell me what happens next. Please. This is all… a lot. .
