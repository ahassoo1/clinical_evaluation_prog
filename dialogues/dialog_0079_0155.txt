DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes... my hands. They shake. It's been... a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. Everything's a bit fuzzy these days. Just hoping to get it sorted, if that's alright. I haven't got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: A tremor, yes. And you say it’s been some time… difficult to quantify, you mentioned. Very well. Perhaps we can begin with a bit more detail. Can you describe the tremor to me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It's like… a shivering, but inside. Not from being cold, though. Happens mostly when I try to… do things. Like holding a cup, or writing. Used to be a good carpenter, you know. Can’t do much of that anymore. It's worse when I’m… agitated, I think. Or tired. Though, I’m usually tired. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Jezik, it does. So, it's exacerbated by activity and appears to worsen with stress or fatigue. And you’ve noticed it interfering with tasks such as holding objects or writing… Is it present at rest, or only when you attempt to do something?
PATIENT: At rest… now that’s a good question. Honestly, I haven’t really paid attention. I mostly notice it when I need to use my hands. Like, if I'm trying to eat soup, or… well, anything that requires a steady hand. Maybe it's there when I'm just sitting, I don't know. I really wouldn’t be able to say. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to discern those subtleties. Very well. Let's proceed with a brief examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Alright. Get it over with quickly, if you would, Doctor. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just have a seat, Mr. Jezik. I’m going to assess your reflexes, coordination, and range of motion. Please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Now, can you tap your fingers on your knees, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: Right, right. There. Is that fast enough? Honestly, this is… uncomfortable. It’s not getting any easier, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mr. Jezik. Your reflexes are… a bit diminished, as one might expect with age. And I observe a resting tremor in both hands, as well as an intention tremor with movement. Now, do you experience any rigidity or stiffness in your limbs?
PATIENT: Rigidity… stiffness? Well, everything aches, Doctor. I'm an old man. But specifically… stiffness? Not that I've noticed. Maybe a little in the mornings, but I just thought that was… getting old. My joints aren’t what they used to be, that’s for certain.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any changes in your gait, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Gait? You mean… how I walk? Probably. I don’t run around much these days. I walk a little slower than I used to, I suppose. A bit more… careful. Don’t want to fall and break anything. My daughter keeps telling me I need to be more careful.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Jezik, based on your description and my brief examination, it appears you may be exhibiting signs consistent with essential tremor, although further investigation is warranted to rule out other possibilities. Have you ever been evaluated for Parkinson's Disease?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s? Parkinson’s… no. No, I don’t think so. Never had any… tests for that. A doctor, a long time ago, said something about my… blood pressure, maybe. And my knees. But Parkinson’s… no. Doesn’t ring a bell. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It can be, Mr. Jezik. The symptoms can overlap, which is why it's important to be thorough. We’ll need to rule it out. I'm going to order some blood work to check for underlying conditions and, given your age and these symptoms, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurologist… more doctors. Look, Doctor, I’m seventy-nine years old. What’s the point? It’s just… old age, isn’t it? I just want something to help with the shaking. Can’t you give me something for that? I don’t want to spend weeks going back and forth to specialists.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. We must determine the cause of the tremor before proceeding. However, to provide some symptomatic relief while we await further evaluation, I can prescribe a low dose of propranolol. It’s a beta-blocker sometimes used to manage essential tremor, but it's not without potential side effects, and it may not be appropriate given your medical history. Before I proceed, are you currently taking any other medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Just a little something for my… digestion. Something the daughter got me. A small white pill. That's all I can think of. I don’t really pay attention to those things. She handles all that.
DOCTOR: Very well. It’s crucial you provide a complete medication list. I’ll need your daughter’s assistance with that. However, proceeding with caution, I will prescribe a low dose of propranolol – 20mg twice daily – to be taken with meals. It’s essential to monitor your blood pressure and heart rate while taking this medication, and to report any dizziness, fatigue, or shortness of breath immediately. And, I am still strongly recommending a neurological consultation. Would you like me to provide a referral?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. The pill sounds… alright. I’ll try it. Referral… if you have to. Honestly, this is all a bit much. Just give me the papers and let me get home. I’ve got a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. The prescription is for the propranolol, and this form is for the neurology referral. Please schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. And remember, if you experience any adverse effects from the medication, stop taking it and contact my office immediately. I will document your symptoms and our discussion. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… everything. Thank you. Let’s just hope this pill does something.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. Have a good day.
