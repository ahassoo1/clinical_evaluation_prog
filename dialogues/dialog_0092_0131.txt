DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, the reason I'm here is 'cause my blood pressure's been a bit high lately. My sister kept on at me to get it checked, so here I am!
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good that your sister encouraged you to come in – preventative care is very important. And it’s always best to address things sooner rather than later. When you say “a bit high,” do you happen to know any specific numbers, or how it was measured?
PATIENT: Hmm, not really, Doctor. I don't know the numbers, no. I just bought one of those machines for home, you know, the one that goes on your arm? And it kept beeping at me with a red light. That's how I knew it wasn't right. I don't really understand all those numbers anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those home monitors can sometimes be a little alarming if you’re not sure what you’re looking at. And it’s perfectly fine not to know the specifics – that’s what I’m here for. Okay, so you recently purchased a home blood pressure monitor. Do you know roughly when you started checking your blood pressure with it?
PATIENT: Let me think... it must be about three weeks ago now. Yeah, three weeks. My niece was visiting and she showed me how to use it, said everyone should have one. I was trying to be good and keep an eye on things, you know?
DOCTOR: That's very proactive of you, Mykeisha. It’s good to be aware of your health. And three weeks gives us a little timeframe to work with. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the higher blood pressure readings?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really, no. I mean, I get headaches sometimes, but I always get headaches. And I get a little tired, but who doesn't? Nothing that felt… different, or connected to the machine beeping. Just the usual, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no new or unusual symptoms. Just your typical headaches and fatigue. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or any other medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve been pretty healthy, to be honest. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. My mother had a bit of arthritis when she got older, but that's it in the family really. I've never been told I had any of those things you mentioned.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, no prior diagnosis of high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems, and a relatively healthy family history. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Not a fan of hospitals, if you know what I mean! I broke my arm when I was a little girl, and they put it in a cast, but that was it. No major operations or anything like that.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's perfectly reasonable to avoid surgery if you can. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. My sister said I should take one, said it would keep me going. And sometimes I take paracetamol for headaches, but that's it. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and paracetamol as needed for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything. My sister's the one with all the allergies, she has to carry an EpiPen everywhere! But I'm perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, no known allergies. Okay, Mykeisha, that gives me a good starting point. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to check your blood pressure now, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's just a bit worrying, having it be high. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, please. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Try to relax, and keep your arm still while I take the reading. Okay, your blood pressure is reading 152/92. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. That blood pressure is a bit elevated, as we suspected. It’s not critically high, but it’s high enough that we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh. 152… Is that bad, Doctor? I mean, what does that mean? My sister will be asking me all about this, you know. She told me all about blood pressure, but I don’t remember any numbers. Is that something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mykeisha. 152/92 is considered Stage 1 hypertension. It means your heart is working a little harder than it should to pump blood through your arteries. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re in immediate danger, but it’s important to find out why it’s elevated. There are many possible causes, and it’s usually something we can manage with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order some routine blood tests. These will help us check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other underlying causes for the high blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Blood tests… alright. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I don't really like needles, but I’ll do whatever it takes to get this figured out. What sort of things will they be looking for in the tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That's very good of you, Mykeisha. It's a small discomfort for a lot of peace of mind. We'll be checking your basic metabolic panel, which looks at your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We'll also do a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a complete blood count just to get a general overview of your health. And we will check your thyroid levels as well. These tests should give us a good picture of what's going on. The lab usually takes a couple of days to get the results back to us – typically, three to five business days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Three to five days, alright. I guess I can wait. It's just a bit unsettling, not knowing, you know? And what if they find something bad? What sort of things would that be? I don’t want to worry my sister unnecessarily, she gets so anxious as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mykeisha. It's perfectly normal to feel unsettled when you're facing uncertainty. The tests are designed to rule things out as much as they are to find problems. Most of the time, high blood pressure isn't caused by a serious underlying condition. It’s often linked to lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and stress. However, in some cases, it can be a sign of kidney problems, thyroid issues, or other underlying health conditions. If we do find something, it doesn't necessarily mean it’s severe. It just means we need to address it with appropriate treatment. We'll discuss everything thoroughly when the results are back, and I'll explain all your options in detail. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I will write you a lab requisition. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. In the meantime, try not to worry too much, and we will figure this out together. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or where to go to get them done?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay with the tests themselves. And I have Medicare, so I should be able to find a lab nearby. My sister usually handles all this sort of thing, but I guess I can manage. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Like, should I fast or anything like that? I don't want to mess it up. And… will I feel sick after giving blood?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mykeisha. You're doing great. And it's perfectly alright to let your sister help, if that makes you more comfortable. Yes, you do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is fine. You can still take your regular medications, unless I’ve specifically told you otherwise. As for feeling sick afterwards, most people don't feel anything more than a slight pinch at the site of the draw. Occasionally, some people might feel a little lightheaded or dizzy, but that usually passes quickly. The nurse will give you a bandage and tell you to drink plenty of fluids. If you do feel unwell, just let them know, and they'll take care of you. Here’s the lab requisition. It includes all the tests we discussed, and the instructions for fasting. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Fast for eight hours, drink water… alright. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really clearly, and you’ve put my mind at ease a little. My sister will be relieved to hear I know what’s going on. I guess I’ll go and get the tests done, and then we’ll wait for the results. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting for the results. We’re here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
