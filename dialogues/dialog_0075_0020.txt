DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's August 2nd, as you know. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… I am here for this… the talk on the computer? My son, he make the appointment for me. It is for a check-up, I think. I do not feel… bad, exactly. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here a routine check-up scheduled by your son. That's very thoughtful of him. "Just old," as you say, is a perfectly valid reason to come in! It's good to be proactive about your health. To give me a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about what "old" feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… my bones, they ache sometimes. Especially in the morning. And I get tired very quickly. I used to work all day in the garage, fixing cars. Now… now I need to sit down after only a few minutes. It is… frustrating. Also, my hands, they are not as strong as before. It is hard to hold the tools.
DOCTOR: Okay, aching bones, particularly in the morning, fatigue, and decreased strength in your hands... that's helpful information. It sounds like you’ve noticed a change in your ability to do the things you used to enjoy. Just to be thorough, can you describe the bone pain more specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, I have noticed. I miss working. The pain… it is not sharp. More like a dull… heavy feeling. In my knees, mostly. And my back. Sometimes my shoulders. It is worse when it is cold. Or when it rains. I do not know if that make sense. I am not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Benites. You don’t need to be good at explaining, I’ll ask the questions to help me understand. Dull, heavy pain in your knees, back, and shoulders, worse with cold or rain... that points us in a certain direction. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints – knees, back, or shoulders?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I do not think so. Maybe a little sometimes in my knees, after I have been walking. But not much. It goes away after I sit for a while. I did not think it was important. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It can be important, yes, but it’s good you mentioned it. Intermittent swelling, even if it goes away, can give us useful information. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Have you had any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I have been a little more… forgetful lately. Not big things, just… where I put my glasses, or what I was going to say. My son say I repeat myself sometimes. And… my appetite is not very good. I do not feel hungry like I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased forgetfulness and decreased appetite… thank you for sharing those details. Those are things we want to be aware of. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… yes, I think so. My clothes are a little… loose. I have not weigh myself, but I feel like I am smaller. I do not eat as much, so I suppose it make sense. I do not worry about it much. I am not a big woman, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Even a small amount of unintentional weight loss is worth noting. Now, let's move onto your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm. I do not think so. The doctor, back in Czech, he checked me every year. He say I was healthy. After my husband… well, I did not see a doctor for many years. I have Medicare now, so I try to take care of myself. I do not remember any big sicknesses. Maybe a cold sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common to not remember specific diagnoses. No major illnesses reported, that's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a girl. And… when I broke my arm, many years ago. A car accident. But that was a long time ago. No… I do not think I have been in the hospital for anything else. Just the usual check-ups with the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a past broken arm. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little pill for my water. The doctor say my water pressure was high. And sometimes, when my knees hurt very bad, I take ibuprofen. But not every day. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for high blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Do you know the name of the medication you take for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… I forget. It is a small, white pill. My son, he fill the box for me. I do not like to bother him, so I just take the pills. He know everything. I am sorry. I wish I could remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Benites. It's very common to forget medication names. Your son is very helpful. We can look it up in the pharmacy records if you'd like. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I eat everything. And I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My husband, he was allergic to bees. But I am not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, if you don't mind me asking, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother, she lived to be very old. Ninety years. She had… arthritis, I think. In her hands and knees. My father, he died young. A heart problem. And my sister… she had diabetes. But I do not think… I do not think I will get those sicknesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis, heart problems, and diabetes. Thank you. And finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never. I do not smoke. And I do not drink. My husband, he liked a beer sometimes. But I never did. It is not good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or alcohol use. Thank you, Ms. Benites. That gives me a very good overview. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your joints for tenderness or swelling, and some basic neurological tests. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please… and hold it… good. Now exhale… Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight crackling in the lower part of your lungs on both sides. It’s subtle, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, let’s check your knees… Does this hurt at all?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. When you press there. It is always sore, but it is worse today. And when it rains.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your back?
PATIENT: A little pain there too. Not as bad as my knees. It feels… stiff. Like it needs to be stretched. It is hard to bend over. I used to be able to do anything. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about bending forward?
PATIENT: Ooh… Not very good. It hurts. It feels like something is blocking me. I can’t go very far. I used to be able to touch my toes. Now… no chance.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. The neurological exam is normal. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you are likely experiencing osteoarthritis, also known as wear-and-tear arthritis, along with some possible early signs of fluid in your lungs. The fatigue, forgetfulness, and decreased appetite could be related to the arthritis, or they could indicate something else. We’ll need to do some further testing to be sure. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your inflammation levels, kidney function, and thyroid function. I’d also like to get a chest X-ray to assess the fluid in your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. I miss my work. And I do not want to be a burden to my son. Will the tests… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: The blood tests will only involve a small needle prick. It might sting for a moment, but it shouldn’t hurt for long. The chest X-ray is completely painless. It's like having a photograph taken. While we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief—either acetaminophen or ibuprofen – whichever you tolerate better. I will also recommend some gentle exercises to help keep your joints mobile. I can write a referral to a physical therapist if you are interested. We will review the test results in a week. If they show significant inflammation, we can discuss additional treatment options, such as prescription medication. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Acetaminophen… and ibuprofen. Gentle exercises. And the physical therapist. Okay. My son can help me with the exercises, I think. He is very good at those things. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could help. Here are the orders for the blood tests and chest X-ray, as well as a referral to a physical therapist. My nurse will schedule you for those tests before you leave. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and remember to listen to your body. It was a pleasure meeting you.
