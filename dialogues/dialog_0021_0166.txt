DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Havird. It’s… well, it’s my leg, actually. It’s been feeling numb, off and on, for a little while now. Not constantly, thankfully, but enough that it’s starting to bother me. I thought it best to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Numbness, you say. "A little while now"... hmm. Vague descriptions don't really help me, you know. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: My apologies, Doctor. You're quite right. It started, I believe, approximately three weeks ago, on July 12th, to be precise. It's in my right leg, mostly the outer side, from the hip down to just above the knee. It doesn't feel like complete numbness, more like… a fading sensation? Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as intense, and it comes and goes. It’s not constant, as I said. It seems to happen more when I've been standing for long periods, or after a particularly long day working on a project.
DOCTOR: Right. So, three weeks… outer right leg, hip to just above the knee. And related to standing, or long days. Do you recall anything specific that you were doing when it first started?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I do. It was the day after we finished the preliminary animation for the new wildlife documentary. We'd been working on it for nearly 72 hours straight, mostly standing at the motion capture rig, adjusting settings and reviewing the footage. I remember feeling… quite fatigued afterward. It wasn't immediately after, though. It started sometime that evening, after I’d gotten home and was trying to relax. Perhaps it's related to that? I’m not certain, naturally.
DOCTOR: 72 hours... really?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… unfortunately rather common in my field. Deadlines, you understand. It was a particularly demanding project, and the client was… insistent on timely delivery. Perhaps a poor decision on my part to push myself so hard, in retrospect. It’s not a habit I’m proud of, but it’s been necessary on occasion. Would you like me to elaborate on the project details? I can recall the exact dates and times we were working, if that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, that's quite enough about your… work. Let’s get back to the leg. Do you have any pain associated with the numbness?
PATIENT: Not consistently, no. Occasionally, I'll feel a dull ache in my lower back, but I assumed that was simply from standing for extended periods. It’s not sharp or debilitating, more like a general soreness. And sometimes, when the numbness is particularly pronounced, there's a slight tingling sensation in my foot, like pins and needles. But no significant pain, Doctor. Not that I’ve noticed, at least. It's more… unsettling than painful.
DOCTOR: "Unsettling." Right. And any weakness in your leg?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it, to be honest. I haven't noticed any significant weakness, no. However… now that you mention it, I have felt slightly more clumsy when walking after a long day. Nothing dramatic, just a slight… hesitancy, perhaps? Like I'm not quite as coordinated as usual. It could be fatigue, naturally, but I suppose it’s possible it's related to the numbness. Would you like me to attempt a few simple exercises to demonstrate? I can stand on one leg, if that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary. Let’s just get on with it. Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just lie back and try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tender spots here… not unexpected, given your… lifestyle. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Patellar reflex… a little sluggish on the right. Achilles… same. Strength testing. Okay, flex against my resistance… extend… dorsiflex… plantarflex… alright. Strength is… adequate, but a little diminished on the right. Sensation… reduced light touch on the outer right foot. Alright. That’s… something.
PATIENT: Diminished sensation and reduced strength… I see. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I apologize for asking, but I trust your judgment, naturally. I understand medical terminology is not my forte, so any clarification you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Is it… something serious? I’m not attempting to be alarmist, merely seeking information.
DOCTOR: "Serious" is a relative term. It could be something simple – a pinched nerve, muscle strain. You do put a lot of stress on your body, you know. But the diminished sensation and strength… that warrants further investigation. It could indicate nerve compression further up the chain. I’m going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine, just to rule out anything more significant. And I want you to see a physical therapist, starting immediately. They can help with your posture and core strength. And seriously, consider your work habits. You can't keep pushing yourself like this.
PATIENT: An MRI and physical therapy… I understand. I will schedule those appointments immediately. And I… I take your point regarding my work habits, Doctor. It is… a difficult lesson to learn, but a necessary one, apparently. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any specific symptoms I should be looking out for? And… roughly speaking, what sort of timeframe are we looking at for the MRI results? I apologize for the multitude of questions, but I prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Look, if you experience any sudden weakness, bowel or bladder problems, or severe pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Those are red flags. Otherwise, just follow the physical therapist's instructions and try to be more mindful of your body. The MRI results should be back in about a week. My office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they have them. Now, do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I understand. Sudden weakness, bowel or bladder problems… noted. I will be vigilant. As for allergies, no, I have no known allergies. And I am not currently taking any medications. I occasionally use a topical analgesic cream for muscle soreness, but that is all. Just a standard over-the-counter product, nothing prescription-strength. Is there anything else you require from me at this time? Perhaps a referral form for the physical therapy? I want to ensure everything is handled efficiently.
DOCTOR: Here. Referral to a physical therapist, decent one nearby. And try not to overdo it, alright?
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Havird. I appreciate your time and guidance. I will schedule the appointment immediately and follow your instructions carefully. I will contact your office if any concerns arise. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too. And try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: .
