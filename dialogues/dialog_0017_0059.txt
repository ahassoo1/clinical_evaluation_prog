DOCTOR: Good morning, Miss Swaby. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. My speech… it hasn't been quite right, I suppose. It feels… slurred, sometimes. I noticed it a few days ago, but it comes and goes. I don't really know when it started exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: “Comes and goes,” you say. Hmm. And when you say slurred, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… It’s like… the words don’t come out clearly, sometimes. Like I'm trying to say something, but it sounds… mushy? Or slow, maybe? It's not all the time, thankfully. It's more noticeable when I'm tired, I think. Or… when I'm speaking quickly. It's difficult to describe, I apologize.
DOCTOR: “Mushy” and “slow.” Right. And you've noticed this is worse with fatigue or when speaking rapidly. Have you experienced any difficulty understanding what others are saying, or is it solely with your own speech?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I can understand people perfectly fine. It’s definitely just me speaking, not hearing. I haven’t had any trouble with that, thankfully. It’s just… embarrassing, sometimes, when I can’t get the words out properly. My husband says I’m worrying too much, but… it’s still a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Your husband’s assessment is… potentially relevant, but we will proceed. Now, have you experienced any weakness in your face, arms, or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… Not that I’ve noticed, Doctor. No. I work in construction, so I’m using my arms and legs all day, and they feel… normal. Maybe a little sore at the end of the day, but that's just from the work, you know? Nothing unusual. I haven't dropped anything or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any recent headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, actually. I’ve had a few headaches in the last week or so. Not terribly bad, just… a dull ache, mostly behind my eyes. They come and go, like everything else, I suppose. No dizziness, and my vision seems fine. I had my eyes checked last year, and everything was good then. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Everything is potentially relevant, Miss Swaby. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or neck stiffness recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't think so. I haven't felt warm, and I haven't been taking my temperature, if that helps. No chills either. And… neck stiffness? No, I can move my neck just fine. It doesn't feel stiff at all. I'm really trying to think, Doctor, but it’s difficult to remember everything. Everything just feels a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy.” Right. Let's move on to some more directed questions. Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, or changes in your taste or smell?
PATIENT: Swallowing… No, I haven't had any trouble swallowing. Food goes down normally. And no changes to my taste or smell, either. I made jerk chicken last night, and it tasted just like jerk chicken should. I’m a pretty good cook, if I do say so myself. But honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to get a little worried. I don't understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed with a brief neurological examination. Please follow my finger with your eyes – do not move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'm following it… is that right? It's a little blurry, but I can see it. Just let me know if I need to adjust or anything. It's been a long day already, so my eyes might just be tired.
DOCTOR: Adequate pursuit. Now, squeeze my hands firmly. Please squeeze as hard as you can. I will resist.
PATIENT: Okay. I’m squeezing… is that enough? I don't want to hurt you, Doctor. My grip isn't as strong as it used to be, but I’m trying my best. It feels… a little stiff, actually.
DOCTOR: Adequate strength, though slightly diminished, as you indicated. Now, say "hello" for me.
PATIENT: Hello. Does that… sound alright? It feels a bit strange to say, now that you mention it. It doesn’t feel slurred, but… I don't know. It's hard to tell, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Speech is mildly dysarthric, though inconsistent. Now, please stick out your tongue. And say “red bird”.
PATIENT: Red… bird. Is that okay? It feels a bit awkward, Doctor. My tongue feels… a little heavy, maybe? I hope I’m doing this right.
DOCTOR: Adequate, though articulation is…compromised. Given your age and reported symptoms, and inconsistent exam findings, I suspect a possible early neurological process. However, it could be a multitude of things. I would like to order a stat MRI of the brain with and without contrast, and a full blood panel including a complete metabolic panel and thyroid function tests. I will also have the nurse draw a Vitamin B12 level. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests? I… I don't think I've ever had an MRI before. And I don’t think I have any allergies to dye… but I haven't had any dye injected before, so I wouldn't really know, would I? My husband usually handles all the medical stuff, and I just… go along. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is potentially serious, Miss Swaby, which is why we are pursuing these tests. It's far better to be thorough. The nurse will explain the blood draw procedure. As for the MRI, you will lie inside a large magnet. It's noisy, but not painful. We need to rule out several possibilities, including stroke, tumor, or demyelinating disease. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Stroke… tumor… demyelinating disease? Those sound… frightening, Doctor. I… I think I understand, but… I'm not a medical person, you know? I just want to know… what's happening to me? Is there anything else I should be worried about? Is it something I did?
DOCTOR: Miss Swaby, speculating on etiology at this juncture is unproductive. It could be a multitude of factors, entirely unrelated to lifestyle. We will obtain the necessary imaging and laboratory data, and then formulate a more informed plan. Until then, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity, and refrain from driving. The nurse will schedule the MRI for tomorrow morning. I suggest you bring a family member for support. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. I'm just… scared, Doctor. I'll… I’ll get my husband. He’ll know what to do. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will see you out. .
