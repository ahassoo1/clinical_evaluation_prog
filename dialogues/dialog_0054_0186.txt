DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Uh, well, I'm trying out for a team. Need a check-up, I guess. For the sports thing. Don't really know what all needs to be done, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. That's perfectly alright. A sports check-up is a good idea. We want to make sure you're in good shape before you start. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about the team you're trying out for, and what kind of physical activity is involved?
PATIENT: It's a… well, it’s a wrestling team. Sort of traditional Mongolian wrestling, but they're trying to get it more… mainstream, I think? Lots of grappling, pushing, lifting... you know, the usual. Not a ton of running, thankfully. I'm not the fastest guy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Mongolian wrestling, that sounds interesting! And no worries about the running; we’ll focus on what’s important for your activity. Grappling and lifting definitely require a good level of strength and endurance. To get started, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. I mean, I’m an old man now, so things ache a little. But nothing major. No big illnesses or anything like that. I think I had the flu once, a long time ago. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… a long while.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. “Aches and pains” are fairly common as we get older, and it sounds like you’ve been fortunate with your overall health. Since it’s been a while since you’ve seen a doctor, we’ll be a bit thorough today. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mother tried to get me to eat everything as a kid, said it builds character. Never had a problem with anything. I eat… whatever’s available, mostly. Don’t really have picky tastes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! A resilient digestive system is certainly a benefit. And now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t believe in taking pills if I can avoid it. Always thought it was best to let the body heal itself, you know? Unless it's really bad, of course. But nothing right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree trying to get a bird’s nest. But that’s it. Just the arm. Healed up fine. Nothing else. I've been pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And you said you've been pretty lucky. That's excellent. Now, is there a family history of any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Uh… that’s a tough one. My family… they weren't big on keeping records. Lots of farmers and herders. People died doing what people died doing, you know? Heart trouble, probably. Old age, mostly. Can't really say for sure. It was a long time ago, and far away.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s not uncommon. It's helpful to know what you do remember, though. Alright, before we move on to a physical exam, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I don’t smoke. My father smoked, and it didn’t do him any good. Alcohol… maybe a small drink with special occasions, but not regularly. And drugs? Never touched them. Never had the inclination. I need a clear head for wrestling, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… simple. Mostly meat and dairy, to be honest. Lamb, beef, some goat. Milk, yogurt, cheese. Potatoes, sometimes. We don’t have a lot of variety where I come from. It keeps you strong, though. That's the important thing. Not fancy, but it works.
DOCTOR: It certainly sounds like a sustaining diet. Alright, Mr. Kingan, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. We’ll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, reflexes, and range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, really. I've got training to get back to. The sooner we know if I’m fit, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably and relax your arm?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 145 over 90. That's a little elevated. We'll want to keep an eye on that. I'm going to listen to your heart now. Your heart sounds… regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s quiet, but it warrants further investigation. I’ll also listen to your lungs. Your lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal, 2+ bilaterally. Finally, let's assess your range of motion. Your range of motion is generally good, but I notice some mild stiffness in your lower back. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: The back… yeah, it aches sometimes. Old injuries, probably. Not anything major, just… gets stiff after a long day. I usually work it out. It’s nothing to worry about, really. I’ve been wrestling for a long time, things get broken and bent. It’s part of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and I detected a slight heart murmur. Your reflexes and range of motion are generally good, but you do experience some stiffness in your lower back. Given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur, I’d like to order some further testing. I recommend an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and a blood test to check your cholesterol and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… and blood tests. Sounds… involved. But if you think it's necessary… fine. When can I get this done? I don't want to delay my training any longer than I have to.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can get those scheduled quickly. There’s a lab just down the street, and they take walk-ins. I'll write you a requisition form, and they can get it done today. The EKG can be done at the clinic tomorrow morning. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance? No. Never got around to it. It's expensive. I'll pay cash. How much will it be?
DOCTOR: Alright. The EKG will be around $150, and the blood tests will be about $200. That brings the total to $350. I understand that’s a significant expense. Considering your age and the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur, it's important to rule out any underlying heart conditions before you start intensive training. Given your limited insurance coverage, would you be interested in exploring some local assistance programs that might help with the cost of testing?
PATIENT: Assistance programs? No. Just… no. I’ll pay it. Get it done. I don't have time for paperwork and… programs. I'll write a check. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. I respect your decision. I'll write the requisition forms for the EKG and blood tests. Here is the information for the lab down the street. They're open until 6 PM tonight. I’ll also schedule you for the EKG tomorrow morning at 9 AM here at the clinic. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity until we get these results. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when will I know the results? And what if they say I can't wrestle?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my assistant call you as soon as they come in. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. As for your concern about not being able to wrestle… let’s not jump to conclusions. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. If there are any concerns, we'll explore all available options to manage them and see if we can adjust your training to minimize any risk. It's possible we may need to consult with a cardiologist if the murmur is significant, but that’s something we'll discuss once we have the results. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and taking things one step at a time. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… yeah. Just get the tests done. I’ll wait for the call. Thank you, Doctor.
