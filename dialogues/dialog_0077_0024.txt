DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Pirl. Welcome to the clinic. I apologize if the wait was a bit long today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. No problem at all about the wait, I understand things get busy. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I'm able to fly. It’s for… well, it's a bit complicated, but my travel insurance requires it.
DOCTOR: A letter confirming your fitness to fly. Yes, I understand. And what precisely is the reason for requiring this confirmation, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: It’s… because my husband passed away unexpectedly a few months ago. He was planning the trip, a big one to visit family in Mongolia, and I’m going in his place. The insurance company… they’re being very thorough, I guess, since it was a sudden change of plans and a… a bereavement trip. They just need a doctor to say I’m healthy enough to travel.
DOCTOR: I see. My deepest condolences for your loss, Ms. Sayar. That must be incredibly difficult. Of course, I can certainly write a letter confirming your fitness to fly. To do so responsibly, I'll need to ask a few questions, if you don’t mind. It’s standard procedure, just to ensure your safety during travel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Ask away. I want to make sure everything is done properly, too. It’s a long flight, and I wouldn’t want any issues.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but haven’t really been sick in… well, a long time. My husband always said I was too stubborn to get sick! I do have Medicare, if that helps? They have all my basic records, I presume.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is helpful. I see a record here indicating generally good health, and up-to-date preventative screenings. Still, it’s important to confirm everything. Have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized in the past few years?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And no hospital visits either, not for anything serious. I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, clumsy fall off a horse, but that was… decades ago. Honestly, the biggest medical thing I've dealt with recently was getting my flu shot.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really take anything. I try to eat well and get enough sleep, and that’s usually enough. I might have some ibuprofen in the house for headaches, but I rarely even use that. My husband was the one who always remembered to take his vitamins! It’s strange not having to remind someone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever, thankfully. My husband… he was allergic to shellfish. A really bad reaction, so we always had to be careful when we went out to eat. It’s little things like that you don't even think about until they're gone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions, then perhaps a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any recent changes in your health – new symptoms, unexplained weight loss or gain, fatigue, or anything else unusual?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been… a bit tired, of course. But that’s just from the grief, I think. And dealing with everything after… after he passed. I haven’t lost or gained any weight, and I’m sleeping okay, all things considered. I’m just… trying to get through each day. I wouldn’t say I've felt unwell, just… sad.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Grief can manifest in many ways. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me about any family history of serious medical conditions – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some heart trouble, but he lived to be almost ninety, so it wasn’t too bad. No cancer that I know of. My husband’s side of the family… they were all pretty healthy, actually. He always said it was the Mongolian air and a good diet.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. My husband wasn’t a drinker either, mostly tea. Mongolian tea, very strong!
DOCTOR: Very good. Thank you for answering those questions so thoroughly, Ms. Sayar. Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to just perform a quick physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just a general assessment. It’s just a precaution, to ensure you're fit for travel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this letter so I can… well, so I can finally go on the trip.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat on the table, please. We'll start with your blood pressure. Just relax and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is perfectly normal. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good, Ms. Sayar. No signs of anything concerning.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. So, does that mean you can write the letter? Is there anything else you need? I have a meeting later this afternoon, so I’m a little pressed for time, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Based on my assessment, and the information you’ve provided, I have no medical concerns preventing you from traveling. I’m happy to write a letter confirming your fitness to fly. It will just take me a few minutes to draft it. Here you are, Ms. Sayar. It outlines that you are in good health and able to undertake air travel. I’ve included my contact information should the insurance company require any further clarification. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Perfect! Thank you so much, Doctor. This looks great. No, I think that's everything. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to see me, especially with everything going on. I'll let you get back to your other patients. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. And again, my deepest condolences for your loss. I wish you a safe and peaceful trip. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. Goodbye.
