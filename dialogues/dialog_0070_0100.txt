DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you as well. Um…well, they told me I needed to come in for a…a check, I guess. Something about…testing? For stuff. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. It's Medicare, you know how they are. They sent a letter. Is that a drug test? I think it might be.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare sometimes initiates preventative testing, and those letters can be…less than clear. No, Ms. Hughston, this isn't a drug test. It sounds like they've scheduled some routine bloodwork and possibly a few other standard tests. To clarify, are you currently experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns that brought you to consider seeing a doctor, independent of the letter?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Not a drug test. That would be…awkward. No, not really any symptoms. I mean, I get a little tired, you know, being my age. And my knees ache when it rains. But that’s just…old age creeping up on me. I work outside a lot, paving and all, so aches and pains are normal. Honestly, Doctor, I feel alright. Just…tired sometimes. And forgetful. But who isn't, right?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you're feeling generally alright. Fatigue and mild aches are common, especially with physical work. And memory changes can be normal as we age as well. However, it’s important to investigate those things to ensure there isn’t an underlying cause we should address. Could you tell me a little more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it's not like, falling-down tired, you know? It’s just…at the end of the day, I'm really at the end of the day. Like, I’ll sit down and just…be done. And it takes a little longer to get going in the mornings. Used to bounce right up, but now…it’s a process. I nap sometimes. Not every day, but…when I can. It's been…gradual, I guess. It's not sudden or anything. And I sleep okay, mostly. My husband… he used to say I snored. But he’s…gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a gradual decline in energy levels, which is important to note. And it’s perfectly normal to experience changes after a loss; that can significantly impact energy and sleep patterns. I’m sorry for your loss, Ms. Hughston. To get a better picture, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was…a few years ago now. Time flies, doesn’t it? A typical day…well, I get up, usually around 6:30. Coffee, of course. Then I get ready for work. I operate one of those big paving machines, you know, the ones that smooth out the roads? It's…physical. A lot of sitting, but also getting in and out, checking things, making adjustments. We work pretty much straight through ‘til 4 or 5. Then I come home, make dinner…usually something simple. Watch a little TV. And then…bed. Some days I just collapse on the couch after dinner and wake up there. It really depends on the job. Some days are harder than others. Mostly just work, really. I don’t…do much else these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like a demanding job, physically and mentally. And it’s not uncommon for physically strenuous work to contribute to fatigue. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. That was…no big deal, really. And the doctor said I was a little anemic once, but he gave me some pills and that fixed it. I think. Honestly, I don't remember a lot of the specifics. High blood pressure…maybe? I take a pill for something, I’m pretty sure. I get it refilled every month. My husband used to handle all that stuff. He knew all the doctor’s names and what everything was for. I just…took the pills. I’m sorry, I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely fine, Ms. Hughston. It’s very common for patients to not recall specific details, especially regarding past medical history. We can access your records to clarify those things. Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with hypertension – high blood pressure – about ten years ago and you’ve been on lisinopril since then. That would explain the pill you’re taking. And you did have your gallbladder removed in 2008. It also looks like you were treated for iron deficiency anemia several years ago, and your iron levels were within normal limits at your last check-up in 2022. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know. So it was my blood pressure. No, no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I used to get stung by bees sometimes when I was a kid, but I haven’t been stung in years. Nothing serious, just a little pain. My husband was allergic to penicillin, I remember that, but…that’s him. I don't think I have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just glad I don't have to worry about that.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm…family history. That’s a tough one. My mother…she had a bad heart. She died when she was pretty young, I think. Maybe in her sixties? It was…sudden. My father, he lived to be old, but he had arthritis really bad. Couldn't walk without a cane for years. And my sister…she had cancer, a long time ago. She beat it, though. She’s still alive, thank goodness. My husband’s side…I don't really know much about his family. He didn’t talk about them much. So, heart trouble, arthritis, cancer…that’s about all I can remember, honestly. It wasn't something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hughston. That gives me a good start. History of heart disease, arthritis, and cancer in the family…that’s important information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it. My husband smoked for a while when he was young, but he quit years ago. Said it was killing him. He was right, of course. I don't drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… Well, operating a paving machine is pretty physical, wouldn’t you say? Seriously though, I don’t really exercise. Not like going to a gym or anything. I used to walk more when my husband was alive, but…not so much now. I mostly just try to keep moving at work, I guess. That’s about it. I’m not one for fancy exercise.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's perfectly alright. Physical labor can certainly be a form of exercise. Okay, Ms. Hughston, I think I have a good understanding of your overall health history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, looking in your ears, and feeling your abdomen. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I haven’t had a good check-up in a while, so I’m sure I need it. Just let me know if anything feels…weird. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. It can fluctuate. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s often harmless, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Ears look clear as well. Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses detected. Okay, Ms. Hughston, everything seems within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur. Given your fatigue, slightly elevated blood pressure, and family history, I’d like to order some bloodwork. It will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a lipid panel. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Bloodwork sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Will I need to fast before the bloodwork? I always forget those things. And where do I go to get it done? Is it here in the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the bloodwork, meaning no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. And we'll send you to the lab right across the hall. They're very efficient over there. I'll give you a lab requisition form with specific instructions. Here you go. This form lists everything they need to check. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes about a week. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. There are affordable home blood pressure monitors available. Do you have any questions about the bloodwork or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Eight to twelve hours. And the lab is right across the hall. That’s good. No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just…when we schedule the follow-up, would it be possible to have it in the morning? I find I’m more alert then. And thank you, Doctor. For everything. I feel…better just knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. We can definitely schedule the follow-up appointment for the morning. I'll have the receptionist assist you with that when you're ready. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. We’ll get these results back and develop a plan to address your fatigue and keep your blood pressure under control. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Abady. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your patience and…everything. I’ll go see the receptionist now and schedule that follow-up. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day to you too. .
