DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Norval is fine, please. It’s this… well, I get full awful quick these days. Like, I haven’t even finished half my plate and I feel stuffed. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, maybe a month. It’s just… strange.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Hard to say exactly, you know how it is at my age. Things kinda blur together. But definitely longer than a couple of weeks. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable and frustrating. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… I barely get a few bites in.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what kind of meals are we talking about here, Norval?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… normal stuff. Fish and rice, sometimes some bannock if my wife makes it. Roast chicken on a Sunday. Nothin' fancy, and not huge portions either. I haven't been eatin' more than usual, that's for sure. It’s just… fills me up faster. I used to be able to polish off a good plate, no problem. Now… It’s just not the same.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this… early fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really, no. Maybe a bit tired sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I reckon. No pain, no heartburn, no… well, nothin' really stands out. I sleep alright, go to the bathroom regular. Just the full feeling, that's the main thing. It's a bit of a worry, to be honest. Makes me wonder if somethin's wrong.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just a bit. Not all the time, mind you. More… sluggish, maybe? Like I could nap all afternoon, but that’s not unusual for an old fella like me. It's hard to say if it's connected to the full feeling or just… life, you know? Gets harder every year, that’s what my wife says. But this full feeling is new, and that’s what’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, other than getting full quicker?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite… hmm. Not really less appetite, no. I still feel hungry, but then just a few bites and I'm done. It's weird, like my stomach’s shrunk or somethin’. I still want to eat, it’s just… I can't. And it's not like I’m pickin’ at things 'cause I’m sick, I just get full so fast. It's frustrating, more than anything. Makes me not want to bother with meals at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Norval?
PATIENT: No, not a one. Never really been much for pills, if I can help it. Just a bit of liniment for my knees when they’re botherin’ me, but that’s it. Always figured I’d rather tough things out than load up on chemicals, if you know what I mean. My wife keeps tellin’ me I should see someone about my knees, but I just put it off. And I definitely haven't started any new medicines recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Deep breath in… and out… again… Alright, that sounds reasonably clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just relax for me. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Feels… normal, I suppose. A bit sensitive, maybe, but that could just be my gut. I haven’t had much of a flat stomach in decades, if you catch my drift. It's probably just the way things are. I'm not a young man anymore, Doctor. A bit of poking and prodding is to be expected. Ooh, that’s a bit… firm. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Hmm. That is…slightly firm. Not overtly concerning, but noted. And no pain with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just…firm. It doesn't hurt, it just…feels different. Like there's somethin’ there that shouldn't be. Not a big somethin', mind you, just… somethin’. I haven’t noticed it before, to be honest. Usually, I don't pay much attention to what's going on down there. Old men don't dwell on such things.
DOCTOR: Let’s listen to your bowel sounds. Sounds are present… a bit quiet, perhaps, but not alarming. Alright. Everything seems… relatively normal. But that firmness is a bit unusual.
PATIENT: Relatively normal is good, I suppose. What about that firmness, Doctor? Should we be worried? Is it somethin' serious? My wife’s been tellin’ me I should get a check-up for years, and I finally caved. I'm hopin' it's not somethin' too bad. I'm not as spry as I used to be, but I still like gettin’ out on the water.
DOCTOR: Well, Norval, it’s difficult to say for certain without further investigation. It could be a number of things – a bit of constipation, a minor muscle issue… or it could be something else. To be on the safe side, I think we should order some blood work. And, frankly, given your age and this new symptom, I’d recommend an abdominal ultrasound. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in there. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Blood work and an ultrasound… sounds sensible, Doctor. If it puts my mind at ease, I’m happy to do it. I just want to know what’s goin’ on. My wife will be relieved to hear we're gettin' to the bottom of things. She’s always been the practical one. Alright, let’s do it. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval, here's your lab requisition. You'll need to go to the lab downtown – the address is on the form. They’ll need a blood sample. And here's the referral for the ultrasound. You'll need to call and schedule an appointment. The imaging center is just across town. They'll give you specific instructions on how to prepare. It’s usually nothing more than being well-hydrated. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds pretty straightforward, Doctor. Lab work and a phone call… I can manage that. Well-hydrated… I can do that, too. I usually have a good cup of tea with my lunch. Thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look into this. It’s a relief to have a plan. I’ll get these scheduled right away. Hopefully, it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. No problem at all. Just call the imaging center, and the lab and we'll get everything sorted. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
