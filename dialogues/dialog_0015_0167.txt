DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Trestrail. It says here you're 87 years young. That's wonderful. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, eighty-seven years. Time goes fast, eh? I have… a bad sore on my foot. It’s been hurting for a little while now. It doesn't seem to be getting better.
DOCTOR: A sore on your foot. Alright. And how long is "a little while," exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe three, four weeks now? It started small, just a little red spot. I thought it was from my slippers rubbing, maybe. But it just… got bigger. And more painful. I try to walk, but it hurts each time my foot touches the floor. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Near your toes. And you've been trying to walk on it?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I have to get around, you know? I go to the store, I water my plants… I don’t just sit still all day. But I try not to put too much weight on it. It’s just… hard not to. Maybe that’s why it’s not getting better? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Like… pus? I haven’t really looked that close, to be honest. It’s… unpleasant to look at. There's maybe some wetness sometimes when I put a bandage on it. But I just thought that was from the sore itself, you know? I’m not sure what pus looks like.
DOCTOR: "Wetness" isn't a particularly helpful description, Mr. Stoegbauer. Is it clear fluid?
PATIENT: Oh, clear… like water? Yes, I think so. Not… thick or cloudy. Just a little bit of wetness. Not a lot, but enough to make the bandage feel damp. I change it every day, though. I try to keep it clean. I use soap and water.
DOCTOR: And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh yes. The doctor told me a long time ago I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, he called it. I take pills for it, every day. And… well, my knees aren’t so good anymore. Arthritis, I think. Makes it hard to get up sometimes.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, arthritis… alright. And what medications are you currently taking for those conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… for the sugar sickness, I take a white pill. Small one. And for my knees… a pink one. Sometimes the doctor changes them. I have a bag of pills at home, all different colors. I try to remember which one is which, but it’s hard. My daughter helps me fill the little boxes each week. She knows what I need.
DOCTOR: It would be extremely helpful if you kept a current list of your medications, Mr. Stoegbauer. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve taken a lot of different medicines over the years, and nothing bad ever happened. I don’t remember ever being allergic to anything, no. But… I get a little itchy sometimes. But that could be anything, you know? The sun, the plants…
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at this foot. Please, if you don’t mind, sit back on the exam table and elevate your leg. I need to get a good look at this sore.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Here you go. Be gentle, please. It’s tender.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. It’s located on the plantar aspect of your foot, near the metatarsal heads. There's significant erythema and induration. I’m also noting some warmth to the touch. And, yes, there appears to be some mild weeping from the wound. It's approximately two centimeters in diameter. No obvious signs of osteomyelitis at this time, but further investigation may be required. It appears to be an open wound, and given your history of diabetes, we need to take this seriously. Dorsalis pedis pulse is present, but weak. Posterior tibial pulse is also weak. Capillary refill is slightly delayed.
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s… a lot of words, Doctor. Is it… bad? Is it the sugar sickness making it worse? I just want to be able to walk again.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Stoegbauer, diabetes significantly impairs your body’s ability to heal, and it can lead to complications such as poor circulation and increased risk of infection. Given the presentation, my concern is that this is a diabetic foot ulcer. We need to prevent this from worsening, which could lead to more serious consequences. I'm going to order some labs to assess your blood sugar levels and rule out any infection. We will also need to get an X-ray to see if there is any bone involvement. In the meantime, I recommend complete offloading of the foot – no walking on it whatsoever. Do you understand?
PATIENT: No walking? But… how will I get to the store? How will I water my plants? And… what about the tests? What will they do? I don't like needles. I understand about not walking, I guess, but… it's going to be very hard.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, I understand this is inconvenient, but we need to prioritize the health of your foot. The lab tests will involve a simple blood draw to check your glucose levels and look for signs of infection. It’s a necessary step to determine the best course of treatment. As for getting to the store and watering your plants, you’ll need to arrange for assistance from family or friends. We can discuss options for mobility aids after we get the results of the tests. I’m going to write you a prescription for some topical antibiotic ointment to apply to the wound. Keep it clean and covered with a sterile bandage at all times. And, again, no walking. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Topical ointment… okay. My daughter, Leilani, she can help. She drives. And… she likes my plants. Will I… will I have to go to the hospital? If it gets infected?
DOCTOR: The possibility exists, Mr. Stoegbauer, should the infection become severe. However, with proper care and diligent monitoring, we can hopefully avoid that outcome. I’m going to order a wound culture as well to identify any specific bacteria present. This will help us determine the most appropriate antibiotic treatment, if necessary. I’m also going to refer you to a podiatrist for specialized wound care. They can provide debridement and offloading strategies. I'll have the lab orders and referral paperwork ready for you before you leave. It’s crucial that you follow up with the podiatrist within the next week. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Podiatrist… that’s another doctor? So many doctors… I understand. I will try to follow all the instructions. Leilani will help me. But… what if it doesn’t get better? Even with all the doctors and the ointment and… everything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, while I understand your concerns, dwelling on hypotheticals is not productive. We will address any complications as they arise. Right now, the priority is to prevent infection and promote healing. I've written the referral to Dr. Kamalani, a highly respected podiatrist in the area. I’ll also send your primary care physician a summary of today’s visit. Here are the lab orders, the referral paperwork, and a detailed list of wound care instructions. Please read them carefully, and follow them diligently. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it gets better.
DOCTOR: Very well. I expect to hear from Dr. Kamalani’s office to schedule your appointment. Should you experience any signs of infection—increased pain, redness, swelling, fever—seek immediate medical attention. You’re dismissed.
