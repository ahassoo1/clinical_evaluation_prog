DOCTOR: Right. Bianca Zicarelli, 63. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s just…I been drinkin’ a lot of water, more than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat. It’s been goin’ on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It just don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Maybe a little longer. Hard to say exactly, things been busy with the garden. But definitely over a month. I just thought it would go away, you know? But it ain't.
DOCTOR: And you said you're drinking more water than usual, despite being hungry all the time?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I does try to drink plenty water, always have, especially with the heat. But now… now I feel like I have to force myself to drink even more, just to feel okay. And it don't even help the hunger, really. It’s strange. I eat a good plate of food and feel empty again soon after.
DOCTOR: Any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don't weigh myself regular, Doctor. We don't really have one of those scales at home. But my clothes… maybe a little tighter? I don't know. I ain't been feelin' myself lately, if that makes sense. Not like I lost weight, just… different. Everything feels a little different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? You mean… going to the bathroom? Yes, I think so. I does go more often, now that you mention it. Especially at night. I have to get up sometimes, which is not good. My husband, he does complain a little, but I can’t help it, you know? It just happens. Is that… is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. I feel tired all the time. Even after a good night’s sleep. I used to be able to work in the garden all day, but now I have to stop and rest. It's just… weariness. A heavy feeling, you know? I just don't have the energy I used to. It’s a shame, really. I love my garden.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Not that I’ve noticed, Doctor. My eyesight ain't been the best for years, you know? Always had to wear glasses. It's blurry sometimes, but that’s just… normal for me. Not any worse than usual, I don't think. I haven’t been readin’ much lately either, so I wouldn’t really notice, would I?
DOCTOR: Any family history of diabetes, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Hmm. My mother, her sister, she had something with sugar, a long time ago. She had to take medicine for it. But that was years and years ago, when we were just children. As for other conditions… my father, he had high blood pressure, but that was when he got older. I don't really know much about it, to be honest. We didn't talk about things like that much, back then. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a problem with any medicine before. I take a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that's it. Never had a rash, or any trouble breathin’, or nothin’. Just the arthritis medicine, when I need it. Is that alright? Should I be tellin' you what it is? I forget the name easy.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. And what about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, we eat a lot of ground provision, you know? Yams, dasheen, sweet potato. And fish, when my husband catches it. We grow some vegetables in the garden, like ochro and pumpkin. We try to eat healthy, but sometimes we have a little roti, or some doubles from the roadside. Not every day, but… a treat now and then. We don’t eat a lot of processed things, though. Mostly just fresh food. Is that good enough, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Can you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Here. Take your time. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated, 148 over 92. Pulse is 88 and regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper quadrant. No masses felt. Now, let’s check your feet. Some decreased sensation in your feet. Reflexes are diminished.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That don’t sound good, does it? What does all that mean, Doctor? My feet feel a little numb sometimes, but I thought it was just from standing too long in the garden. And my belly...tender? Is something wrong? I'm gettin' a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it’s possible you have early signs of diabetes, and possible neuropathy. Your elevated blood pressure is also a concern. We need to run some blood tests to confirm this, specifically a fasting blood glucose and an A1C test. I’m also going to order a complete metabolic panel to check your kidney function.
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, Lord. Like my auntie? That sounds…serious. What does that mean for me, Doctor? Will I have to take medicine? Will I be sick? And my kidneys? What’s wrong with my kidneys? I'm gettin' a little frightened now. I just want to know what's goin' on, and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s possible it's diabetes, but we need the tests to confirm. Diabetes, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications – heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, vision loss. It requires lifestyle changes – diet and exercise are essential. And yes, medication may be necessary, depending on the results. We'll discuss options if needed. As for your kidneys, the blood tests will tell us if they're functioning properly. Don't jump to conclusions. We'll address everything one step at a time. I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood now. She’ll explain the procedure. Then, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. One step at a time. That's what you said. I can do that. I guess. Lifestyle changes… diet and exercise. I can try. I do love my garden, maybe I can get more exercise there. But medicine… I don’t like the sound of medicine. But if I have to, I suppose I have to. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it ain’t too bad. Will the nurse tell me when I can eat again?
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain everything about fasting before the blood tests. And we'll discuss the results, and a plan, at your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you then. Next patient. .
