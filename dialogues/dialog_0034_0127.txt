DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schaust. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally, for a few months now. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little. It’s starting to bother me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness and drooping eyelids for a few months now. That is something we should look into. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's not… a sudden thing, you understand. It’s gradual. At first, I just felt a bit more tired than usual after work. But now… lifting things is harder. Even climbing the stairs, I have to pause sometimes. It's mostly in my arms and legs, I think. Not so much my hands, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Gradual onset, primarily in your arms and legs… and not affecting your hands as much. That’s helpful. And you mentioned your eyelids feeling heavy and drooping—have you noticed this happening consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty consistent, I’d say. It’s worse in the afternoon, definitely. Like they’re weighing me down. People haven’t said anything, but I feel like I’m squinting more to keep them open. And sometimes, my vision feels a bit blurry because of it, I suppose. It’s… a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. That sounds quite bothersome. We’ll certainly investigate this further. Before we move on, let's briefly touch on your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing serious, anyway. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox – but that was a long time ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a teenager playing football, but it healed perfectly fine. I haven’t been to the doctor for anything significant in… well, probably ten years, I'd guess. Just the occasional check-up.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history, just childhood illnesses and a healed wrist fracture. That’s good to know. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Just the wrist, and that didn’t require one. They just put it in a cast for a few weeks. Nothing else. I'm not a fan of hospitals, if I'm being honest. It… it makes me anxious, all the sterile smells and everything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schaust. Many people feel that way about hospitals. We'll do our best to keep things as comfortable as possible here. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—perhaps heart disease, diabetes, or any neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather on my father’s side, he had something with his memory, later in life. I don’t know the details, exactly. It wasn't Alzheimer's, but something similar, I believe. He needed a lot of care towards the end. And… my aunt on my mother’s side had rheumatoid arthritis, if that’s relevant? It's… difficult to recall everything, honestly. We weren't a family that talked a lot about health issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in your mother, a possible memory issue in your paternal grandfather, and rheumatoid arthritis in your maternal aunt. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a Facilities Manager, so I’m on my feet quite a bit during the day – checking buildings, doing inspections, that sort of thing. I live alone, since my divorce a few years ago. I… I try to eat healthy, but it’s sometimes difficult when you’re on your own. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner, maybe. I used to play football regularly, but I haven’t had much time for it lately. It’s mostly work, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schaust. That gives me a good picture of your background. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take antihistamines for hay fever when I was younger, but I haven’t needed them in years. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose. I don't usually have problems with anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication if I can. I've always tried to manage things on my own, if possible. Just… vitamins occasionally, during the winter months, maybe. But nothing regularly. I'm quite healthy, usually. That’s why this whole thing is so… concerning, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, thank you for providing me with all of this information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your muscle strength and reflexes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I understand it’s necessary. Please, go ahead. I'll do my best to cooperate. Just… let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m not very good with medical things, as you may have gathered.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go, and please do let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is 130/85, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s within the normal range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds are normal—no murmurs or irregularities. Your lungs are clear—no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can squeeze quite hard, I think. I used to be quite strong, playing football. Not so much these days, unfortunately. It takes more effort than it used to.
DOCTOR: Good. Your grip strength is…slightly diminished compared to what I'd expect for someone your age and build, but not significantly. Now, can you please push against my hands with your arms?
PATIENT: I'm trying my best. It feels… a little harder than it used to, I must admit. My arms do feel a bit… fatigued already, actually. It's not usually like this. I suppose that's why I came to see you. It’s… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. We're getting some information here. Now, can you please lift your legs against my resistance?
PATIENT: It’s… definitely harder than it used to be. Especially my thighs. They feel… weak. I'm trying my best, but it's… a struggle. It feels like I'm wading through water, somehow. It’s a strange sensation. And… it’s tiring. Really tiring. I hope this isn’t anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. You are doing very well. Your reflexes are normal, and your sensory function is intact. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary physical exam, you’re experiencing generalized weakness and ptosis—the drooping of your eyelids. This combination of symptoms, along with your age and gradual onset, raises some concerns about a possible neuromuscular condition. However, it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. To investigate this further, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your weakness. I also recommend an electromyography and nerve conduction study to assess the function of your muscles and nerves. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An EMG and nerve conduction study… that sounds… complicated. And probably unpleasant. But… if it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, I suppose so. I’d rather know, even if the news isn't good. Blood tests are fine, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I want to get to the bottom of this. It's been worrying me a lot. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be resting? Avoiding any strenuous activity?
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Mr. Schaust. The EMG and nerve conduction study are a bit uncomfortable, but they provide valuable information. We'll do our best to make you comfortable during the procedure. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity. Rest is a good idea, but gentle exercise, like walking, is fine as long as it doesn't exacerbate your symptoms. Pay attention to your body and stop if you feel fatigued or your weakness worsens. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist, who is a specialist in neuromuscular disorders. They will be able to interpret the results of the tests and develop a treatment plan if necessary. I’m going to write up the orders for the blood tests and the neurology referral now. It may take a few days to get an appointment with the neurologist. The lab results will take a few days as well. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll… I’ll try to rest and avoid overdoing it. And I’ll wait for my nurse to contact me. Thank you for your time. And thank you for taking me seriously. It’s… it’s been a relief to finally talk to someone about this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could help. It’s always important to address your concerns, and we’ll work together to get to the bottom of this. Here are the orders for your blood tests and the referral to the neurologist. Please let my nurse know if you have any trouble scheduling the appointment or have any questions about the tests. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to contact us if anything changes. Have a good day, Mr. Schaust.
PATIENT: .
