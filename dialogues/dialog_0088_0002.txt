DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Um… well, it’s a little hard to explain. It’s… going to the bathroom. It’s not easy, you see? Not like it used to be. It takes a long time, and sometimes… sometimes it just doesn’t want to go. I don’t know why. It's just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. That's perfectly alright, take your time. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination – needing to strain, feeling like you don’t empty completely, or perhaps taking a long time to start?
PATIENT: Oh, straining… yes, that's it! A lot of pushing. And it feels like… like there’s still some left in there, even after I’m done. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It does take a long time to start, too. I used to just… go. Now I have to… wait. And wait. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, honestly. My husband says I spend too long in the bathroom. He jokes, but… it is a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, Ms. Stoffregen, but it’s important we talk about these things. It’s quite common, especially as we get older. So, straining, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and difficulty starting – those are all helpful details. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… pee? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I don’t know. It looks… yellow, I think? Like it always has. Maybe a little darker sometimes? I don’t really pay much attention, to be honest. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you see. I don’t think I’ve seen any blood or anything scary like that. Just… yellow. Is yellow bad? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: No, yellow is perfectly normal, Ms. Stoffregen. A slightly darker yellow can just mean you’re a little dehydrated. We'll keep that in mind. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain, exactly. More like… a little discomfort? A sort of… ache, low down? It’s not sharp, and it doesn’t last long. It's just… not comfortable. Especially when I'm trying to… push. I don't know if that makes sense. It's hard to describe. And it doesn't happen every time. Sometimes it's fine, sometimes it's a little… off.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. Discomfort and a low ache when straining are definitely important to note. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a good question. Let me think… My husband always handles the doctor things. I… I had a bad hip a few years back, they fixed it with a new one. That was good. And I have a little trouble with my blood pressure, the doctor keeps an eye on that. And… oh! Arthritis, in my hands mostly. It makes it hard to do things sometimes. I don't know if any of that is important. I get so confused with all the different doctors and pills. Do you want me to keep going?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do, Ms. Stoffregen. All of that is helpful. A history of hip replacement, high blood pressure, and arthritis – those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Do you know what medications you take for your blood pressure and arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's where I get really lost. Little white pills, mostly. And a pink one, I think. My husband fills the little boxes every week. I just… take them. He tells me when. I don’t know the names, I’m sorry. I tried to remember once, but it just… slipped my mind. I have a lot on my mind these days. I can ask my husband later, if that's alright? He's very good with those things. He keeps a list.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. We can certainly get the list from your husband. It’s very common for patients to not remember medication names. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I used to get hay fever when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. I don't think that counts. I've never been told I was allergic to anything by a doctor. I hope that makes sense. It's just… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Stoffregen. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and do a gentle exam of your lower area. It will help me understand what's going on a little better. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, alright, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. I haven't had one in a while. Just… be gentle, please? My skin is a little thin these days. And… I’m a bit ticklish, if you're poking around too much. But yes, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm not feeling any obvious masses or tenderness in your abdomen. Your bladder feels a little full, which is expected. I do feel some mild discomfort when I press on your lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may have an overactive bladder with some difficulty emptying. It's common as we age. We can do some simple tests, like a urine sample to rule out infection and a post-void residual to see how much urine you’re leaving in your bladder after you go. Would you be comfortable with those?
PATIENT: Oh, tests. Alright, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. I don’t mind a little poke if it helps. A urine sample… yes, I can do that. And… a post-void… what was it? Something about what’s left over? Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you need. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom without all the… fuss. Is it going to be painful? I hope not. I don't like needles, you see.
DOCTOR: No, the post-void residual doesn’t involve a needle. It’s just a quick ultrasound after you urinate to measure how much urine is left in your bladder. The urine sample is just that - a sample in a cup. Not painful at all. Let’s start with the urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. Then we'll have you go to the bathroom and we'll do the ultrasound. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… much better. No needles, that’s good. A cup and… going to the bathroom. Yes, I can do that. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll try my best. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so maybe someone could help me find the bathroom? And… is there anything special I need to do with the cup? Should I… stir it or something? I just want to make sure I do it right.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll have a nurse escort you to the bathroom and help you with the sample. You don't need to stir it or do anything special! Just a clean catch – meaning try to collect the urine mid-stream, after you’ve been flowing for a few seconds. The nurse will explain it to you thoroughly. Just relax, and we’ll take it one step at a time. While we’re waiting for the nurse, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. A nurse, that’s good. I always forget things. And no, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… thank you. For being so patient with an old woman. It’s just… a bit embarrassing to talk about these things, you know? But you make it easier. Yes, thank you. I think I’m ready when the nurse comes. Just… a little nervous, that’s all. But thank you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little nervous, and you’re not alone in this. It’s my job to make you feel comfortable, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Nurse Patel, could you please assist Ms. Stoffregen with a urine sample and then perform a post-void residual ultrasound?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, alright. Whatever the nurse says, I’ll do it. I’m ready when you are. Thank you both for being so kind. I think… I think that’s all I can do for now. Just let me know what to do, and I’ll try my best. Yes. Thank you.
