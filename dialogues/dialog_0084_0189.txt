DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my… well, my bathroom habits, really. Not something a man likes to talk about, but here we are. I noticed some… red in the stool. Blood-streaked, the nurse called it. Not a pleasant sight, I can tell you that. And it's not like I'm eating beets or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom, I understand. It's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable discussing this, but it’s good you’re getting it checked out. Blood in the stool is something we definitely want to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigate, eh? Sounds serious. Honestly, I haven't paid that much attention. I'm eighty-eight years old! Things happen. But, alright, alright. It was… yesterday, I think. Maybe the day before. Doesn't matter. It wasn't a huge amount, mind you. Just… streaks. Bright red. And it didn't hurt, not exactly. More… a surprise, really. I just… saw it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a surprise. And bright red, so that's helpful to know. It is good you're getting it checked out. We want to rule out anything serious. Now, has this happened before?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute. You’re making it sound like I'm falling apart here! I haven't been that sick, you know. And no, it hasn't happened before. Not that I recall, anyway. I’ve had the usual… things. A bit of constipation now and then, but nothing… alarming. This is new. And frankly, a bit upsetting. I used to fly those big jets, you know. Always in top condition. This feels… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I came across as alarming. It's good you’ve generally been in good health. We just want to be thorough. Okay, so this is a new symptom for you. And you said you've had some constipation occasionally?
PATIENT: Yes, occasional. Not a regular thing. Just when I… well, don't eat enough roughage, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me to eat more fruit. Always nagging. But I’ve been flying all my life, eating whatever's put in front of me. Never bothered me before. And this isn’t constipation, not exactly. It was… normal, then that. Just a shock, I tell you. A shock. And it’s not something a man discusses lightly, even with a doctor.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s not an easy topic to discuss. Okay. And just to clarify, when you say “normal”, was the stool itself a normal consistency for you before you noticed the blood?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, perfectly normal. Firm, you know? Not too hard, not too soft. What is with all the questions about my… output? I mean, I’m a retired airline pilot, not a… a plumber! I've dealt with complicated machinery, navigated storms, but this… this is ridiculous. Look, I just want to know if it’s serious. Is it cancer? My brother, he… well, never mind. Is that what you’re trying to figure out?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your frustration and I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable. We are trying to figure out what’s going on, and yes, we need to consider all possibilities, including cancer, but that doesn’t mean we’re jumping to conclusions. It’s important to rule things out systematically. I want to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Now you want to poke at me? Honestly! Alright, alright. Do what you have to do, I suppose. Just be quick about it. And no unnecessary prodding, if you don’t mind. I’m a bit… sensitive, you see. And don't tell me it's nothing if it is something. I want the truth, even if it's unpleasant. And I expect a clear explanation, none of that doctor jargon. I flew those planes for forty years, I can understand complicated things. Just… be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. I promise to be as gentle and respectful as possible, and I'll explain everything in plain language. I will absolutely be honest with you. First, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re getting into history? At my age, it's a long one! Let me think… high blood pressure, years ago. They put me on a pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t like the side effects. And my knees are shot, of course. Flying so much, getting in and out of planes… arthritis, the doctor said. Otherwise, pretty good for my age. I used to walk five miles a day. Not so much lately, though. And I had my appendix out when I was a boy. Does that count? Honestly, I can't remember everything. It's been eighty-eight years, you know. A lot happens.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure, arthritis, and appendix removal. And you stopped taking the blood pressure medication due to side effects?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Made me feel… dizzy. And tired. My daughter, she kept after me about it, said I was risking a stroke. But I felt worse on the pills than off them. I’ve always been a strong man, you see? Didn’t like feeling weak. Besides, I always had good check-ups. The company doctors, they said I was in perfect health. Right up until I retired. Then everything started to… creak. And now this. Blood in the stool. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've had the high blood pressure in the past, but you stopped taking medication for it. And you haven't had any other major medical issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. A few colds, the flu now and then. But nothing that kept me down for long. I always bounced back. My daughter worries too much. She’s a nurse, you see? Always reading about terrible diseases. Makes a man nervous, all that information. I just want to know if this is something serious, doctor. Is it… life-threatening? That’s what I need to know. None of this talk about history and pills. Just the truth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your anxiety, and I appreciate you being direct with me. I promise we'll get to the bottom of this. Now, before we move on to the exam, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, not that I know of. I used to eat anything put in front of me. Never had a reaction. Not to shellfish, not to peanuts, not to anything. I've travelled all over the world, eaten all sorts of strange foods. Didn't bother me. My daughter says I should be careful, but I've never had a problem. Honestly, I think she just likes to worry. But alright, alright. I can't think of anything. No allergies. Now, can we get this over with? I'm starting to feel… exposed. This whole thing is undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, that's good to know. Now, one last question before the exam. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like aspirin or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Now you're asking about pills again? Honestly! No. No pills. Absolutely nothing. Haven't taken anything regularly in years. Maybe a pain reliever now and then for my knees, but that's it. And not even regularly, just when they really bother me. I try to avoid them, though. Don't like the way they make me feel. I prefer to tough it out. Look, is this exam going to be… invasive? I need to know. I'm an old man, doctor. I have some dignity left, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concerns completely. The exam will involve a brief abdominal examination and a rectal exam, which is necessary to help determine the source of the bleeding. I will explain everything as I go and make sure you are as comfortable as possible. We will proceed at your pace. Are you ready to proceed, or would you like a moment to think about it?
PATIENT: Rectal exam, eh? Well… I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? If you want to find out what’s going on. But be quick about it, and be gentle. And no unnecessary poking! I’ve lived a long life, seen a lot of things, but… this isn't exactly something a man looks forward to. Alright, alright. Let's get it over with. But I warn you, I'm not a fan of being… violated. And explain everything, like you promised. Don’t just start poking without warning. I'm a retired airline pilot, not some… patient. Now, get on with it. But be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I’ll explain each step before I do it. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I’ll gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Finally, I’ll perform a rectal exam. This involves inserting a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to check for any abnormalities. It may be uncomfortable, but I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort at any time. I’m listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds normal so far.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds normal, you say? Good. Now, get on with the poking. I’m bracing myself, I can tell you that. And don't take too long. I haven’t got all day, you know. And try to remember I’m a retired airline pilot. I'm used to being in control of things. This whole situation is… unsettling. Just get it over with, and tell me what you find. And be gentle! Very, very gentle. I’m warning you.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m gently pressing on your abdomen now. Do you feel any tenderness or pain in any particular area?
PATIENT: A little… right there. Just a dull ache, really. Not sharp, not terrible. It’s been there on and off for a few days, now that I think about it. I just figured it was my age. Creaky joints, creaky insides… It’s not unexpected, you know. But it doesn’t hurt, not unless you press on it. And it’s not constant. Just… there. Is that bad? Don’t tell me it’s cancer. My brother… never mind. Is it serious? That’s what I want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your lower right abdomen, that's helpful to know. It’s not constant and it’s not sharp. We’ll investigate further. Now, I’m going to perform the rectal exam. I’ll explain each step as I go. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort at any time. It may be uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Do you want me to count to three before I begin?
PATIENT: Three, I suppose. Might as well get it over with quickly. And please, be careful. I haven't… done this in a while. And don't poke around too much. Just a quick look, that's all I ask. This whole thing is… degrading. A retired airline pilot, subjected to this… Honestly! Three, then. Get on with it. But be gentle! Very, very gentle. I’m warning you again. And tell me if you see anything… unpleasant. But I don’t want too many details, if you don't mind. Just a quick assessment, that's all. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum now. This may cause some discomfort, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll be assessing the area for any abnormalities. I’m feeling the muscles and the lining of your rectum now. I’m checking for any masses, tenderness, or any signs of blood. Okay, I’ve completed the exam. I’m cleaning up now. I did feel a small, firm mass in your lower rectum. It wasn’t particularly painful to the touch. There was also a small amount of old blood on my glove. That likely explains the streaks you noticed. It's important to investigate this further. Based on my findings, I recommend a colonoscopy to determine the nature of the mass and rule out any serious conditions. It is possible it is a benign polyp or hemorrhoid, but we need to be thorough.
PATIENT: A mass? A colonoscopy? You mean… it could be cancer? I knew it! I just knew it! My brother… he… oh, this is terrible. A colonoscopy… that sounds… invasive. And painful. What does it involve? And what if it is cancer? What are my options? I’m eighty-eight years old, doctor. Do I really need to go through all this? Maybe it’s just a hemorrhoid. Maybe it will go away on its own. I don't want to be poked and prodded and… and have them tell me I’m going to die. Just tell me straight. Is it cancer? And if it is, what can be done? I need to know. Now. Don’t sugarcoat it. Just tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your anxiety, and I want to be as honest and clear as possible. A colonoscopy involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera attached into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It allows us to identify any abnormalities, such as polyps or masses, and take a biopsy for further analysis. It is the gold standard for diagnosing colon cancer. At this point, it’s too early to say definitively whether it’s cancer. The mass could be benign, such as a polyp or hemorrhoid. However, the presence of blood requires us to investigate further to rule out any serious conditions. If it is cancer, the treatment options depend on the stage and location of the cancer. They can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these therapies. The goal of treatment is to remove the cancer and prevent it from spreading. I understand that you’re 88 years old and may not want to undergo extensive treatment. We will discuss all of your options and make a decision that’s right for you, based on your health and preferences. It’s important to remember that many people live long and fulfilling lives even after being diagnosed with colon cancer, especially when it’s detected early. Right now, the most important thing is to schedule a colonoscopy to get a definitive diagnosis. We will provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision. Would you like me to explain the colonoscopy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain the procedure. Yes. In detail. And what are the risks? I’ve flown enough missions to know there’s always risk involved. What are the chances it will hurt? And what if they find something… bad? Will I be in pain afterwards? And how long will I be in the hospital? I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in a hospital bed. I’ve lived a good life, seen a lot of the world. I don't want to end it like that. Just tell me everything. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And be honest. I can handle it. I'm a retired airline pilot. I’ve faced worse things than this. But I need to know what I’m getting into. Now, tell me. In detail. And don't leave anything out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I will explain the colonoscopy procedure in as much detail as possible, and I won't leave anything out. The colonoscopy procedure typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You will be given intravenous sedation to help you relax and minimize discomfort. This means you’ll likely be drowsy and may not remember much of the procedure afterwards. You will lie on your left side with your knees bent. A long, flexible tube with a camera attached – the colonoscope – will be gently inserted into your rectum. The colonoscope will be advanced through your entire colon, allowing me to visualize the lining of your colon. If any polyps or abnormalities are found, they will be removed during the procedure using small instruments passed through the colonoscope. This is called a polypectomy. Small biopsies may also be taken for further analysis. The most common risks of a colonoscopy are mild and include bloating, gas, and abdominal cramping. These symptoms usually resolve within a few hours to a day. More serious, but rare, complications include bleeding from the polypectomy site, perforation of the colon, and reaction to the sedation. The risk of perforation is less than 1 in 1,000, and the risk of serious bleeding is also very low. After the procedure, you will be monitored in the recovery area until the sedation wears off. You may experience some bloating and gas, but this usually resolves quickly. You will be able to eat and drink normally, and you should be able to return home the same day. We will discuss the results of the procedure with you and schedule any necessary follow-up appointments. If the biopsy results show cancer, we will discuss the treatment options with you in detail. This may include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. The goal of treatment is to remove the cancer and prevent it from spreading. We will work with you to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs and preferences. I understand that this is a lot of information to take in, and you may have many questions. I’m here to answer any questions you have and to provide you with the support you need. We will proceed at your own pace, and we will make sure you are comfortable with every step of the process. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Perforation… that sounds… bad. And bleeding? I’ve never had surgery before. I don't like the sound of any of this. But you said it’s possible it’s just a polyp. A benign polyp. What are the chances of that? Be honest. What’s the most likely scenario? Don't sugarcoat it. I need to know what I’m facing. And what happens if they find cancer? What’s the treatment like? Is it… painful? And how long would I be in the hospital? I don't want to spend the rest of my days hooked up to machines. I’ve had a good life, seen the world. I just want to know… what are my chances? And what’s the worst-case scenario? Tell me everything. Now. Don't leave anything out. I need to know what I’m facing. I’m a retired airline pilot. I’ve faced worse things than this, but I need to be prepared. Tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your anxiety and your need to be prepared. I will be completely honest with you, even if it's difficult to hear. Let’s start with the chances of it being a benign polyp. Based on the information we have right now, it’s difficult to say for sure, but the most likely scenario is that it is a benign polyp. Polyps are very common, especially in people over the age of 50. Many polyps are harmless and don’t cause any symptoms. However, it’s important to remember that some polyps can become cancerous over time. That’s why it’s so important to have a colonoscopy to remove the polyp and have it analyzed by a pathologist. The worst-case scenario is that the biopsy results show cancer. If this happens, we will discuss the treatment options with you in detail. The treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer, its location, and your overall health. The most common treatment for colon cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tumor. This may involve removing a portion of the colon or the entire colon, depending on the location and size of the tumor. In some cases, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be recommended before or after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. The surgery can be painful, but we will provide you with pain medication to manage your discomfort. The length of your hospital stay will depend on the type of surgery you have and your overall health. Typically, patients stay in the hospital for 5 to 7 days after surgery. The treatment can also have side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and changes in bowel habits. We will provide you with medication to manage these side effects. It's important to remember that many people live long and fulfilling lives even after being diagnosed with colon cancer, especially when it's detected early. We will work with you to develop a treatment plan that minimizes side effects and maximizes your quality of life. I understand that this is a lot of information to take in, and you may have many questions. I’m here to answer any questions you have and to provide you with the support you need. We will proceed at your own pace, and we will make sure you are comfortable with every step of the process. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Well… that’s… a lot to take in. Cancer… it's a frightening word. Surgery… pain… side effects… it all sounds… unpleasant. But you said many people live long lives even after being diagnosed. What’s the… success rate? Be honest. What are my chances of… surviving? And what if I don’t have surgery? What happens then? Will the cancer just… grow? And how long would I have? I need to know. I’m an old man, but I still have some life left in me. I want to know what I’m facing. And what’s the first step? What do we do now? Schedule a colonoscopy? What does that involve? Do I have to… prepare? I don’t like the sound of that. Tell me everything. Now. Don't leave anything out. I need to know what I’m getting into. I’m a retired airline pilot. I’ve faced worse things than this, but I need to be prepared. Tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Rowbottom, it is frightening, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. You’re asking very important questions, and I will answer them as honestly as possible. Let’s talk about the success rate. The survival rate for colon cancer depends on the stage of the cancer when it’s diagnosed. If it’s diagnosed early, before it has spread, the 5-year survival rate is around 90%. This means that 90% of people who are diagnosed with early-stage colon cancer will be alive five years after diagnosis. The survival rate decreases as the stage of the cancer increases. If you don’t have surgery, the cancer will likely continue to grow and spread. This can lead to serious complications, such as bowel obstruction, bleeding, and abdominal pain. It can also spread to other parts of the body, making treatment more difficult. The prognosis for colon cancer that is not treated is very poor. The first step is to schedule a colonoscopy. This will allow us to visualize your colon and take a biopsy of the polyp to determine if it’s cancerous. The colonoscopy preparation is not pleasant, but it’s necessary to ensure a clear view of your colon. You’ll need to follow a special diet for a few days before the procedure and take a laxative to clean out your colon. The laxative will cause you to have frequent bowel movements, and you’ll need to stay close to a bathroom. It’s important to stay hydrated during the preparation to prevent dehydration. The colonoscopy procedure itself is usually painless, as you’ll be given sedation to help you relax. You may experience some bloating and gas after the procedure, but this usually resolves quickly. I understand that this is a lot to take in, and you may have many questions. I’m here to answer any questions you have and to provide you with the support you need. We will proceed at your own pace, and we will make sure you are comfortable with every step of the process. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Bloating and gas… that sounds… unpleasant. And a special diet… and laxatives… frequent bowel movements… This whole thing sounds… awful. But you said it's necessary to get a clear view. Alright. I suppose I have no choice. Schedule the colonoscopy. But… how long does the preparation take? And what exactly does the diet involve? Can I still drink water? And what if… what if I can't tolerate the laxatives? Will they still do the procedure? And… what happens during the procedure? Will I be awake? Will it hurt? I need to know everything. Now. Don't leave anything out. I’m a retired airline pilot. I need to be prepared for anything. Tell me the truth. And… can I get a referral to a good surgeon, just in case? I want to be ready. Just in case. Tell me everything. Now.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask all these questions, Mr. Rowbottom. It's good to be prepared. Let's go through everything step by step. The colonoscopy preparation usually takes about 24 hours. You’ll need to follow a clear liquid diet for the entire day before the procedure. This means no solid foods, and you can only drink clear liquids like water, broth, clear juice, and gelatin. No red or purple liquids are allowed, as they can be mistaken for blood during the procedure. You can drink water as much as you need to stay hydrated. You’ll also need to take a laxative the evening before the procedure and again in the morning. The laxative will cause you to have frequent bowel movements, which will empty your colon. If you can't tolerate the laxatives, it may be possible to reschedule the procedure. However, it's important to try to tolerate them as much as possible, as a clean colon is essential for a successful procedure. If you’re having trouble tolerating the laxative, let me know, and we can discuss other options. During the procedure, you’ll lie on your left side with your knees bent. You’ll be given sedation to help you relax, and you may not remember much of the procedure. A long, flexible tube with a camera attached will be gently inserted into your rectum and advanced through your colon. The doctor will visualize your colon and take a biopsy if necessary. The procedure itself is usually painless, as you’ll be given sedation. You may experience some bloating and gas after the procedure, but this usually resolves quickly. I can absolutely provide you with a referral to a good surgeon, just in case. I’ll write a referral for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected colorectal surgeon. Here is her contact information. She's excellent and will take good care of you, if needed. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance… good. It's good to have a plan. And the sedation… that's reassuring. I suppose I can handle the diet and the laxatives. It sounds… unpleasant, but necessary. And the bloating and gas… I’ve had worse. Alright. Schedule the colonoscopy. And… can you give me a written list of instructions for the preparation? I want to be sure I follow everything correctly. And… how long will the procedure take? And when will I know the results? Will I have to wait a long time? I’m an old man, doctor. I don’t have a lot of time to waste. Just give me the written instructions. And tell me how long the procedure will take. And when I’ll know the results. That’s all. Just the instructions, the procedure time, and the results timeline. Now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I completely understand. Here is a written list of instructions for the colonoscopy preparation. Colonoscopy Preparation Instructions 24 Hours Before Procedure: Follow a clear liquid diet. No solid foods. Clear Liquids Allowed: Water, broth, clear juice , gelatin , clear sports drinks. Medications: Discuss all medications with your doctor. Laxative: Take the laxative as directed. Transportation: Arrange for someone to drive you home after the procedure. The colonoscopy procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You will be monitored in the recovery area for about an hour after the procedure. The results of the biopsy usually take 3 to 5 business days to come back from the lab. I will call you as soon as I have the results. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. I suppose I’ll… schedule the colonoscopy. And… I’ll follow the instructions carefully. And… I’ll wait for your call. Thank you again. I… I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: .
