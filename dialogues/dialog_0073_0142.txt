DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning, Doctor. Right, well… headaches, mostly. Been gettin' them on and off for a bit now. They're… bad ones, when they come. And I get kinda sweaty, and my heart races a bit, too. Honestly, it's a bit fuzzy trying to remember exactly when they started, but it feels like a while.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “A while” isn’t terribly helpful, unfortunately. But we’ll get there. Sweaty, racing heart… and these are bad headaches. Can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry, I know, not very specific. It's just… hard to pin down. They feel like… a really tight band around my head, mostly. Like someone’s squeezing. Sometimes it’s just on one side, other times it's all over. And it's a throbbing kind of pain, if that makes sense? Not like a constant ache, more… pulse-y. I don't know if that helps.
DOCTOR: Throbbing, band-like… alright. And do you notice anything before these headaches start?
PATIENT: Before…? Now you're askin'. Not really, not that I can recall. Sometimes I feel a bit… off, I guess. Like I'm comin' down with somethin', but then it just turns into the headache. And sometimes… no, honestly, sometimes there’s no warnin' at all. Just bam, headache. It's pretty random, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Random, no warning… frustrating, I can imagine. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Worse…? Not that I’ve really figured out. I mean, stress probably doesn't help, but… I work a pretty physical job, so there's always some stress. Bright lights maybe? I haven’t paid that much attention, to be honest. I mostly just try to lie down when one hits. It's… hard to focus on figuring out what causes 'em when your head's poundin'.
DOCTOR: Right, lying down is sensible. And the physical job… is that new, or have you been doing that for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been a couple of years now, I think. Factory work, mostly. It's not… glamorous, but it pays the bills. Before that… I did a bit of everything, really. Construction, landscaping… nothing stuck for long. And the divorce… that was a bit stressful too, comin' right before I started the factory job. Does that matter? I don't know if that would have anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: Divorce… yes, that certainly could be a contributing factor. We’ll get there. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your vision with these headaches?
PATIENT: Nausea… sometimes. Not usually vomitin', thankfully. Just feelin' kinda sick to my stomach. And… yeah, actually. Now that you mention it, my vision gets a bit blurry sometimes during the headache. Like there’s… spots in front of my eyes. It doesn't last long, just when the pain's really bad. I figured it was just from strainin' my eyes, maybe.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, spots… alright. Do you have any family history of headaches, migraines, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mum used to get headaches, pretty bad ones, but I don't know if they were anything like these. She just always said she had a "sensitive head." And my grandad… he had somethin' wrong with his nerves, I think. But I don't really know the details. We weren't really close, and nobody ever talked much about it. Sorry, I'm not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: Right. That’s alright. Let's move on to some basics. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I don't take any medication regularly, apart from the occasional painkiller for these headaches, obviously. Just whatever's over-the-counter. Paracetamol, ibuprofen, that sort of thing. Doesn't always help, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… I used to drink, a bit. Not much anymore, not really. Haven't touched a cigarette in years. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been my thing. I'm not much of a partier, to be honest. Just tryin' to get by, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Lawther, I think we have enough information for a basic assessment. I’m going to perform a quick neurological exam. Just follow my instructions, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. Sounds good. Whatever you need me to do, just let me know. Hopefully it's nothin' too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Good. Now look to your left… and to your right. Excellent. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? I don't wanna squeeze too hard, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m not very strong, to be honest. Mostly just use my hands for work.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine. Just a normal strength is sufficient. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Relax your leg, please. And the other side. Good. Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, no problem. Just a bit rusty, haven't been walkin' much lately. Like this? Is that alright? I sometimes feel a bit clumsy when I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. Slightly unsteady, as you said, but nothing too concerning. And finally, I’m going to check your pupils. Just look straight ahead. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Alright, Mr. Lawther. Based on your symptoms and this brief examination, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. However, given the throbbing headaches, associated nausea, visual disturbances, and your history, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be tension headaches, but the symptoms suggest migraine is more likely. It's also important to rule out other causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check for any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a CT scan of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Is that… serious? I mean, is it somethin' bad? I'm not really good with hospitals, to be honest. I just thought it was bad headaches, that's all. Blood tests are okay, I guess. But a scan sounds… scary. What exactly are we lookin' for? And how much is all this gonna cost? I don't have insurance, so… I'm a bit worried about the money, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lawther. A CT scan is a precautionary measure, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It simply allows us to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your brain and rule out any rare, but potentially serious causes for your headaches. We're looking for things like tumors, aneurysms, or any other structural abnormalities. However, I want to stress again, these are unlikely. As for the cost, I completely understand your worry, especially without insurance. Let me see… A CT scan in this area typically costs around $300-500, and the blood tests will be another $100-200. I can also see if the hospital offers a financial assistance program or a payment plan. Would you like me to look into that for you?
PATIENT: $500… Wow. That's… a lot of money. I don't know if I can afford that, to be honest. I'm barely makin' ends meet as it is. A payment plan would be good, if possible. And the financial assistance program… yeah, please look into that. I really appreciate it. I just want to get this sorted, you know? I can't keep havin' these headaches, it's affectin' my work. Is there… anything else we can do? Like, is the scan absolutely necessary? Could we try somethin' else first? Maybe some medication? I don't know… I’m just a bit overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I understand your concerns about the cost, truly. However, as a physician, my primary responsibility is to ensure you receive the appropriate care, and that includes ruling out serious possibilities. We can try medication to manage the symptoms, but that simply masks the problem. If there is something serious going on, delaying proper diagnosis could have significant consequences. I would never recommend a test without a reason, and in your case, given the associated symptoms, it’s a prudent step. We can discuss a payment plan and explore the financial assistance program, absolutely. And while we wait for those details, I can prescribe a medication to help manage the headache pain. It's a low-dose triptan, often used for migraines. However, it's not a long-term solution, and it won't address the underlying cause. I'm now sending the order for the blood tests and the CT scan to the lab and radiology department. In the meantime, here's the prescription for the triptan. If the headaches worsen or if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, weakness, or confusion, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. I understand. Emergency room… right. And the triptan… I’ll try it. I guess I don't really have much choice, do I? I just… I don’t like hospitals, and I don’t like the idea of all these tests. But you’re the doctor, I suppose. Okay. So, what happens now? Do I just… go and get the blood tests done? And then… schedule the scan? And how long will that take? I need to work, you know, I can’t just be takin’ time off all the time. This is… a lot. I'm really worried about the money, and I’m worried about what the scan might find. Sorry. I’m probably just bein’ silly.
DOCTOR: You’re not being silly, Mr. Lawther, but worrying excessively won’t help. The blood tests can be done at any local lab, I can provide a requisition form. It should take about 15-20 minutes. As for the CT scan, the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. They are usually quite accommodating with work schedules. Here’s the requisition form for the blood tests. I'll also have my receptionist give you the contact information for the radiology department. Try to schedule the scan as soon as possible, so we can get a definitive diagnosis and start appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any known headache triggers. And remember, if anything changes, or if you develop new symptoms, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. We'll discuss the results once we have them. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I mean, I’m still worried, but… I guess I just need to get it done. Thank you… for everything. And for tryin’ to explain everything. I’m really grateful. I’ll go and get the blood tests done, and I’ll try and schedule the scan as soon as I can. …I hope it’s nothing serious.
