DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife, she want… a baby, maybe? She think it good time. I… I not so sure what I tell you. It been long time since… this talk. We just want to make sure everything okay, you know? For baby, for her.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you and your wife are considering starting a family, and you’d like a check-up to ensure everything is healthy before proceeding?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that right. Check-up good. I… I make little things. Metal, plastic. Model. But body… body I not so good at making! She say I old, maybe not strong enough. But I feel… okay. Most days.
DOCTOR: That’s very understandable, Mr. Carlotta. It's always wise to ensure everything is in good working order, and age is certainly not the sole determinant of health. We'll do a thorough assessment to get a clear picture of your current health status. To start, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… hmm. Long time ago. I remember… hospital when I little boy. Sick, very sick. But that Somalia, long, long time ago. After that… not much. Work hard, eat food, sleep. No big problem. Maybe some aches, you know? Old man aches. Nothing… serious. I have Medicare, if that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is very helpful, thank you. It’s good to know. So, to clarify, you haven't had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations since childhood in Somalia?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Nothing I remember. Maybe doctor in… America? When I first come. Just check-up. Shots, I think. But nothing… bad. I work with metal, sometimes cut myself, little things. But always clean, always fix. Nothing serious, I promise. My wife… she worry too much.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been quite fortunate with your health, Mr. Carlotta. It’s good you’ve been proactive with care when needed. And it’s wonderful that your wife cares so much. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No, I don't believe so. Never need cut open. Maybe teeth, when I young? But small, very small. Not big surgery. Just fix teeth. That all. I not a surgery man. I fix things outside body, not inside.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… I have wife, Aisha. Wonderful woman. Children… I had brothers and sisters, in Somalia. Long time ago. Not see them since… many years. Very sad. Aisha, she my family now. We have no children yet, that why we here. She worry about… if I too old to have strong baby.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of you both to consider all aspects of starting a family. Family history can be helpful, and while it’s understandable to be concerned, many factors contribute to a healthy pregnancy. We can certainly discuss some potential considerations. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family—perhaps heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. That… hard to say. My mother… she get sick when I young. Not know what sickness. Just… weak. And father, he strong man, work hard, but maybe heart… I not sure. No doctor for them, you know? Just… old age. No talk of… diabetes, high blood pressure. Just… life hard. Aisha's family… she say her grandfather have something with… sugar? But she not remember. Long time ago for her too. I sorry I not have better answer.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It’s common for medical histories to be incomplete, especially when families don’t have access to consistent healthcare. We'll proceed with what we have. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medicine. I not like medicine. Make me feel… funny. Sometimes, Aisha give me… little pills for my knee. When it ache bad. But just sometimes. Not every day. She buy them at… store. For old people. I forget what name. Just small white pill. Otherwise, no. I try to stay healthy. Eat good food, work in garden. No need much medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. We may want to discuss those knee pills later, just to be sure they aren’t interacting with anything should we need to prescribe something in the future. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don't think so. Aisha say I eat anything. She cook everything! Sometimes I itch a little, maybe from… dust? I work in garden, you know. But not bad. Not take medicine for it. Just… itch. No big problem. I don't think I allergic to anything. Never have bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Carlotta, we’ve covered a lot of important information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll just check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your general health. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that okay. You check, you listen. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. Aisha say good doctor is important. You seem like good doctor. Go ahead. I ready.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. I appreciate your trust. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll get started. I’m noting everything as we go. It’s good that your heart and lungs sound clear. I did note some tenderness in both knees and some swelling. That may be contributing to your wife’s concerns. Would you mind if I order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, okay. If you think it good. Aisha always say blood tell everything. Knees… yes, they bother me sometimes. Especially when it cold. I try to ignore it. Old man knees, you know? But… if you think it important, do blood work. Whatever you need to make sure baby strong. Is something wrong, Doctor? You look… worried.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Carlotta, I’m not worried, not at all. It’s just standard procedure to get a complete picture of your health before proceeding. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying issues and ensure you are in the best possible condition. We'll check your blood count, kidney and liver function, cholesterol, and some other important markers. It’s good that you're proactive about your health. The blood work will give us a much clearer picture, and then we can discuss potential next steps. We may also want to consider an X-ray of your knees to assess the extent of any arthritis. But let’s start with the blood work first. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: X-ray… hmm. Aisha might want that. She always worried about bones. If you think it good, we do X-ray. But blood first, yes? That make sense. No… I don't think so. No questions right now. Just… hoping everything okay. Hoping baby strong. You think… you think I too old for baby? Aisha she worry…
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, age is certainly a factor to consider, but it’s not the sole determinant of a healthy pregnancy. Many men in their 70s and beyond father healthy children. We'll assess your overall health through the blood work and other tests, and then we can discuss your specific situation and potential risks and benefits. It's wonderful that you and your wife are considering this together. We'll do everything we can to support you both. I’ll write the order for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw a few vials of blood, and the results should be back within a few days. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sound good. Few days… I can wait. Aisha will be happy. She always worry, you know? Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. You make me feel… better. I go to lab now. Blood work. Thank you again. Tell Aisha I say hello. She waiting.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It's my pleasure to help. And please, tell Aisha hello for me as well. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’ll be here to support you both. .
