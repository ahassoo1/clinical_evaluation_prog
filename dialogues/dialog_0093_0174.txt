DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. The pleasure is mine, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were… more cheerful. I’m here because, well, I haven’t been myself lately. Just… a great deal of sadness, really. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I’m not one for dwelling, but this… this is persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Derasmo. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I commend you for doing so. “Not feeling yourself” and persistent sadness are certainly valid reasons to seek medical attention. To help me understand what’s been going on, could you tell me a little more about this sadness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It’s… a heaviness, I suppose. Not like a grief, exactly, though I’ve known my share of that. More… a lack of joy. Things that used to please me – gardening, spending time with my grandchildren – don’t hold the same appeal. I find myself… withdrawing. Sleeping more, eating less, though not deliberately. It just… doesn't seem to matter as much anymore, you understand? I just feel… empty, mostly. And tired. Very, very tired. I’m trying to be brief, Doctor, if that’s alright. I don’t like to take up people’s time.
DOCTOR: Please, take all the time you need, Mrs. Derasmo. Your well-being is my priority, and understanding the details is crucial. It doesn’t sound as though you’re taking up my time at all; you’re providing me with valuable information. You’ve described a lovely contrast – a loss of enjoyment in activities you previously cherished, along with withdrawal, changes in sleep and appetite, and a feeling of emptiness. That does sound distressing. To clarify, approximately how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, you see. It wasn't a sudden thing. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, a sort of… dimming of the light, if you will. I initially dismissed it as simply getting older, you understand? One expects a little melancholy with age. But it hasn’t lifted. It’s just… stayed. It’s been particularly noticeable the last three months, I’d say. I truly haven’t been sleeping well for that long. It’s frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mrs. Derasmo. Six months of gradual onset, becoming more pronounced over the last three, with specific mention of sleep disturbance. That’s very helpful. Now, have you experienced any other changes alongside this sadness and fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me see… other changes. Hmm. Well, my temper has been rather short, I must admit. Not with anyone in particular, just… easily irritated. Small things that wouldn’t have bothered me before now seem… unbearable. And I’ve been… forgetful. Not alarming, you understand, just misplacing things, struggling to recall names occasionally. My daughter pointed it out, actually. She says I repeat myself more than I used to. Which is probably true. But I attributed that to age as well. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what’s normal at my age and what isn't. I just want to feel… like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mrs. Derasmo. It's quite common to question what changes are simply part of aging and what warrants further investigation. Increased irritability and forgetfulness, as you describe, are important details to note. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I had my share of childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. I had a hip replacement about ten years ago, which went well. Other than that… high blood pressure, which is managed with medication. I take a small dose of lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up quickly with antibiotics. I've never been diagnosed with anything… significant, you understand? No history of mental illness in the family, either. My mother was a very stoic woman. Didn’t believe in dwelling on things. Perhaps that’s where I get it from. I truly don’t want to make a fuss, Doctor. I’m just… not myself.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mrs. Derasmo. A history of well-managed hypertension treated with lisinopril, a previous hip replacement, and a bout of bronchitis. No significant medical history or family history of mental illness. And to clarify, are you currently taking any other medications, over-the-counter supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, no supplements or herbal remedies. Just the lisinopril for my blood pressure. I take one tablet each morning, as directed by my doctor, Dr. Adebayo. He’s a very good man. I take it with my breakfast, a small bowl of oatmeal. I try to be very disciplined about my medication. It’s important, you see. I’m not one for taking unnecessary things. Just what the doctor prescribes. That's it, really. I wouldn't want to confuse things with a long list of remedies. I assure you, Doctor, I’m a rather simple woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that clarification, Mrs. Derasmo. Just the lisinopril as prescribed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. Not to any medications, foods, or anything like that. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. My daughter has a slight shellfish allergy, but that's not relevant to me, you understand. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. Truly, Doctor, I’m a very plain case. I simply… don’t feel well. I just want to understand what’s happening and, if possible, feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mrs. Derasmo. It's not too much to ask. And you are not a “plain case” – everyone’s experience is unique. With your permission, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listening to your heart and lungs. I’d also like to do a quick neurological assessment, just to assess your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. Whatever you deem necessary, please proceed. I understand it’s all part of the process. I trust your judgment. I do hope it won’t take too long, though. I have a small garden I’m trying to keep up with, and the weeds… well, they don’t wait for anyone. But please, take your time. I just want to get to the bottom of this and, as I said before, feel like myself again. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Coordination appears intact. I’m also going to quickly assess your mood and cognition with a few simple questions, if you don’t mind. It's just a standard part of the examination.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Ask away. I may not be as quick-witted as I used to be, but I’ll do my best. I understand you’re just trying to get a complete picture. I appreciate your thoroughness. Go ahead, then. I’m ready when you are. I truly hope this doesn't take too long. The garden… it’s calling my name, you understand. And the weeds… they simply won't quit.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Now, could you tell me what year it is currently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… the year… Is it… 2024? No, wait. It must be 2025, isn’t it? Yes, 2025. August, isn’t it? The second of August. Though, honestly, the days all seem to blend together lately. I do hope I’m correct. My daughter says my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I suspect she's right. Is that… a bad sign, Doctor? I truly hate feeling… foggy like this.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mrs. Derasmo. It's not uncommon to have some difficulty with dates, especially when feeling unwell. And you are correct – it is August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you repeat these three words for me, and I’ll ask you to recall them later?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Three words? Let me see… pencil, table, flower. Pencil, table, flower. I’ll try to remember them. My daughter plays word games with me sometimes, to keep my mind sharp. It’s rather frustrating, actually. Sometimes I remember them, sometimes I don’t. But I’ll do my best. Pencil, table, flower. Is that correct, Doctor? I’m afraid my short-term memory isn’t always reliable, you understand. But I'm trying, truly I am.
DOCTOR: That's perfect. Now, I’m going to ask a few simple questions about your current mood and feelings. It’s alright to be honest; there are no right or wrong answers. Over the past few weeks, have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, yes. Most definitely. Not constantly, you understand. But… a heavy sadness. A sort of… emptiness. A lack of joy, as I mentioned earlier. Hopeless… well, perhaps not hopeless, exactly. But… discouraged. Very discouraged. It’s just… difficult to find pleasure in things anymore. Even the things I used to enjoy. Gardening, spending time with my grandchildren… they don’t hold the same appeal. It's a bit frightening, actually. I try to put on a brave face, but… it’s exhausting. Truly exhausting. I’m not myself, Doctor. Not at all. And it’s… unsettling. Is that what you're asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Derasmo, that is exactly what I'm asking, and thank you for being so honest with me. And it’s perfectly valid to feel this way. Over the past few weeks, have you had any thoughts of harming yourself, or have you felt like life isn't worth living?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never. I would never do anything like that. That’s… a terrible thought. I have grandchildren, you see. And a daughter who cares for me. I wouldn't put them through that. No, Doctor, I haven't had any thoughts of harming myself. Not at all. I'm… sad, yes. Discouraged, certainly. But not… suicidal. Never. I assure you. I simply want to feel like myself again. That’s all. I find it… distressing that you would even ask, you understand. It’s just… not me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Derasmo, and I apologize if that question caused any distress. It is a standard part of the assessment, and I assure you, I did not intend to cause any harm. Now, let’s return to your garden. Has your interest in gardening diminished recently?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, yes, significantly. It's… heartbreaking, really. Gardening used to be my sanctuary. My little piece of peace. But lately… it feels like a chore. I go out there, I weed a bit, I water the plants, but… the joy is gone. I used to spend hours out there, admiring the flowers, nurturing the vegetables. Now… it feels like an obligation. I even let some weeds grow, which I would never have done before. My daughter keeps offering to help, but… I don't want her to feel like she has to take over. It's my garden, you see. But… I just don’t have the energy, or the motivation, to care for it properly anymore. It's… a sad state of affairs, really. And it’s just one more thing that reminds me that I’m not myself. Is that… making sense, Doctor? I'm rambling, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mrs. Derasmo. You're providing me with valuable information, and I appreciate your honesty. Based on what you've told me – the persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, changes in sleep and appetite, increased irritability, and forgetfulness – and after a brief physical examination, I am concerned you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. Therefore, I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin D levels. I also recommend a urine analysis to rule out any infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Anything that might help me understand what’s happening, I’m willing to try. Blood work, urine analysis… whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel like myself again. And if blood work and tests are what it takes to get there, then so be it. When can I get these tests done? And will they take long? I do have a small gardening club meeting next Tuesday, and… well, I don’t want to miss that, if possible. Although, truthfully, I’m not even sure I have the energy to go. But still… it’s something to look forward to, you understand. What’s the next step, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so we can get these tests done today. It will only take about 30 minutes to an hour, and you can relax in the waiting room afterward. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I would also like to recommend a brief screening questionnaire for depression and anxiety, just to help me better understand your symptoms. It’s a simple questionnaire, and it will only take a few minutes to complete. And while we're waiting for the results, I want to assure you that you're not alone. Many people experience symptoms of depression, and there are effective treatments available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. That all sounds… manageable. Blood work, questionnaire… I can do that. You’ve been very thorough, and… reassuring, actually. It’s nice to feel like someone is listening, and taking me seriously. One question, though… will these tests… show something definite? Will they tell me why I’m feeling this way? I just… I hate not knowing, you understand. It's the uncertainty that's so unsettling. And… what if it's something serious? I'm rambling again, aren't I? Forgive me. It's just… a bit overwhelming, all of this. I suppose I should just focus on getting the tests done, and then we’ll see. Yes, that’s what I should do. Very well, Doctor. Let’s get started, then.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mrs. Derasmo. Your feelings are completely understandable. And while I can’t guarantee that the tests will provide a definitive answer, they will help us rule out any underlying medical causes and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The tests will also help me determine the best course of treatment, should it be necessary. Remember, we will work through this together, one step at a time. Let's start with the blood work. My nurse, Sarah, will be with you shortly to draw the samples. She’s very gentle and will explain everything clearly. And then we’ll complete the questionnaire. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I’m alright. Just… a little anxious, perhaps. But I’ll manage. I’ve faced worse, I suppose. Thank you for your kindness, and your patience. It means a great deal. I believe I’ll just… sit here for a moment, and try to calm my nerves. And try not to think about weeds. That’s probably best. I truly appreciate you listening to me, Doctor Bakan. It’s… a relief, actually. Very well. I’ll wait for Sarah, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mrs. Derasmo. Please, take all the time you need. Sarah will be with you shortly. And remember, I’m here if you have any questions or concerns.
