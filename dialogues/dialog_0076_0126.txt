DOCTOR: Right. So, Mr. Erxleben, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s rather…uncomfortable to discuss, to be frank. I’ve just been terribly thirsty, constantly. And hungry, always feeling like I need to eat, even after a good meal. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to disrupt things.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately three to four weeks. Perhaps a little longer, honestly. I haven’t kept precise track, I just know it’s…noticeable. It's not improving, that's for certain.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…changed? Not that I can readily recall. My divorce was finalised about six months ago, but that was… emotionally draining, not physically. Work’s the same – shipping and receiving, day in, day out. No different travel, no new medications… I truly can’t pinpoint anything specific. It just…started.
DOCTOR: Any changes in your…bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Good heavens. Well, no, not particularly. Everything’s… regular, if you’ll pardon the bluntness. Nothing out of the ordinary there, thankfully. Is that…is that relevant? I wasn’t expecting such a…direct question.
DOCTOR: Everything's relevant. We need to rule things out. Any weight loss?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…yes. A bit, perhaps. I haven't weighed myself properly in a while, but my trousers feel a little looser than they used to. Not a drastic amount, mind you, but noticeable. Probably a stone or so, I’d guess. It’s difficult to say with certainty.
DOCTOR: Stone…roughly fourteen pounds… Alright. Any family history of… diabetes or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother’s side…my grandmother, actually, had something. I believe it was…sugar sickness, they called it back then. Before all the proper medical terms, you understand. She was rather frail towards the end, always needing water. I don’t know the specifics, I was just a lad. Is that…relevant? I hope it’s not something like that.
DOCTOR: It could be. Alright. Let's do a quick check. Blood pressure first. And I'll need a urine sample. Just standard procedure. It'll give us a better idea. Don't make a fuss, it’s quick.
PATIENT: Right. Of course. Blood pressure…fine. And the…sample. Very well. Where do I go to… provide that? I prefer to get this over with as swiftly as possible, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: Through there. The usual instructions are posted on the wall. I’ll be back shortly. Try not to take too long. And please, just a small sample will do.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Small sample. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Let's see…while we wait, tell me about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, it's not terribly exciting, I assure you. I generally have a fairly hearty breakfast – porridge with a bit of fruit, toast, and a cup of strong tea. Lunch is usually a sandwich, something simple, and an apple. Dinner… varies. Sometimes a bit of fish, occasionally a roast, or just a simple pasta dish. I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea in the evenings, I must confess. Nothing extravagant, certainly not a strict diet, but I don’t overindulge, either. It's all rather…normal, really. Though, with this thirst, I’ve been having rather more sugary drinks than usual, simply to stay hydrated. Which, I suppose, isn’t helping.
DOCTOR: Sugary drinks… Right. And any recent infections?
PATIENT: Infections? No, nothing of that sort. Not a cold, not the flu, nothing. I'm generally quite healthy, despite this… discomfort. I haven’t been near a doctor in years, apart from the usual check-ups. It’s just…this constant thirst and hunger. It’s quite unsettling, frankly. I’m starting to feel rather weak, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see… Your glucose levels are… elevated. Significantly. And your urine shows glucose as well. It appears you have Type 2 Diabetes. It's not a death sentence, but it needs to be managed. We’ll need to get you started on medication and a strict diet. I’ll write you a prescription and a referral to a dietician. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens. My grandmother… I suspected something of that sort. Medication? A strict diet? This is… rather a lot to take in. I… I suppose I understand. But… what does this mean? What do I need to do? This is all happening rather quickly.
DOCTOR: It means you need to control your blood sugar. The dietician will explain the diet – no more sugary drinks, limited carbohydrates, regular meals. I’m prescribing Metformin. It'll help your body use insulin more effectively. Take it with food, twice a day. And you need to monitor your blood sugar regularly – I’ll give you a meter. It's not complicated. Now, do you have any specific questions?
PATIENT: Monitoring… with a meter. Right. No sugary drinks… I can manage that, I suppose. What… what are the risks if I don’t manage it? What could happen? And… will this affect my work? I can’t afford to be ill. Shipping and receiving… it’s quite physical. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It can lead to complications – nerve damage, kidney problems, blindness, heart disease. That’s why it’s important to control your blood sugar. As for your work… that depends on how well you manage it. If your blood sugar is uncontrolled, you may experience fatigue and weakness. It’s serious, yes. But manageable. Here. Take these. Follow the dietician’s instructions, take your medication, and monitor your blood sugar. And schedule a follow-up appointment in one month so we can assess your progress. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Right. One month. Dietician… medication… Very well. Thank you, Doctor. .
