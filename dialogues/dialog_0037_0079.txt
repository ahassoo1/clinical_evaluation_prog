DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Um, well, it's about my bruising. It's been getting worse, and I'm on blood thinners, so it's a bit worrying, you know? I get them pretty easily normally, but now... it's like a tiny bump and I end up with a huge bruise.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that's getting worse, especially while on blood thinners, is definitely something we should look into. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. First, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this increase in bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started maybe a month ago? It was just a little more than usual at first, like I bumped into something and it was a bigger mark than it should have been. But the last couple of weeks, it's been getting noticeably worse. Even just from, like, normal stuff. Like reaching for something on a shelf. It's kinda scary, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. A month ago, with a gradual worsening… that’s helpful to know. And it’s good you’re paying attention to the changes. You mentioned being on blood thinners. Could you tell me what blood thinner you’re taking, and what it’s prescribed for?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, sorry. It's Warfarin. And it's for... atrial fibrillation. My heart flutters sometimes, and the doctor said it helps prevent clots. I've been on it for about two years now, and everything was fine until recently. I get my levels checked regularly, too. At least, I was regular. It's been a while since my last check, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for atrial fibrillation, two years of stable use, and a recent lapse in regular monitoring… that’s important information. We’ll definitely need to look into your INR. Just to get a clearer picture, when was the last time you had your INR checked?
PATIENT: Let me think… Ugh, this is embarrassing. It was… March, I think? Maybe April? It was right before my cousin's wedding, and I totally meant to reschedule when I got back, but things got busy. It's been... a while. Definitely longer than three months. Sorry. I usually write it down but… I can’t find the notebook right now.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Courtnye. Things happen. It's good you're remembering it’s been some time. An INR check that's overdue, coupled with increased bruising, is something we need to address promptly. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, no really heavy periods… just the bruising. And I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I thought that was just from work. I do a lot of overtime lately. It's hard to say, really. Is tiredness a sign of something? I haven't seen any blood in my urine or anything like that, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other signs of bleeding, and the tiredness could be work-related. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about the bruising itself a little more specifically. Where are you noticing the bruising most often?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and legs, I think. Like, if I just knock my arm against something, it bruises really easily. And sometimes I get bruises on my legs for no reason at all. I haven’t fallen or anything. A couple on my hands too, but that's probably from gardening. But even tiny little bumps leave really big marks. It's weird. They’re not painful, just… noticeable. And they take forever to go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, arms and legs primarily, easy bruising with minimal trauma, slow to resolve… That paints a clearer picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at the bruising on your arms and legs. Then we can discuss some possible next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's kinda freaking me out. I've never had bruising this bad before.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get to the bottom of this. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you could just extend your arms for me, please. Okay, I see some bruising here on your forearms and upper arms. Varying shades, some appearing more recent, others older. And it looks like there's some on your shins as well. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, the most likely cause is related to your Warfarin levels being outside of the therapeutic range. However, to be absolutely certain, we need to get a recent INR done. Also, just to rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel .
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. So, blood tests? I can do that. Where do I go? Is it at the clinic here? I don’t mind going somewhere else if I have to. I just want to get this checked out. Hopefully it is just the Warfarin. I don’t want it to be anything worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests. We can do those right here at the clinic. I’ll write you an order now. The lab is just down the hall, and they're expecting you. They'll take a small sample of blood to check your INR, CBC, and BMP. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of hours – we’ll review them together and discuss a plan. Depending on the INR, we may need to adjust your Warfarin dosage. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury or bruising. And if you notice any new or unusual bleeding – such as blood in your urine or stool, excessive nosebleeds, or prolonged bleeding from cuts – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Avoid injury, watch for bleeding, and come back when the results are in. I think I can remember all that. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’ll go to the lab now. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I’m glad I could help. And you’re right to be proactive about this. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Please let the front desk know you’ve dropped off the lab order, and then you can go ahead and get the tests done. I’ll be here when you get back. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. .
