DOCTOR: Hello, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. I received a letter regarding some results from a test… an examination of my insides, I believe it was called? The letter indicated something wasn’t quite right, and I wanted to discuss it with you. It was regarding my stomach, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis. Let me pull up your records… Yes, here we are. You had a CT scan done on July 12th. And the report does mention a few things we should talk about. My apologies, my memory isn’t what it used to be… it sometimes takes me a moment to recall specifics. So, you said it was your stomach that was the concern?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, to be honest, Doctor, I wasn’t entirely sure where exactly the problem was. The technician simply said it involved looking inside… with a camera, perhaps? I received the letter a week or so ago, and I’ve been… a little anxious, if I may be frank. It said "abnormal," and that is never a comforting word. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely, Denis. “Abnormal” is a scary word. And it’s perfectly natural to be worried. We’ll go through everything step-by-step, and I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. The CT scan showed a small mass in your stomach. It's about 2 centimeters in size. Now, that doesn’t automatically mean it’s cancer, okay?
PATIENT: Two centimeters… That doesn't sound… terribly large, does it? But of course, size isn’t everything. What could it be, Doctor? And what do we do next? I confess, I haven’t had many health problems in my life, so I’m rather unfamiliar with these sorts of things. Is further examination needed?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Denis. Size isn't everything, but it's good we have a measurement. It could be a number of things – a benign tumor, an inflammation, or, as you rightly pointed out, something more serious. To find out for sure, we need to do a few more tests. The most accurate way to determine what it is would be an endoscopy. It involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your stomach to take a biopsy - a small sample of the mass. This allows us to look at it directly and send the sample to a lab for analysis. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An endoscopy… inserting a tube… It doesn't sound particularly pleasant, I must admit. But if it is the only way to know for certain, then I suppose I must agree. Is it a painful procedure, Doctor? And will I be… awake during this examination? I do have a slight aversion to such things, if you don’t mind my candor. I would appreciate knowing what to expect, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Denis. I completely understand your apprehension. It's not the most comfortable procedure, you're right. But we do everything we can to make it as painless as possible. You'll be given medication through an IV to make you comfortable and relaxed – most patients are actually quite sleepy during the procedure. You won’t feel any pain, though you might feel some pressure. We'll also use a local anesthetic to numb your throat. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. You'll need someone to drive you home afterward, as the medication can make you a bit groggy. We'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, which typically takes a few days. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: That… that is considerably more reassuring, Doctor. Knowing I will be sedated is a great comfort. And that it doesn’t last long. Yes, I have a friend who can certainly drive me. So, if I understand correctly, we schedule this… endoscopy… and then wait for the results? And you will contact me when they are ready? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the procedure? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Denis. Yes, that's correct. We'll schedule the endoscopy. Let me see… We have an opening next Thursday at 9:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday at nine… Yes, that should be quite alright. That gives me a few days to… prepare myself, mentally. And to arrange for my friend, of course. Are there any forms I need to fill out beforehand, Doctor? Or any specific instructions regarding medication? I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, but it is quite mild.
DOCTOR: Good, Thursday at 9:00 AM it is. You'll need to come in about 30 minutes early to fill out some paperwork—standard medical history and consent forms. And yes, please bring a list of all your medications, including that blood pressure medication. It's important for us to know everything you're taking. Also, you’ll need to fast for at least six hours before the procedure—no food or liquids. And please let me know if you have any allergies, especially to any medications. Do you have any questions about any of that, Denis?
PATIENT: Six hours fasting… and a list of medications. No allergies, thankfully. I will be certain to bring the list, and I will arrive a half hour early to complete the paperwork. Just one more question, if you don’t mind. What if… what if the results are not what we hope? What are the next steps, if it is something more serious? I understand it's a difficult question, but I prefer to be prepared, if possible.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible question, Denis, and I commend you for asking it. If the biopsy reveals something concerning, we'll discuss all your options. Depending on the nature of the mass, treatment could involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination of these. We have a fantastic team of specialists here at the clinic—oncologists, surgeons—who would be involved in your care. We’ll make sure you understand everything, and you’ll have plenty of time to ask questions and make informed decisions. It’s important to remember that we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let’s focus on getting through the endoscopy first, and then we'll address whatever the results may be. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very reassuring, indeed. I appreciate your honesty and your thorough explanations. It eases my mind considerably to know there is a team in place, should it be necessary. I believe that is all my questions, for now. I shall arrive on Thursday at 8:30 AM, with my medication list and an empty stomach. Thank you again for your time and your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before Thursday. We’ll take good care of you. I will see you then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
