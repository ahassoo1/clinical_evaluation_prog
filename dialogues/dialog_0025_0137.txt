DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is about the place. For old people? My husband, he think is good time. For me too, maybe. We need… paper? For the place. To say I am okay?
DOCTOR: Right. The "place," as you say. You mean a long-term care facility?
PATIENT: Long… term? Yes. That is… long time, no? My husband, he say they look after you. Everything. I just… need to say I am good? For the paper? I am not sick, you know. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you’re inquiring about admission to a facility, and your husband feels it might be a good time. And you’re wondering if I need to complete paperwork stating you’re fit for admission. It sounds like you're concerned about being perceived as needing a higher level of care than you do. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! That is… good way to say. I walk, I eat, I… remember things. Most things. My husband, he worry too much. He say is better to be safe. But I am okay. I think. Is… a lot of questions, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, even if you feel okay, we need to do a little assessment to determine if admission to a facility is truly the right choice, and to what level of care you might need, if any. It’s standard procedure. It's not just about whether you can walk and eat. We need to check a few things. First, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor Ramirez. He is… nice man. In the town. I see him… when I need. Not every month. When I feel not good. He give me… pills for my water. My blood pressure, he say. Is okay now, I think. He always say, “Take your pills, Lindra.”
DOCTOR: Alright, Dr. Ramirez. Good. So, you take medication for your blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: No. I not remember name. Little white pill. I take it every morning. With my coffee. My husband, he fill the box. He knows the name. I just… take the pill. Is important, he say. For my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that's not ideal, but we can figure it out. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my knees. They hurt when the weather is cold. And sometimes, my hands… they feel stiff. Like old gloves. Not always. Mostly in the morning. Doctor Ramirez, he give me… cream for my hands. And I take something… for the pain in my knees. When it is bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we have blood pressure medication, pain in your knees, and stiffness in your hands. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis?
PATIENT: Arth…ritis? No. I don’t think so. Doctor Ramirez, he never say that. He just say… old age. “Your joints are getting old, Lindra,” he say. He give me the cream. And I take the pills. Is… normal, he say. For old people.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about any surgeries you may have had. Have you ever been in the hospital for any procedures?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time ago. When I was young. I break my arm. Fall from the tree. I was… maybe ten years old. They… fix it. In the hospital. And… I have babies. Two babies. In the hospital. That is… surgery, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm as a child, and the deliveries of your two children – those are considered surgical procedures. Have you had any other surgeries since then?
PATIENT: No. Not that I remember. Nothing else. My husband… he remember everything. He tell me when I need to go to the doctor. He fill my pills. He… is good man. But I am okay. I think. Is just… old age. Everything hurts a little.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, “just old age” can still cause problems that need to be addressed. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. It’ll just be a basic check of your joints, reflexes, and vital signs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Is good. Check. I… I not afraid. Just… is cold in here, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat there. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Can you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Yes. Arms. Like this? Is… cold. The room is cold, yes? My bones… they feel the cold.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished. Now, let’s check your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Ooh. That is… not good. They hurt. Especially this one. Is… creaky. Like old door.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you make a fist with both hands?
PATIENT: Yes. This one… is stiff. Is… harder to bend. Like old gloves. You know? Not easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, I’m going to check your feet and ankles. Some mild swelling in the ankles. Alright, that’s enough for now. Based on this quick exam, it seems you do have some significant joint pain and stiffness, as well as some mild swelling. Your blood pressure is also a little high. While you may not feel sick, there are some things that need to be addressed. It's not simply "old age." Now, to rule out anything serious, I’m going to order some blood work and an X-ray of your knees.
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh… is that bad? Will it… hurt? I not like hospitals. My husband… he will not be happy. He just want me to be safe. Is the place… is it very bad?
DOCTOR: The X-ray is not bad at all. It doesn’t hurt. It’s just a quick picture of your bones. It helps us see what’s going on with your knees and rule out arthritis or other problems. As for the "place," we haven’t even determined if that’s necessary yet. The blood work and X-ray will give us a better understanding of your overall health. Look, I understand you're anxious, but we need to gather information before making any decisions. It's possible you simply need some physical therapy and medication to manage your joint pain. It’s also possible you’d benefit from a short stay in a rehabilitation facility. But we won’t know until we get the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Re… habi…litation? That is… long word. Is like… the place? Will they… make me do things? My husband, he say I need to rest. He worry about me falling. The pills… they make me sleepy. Is… too much, maybe? I just want to be okay.
DOCTOR: Rehabilitation is not necessarily “the place.” It's a facility where you receive therapy to help improve your strength and mobility. It's short-term, not a permanent living situation. And yes, you would be asked to do things – exercises to help your knees and hands. It's not about making you tired, it's about making you stronger. Look, I understand your husband is worried, but we need to be realistic. Simply resting won't solve the problem. And if your pills are making you sleepy, we can adjust the dosage. But first, we need the results of these tests. I'm going to order the blood work and X-ray. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll call you when they’re ready. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Down the hall…? Is far? I walk slow, you know. And… will they… poke me a lot? For the blood? I not like needles. My husband… he always do the blood. He say I am too old to worry about it. But I worry. A lot. Is the X-ray… is it a big machine? Will it… make me sick?
DOCTOR: It’s just down the hall, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s not a long walk. And yes, they will need to draw some blood. It’s a quick poke, I assure you. It won’t take long. As for the X-ray, it’s a large machine, yes, but it won’t make you sick. It’s completely painless. Look, I understand you're anxious, but these tests are necessary. The lab technician will explain everything to you. They are very good at what they do. And I'll be here to discuss the results with you once they're available. I'm going to write you a referral for the lab and the radiology department. Just take these slips with you, and they'll take care of everything. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Slips…? Is a lot. My head… it feels fuzzy. My husband… he always remember things. He write everything down. He know what to do. I… I just want to go home. Is cold here. And I worry. About the needles. And the machine. And… everything. Maybe I just need a nap.
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, I understand you're feeling overwhelmed. But I'm not going to simply send you home without getting some answers. You need these tests. Look, I’m going to have my nurse, Maria, come in and explain everything to you again, step-by-step. She’s very patient and will help you schedule the appointments. She can even call your husband if you'd like. I have other patients waiting. I'm confident Maria can address your concerns and get you the help you need. Please wait here, and she'll be with you shortly. .
