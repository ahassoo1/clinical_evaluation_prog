DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good to meet you too. Hmm… let me see. My wife, she helps me with these things. Something about papers… for work? Or maybe not exactly work. It’s… well, it’s to do with my position at the church. She said I need something from you, some official forms. I’m not quite sure what they’re called. Something about time off, maybe? It’s been… a bit confusing lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like you might need some medical documentation for your role at the church, perhaps related to taking some time off?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right! Time off… or maybe something to allow me to take time off. I’m… well, I’ve been feeling a little under the weather, you see. Not anything terrible, just… tired. And a bit… foggy. My wife said it's best to have everything official, just in case. She's very good at those things. Is that what those papers are for? FMLA, was it? Or… disability? I get mixed up with the names.
DOCTOR: FMLA and disability are both possibilities, yes. FMLA is for time off covered under federal law, usually for your own health or to care for a family member. Disability is if your health condition prevents you from working for a period of time. To figure out which one is best, or if either is appropriate, could you tell me a little more about how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It's not a pain, exactly. More like… everything feels slow. Like I'm wading through water. And I forget things. Small things, mostly. Names, where I put my glasses… things like that. It’s been getting worse lately, I think. My wife notices it more than I do. She says I repeat myself sometimes. I don’t feel sick, not in the usual way. Just… worn out. And confused. It makes it hard to… focus on things at the church, you know? Preparing the lessons, remembering the names of the parishioners… it’s all a bit much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, primarily fatigue and some difficulties with memory and concentration, and it’s been gradually worsening. You said it's affecting your work at the church. Has this been going on for a long time, or is this a more recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. I suppose it’s been creeping up on me for a while now. Maybe… six months? A little longer? It wasn’t so bad at first, just a little tiredness. But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last few months. Like… since the beginning of the summer, maybe? My wife says I’ve been more forgetful too. She keeps reminding me of things I should have remembered. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. I used to have such a sharp mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when things start to slip. And it's good that your wife is noticing and helping you keep track of things. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Then, depending on what we find, we can talk about some possible tests to help figure out what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam. Alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t be surprised if I don't remember everything you ask me! My wife always has to remind me of things afterwards.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll take our time, and I’ll make notes as we go. No need to worry about remembering everything. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll do a quick neurological exam - just checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I get a little… anxious when things go on for too long. And I don’t want to hold up anyone else’s appointment. Just… take it easy, alright? And don’t hesitate to tell me if I’m doing something wrong. My coordination isn't what it used to be, either.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll go at your pace, and I'll explain everything as we go. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. We can monitor that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and again… good. Everything sounds clear, but a little fast. Now, let's check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange. Can you sit with your legs dangling, please?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Legs dangling… yes, I can do that. This hammer… it doesn’t hurt, does it? My wife said something about my reflexes being slow… something about getting old. Is that what this is for? Just to see if I’m… falling apart?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t hurt, Mr. Limtiaco, just a quick tap. And yes, it’s to check your reflexes, but not to see if you're "falling apart"! It's a normal part of the exam. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be normal with age. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Just keep your head still and follow my finger as I move it around. This checks your eye movements and coordination. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Follow the finger… yes, I can do that. Though my eyes do get a little tired sometimes. Especially if I’m reading for too long. My wife reads to me sometimes… she says I strain my eyes too much. Here… is that alright? Am I following it correctly? It’s a little blurry around the edges, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. You’re doing just fine. A little slowness is okay, but I am noting some difficulty with smooth tracking. Now, one last thing. I’d like to quickly check your balance. Could you stand up, please?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Standing up… whoa. Oh dear. Excuse me… that was a little unsteady. My wife says my balance isn’t what it used to be, either. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. I used to be a very active man.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly okay to need a little support. And you're right to mention that. I noticed some instability. Okay, thank you for letting me do that. That gives me a good baseline. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive changes – difficulties with memory and concentration – along with some physical symptoms like fatigue and balance issues. I think it would be a good idea to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I’d also like to recommend a neurological consultation, to get a more in-depth assessment of your cognitive function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Tests… a neurologist… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please don’t make me do too many things at once! My wife already has a whole schedule for me… medications, appointments… it’s a bit overwhelming sometimes. And if you see anything… anything serious… please, just tell my wife first. She’s much better at handling these things than I am.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll coordinate with your wife to make sure everything is manageable. And I completely understand your preference about her being informed first. That’s perfectly reasonable. I’ll order the blood tests now. They’ll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and some other basic markers. I'll also write a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. And if you notice any sudden changes in your symptoms – like worsening confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please contact me or go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Questions… No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I mostly just want to… get to the bottom of this. It’s unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. My wife says it could just be getting old… but I’m not so sure. Is there anything… anything I should be doing right now? To help myself? Besides resting and drinking water, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. While we wait for the test results, focusing on mentally stimulating activities can be helpful. Things like puzzles, reading, or even just having conversations with friends and family. It’s like exercising your brain. Also, it might be helpful to start keeping a journal of your symptoms. Note when you experience forgetfulness or confusion, and what you were doing at the time. That can provide valuable information for the neurologist. And most importantly, don't hesitate to lean on your wife and loved ones for support. It's okay to ask for help, and it's important to have a strong support system during times like these. I’ll have the lab order printed for you now, and the referral to Dr. Sharma. Do you have any difficulty getting to appointments, or would you like me to help arrange transportation?
PATIENT: That’s… very thoughtful, Doctor. The journal… yes, my wife suggested that too. She’s very good at those things. And no, thank you. My son usually drives me to appointments. He works nearby. He’s a good boy. I think that’s all. Thank you… thank you very much for your time and patience. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on… or at least, knowing that we’re trying to find out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m glad I could help. And please remember, we're a team in this. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Here are the lab order and the referral. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. .
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you again, Doctor. .
