DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Marija. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn't… necessary. I understand you have forms regarding… end-of-life wishes? My husband suggested I come. He’s rather insistent on being prepared for everything, you see. I suppose it’s best to have these things sorted, even if it’s a rather unpleasant topic.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Your husband is… thoughtful to consider these things. It is always best to be prepared. The forms are just to outline your wishes, should something unforeseen happen. It's a difficult conversation, absolutely, but a very important one. Before we get into that though, is there anything else bringing you in today?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing else. Perfectly healthy, thank you very much. Always have been. It’s simply this… paperwork. Though, honestly, I find it a bit morbid to be discussing these things when I feel perfectly fine. Is it truly necessary to dwell on… that right now? Perhaps we can simply fill it out quickly and be done with it? I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your feelings completely. It is unsettling to think about these things when you're feeling well. However, these forms are about ensuring your wishes are known, regardless of how far off that may be. It’s not necessarily about dwelling, but about… peace of mind. Before we start, just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find your line of questioning rather… presumptive. You’re acting as if I’m already unwell. As I said, I am perfectly healthy. I’ve always taken good care of myself. A good diet, regular exercise… none of this… deterioration that seems to afflict so many these days. But, if you must know, I have no allergies. No chronic conditions. I had the flu once, many years ago, but that was hardly significant. Is that sufficient? Really, I would prefer to simply get this form completed. I assure you, I am not about to suddenly fall ill.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. I apologize if I came across as… presumptuous. It's just standard procedure to get a brief medical history, even when someone is feeling well. It helps us understand the full picture. No allergies, no chronic conditions, flu many years ago… that's good to know. Just out of curiosity, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I refuse to put unnecessary chemicals into my body. I believe in natural remedies, a healthy lifestyle. Medications are for the weak, Doctor. Honestly, I find it quite alarming that you would even ask such a thing. It implies you believe I should be taking something! I assure you, I am perfectly capable of maintaining my health without resorting to… pills. Are we getting anywhere with this form, or are we going to continue with this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Right, right. No medications. I understand your preference for natural remedies. It’s… admirable. Let’s move on to your family history then. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tedious. My family? A rather unremarkable lot, if you must know. My mother lived to a good age, though she did suffer from a touch of rheumatism in her later years. My father… well, he was a practical man. Died of a heart attack, I believe, but he smoked rather heavily. A regrettable habit, in retrospect. But really, what does any of this have to do with me? I assure you, I have inherited none of their… weaknesses. Are we finally going to look at this form, or is this some sort of elaborate test? I have a luncheon, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I apologize for the delay. Rheumatism in your mother, heart attack in your father… I’m just trying to get a complete picture. Let’s talk about your lifestyle then. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor, are you serious? Do you find my appearance suggests such… depravity? I assure you, I lead a very respectable life. I do not drink excessively – a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, perhaps. And I certainly do not smoke or partake in any… recreational activities. The very idea! My husband would be appalled. I maintain a healthy diet, regular exercise, and a dignified lifestyle. It's rather insulting that you would even ask. Are we getting anywhere with this form, or am I wasting my time? I have a luncheon to attend, you know. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: I apologize. You’re right to be upset. My questions are… standard, but clearly, they're not necessary in your case. You've described a very healthy lifestyle. Okay. Let's focus on the forms then. Do you have any specific wishes regarding end-of-life care?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, Doctor, let's focus on the forms. And frankly, I expect a very straightforward process. I have no desire for a prolonged, drawn-out ordeal if… the inevitable occurs. My wishes are simple: do not keep me alive artificially if there is no hope of recovery. No tubes, no machines, no… indignities. A dignified exit, that is all I ask. And my husband is, of course, fully aware of my wishes. He is a very practical man. Now, please, let’s see this form. I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright. This first section is about appointing a healthcare proxy – someone to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to. You mentioned your husband. Would you like to designate him as your proxy?
PATIENT: Of course. My husband, Jean-Pierre, is the obvious choice. He is a very sensible man, and perfectly capable of making sound judgments. Though, frankly, I trust his instincts implicitly. He’ll know exactly what I would want. Just… write him in. Is there a specific place to indicate his details? I assure you, he's more than capable of handling this. I don't want any complicated forms or unnecessary questions. Just write his name and contact information, and let's move on. I really must get going soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, right here. Name, address, phone number, and a space for his signature. You'll both need to sign it, once it’s complete. After that, we'll go through your wishes regarding specific medical treatments – things like CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. Just to ensure everything is clearly documented.
PATIENT: Very well. There. Is that sufficient? Honestly, the thought of discussing these… procedures is rather unpleasant. I trust Jean-Pierre to make sensible decisions. He understands my preferences perfectly. Can we simply skip the details? Just a general statement that he has my full authority to decide on my behalf? I assure you, I don't need a lengthy document outlining every possible scenario. I really must get going soon. The luncheon, you see. It’s a very important occasion.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance. However, for legal reasons, we really need to have some documentation of your wishes, even if it's just a general statement. Perhaps you could write a brief statement, outlining your general preferences regarding end-of-life care?
PATIENT: There. "I wish for a dignified exit, without prolonged artificial life support. My husband, Jean-Pierre, has my full authority to make all necessary decisions regarding my care.” Is that sufficient? Honestly, I fail to see why this requires so much documentation. It’s a perfectly reasonable request, isn’t it? Now, can we finally be done with this? The luncheon…
DOCTOR: Yes, this is… acceptable. It’s a clear statement of your wishes. We’ll attach this to the proxy form. Now, just a few signatures… and we’ll be finished. You’ll need to sign here, and Jean-Pierre will need to sign as your healthcare proxy here. I apologize for the delay. I understand this is not an easy conversation.
PATIENT: There. Done. Honestly, I’m relieved it’s finally over. I trust my husband to handle everything. And frankly, I’m quite eager to get to my luncheon. It's a very important event, you see. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Thank you, Marija. I wish you a pleasant luncheon. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. .
