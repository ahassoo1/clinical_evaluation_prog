DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Drahota. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… I don’t have all day to recount my woes. My skin… it's darkened. And I’m perpetually tired. It’s… bothersome. Very bothersome. I've been working, of course. Always working. Is that what this is about? Just… work?
DOCTOR: Working hard, eh?
PATIENT: Well, someone has to. I’ve been reinforcing iron and rebar for… well, a lifetime. It’s honest work, unlike some things. But it shouldn't be this tiring. And the… discoloration is concerning, naturally. Though I doubt it's anything serious. Probably just the sun. Or… something.
DOCTOR: Right. Sun exposure. We’ll get to that. So, this tiredness… is it new?
PATIENT: New? Doctor, I’ve been tired my entire life. But… it feels more now. More… oppressive. And it’s not just physical, you understand. It’s… a general weariness. Though I suppose at my age, one expects a certain… decline. My wife keeps telling me I need to rest, but rest is for the… indolent. Is that a word? It should be.
DOCTOR: "Indolent" is a word, yes. And while some fatigue with age is normal, "oppressive" is… not ideal. When did you first notice this increase in tiredness?
PATIENT: Goodness. Honestly, Doctor, you ask such precise questions. It’s all a blur. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe less. It’s difficult to pinpoint, you see. Everything just… blended together. Work, meals, sleep… It's all rather monotonous. I wouldn’t expect you to understand. Can we move on?
DOCTOR: "Monotonous" doesn’t rule out medical causes. Six months… alright. Now, you mentioned skin darkening. Is that all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor, it seems. My face, my arms…even my legs. It’s not… a pleasant shade, I assure you. Though I suppose I've seen worse on the construction site. It's just… a bit of a tan, gone wrong, I expect. I don’t understand why we are dwelling on this so much. Is this going to take long? My wife made me promise to be back by four.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any itching, pain, or changes in the texture of your skin?
PATIENT: Itching? No. Pain? Certainly not. I'm a reinforcing iron worker, Doctor, not a delicate flower. The texture… it feels like… skin. I fail to see the relevance of these inquiries. I’m a practical man, I assure you. I deal with steel, not… skin ailments. Are you a dermatologist, or a general practitioner? This seems… rather detailed for a simple case of exhaustion and a bit of sun.
DOCTOR: I’m a Family Medicine doctor, Mr. Drahota. And while you may be practical, ignoring potential issues isn’t always wise. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? A few aches and pains, as one would expect at my age. Nothing that requires… coddling. My wife handles all the medical paperwork. Honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor in decades. I prefer to be… proactive about my health. Hard work is the best medicine, you know. Though I suppose she insisted on this visit. Is there a quick way to wrap this up? Four o'clock is rapidly approaching.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries…hospitalized? Let me see… There was a rather nasty gash on my leg, decades ago. A piece of rebar came loose. My wife bandaged it up herself, of course. No need to bother the… professionals. And… I believe I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. But that was… a very long time ago. It hardly seems relevant now. Honestly, Doctor, all these questions about ancient history… It’s rather unsettling. Is this a standard procedure? Because it feels… excessive.
DOCTOR: And your family… do any of your relatives have any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Family? Goodness, where does one begin? There were… many of us. My parents, of course. Several siblings. Cousins. Aunts. All scattered across…various locations. I honestly haven’t kept track. They all seemed… reasonably healthy. Working people, mostly. No one indulged in… frivolous complaints. I believe my uncle had something to do with his lungs. Smoking, I presume. But beyond that… I couldn’t say. It's not something I concern myself with. Really, Doctor, is this information truly vital? Four o'clock is imminent.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Very well. But do try to be swift. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I haven't got all day, you understand. My wife will be expecting me. Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of tiredness and a darkened complexion. It’s… rather ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: 140/90. A bit elevated. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds… normal. Lungs are clear. Skin examination… The skin is uniformly darkened, as you mentioned. No rashes or unusual lesions. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears… within normal limits, for your age. However, the elevated blood pressure and fatigue warrant further investigation. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We’ll also need to discuss lifestyle modifications. Diet, exercise, stress management…the usual.
