DOCTOR: Right. Zelina Ambris, 18 years old. Hello. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. It’s… my breath. It smells. Bad. It’s embarrassing, okay? I just want something to fix it. Fast.
DOCTOR: “Smells bad,” is rather vague, dear. Can you describe how it smells?
PATIENT: Ugh, like… old food, I guess? And just… unpleasant. Look, I don’t need a detailed description. It’s bad. I brush my teeth, okay? Twice a day. Sometimes more if I’m going somewhere. It’s not like I want it to smell like that. It’s just… always there.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “Old food” is… marginally helpful. And you said twice a day brushing?
PATIENT: Yes! Twice a day. Morning and night. Like a normal person. What do you want to know? Do I need to list everything I eat? Honestly, this is a waste of time. Is there a spray or something you can just give me?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s hardly a waste of time to gather information, dear. A simple spray isn’t likely to resolve this. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? What does that even mean? No, I haven't noticed anything else! I just want my breath to not stink, alright? Look, I work outside, fixing roads. It's hot. Maybe it's the heat? I don't know. Do people usually get bad breath from working outside?
DOCTOR: Heat alone is unlikely to cause persistent bad breath. And it's not simply wanting something fixed, dear, it’s determining why it’s happening. Do you have any nasal congestion or post-nasal drip?
PATIENT: Ugh, what is post-nasal drip? Is that something contagious? Look, I'm a highway worker, not a doctor. No, I don't think so. Sometimes my nose gets a little stuffy in the winter, but that's it. This is in August! It’s hot. I’m sweating. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Post-nasal drip is when mucus drains down the back of your throat. It can cause bad breath. And while not always contagious, it can be associated with sinus infections. Alright. Let’s move on. Any recent dental work or tooth pain?
PATIENT: No. I had a filling a couple years ago, but it didn’t hurt. And no, no tooth pain. Look, I'm divorced. I don't have time for this. My ex-husband… he complained about everything. This is just like that. Is there anything quick you can give me? A mouthwash? A mint? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: A temporary mint will mask the odor, yes, but won’t address the underlying cause. And I am trying to determine that cause. Have you noticed any white coating on your tongue?
PATIENT: White… coating? I haven't looked! Why would I look at my tongue? Honestly, this is getting absurd. I brush my teeth, I go to work, I try to live my life. I don’t inspect my tongue for… coating. No. I haven’t. Is this going to take long? Because I’m wasting daylight here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. I need to look in your mouth and check your throat. It’s the only way to have any idea what’s going on. Open wide, please. And try to relax. This won't take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. This is embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is a moderate amount of white coating on your tongue. And your gums are slightly inflamed. No obvious cavities, but there's some redness around the base of your molars. Your throat appears clear, but a little dry. It appears you have mild gingivitis and possibly a fungal infection of the tongue – oral thrush. It’s not uncommon, particularly with a dry mouth. Do you drink enough water during the day?
PATIENT: Water? Look, I drink when I'm thirsty. I'm sweating all day, fixing potholes, okay? I don’t sit around sipping water like a… like a princess. I probably don’t drink enough, if that’s what you’re asking. But what does that have to do with my breath smelling like garbage? And what's "thrush?" Is it contagious? I really need to know if I need to worry about my coworkers.
DOCTOR: Thrush is a yeast infection, and while it can be mildly contagious, it’s not typically spread through casual contact. The dryness in your mouth creates an ideal environment for it to flourish. The gingivitis is also contributing to the odor. It’s a combination of factors. Alright. I’m going to prescribe an antifungal mouthwash for the thrush and recommend a prescription strength fluoride toothpaste for the gingivitis. And you need to increase your water intake. Significantly. Aim for at least eight glasses a day.
PATIENT: Eight glasses? That’s… a lot. Fine. Whatever. Just give me the stuff. And is this going to be expensive? Because I don't have insurance. And I need a note for work, in case I need to take breaks to… drink water. This is ridiculous. Honestly.
DOCTOR: The prescriptions are for Nystatin oral suspension, to be swished and swallowed twice daily for two weeks, and high-fluoride toothpaste. I’ll write a note excusing you for reasonable breaks to hydrate. Here are the prescriptions – the Nystatin should be relatively inexpensive, but the toothpaste may be a bit pricier. I will also provide a list of resources for low-cost dental care in the area. Increase your water intake, brush and floss diligently, and follow the instructions on the prescriptions. Return in two weeks if there's no improvement. Any questions?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you. I’ve got to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Some people. Honestly. .
