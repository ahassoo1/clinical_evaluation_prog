DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Rakosky, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly. Time… slips away, you know? It’s a bother, mostly when I’m trying to… do things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. The shaking, you said. And you mentioned it makes it difficult to do things?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Difficult... frustrating, more like. I used to be able to fix anything, you know? Plumbing, wiring… worked at the water treatment plant for… well, a long time. Now… even holding a cup of coffee is a challenge sometimes. Spills everywhere. My daughter says I should just use a lid, but… it’s not the point, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Jezik. It sounds like this is impacting your daily life, and that’s certainly something we need to address. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when the shaking started?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When it started… Honestly, Doctor, it’s a blur. A few months, maybe? Six? Longer? I really can’t put my finger on it. It wasn't sudden, not like a switch flipped. It just… gradually got worse, I suppose. I don't remember anything specific triggering it. Just… there one day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over several months. And you haven’t noticed anything that seems to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I don’t think so. Maybe a bit worse when I’m tired, but I’m always tired these days. And cold weather… seems to bother it a bit, but then everything bothers me a bit in the cold. It’s not like a definite thing, you understand? It just… fluctuates.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Jezik. Fluctuations are common. Now, besides the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been a bit… clumsy lately, I suppose. More so than usual, anyway. And my handwriting… it’s always been terrible, but it’s gotten even worse. Almost illegible. Can’t really remember if that's just old age catching up, or if it's connected to the shaking. Oh, and I've been feeling a bit… off. Just generally unwell, tired, you know? Like something isn’t quite right.
DOCTOR: Okay, clumsiness, worsening handwriting, and a general feeling of being unwell. Have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles or joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness… Now that you mention it, yes. My hands, mostly. Especially in the mornings. Feels like they’ve been clenched all night. It loosens up a bit after I move around for a while, but it’s definitely there. And my shoulder… sometimes aches. I figured it was just old age, and from years of… well, doing things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance… Hmm. Not really falling or anything, no. But… I do feel a bit… unsteady sometimes. Like I might stumble. I try to be careful, you know? Especially on uneven ground. My daughter keeps telling me I need to get a walking stick, but I’m not quite there yet. I still get around okay, mostly. But it’s not as… confident as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unsteadiness. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, dear. That's a tough one. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, of course. And I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder. But as for conditions… not that I know of. The doctor always said I was a strong, healthy man. I don't really go to the doctor much. Never needed to, until now, I guess. I think I had high blood pressure at one point, but I don’t really remember the details. It was years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal, broken arm, and a history of high blood pressure that was managed at some point. Do you recall any medications you were prescribed for the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, goodness. No, I really don't. It was so long ago, and the doctor... he moved away. I just remember taking a little pill every day for a while. Stopped when he left, and another doctor told me it wasn't so bad. Just watch my salt intake, he said. And then… well, I forgot about it. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. Many people have difficulty remembering details from the past. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, no. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach. She’s… well, that’s another story. No allergies. Definitely not. Never had any trouble with that. I’m pretty lucky, really. Or at least, I was lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just coffee, mostly. And maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. But that’s it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. Never liked taking them. My daughter keeps telling me I should take something for my arthritis, but I just tell her I'm managing. So, no medications. Just coffee and beer. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Jezik, that is good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, balance, and coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just… try not to poke too much. Old bones, you know. And please, be gentle. I don't want to fall over. Let's get it over with. I'd like to get home before it gets too late.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. Relax your legs for me. Your reflexes are a little diminished on both sides, but not dramatically so. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Alright, here you go. Is that enough? It feels a bit… harder to squeeze than it used to. Maybe it's the cold.
DOCTOR: That’s good, thank you. A little weaker than expected, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, can you please stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I go. It's a bit… wobbly. Don't mind me. Getting old, you know? Bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, just walk forward a few steps, and then walk backward a few steps. Take your time, and don’t worry if you’re a little unsteady. I'm just observing.
PATIENT: There we go… one, two, three… Now backwards… It's harder going backwards, you know? Feels like I'm going to fall over. Perhaps I should sit down.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, sit down. That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. You did well. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds a little irregular, and your breathing sounds a bit… diminished. Now, let me check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, alternating hands?
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go… It’s… harder than it looks, Doctor. My hands aren’t cooperating. I used to be so precise. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. Thank you. Based on what I’ve observed during the exam and what you’ve told me, I’m concerned about a few things. The tremors, the stiffness, the unsteady gait, the diminished reflexes, and the slight irregularity in your heartbeat are all things that need further investigation. I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, although we'll need to confirm this with further testing. Before we proceed, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… Parkinson’s… Is that… serious? I've heard of it… doesn't that affect… everything? Everything getting worse and worse? I just thought it was old age. All these aches and pains… What kind of testing? And… what can be done about it? Will I… will I end up in a wheelchair?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. Jezik. Yes, Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological condition, meaning it can worsen over time. However, it affects individuals differently, and there's a wide range of severity. It primarily affects movement, and symptoms can include tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, and balance problems – which you've been experiencing. It doesn't mean everyone will end up in a wheelchair. With proper management, many people with Parkinson’s can maintain a good quality of life for many years. The testing we'll need to do includes a neurological examination and potentially a DaTscan, which is a type of imaging scan that can help us confirm the diagnosis. We'll also want to do some blood work to rule out other possible causes. If it is Parkinson’s, there are medications available that can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. We can also explore physical therapy and other supportive therapies. Right now, we need to get a definitive diagnosis. Would you be willing to schedule a neurology consultation and the necessary testing?
PATIENT: A neurology consultation… and a scan… Yes, alright. I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? If that’s what it takes to find out what’s going on. Is it… is it painful? The scan? And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I just want to know what I’m dealing with. And… if there's anything I can do now to help, before we get the results. Anything at all.
DOCTOR: The DaTscan is non-invasive, Mr. Jezik. It involves a small amount of radioactive tracer being injected into your vein, and then a scan is taken to measure dopamine levels in your brain. It doesn't involve any pain, although you may feel a slight pinch during the injection, like any other blood test. It typically takes a few hours to complete the scan and get the preliminary results. We should have those within a week. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do. Gentle exercise, like walking, can help maintain your mobility. We can also discuss some strategies to help with your balance and coordination. It’s important to avoid falls, so make sure your home is free of tripping hazards. I’m going to give you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist at St. Luke’s Hospital. She is excellent. I’ll also order some routine blood work to rule out other possibilities. And I’ll provide you with a handout on Parkinson’s disease with more information. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Dr. Reed… St. Luke’s… Alright. Good. That sounds good. And the handout… Yes, that would be helpful. I like to know what I’m up against, you know? Um… Will this… will this affect my driving? My daughter… she worries about me driving. I still need to get to the grocery store, you know? And… to visit my friends.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Jezik. Whether Parkinson’s affects your driving will depend on the severity of your symptoms. We’ll need to assess your reaction time, coordination, and overall cognitive function. Initially, there’s no reason to believe you’ll have to stop driving. However, as the disease progresses, it’s possible you may need to reduce your driving or eventually stop altogether. We can discuss this further with Dr. Reed. She can perform a comprehensive driving assessment if necessary. And we can explore alternative transportation options if needed. For now, let’s focus on getting a diagnosis and developing a management plan. I’m going to print out the referral for Dr. Reed and the handout on Parkinson’s disease. I'll also give you a list of local support groups. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful. And… patient. It's just… a lot to take in. I appreciate you not dismissing me as just an old man. I suppose I'll… I'll schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed. And try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It was my pleasure. Remember, we’ll work through this together. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Reed. And please, take care of yourself. Have a good day.
