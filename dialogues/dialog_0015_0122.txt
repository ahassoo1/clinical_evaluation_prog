DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, precisely. I have been noticing…lapses. Small things, mostly. I forget where I put my keys, or a name…even what I was saying mid-sentence. It is…troubling. My blood pressure has been high for some time, you see. And I worry it is connected.
DOCTOR: Lapses in memory, you say. And you attribute this to your history of high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. My late husband, he was…a very methodical man. Everything had its place. I was never quite as organized, but I managed. Now…it feels as if my thoughts are…slipping. It is not constant, Doctor, but frequent enough to cause concern. It is…disconcerting. I do not wish to become a burden.
DOCTOR: “Not constant, but frequent enough to cause concern…” Alright. And how long have you been noticing these lapses?
PATIENT: Approximately…six months, I believe. It began subtly. Misplacing objects. Then, forgetting appointments. Now…sometimes I struggle to recall the names of acquaintances I have known for years. It is…frustrating, and honestly, a little frightening. I find myself writing everything down, but even that I sometimes forget to do.
DOCTOR: Six months…and you said this coincides with a history of high blood pressure. Do you know what your most recent blood pressure reading was?
PATIENT: I do, actually. I check it regularly, as my doctor – the one before he retired – insisted. Last week, it was…160 over 95, I believe. It fluctuates, of course. Sometimes it is lower, sometimes…worse. But rarely below 140 over 90. I am taking medication, but it does not seem to be fully effective.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95… that is elevated. And what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It is…Lisinopril. Twenty milligrams, once daily. I have been on that dosage for…approximately three years, I think. It helped initially, but the effect seems to have diminished. I did mention it to my previous physician, but he…passed away before we could adjust the treatment. It has been difficult finding a new doctor, honestly. They all seem…so rushed.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 20mg daily. And you haven’t had any adjustments made to the dosage in three years, despite it becoming less effective. Alright. Now, beyond the memory issues and high blood pressure, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not that I have noticed. No headaches, no dizziness, no…vision changes. My appetite is normal, I sleep… adequately. I feel…tired, certainly. But that could be my age. And the worry, of course. I do not wish to be a bother. I apologize if I am rambling. It is just… disconcerting to feel one's mind… slipping away.
DOCTOR: "Slipping away" is rather dramatic, Ms. Alvara. Fatigue is a common symptom with many conditions. Now, let’s review your medical history a bit more thoroughly. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides hypertension?
PATIENT: Oh. I… apologize. I did not mean to be… melodramatic. It simply feels that way at times. As for other conditions… no, not that I am aware of. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… but nothing significant. No diabetes, no heart problems, no… neurological issues. I had a hysterectomy many years ago, but that was… routine. I do not recall any other diagnoses. I assure you, Doctor, I have always been a healthy woman. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries besides the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Let me think… there was a small procedure on my knee, many years ago, after I fell. It was…arthroscopic, I believe. To repair a torn meniscus. And… I had my appendix removed as a young woman. Those are the only surgeries I recall. I have…a very good memory for details, you see. It is the recent events that are… problematic. It is… most unsettling.
DOCTOR: A good memory for details, yet difficulty recalling recent events... Interesting. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any instances of dementia or Alzheimer's disease in your family?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My mother… she did become quite forgetful in her later years. But it was attributed to…old age, mostly. She was a very independent woman, and refused to see a doctor. My father… he passed away young, from a heart attack. I do not recall any other instances of dementia or Alzheimer's in either family, truthfully. It was…not a common ailment, as far as I know. Though, one does not always know, does one? It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? I… I am a widow, as I mentioned. My husband passed away five years ago. We had no children. I live alone. I…keep busy. I volunteer at the local library. I enjoy reading, gardening, and… attending concerts. I do not…drink alcohol. I do not smoke. I have a small circle of friends. It is… a quiet life. A solitary life, perhaps. But I am content. Mostly. It is…difficult, losing someone.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I am aware of. I have always been fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. I have never had a…reaction, as far as I know. It is… another fortunate aspect of my health, I suppose. Though, it seems that is changing. This…forgetfulness is quite disconcerting. I apologize if I am repeating myself, Doctor. It is just… troubling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, you've mentioned a number of things. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Oh! That is… a very good question. I… sometimes take Ibuprofen for arthritis in my hands. Just when the pain is particularly bad. Perhaps two or three times a week, at most. And… occasionally, I take a sleep aid. Melatonin, when I cannot sleep. But those are… over-the-counter. I did not think to mention them. I apologize. It is… I am usually so meticulous. It is… unsettling to feel my mind… failing.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen and Melatonin… Alright. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. I’d like to check your vital signs, neurological function, and a brief cognitive assessment. That is… standard procedure.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. I… just hope we can determine the cause of this… forgetfulness. It is… quite distressing. I am ready when you are. Please, proceed. It is… good to be thorough, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 158 over 92. Pulse is 72 and regular. Respiratory rate is 16. Temperature is 98.6. Now, let's do a brief neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. I can see it perfectly well. Is this… satisfactory? I apologize if my gaze seems… intense. I simply wish to be precise. It is… a habit, I suppose. A meticulous habit. Is there anything else I can do?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am squeezing as tightly as I can. Is this… sufficient? I am rather strong, you see. Despite my age. I enjoy gardening, it keeps my hands active. Is there anything else? I am prepared to cooperate fully. It is… important to be thorough, I believe.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Remember them, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Apple, Table, Penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. Apple, Table, Penny. I have them memorized. Is this… satisfactory? I pride myself on my memory, you see. It is… disconcerting to feel it slipping. I can repeat them if you wish. Apple, Table, Penny.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Both reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I will perform a brief cognitive assessment. I'm going to ask you to spell the word "World" backwards.
PATIENT: … D-L-R-O-W. World backwards is… D-L-R-O-W. Is that…correct? It is… a little difficult. It is not something I do every day. I apologize if I am slow. Is there anything else? It is… unsettling to feel one's mind… resisting.
DOCTOR: That is… incorrect. It's W-O-R-L-D. Now, let’s try a simple calculation. If you have 15 apples and you give away 7, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Fifteen… minus seven… Eight. I have… eight apples left. Is that… correct? It is…simple arithmetic. Perhaps I am… distracted. It is… unnerving to be tested in this manner. Is there anything else? I apologize for any…mistakes.
DOCTOR: Eight is correct. Now, finally, can you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: … Apple… Table… … I… I cannot recall the third word. Apple… Table… I apologize. It is… most unsettling. It was… a simple task. I assure you, I have a good memory. It is… simply slipping away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your symptoms and the brief cognitive assessment, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive decline. Given your history of hypertension, we need to rule out any vascular contributions. While it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis, I suspect early-stage mild cognitive impairment. I am ordering a complete blood panel, including a thyroid function test, vitamin B12 levels, and a lipid panel. I’m also ordering an MRI of the brain to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or evidence of small vessel disease. I am referring you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. In the meantime, I recommend engaging in mentally stimulating activities and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: …Mild cognitive impairment? An MRI? A neurologist? I… I see. What… what does this mean, precisely? What are the… implications? I… I had hoped it was simply… forgetfulness. Is this… serious, Doctor? And… will this… worsen? I… I apologize for the questions, but… it is all rather… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Mild cognitive impairment means you're experiencing a decline in cognitive function that is greater than expected for your age, but it doesn't necessarily interfere with your daily activities… yet. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including vascular disease, which is common with uncontrolled hypertension. The MRI will help us rule out other causes, like stroke or tumors. Seeing a neurologist is essential for a proper diagnosis and to determine the underlying cause. As for whether it will worsen… that depends on the cause and how aggressively we manage it. Lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, mental stimulation – can slow the progression. Medication may also be necessary. It's important to understand that this is not an immediate emergency, but it does require attention. We need to identify the cause and develop a plan to manage it effectively. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I understand. So, it is… not a simple matter of…forgetfulness. It is… something more significant. And it is… potentially progressive. The neurologist… what will they do, precisely? What tests will they perform? And… what if it is… something serious? I… I apologize for my questions. It is just… all rather frightening. I simply wish to be… prepared. Is there anything I should… do in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: The neurologist will likely perform a more in-depth cognitive assessment, including memory tests, language skills, and executive function. They may also order additional imaging studies, such as a PET scan, to evaluate brain function. As for what if it is serious… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. It's important not to jump to conclusions. There are many possible causes of cognitive decline, and not all of them are severe. In the meantime, focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, engage in mentally stimulating activities like reading or puzzles, and prioritize getting enough sleep. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption and smoking. I’m also going to write you a referral to a support group for individuals with cognitive impairment and their families. It can be helpful to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results of your tests and the neurologist’s recommendations. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I believe that is all for now. Thank you for your… thoroughness. And thank you for your… honesty. I… I will follow your recommendations. I… I suppose I should… schedule the tests. And find the neurologist. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will assist you with scheduling those appointments. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Goodbye, Ms. Alvara. .
