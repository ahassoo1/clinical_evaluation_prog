DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. Ivette Redeye, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Good morning to you too, Doctor… Gorga, is it? I hope you don’t mind me asking, but you don’t sound like you’re from around here. Not that it matters, of course. I just… have a good ear for accents, I suppose. Anyway, I’m here about these hiccups. They just won’t stop.
DOCTOR: Gorga, yes, that’s right. And no, no mind at all. Romanian, originally. Been here… quite a while now, though. Accents tend to fade, eh?
PATIENT: They do, I suppose. Though mine seems to stick to everything! See? It’s been going on for… goodness, over two days now. It started, oh, let me think… Tuesday, I think it was. After I had that spicy tagine at Omar’s. It was delicious, though. Maybe too delicious.
DOCTOR: Two days, starting Tuesday… tagine… right. Okay. And is this constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. It comes and goes. Mostly it’s after I eat, or drink something… even just talking sometimes sets it off. It's just… frequent. Really frequent. It’s exhausting, to be honest. It feels like someone’s giving me tiny little shocks inside.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, yes, I can imagine. And the shocks… okay. Any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no pain anywhere… I’ve been a little bit breathless sometimes, but I put that down to the hiccups themselves. They just… take your wind away, you know? And maybe a tiny bit of heartburn, but I get that sometimes anyway. Nothing major. Oh! And I’ve been a bit jumpy, easily startled. But honestly, who wouldn’t be, with this constant… hic… jumping inside?
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, heartburn, jumpiness… Alright. Any past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago, but that was no trouble. And high blood pressure, but it’s managed with… well, I don’t even remember the name of the pill anymore. Just a little blue one. Doctor Samir used to handle that, but he retired last year. Otherwise, pretty healthy, all things considered. Considering I run a karaoke bar, anyway. That’s not exactly a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Karaoke bar… interesting. And the blue pill… we’ll figure that out. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I eat everything. I have to, with the bar! I’m always sampling the food. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything… until, possibly, that spicy tagine. But I don’t think I’m allergic to it, just… it seems to have upset my system a little. This is ridiculous. I can’t even have a conversation without… hic… exploding.
DOCTOR: Alright. And medications?
PATIENT: Just that little blue pill for the blood pressure, like I said. I don't know the name, I really don't. I just take one every morning with my coffee. And sometimes ibuprofen, if I get a headache after a busy night at the bar. Usually just one or two, nothing regular. Honestly, I wish I’d paid more attention when Doctor Samir explained everything. It all goes in one ear and out the other, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Okay. Let’s have a listen to your chest, just to be on the safe side. And maybe I’ll take your blood pressure, see where we're at with that little blue pill. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Absolutely. The sooner we figure out what’s going on, the better. It’s just… embarrassing, really. Exploding with every breath. You wouldn’t catch the bar patrons doing that.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up there for me. I'll grab the stethoscope. And try to take deep breaths. Don't worry about the hiccups, they won't interfere.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths… easier said than done, with this… hic… going on! But I'll try my best. Don’t hesitate to tell me if I’m doing something wrong. I’m not exactly a medical expert, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Breathing sounds are a little diminished on both sides, but nothing alarming. Blood pressure is slightly elevated… 140 over 90. Definitely something we need to address. And… a little tenderness in the upper abdomen. Any pain here when I press?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. It’s been like that on and off all day, really. I just thought it was… indigestion. Or maybe leftover spicy tagine. It’s not terrible, but I can definitely feel it. Especially after I… hic… try to talk. It seems to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given the tenderness, the slightly elevated blood pressure, and the hiccups… it could be a number of things. Possibly some irritation to the diaphragm. The spicy food may have played a role. However, with the tenderness, I want to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to order some blood work, just to be safe. And a chest X-ray. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Absolutely. Blood work and an X-ray. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want this… hic… this torture to stop. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Avoid spicy food, I presume? Or is there a position I should be sleeping in? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, avoiding spicy foods is a good start. And try to eat smaller meals, rather than large ones. As for position, lying on your left side might help. It can sometimes reduce pressure on the diaphragm. But the blood work and X-ray are the most important things right now. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology. They'll call you to schedule the appointments. And then we’ll review the results and figure out the next steps. I’m going to write you a prescription for something to help calm the hiccups in the meantime, while we wait for the results. It's a muscle relaxant. It may make you a little drowsy, so be careful driving. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wonderful, actually. Anything to stop this… hic… this incessant jumping. A muscle relaxant sounds perfect. And I will be careful driving. I'm not driving anywhere until this settles down, anyway. My karaoke patrons’ lives are too precious to risk. Thank you, Doctor. You've already made me feel a lot better, just knowing we're doing something about it. Hopefully, this little blue pill will work better than the last one. Do you happen to know what it is? Just so I can tell my niece if she asks… she likes to pretend she's a doctor, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s baclofen. It’s often used for muscle spasms. And as for the little blue pill you're currently on, it sounds like you may be taking amlodipine, which is a common blood pressure medication. But it’s always best to confirm with the pharmacy. Alright. I think that's everything for now. Please, follow up with me once you have the blood work and X-ray results. And if the hiccups get any worse, or you develop any other symptoms – fever, shortness of breath, severe chest pain – go to the emergency room immediately, understood?
PATIENT: Yes, baclofen and amlodipine… I’ll definitely ask the pharmacist to confirm. And absolutely, I understand. Worse hiccups, fever, shortness of breath… emergency room. Got it. Thank you again, Doctor Gorga. You've been very helpful. And if you ever need a karaoke singer, you know where to find me. Though I can't promise I won't hic… spontaneously combust mid-song. I think I’ll go lie down now, and try not to think about spicy tagine. .
DOCTOR: A very tempting offer, but I think I’ll pass. Get some rest, and let me know how it goes. Take care now. .
