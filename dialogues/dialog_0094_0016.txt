DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s about my…condition. I’m on a blood thinner, as you can see from my chart, and I’ve been bruising. A lot more than usual, frankly. It’s…unacceptable. I haven’t done anything to cause it, you understand. Just…appearing. It’s quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: I see. Increased bruising while on a blood thinner is certainly something we need to investigate, Mr. Farson. It’s good you brought it to my attention. You’re right to be concerned. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: More than usual. Really, that’s the problem. I haven't been knocking into things, I assure you. I’m a careful man. Always have been. They just…show up. On my arms mostly, and a couple on my legs. Not terribly painful, just…visible. And spreading, I think. It's rather unsightly, to be perfectly honest. It makes me look…fragile.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they're appearing spontaneously, primarily on your arms and legs, and seem to be increasing in number. You haven’t experienced any significant trauma or injury that would explain them. And you’re noticing they’re becoming more widespread. To help me rule out other possibilities, could you tell me when you first noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started…oh, about a month ago, I'd say. Maybe a little longer. It was gradual at first. A small bruise here or there. I dismissed it, thought it was just getting older, you know? But then it just…kept happening. More frequently, larger ones. That's when I decided to come in. I don't like things getting out of control.
DOCTOR: A month or so ago, starting gradually and progressing to more frequent, larger bruises. I understand your concern about it escalating, Mr. Farson. That's a very good reason to get it checked out. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… I have been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I'm a man of a certain age. One gets tired. And my gums… they bleed a bit when I brush my teeth. Not a lot, just a little pink on the brush. Nothing dramatic. Honestly, I hadn’t thought much of it. It’s probably just…old age again.
DOCTOR: Increased fatigue and some bleeding gums, in addition to the bruising. Okay, that's helpful information. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no! No, absolutely not. That hasn't happened. That would be… distressing. No, just the gums. A little pink, as I said. I assure you, I’m quite meticulous about my hygiene. And no, no blood anywhere else. I would know if that was happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No blood in the stool or urine. That's reassuring. Now, let's talk about your medical history. I see you’re on a blood thinner – do you know the name of it, and what condition it's prescribed for?
PATIENT: It’s…Warfarin, I believe. Or something like that. My previous doctor – a very good man, sadly passed away – prescribed it for…atrial fibrillation, I think it was called. Something to do with my heart. It was years ago, honestly. I just keep taking the pills as directed. I haven't the faintest idea what it actually does, to be frank. I just trust that it keeps me from…well, from something bad happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for atrial fibrillation. That’s good to know. And you've been taking it for quite some time, as prescribed. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate removed a few years ago. Routine, really. And I've always had high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. Nothing else… I used to have terrible heartburn, but I take something for that now and it’s under control. I try to stay healthy, you know. I eat reasonably well, though my wife, bless her soul, always made a better cook than I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of prostate removal and managed high blood pressure. And occasional heartburn, currently under control. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. There’s the pill for my blood pressure… Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And the one for the heartburn, Omeprazole. And… oh, yes, a statin for my cholesterol. Atorvastatin. I believe those are all of them. I have them all in a little organizer, thankfully. I'm very organized, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril, Omeprazole, and Atorvastatin, in addition to the Warfarin. That's a very helpful list, Mr. Farson. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I used to get a little itchy with some insect bites when I was a boy, but nothing serious. I’ve eaten everything, travelled everywhere. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm quite robust, generally. It's just this…bruising that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the bruises on your arms and legs. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Though I assure you, there’s nothing physically wrong with me. It's probably just a side effect of the medication, or…something. But very well, examine away. Just be gentle, if you would. I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but within a reasonable range. The bruises are as you described, varying in size and color. They don't appear particularly painful to the touch, which is good. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and Warfarin use, along with the increased bruising and fatigue, I think we need to run some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll check your INR – that’s how we measure how well your Warfarin is working – and also do a complete blood count to see if there are any abnormalities in your blood cells. We will also check your liver function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests, you say? Hmm. Very well. I suppose it's necessary, though I'm not particularly fond of needles. But if you insist… Yes, do whatever tests you deem necessary. Just…try to be quick about it, if you would. And explain the results to me afterwards, in plain English. I don’t understand all that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Farson. I understand your concerns about the needles, and I will make sure the phlebotomist is as quick and gentle as possible. And I promise to explain the results to you in plain English – no medical jargon, I assure you. The lab is just down the hall. They will call me with the results as soon as they are available, usually within a few hours. In the meantime, if you notice any significant bleeding – such as nosebleeds, blood in your urine or stool, or unusually heavy bruising – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Heavens, no. I'll be careful, naturally. No, I don’t suppose I have any questions at the moment. Just…get the tests done quickly, and let me know what you find. I don’t like being kept in suspense. And…thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your attention to this matter.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I understand your concern, and I’ll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. We'll review them together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, please continue taking your medications as prescribed. If anything changes or worsens, don't hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Very well. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
