DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get right to it. I want to have a baby. And I want it to be…easy. No complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know. Fifty-one is not exactly prime baby-making age. So, what can you do to make sure this happens without a lot of fuss?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Angelle. It’s smart to be proactive, and you’re right, timing is important. “Easy” is always the goal, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Precisely. I don’t want a drawn-out ordeal. I’ve seen friends go through…things. Years of appointments, needles, and nothing to show for it. Frankly, it's depressing. I just want to know if I need any of that. Do I need tests? Pills? What's the rundown?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's talk about what we can do to give you the best chance of a healthy pregnancy. At 51, there are a few things we need to consider, and yes, some initial testing is a good idea. It’s not necessarily assuming there will be complications, but it helps us get a baseline and address any potential concerns upfront. First, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Yes. One. A very long time ago. It ended…poorly. And it was a complete disaster. Honestly, I don’t like to talk about it. I was…young. And foolish. It’s why I waited so long to even consider this again. Is knowing the details really necessary? I have Medicare, if that helps. They’ll want a full account of everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I completely understand that it's a difficult topic, Angelle. You absolutely don’t have to go into details if you’re not comfortable. Knowing anything about it is helpful, even just that it ended poorly. It gives me context. And yes, Medicare will likely have forms requesting details, but we can take it slowly. Just knowing it was a difficult experience is enough for now. It does raise some flags, though, and we'll want to be extra careful. Beyond that pregnancy, do you have any other significant medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I was always very healthy. I still am, frankly. I eat well, I walk every day – I cycle, actually, that’s my profession – and I’ve never smoked. I had a bit of a weight problem after the divorce, but I’ve managed that. I’m…robust. Let’s just say that. 86 kilos, and I’m quite tall – 186 centimetres. So, I’m not some frail little thing. I’m not prone to illness. Does that help? It’s just…this whole thing feels a bit ridiculous. I should just be able to get pregnant.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Angelle. Being generally healthy, active, and at a healthy weight for your height is a huge plus. You're right to feel confident in your overall health. It’s a great foundation. And you're right, it should be straightforward. However, at 51, a few things change, and we want to make sure everything is optimal. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't believe in filling my body with chemicals. Just a multivitamin, occasionally, if I feel a bit run down. And sometimes ibuprofen for a sore back from bending over bicycles all day. That's it. I’m very careful about what I put in my body. I eat organic whenever possible. I'm not one of those people who just pops pills for every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Angelle. Avoiding unnecessary medication is always a wise approach. Okay, and just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s a mess. My mother had…difficulties. With everything, really. She was sickly her whole life. And her mother…well, let’s just say there were complications. I don’t even know the details, my aunt doesn’t talk about it. Something about…bleeding. A lot of bleeding. It wasn’t pretty. I try not to dwell on it. It’s why I’m hesitant about all this, frankly. I don't want to end up like them. Is there any point in going into more detail? It's just…unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Angelle. It's perfectly fine if you’re not comfortable going into detail. Knowing there's a history of complications on your mother’s side is helpful, and it does explain your hesitancy. We'll definitely take that into consideration. It means we might want to be a little more thorough with some testing. Okay, one last bit of background before we move on to a physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I run a bicycle repair shop. It’s a lot of physical work, bending over, lifting things. I live alone, as you can probably tell. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't really socialize much. It’s a quiet life. I’m very independent. I eat a healthy diet, mostly organic foods. I try to be sensible. I'm not a risk-taker. Does that cover it? Honestly, it's a bit boring, if I'm being honest. But it's my boring.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Angelle. It sounds like you lead a very active and sensible life, and your independence is admirable. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health and risk factors. Okay, so before we discuss any specific tests or potential next steps, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a standard check-up – blood pressure, heart and lung sounds, and a general abdominal exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I have a customer waiting for a repair, and I’m losing money every minute I’m here. I just want to know what tests I need and how long this is going to take. And preferably, nothing invasive. I have absolutely no interest in…unnecessary procedures. Let’s just focus on the basics. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Angelle. I completely respect your time and preferences. We'll focus on the basics, and I’ll explain everything as we go. No unnecessary procedures, I assure you. If you'll just hop up on the table, we can start with your blood pressure. It’s a quick and painless check. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I really don’t like doctors’ offices. They always smell like…disinfectant and worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax, Angelle. Deep breaths. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not significantly. It could be due to the stress of the appointment, or just a normal fluctuation. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezing or crackles. Good. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Everything feels normal so far. Okay. Everything sounds good, Angelle. A little elevated blood pressure, but nothing alarming. Now, to give you a clearer picture of your overall health, I would recommend a few blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and an anti-Mullerian hormone level. The AMH level will give us an idea of your ovarian reserve. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ovarian reserve? What does that even mean? Honestly, you doctors always talk in code. Just tell me, plain and simple, what these tests will show. And how much they're going to cost. I'm not made of money. And will I have to come back multiple times? Because I really don't have time for a drawn-out process. Just give it to me straight. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask for clarity, Angelle. I apologize for using medical jargon. Let me explain, plain and simple. The complete blood count will check your overall blood health – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The comprehensive metabolic panel will check your kidney and liver function, as well as your blood sugar and electrolyte levels. The thyroid test will check if your thyroid is functioning properly, as thyroid issues can affect fertility. The AMH level, which is the most important test in your case, will give us an idea of how many eggs you have remaining. It’s a good indicator of your potential for pregnancy. As for the cost, the tests should be covered by Medicare, but there might be a copay. I’ll have the receptionist confirm the exact amount for you. And you'll only need to come back once to get the results, Angelle. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan tailored to your needs. It won't be a drawn-out process, I assure you. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Better. But what if the results are…bad? What if I don’t have enough eggs? What then? I don’t want to hear about options I don’t want. I just want to know if it’s possible, and if it’s possible, what’s the simplest way to make it happen. No IVF, no donors, no…complicated things. If the answer is no, just tell me no. I’d rather know now than waste my time and money. And frankly, I don’t want a lecture about the risks. I understand the risks. I’m fifty-one years old, not a naive teenager.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Angelle. You’re right to be direct, and I respect your wishes. If the results show a low ovarian reserve, it doesn’t necessarily mean pregnancy is impossible, but it might mean the chances are lower, and it might take longer. In that case, we can discuss options to optimize your chances, such as timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination. However, if your ovarian reserve is very low, and you’re not comfortable with IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies, we will be honest with you. If the chances are extremely low, we won't push you to pursue options you’re not comfortable with. I promise we’ll give you the honest truth, without any pressure or judgment. We can focus on natural conception methods and optimize your overall health to give you the best possible chance, or we can discuss other options, such as accepting that pregnancy might not be possible at this time. We won’t waste your time or money on methods you're not comfortable with. Would you like me to go ahead and order the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Order the tests. Let's just get it over with. And tell the receptionist to call me as soon as they have the results. I have a business to run. Stop wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Angelle. The orders are submitted. The receptionist will call you as soon as the results are available. It usually takes a few days. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And thank you for being so direct. It helps me provide you with the best possible care. We'll talk soon.
