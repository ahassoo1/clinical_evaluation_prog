DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… honestly, I’m not entirely sure what brings me here. My daughter insisted. She said something about… not being able to see or hear properly? It all happened rather suddenly, and frankly, I have a very busy schedule. I’m a surgeon, you know. Important work. I don't have time for… this.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your daughter is concerned about some changes she's noticed in your vision and hearing. That’s very thoughtful of her. Even busy surgeons need to take care of themselves. And it's good you came in to get it checked out. When did you first start noticing these changes—the difficulty with seeing or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I’m terrible with dates. It was… sometime last week, I suppose. Perhaps a few days before that? It’s all a blur, really. I was in the operating room, naturally, and… things just seemed a little fuzzy. And the beeping… it was muffled. It could have been the equipment, honestly. We have rather old machines. It wasn't that noticeable, if you ask me. My staff didn’t mention anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, sometime last week. And it started while you were in surgery?
PATIENT: Yes, as I said. In the operating room. Though, I suppose it could have been before that. I really don’t pay attention to such trivial things unless it interferes with my work. It’s probably just stress, you know? A demanding profession. One doesn’t simply have time to catalog every little… sensation. It's very inconvenient, all this questioning.
DOCTOR: I understand you have a busy schedule, Ms. Julie. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you describe the fuzzy vision in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… blurry. Like looking through a dirty window, perhaps? Everything isn’t sharp, I suppose. Though, my eyesight has never been perfect. I wear glasses, as you can see. It’s probably just a change in prescription. Honestly, Doctor, I doubt it’s anything serious. I’m a very healthy woman. I eat well – when I have the time – and I’m quite active. It's likely just age. I’m not a spring chicken, you know. 66 years old. Things happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, like looking through a dirty window. And you wear glasses currently?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I wear glasses! As I just said. I need them to see properly, naturally. I’ve had them for… oh, goodness, decades, I suppose. Since I was a young woman. It's not a new development, Doctor. Are you even listening? This is getting rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am listening, Ms. Julie. And I apologize if I seemed to be repeating questions. It's important to get a complete picture. You mentioned the beeping in the operating room was muffled. Has the muffled hearing persisted outside of work?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't made a particular point of listening for muffled sounds, Doctor. I've been busy! But... now that you mention it, perhaps my daughter was speaking rather loudly the other evening? She claims I didn't respond when she called me for dinner. But she is often… excitable. So it’s difficult to say whether I didn’t hear or she was simply being dramatic. It’s probably nothing. Truly. I’m quite certain it's just age, or stress, or possibly my daughter's volume. Can we be done now? I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just to be thorough, I'd like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in your ears, headaches, or any changes in your balance recently?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Doctor, are you simply going through a checklist? I’ve told you, I’m a surgeon. I’m perfectly healthy. I don’t have time for dizziness or ringing noises or… balance problems. I need a steady hand for my work. Obviously. No, I have not experienced any of those… symptoms. Honestly, I find this entire process rather insulting. Are you suggesting I’m incapable of performing my duties? This is preposterous. Can we please wrap this up? I really must get back to the hospital. I have lives to save.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. I'm not questioning your ability to perform your duties, but it’s standard practice to ask these questions to get a complete understanding of your situation. Before we move on, could you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past, or any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s been decades. I've had a rather full life, you see. Surgeries… I’ve performed countless surgeries. As for having them… There was a tonsillectomy as a child. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… oh. A hysterectomy, many years ago. But that was… well, it doesn’t matter. It was a long time ago. Everything else… I really can’t recall. My focus is on fixing people, not on my own… ailments. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm wasting valuable time here. .
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a hysterectomy. Thank you. And what about any medications you currently take, or have taken recently?
