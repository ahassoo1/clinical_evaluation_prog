DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been botherin’ me for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just… hack, hack. It’s wearin’ me out, especially at night.
DOCTOR: Right. A dry cough, no mucus. And it's worse at night, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Worse when I’m layin’ down, definitely. Makes it hard to sleep. I… I used to have a little cough every now and then, but not like this. Not for this long. Seems like months, maybe? Time… time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Months, alright. And have you noticed anything else that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, dust seems to bother it. I do a little work in the garage, fixin’ things… old cars mostly. Not as much as I used to, but… yeah, dust. And sometimes when it’s cold, real cold. But mostly just… always there, kinda.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, dust and cold air seem to aggravate it. Do you have any shortness of breath with this cough, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I get a little winded when I walk up the stairs, but I always have. Old age, you know? Chest pain… no, not exactly pain. Just… a tightness sometimes, when I cough real hard. A little uncomfortable, but not painful. I don’t think so, anyway. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had a fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. My wife… my late wife used to always check my temperature. I haven’t had anyone check it in… well, a long time. Chills, no. Night sweats… maybe a little? I do sleep with a lot of blankets, it gets cold. But I always have, even when it’s not cold. I can’t really say for sure, Doctor. I just… get warm. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at your records here… Alright, it says you haven’t been seen at this clinic before. And no listed allergies?
PATIENT: No, I don't think I've been here before. And allergies... not that I know of. Never really paid much attention to those things. My wife always took care of that sort of stuff. She knew everything. I… I don’t recall ever having allergies, no. Just the usual sniffles when it’s cold.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago. But the doctor took me off of it. Said I was feelin’ better. And… sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Just ibuprofen, I think. Over-the-counter stuff. Nothing regular, though. Not anymore. I try not to take too many pills. They don’t always do much, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. My wife… she wouldn't have allowed it. Bad for your health, she always said. I used to be around it, when I was younger, workin' with folks who did, but I never took it up myself. Never had the urge, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular, Doctor. Not like I used to. My wife… well, we didn’t drink much. It wasn’t really our thing. Maybe a toast on Christmas, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I’m not as steady as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could sit here for me. I’m just going to listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look in your throat and ears. Nothing to worry about. Deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath… There. Is that alright? It feels a little tight in here, you know? Not painful, just… tight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound a bit… wheezy, yes. And I can hear some diminished breath sounds, especially on the lower lobes. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be from the cough, or just a little anxiety. Your throat looks a little dry, but no obvious signs of infection. Ears are clear. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Okay. We'll need to do a chest x-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and I might want to check your oxygen levels.
PATIENT: An x-ray, huh? Well, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I haven’t had one of those in… goodness, I don’t even remember. And my oxygen levels? Is that… bad? I get a little short of breath sometimes, like I said, walkin’ up the stairs. But I figured that was just old age. Is it serious, Doctor? I just want to… be able to sleep again.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Pavlovic, but we need to rule things out. The x-ray will help us see if there’s any congestion, or anything else going on in your lungs. And checking your oxygen levels will tell us if you're getting enough air. It’s standard procedure when someone has a persistent cough like yours, especially with a bit of wheezing. The shortness of breath you feel could be related to a number of things, and the x-ray and oxygen test will give us some answers. Let’s get those tests done first, and then we’ll talk about the results. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you set up for the x-ray. It's quick and painless, I promise. Would you be able to walk down to the radiology department alright, or would you like a wheelchair?
PATIENT: I think I can walk, Doctor. Just a little slow, maybe. I used to be a strong man, you know. Worked with cars all my life. But… well, things change. Just let me take a moment. And thank you, Doctor. For takin’ the time. It’s good to know someone’s lookin’ into it.
DOCTOR: Alright, take your time. I’ll have the nurse come in and assist you. Nurse, could you please come to exam room three and assist Mr. Pavlovic to radiology for a chest x-ray?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I… I hope it’s nothin’ too serious. It’s just… hard to breathe sometimes. Makes me tired. My wife… she always knew what to do.
