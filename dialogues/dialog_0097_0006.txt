DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up… some blood. It scared me a little, so I thought I should come and see what is happening. It’s not a lot of blood, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is concerning, and you did the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. It’s good you’re taking this seriously. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a bit more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe a week ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little tickle in my throat. But then, a few days ago, I noticed… the blood. It happens when I cough hard, usually. Not every time, but most times. It’s… bright red. And it doesn't hurt, really. Just… surprising. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, started as a tickle, now with bright red blood when you cough hard, not with every cough… and no pain. That’s helpful. No, coughing up blood isn’t normal, but the fact that it's bright red and doesn’t seem to be associated with pain is… a little reassuring, though we still need to figure out what’s causing it. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little tired, maybe? But I always feel a little tired. And… I think I might have a small fever, but I haven’t taken my temperature. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. I have not lost my appetite, and I am sleeping okay. Oh! And I have been a little… stuffy, I think. Like a cold, but very mild. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, mild fatigue, possible low-grade fever, no chest pain or shortness of breath, good appetite and sleep, and a bit of nasal congestion. Okay. Have you had any similar episodes in the past, or anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… completely new. I have had colds, of course. And the flu, a few times. But nothing like this. I have never coughed up blood before. It really frightened me, Doctor. I… my husband, he… he had some lung problems once, and… well, it made me worry. I hope it is nothing serious. Is it possible it is just a bad infection?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, especially with your husband’s history. It's good you’re being proactive about getting this checked out. It is possible it's a bad infection, but we need to investigate further to be sure. Now, let’s go through some of your medical background. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. And… I have high blood pressure, but it’s well controlled with medication. I see my regular doctor every six months, and everything is usually fine. I do not have diabetes, and I do not have asthma. Oh, and… I had a surgery on my knee a few years ago, but that is all. I am a little worried about the blood pressure medication, could that be causing it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removal as a teenager, well-controlled high blood pressure, knee surgery a few years ago… and you’re wondering if the blood pressure medication could be related. That’s a good question, and something we’ll definitely consider. Some blood pressure medications can sometimes cause a cough, though rarely with blood. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medication, Lisinopril. And… I take a multivitamin every day. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, and I drink a lot of water. I do not smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol. I hope that helps. Should I stop taking the Lisinopril until we figure this out? I do not want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and a daily multivitamin. That's helpful to know. And good on you for the healthy lifestyle choices! It's good you asked about stopping the Lisinopril. We probably don’t need to stop it right away, but let's keep it in mind. I’d like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… very sensible. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. Listening to my lungs sounds good. I… I just want to know what is happening, and make sure it is nothing too serious. Is it… is it possible it could be something bad? I know you probably cannot tell me without looking, but I am a little anxious.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Jeannemarie. It's good you’re asking these questions. It is possible it could be something serious, but it’s also very possible it’s something relatively minor. That’s why we need to do the exam and potentially some tests to get a clearer picture. Okay, let’s start with listening to your lungs. If you could please take a deep breath in and out for me… and then cough when you’re ready. Don't hold anything back.
PATIENT: Okay. There. Is that… helpful? It was not much, I am sorry. I do not want to bother you. It is just… worrying.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Jeannemarie. It is helpful. I appreciate you coughing when I asked. Okay. Your breathing sounds relatively clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing on both sides. Your heart sounds normal, and your blood pressure is 130/80 – well controlled. I’m going to check your throat and listen to your ears quickly. Your throat looks a little red, but nothing dramatic. Your ears are clear. No obvious signs of infection there. Given what you've told me, and what I’ve found in the exam, it could be a few things. A mild upper respiratory infection with some irritation, a possible side effect from the Lisinopril, or something a bit more… we’ll need to rule out. I’d like to order a chest X-ray, and a complete blood count to check for infection and anemia. Do you have any allergies I need to be aware of?
PATIENT: Okay. A chest X-ray and a blood test. That sounds… reasonable. And yes, I am allergic to penicillin. Very allergic. I get a rash, and I have trouble breathing. It is very important to remember that. I am not allergic to anything else, as far as I know. Would the X-ray show… if it was something serious? I am a little scared, Doctor. I apologize for being so anxious.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted, thank you. That’s very important information, and we’ll be careful to avoid it. It's perfectly okay to be anxious, Jeannemarie. It's natural when you’re dealing with something unknown. The chest X-ray can show a lot. It can help us rule out pneumonia, look for any masses or fluid in the lungs, and identify other potential problems. The blood test will tell us if there’s an infection, and if you're losing blood. I’m going to write you a referral for the X-ray. You can go to the radiology department at St. Luke’s Hospital – it’s just down the street. They'll need the referral from me, and your insurance information. Once the results are back, they’ll send them to me, and I’ll give you a call to discuss them. Should take a day or two. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – like high fever, severe shortness of breath, or significant chest pain – please go to the emergency room immediately, do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. St. Luke’s Hospital, and I need the referral from you. And if things get worse, the emergency room. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You have been very kind, and helpful. I… I feel a little better, knowing we are doing something about it. And thank you for remembering the penicillin allergy. That is very important. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like… rest? Or drink more water? Or… anything? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. You’re right to ask about what else you can do. For now, rest is a good idea. And yes, drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – will help keep your airways moist and make it easier to cough up any mucus. Avoid irritants like smoke or strong perfumes. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with any discomfort, but avoid aspirin. And, just listen to your body. If you're feeling tired, rest. I’ll give you a written summary of everything we discussed today, including the referral information and these instructions. And remember, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that is… everything. You have been very thorough, Doctor. And very kind. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and explain everything so clearly. I will go to St. Luke’s Hospital as soon as possible, and I will call if I have any questions. Thank you again, Doctor Georgiou. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I’m glad I could help. You take care, and don’t worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. You have a good day too, and please do call if anything changes. .
