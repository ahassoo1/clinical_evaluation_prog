DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin can be incredibly frustrating. A few weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe about three or four weeks now. It comes and goes, but when it comes, oh boy. It’s all over, really – my arms, my legs, even my back. It doesn’t look bad, not really, just…red and bumpy sometimes. And always, always itchy. It’s hard to sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: I can imagine that would be very disruptive to your sleep. And you mentioned it’s red and bumpy – is it more of a flat rash, or raised bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm…it's not really flat, more like little…welts, I guess? Not big ones, just small. And they fade after a while, then come back somewhere else. It’s like they’re moving around, if that makes sense. It’s really strange. I haven’t changed anything – no new soaps, no new lotions, nothing I can think of.
DOCTOR: That is strange. Moving around can be a clue. Have you noticed if anything specifically triggers the itching, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I… I don't think so. I mean, it's bad when I'm hot, definitely. Like if I've been out in the sun, or after a shower. But it happens even when I'm just sitting here, doing nothing. I haven't been eating anything different, either. It just…started.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said it's been happening on your arms, legs, and back. Anywhere else?
PATIENT: Let me think... yes, actually, it's on my chest too, a little bit. Not as bad as my back, but I notice it when I’m getting dressed. And…oh! My elbows. It’s really itchy on the backs of my elbows. That's about it, I think. It hasn't gotten on my face or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Have you tried anything at all to relieve the itching – over-the-counter creams, lotions, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, I did. I used some of that calamine lotion, the pink stuff. It helped a little bit for a few minutes, but then it just wore off. And I tried some of that hydrocortisone cream, the one for bug bites. That didn’t really do much at all, honestly. I’m starting to get really frustrated with it. It's just constant!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Constant itching is miserable. Okay, let’s do a quick exam. I’m going to take a look at your skin and see what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good, Doctor. Please do. Hopefully you can figure out what’s causing this. I really appreciate you taking the time to look at it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some scattered areas of erythema – that’s redness – and small papules, which are those little bumps you described, primarily on your arms, legs, and back. They don't seem to be actively blistering or weeping. There’s some excoriation on your back, meaning some scratching. Your elbows do show some lichenification - that is, thickened, leathery skin, consistent with chronic rubbing or scratching. No obvious signs of infection. It does seem like you’ve been scratching quite a bit. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I have high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. And I had a gallbladder removed years ago, but that was no problem. I used to have terrible allergies, but those seem to have calmed down as I’ve gotten older. Oh, and I was divorced a long time ago…does that count? I don't really have any serious medical problems, I don’t think. And I’m not allergic to any medications that I know of.
DOCTOR: No, a divorce doesn’t count as a medical problem! Thank you for sharing. Just focusing on the medical side of things. So, high blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a gallbladder removal years ago. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, every day. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take ibuprofen. But I haven’t taken any in the last couple of weeks, because it hasn’t been bothering me too much lately. I also take a vitamin D supplement, just because the doctor said my levels were a little low. That's about it, I think. I try to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, ibuprofen as needed, and a vitamin D supplement. And do you have any family history of skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother, she had very sensitive skin. She always complained about rashes and itching, but I don’t think it was ever diagnosed as anything specific. Just…sensitive. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, she had some sort of skin problem on her hands, but I don’t remember what it was. It was a long time ago. Nothing serious, that I know of. Mostly just dry skin, I think. We weren't really ones to talk about medical things.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of sensitive skin, but no specific diagnosed skin conditions that you're aware of. Now, a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to smoke, but he quit years ago. I always hated it. It smelled terrible, and I didn't want anything to do with it. And I don't drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. That's about it. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And do you have any pets at home?
PATIENT: Yes, I do! I have a little chihuahua named Chico. He's a sweetheart, but a bit of a yapper. He’s always under my feet. He doesn’t go outside much, mostly just stays inside with me. He’s very well-behaved, though. He doesn’t shed much, either. I keep the house very clean, so I don’t think it’s anything to do with him. But he is always snuggling with me… Maybe it’s his fur? But I doubt it.
DOCTOR: Okay, one chihuahua, mostly indoors. And finally, can you tell me about any recent travel, or exposure to new detergents, soaps, lotions, or chemicals?
PATIENT: No, no travel recently. I haven’t been anywhere in years! And I haven’t changed anything about my routine, really. Same soaps, same lotions, same everything. I’ve been using the same products for years. That’s why I’m so confused! I haven’t done anything differently. It just…started. It’s very frustrating, Doctor. I feel like I’m going crazy trying to figure out what’s causing it. I really appreciate you trying to help me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carla. It is frustrating when something comes on without a clear cause. Based on everything you’ve told me – the scattered papules, the itching, the lack of recent changes, your medication list, your family history, and your social history – my leading suspicion is that this could be pruritus, or generalized itching, possibly related to a few different things. It could be a reaction to something subtle, a side effect of the Lisinopril – although it's not a common one, it’s possible – or age-related changes in your skin. To help narrow things down, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests: a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to check your thyroid function. Sometimes thyroid issues can cause itching. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests are fine. I just want to figure out what’s causing this and get some relief. It’s just…so uncomfortable. Where do I go to get those tests done? And do I need to fast beforehand? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. You do need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, so no food or drinks other than water. You can drink water. We’ll get the lab order sent over to the lab technician, and they’ll take care of everything. It usually takes just a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a topical corticosteroid cream – hydrocortisone 2.5%, apply it to the itchy areas twice daily. It should help reduce the inflammation and relieve the itching. It’s available over the counter, but I'll write you a prescription just in case. I also recommend using a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer after each shower to keep your skin hydrated. Dry skin can worsen the itching. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good, Doctor. Hydrocortisone and a good moisturizer. I can definitely do that. And I’ll remember to fast for the blood tests. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me and figure out what’s going on. I really appreciate it. How long will it take to get the results back? And should I call the office if things don’t improve?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. I’m glad I could help. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. The lab technician will let us know when they are available. Once we have them, we’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. If your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, blisters, or signs of infection, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Otherwise, we'll wait for the results and schedule that follow-up. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That covers everything. Thank you again for your help. I feel much better knowing we're trying to figure this out. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I hope you find some relief.
