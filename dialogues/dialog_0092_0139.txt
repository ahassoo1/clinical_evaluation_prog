DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. I... I need check for referee. For fitness. I want to be sure I'm okay to do it. It's... important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A fitness checkup is a great idea. When you say “referee,” are you referring to becoming a sports referee, or are you preparing for a fitness test of some kind?
PATIENT: Sports referee, yes. Basketball mostly. I... I used to do it before. But then... things happened. Now I want to start again. Need to be sure body is okay.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very responsible of you to want to ensure you're physically fit before returning to refereeing. That’s excellent. To get a better picture of your current health, could you tell me a little bit about what “things happened” refers to?
PATIENT: It's... my wife. She... she passed away. A year ago. I... I stopped everything after that. Just…stopped. Now I feel better. Want to do something again. But I don't want to... risk anything. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Shanor, I absolutely understand. That's a significant life event, and it's perfectly natural to want to take things slowly and cautiously as you resume activities. I'm very glad to hear you're feeling better and are taking this step. To help me assess your fitness level, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly since your wife passed?
PATIENT: Not really. No. I…I didn't feel like it. Sorry. I just…avoided it. Everything. Now...now I think I need to. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Shanor, that’s perfectly okay. It’s more important that you’re here now. We’ll get everything caught up. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. I don't think so. Never told about anything like that. I…I feel okay. Sometimes a little tired. But I work hard. Repairing…the bricks. It's heavy work. Other than that... nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospital. Broken arm when I was small, maybe? A long time ago. Nothing serious. Just…fixed it. The doctor put it in…a cast. That's all. I don't remember much.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Always make me feel…funny. Just water and…sometimes tea. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything. Unless it's…bad. You know? Spoiled food. But that’s not an allergy. Just…bad food.
DOCTOR: I understand what you mean. No known allergies, that's good. Now, briefly, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: My…mother, she had heart trouble. When she was old. My father…he worked very hard. Always tired. But…he never went to the doctor. Just…rested. I don't know about anything else. We…didn't talk much about it. They lived far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked. Sometimes I drink tea. Very little. And no…no drugs. Never. I need to be strong. For…for work. And for…this. Refereeing. It needs a clear head.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Shanor. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you describe what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Okay. I wake up early. Around six. Eat a little breakfast. Then go to work. Repairing the bricks. It’s hard. Lifting, carrying, hot. I work until five. Then…I eat dinner. Watch some TV. Go to bed. Sometimes I read. Not much. Mostly just…tired. That’s my day. Very simple.
DOCTOR: I see. So, physically demanding work. Good to know. Now, finally, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations recently?
PATIENT: No. None of that. I…sometimes a little tired, like I said. But not…pain. Or dizziness. I…feel strong. Mostly. Just need to be sure. That’s why I’m here. Before I…start again. Is that okay? Can we…do the test now? I want to finish quickly, if possible. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Shanor, that’s perfectly understandable, and you’re doing the right thing by getting checked out. And yes, we can proceed with the physical exam now. It will help us get a better understanding of your current health status. It shouldn't take too long. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in…and out.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that okay? I try to be quiet.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Shanor. Your heart sounds regular and within normal limits. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it…high? I worry sometimes. From the hard work.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/85. It's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your physical activity. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to check your pulse. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, also within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. No, nothing feels…wrong. It's okay. Just…tired. But that's normal, right? From the work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s normal, Mr. Shanor. Your abdomen sounds normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I’m going to gently tap on your knees.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that…good? I don't know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Finally, I’ll take a quick look at your throat and ears. Open your mouth and say "Ahhh."
PATIENT: Ahhh. Is everything okay? I…don’t get sick often. Just…tired.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal, Mr. Shanor. Your throat and ears are clear. Overall, your physical exam is largely normal. Your slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor, but it's not immediately alarming given your work. Do you have any questions about what I’ve done so far?
PATIENT: No… not really. So…I can do the referee thing? Is that okay? Just…need to be sure. And…the monitor. What does that mean? Do I need pills? I don’t want pills.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Mr. Shanor. Based on the exam today, and considering your history, I believe it is reasonable for you to resume refereeing. However, I do recommend a few things. The "monitor" means checking your blood pressure regularly – perhaps once a week – to see if it stays stable or rises. You can do this at home with a blood pressure cuff, or at a pharmacy. As for pills, no, I'm not recommending any medication at this time. But I do advise some lifestyle adjustments. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and trying to manage stress. Those can all affect blood pressure. I’d also like you to get an ECG – an electrocardiogram – just to get a baseline reading of your heart's electrical activity. It’s a simple, non-invasive test. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: ECG? Is that…expensive? I don’t…have much money. And stress…it's hard to not be stressed when you work hard all day. But okay. I can try. Sleep…I try to sleep. Sometimes it's hard. But okay. And the blood pressure…I can check it at the pharmacy? That's good. Not pills. Okay. That’s…good. Can I…start refereeing now? Soon?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Shanor, an ECG can sometimes be a bit expensive, but it’s a one-time test for a baseline. We can give you a referral to a reasonably priced clinic. And you’re right, stress is difficult to manage, but even small changes can help. And yes, based on what we've discussed, and with the recommendation of getting the ECG, it is reasonable for you to start refereeing again soon. Perhaps start with one game a week and see how you feel. Listen to your body. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or excessive fatigue, stop immediately and seek medical attention. I’ll write you a referral for the ECG, and a note for your primary care physician outlining our discussion. I’ll also provide a handout on managing blood pressure without medication. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been…very helpful. Not pills. That's…good. I need to go now. I have things to do. Refereeing. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Shanor. I'm glad I could help. Remember to listen to your body, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here are the referral and handout. Best of luck with your refereeing! And please, take care.
