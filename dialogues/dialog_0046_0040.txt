DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think you call it. And… I seem to be getting urinary tract infections quite often lately. It’s been a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Espinueva. Pain in your flank and frequent urinary tract infections – I understand. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, could you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, mostly on my right side, though sometimes I feel it on the left as well. It doesn’t come on suddenly, it just… builds up. And it can be quite uncomfortable, especially when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And when did you first notice this flank pain, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It's been… well, a few years now, I suppose. It started off very mild, just a little niggle here and there. I didn’t pay much attention to it at first, just thought it was old age creeping up on me! But it’s definitely gotten worse over the last year or so. I’d say… maybe about a year ago it started becoming more frequent and bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain has been present for about a year, gradually worsening. And you mentioned frequent UTIs. How often would you say you’re experiencing those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It feels like every few months now, Doctor. It used to be once a year, maybe. But lately… three or four times a year, easily. It’s quite inconvenient, and sometimes a bit frightening, if I’m honest. I always have to get antibiotics, and I worry about those, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the frequent UTIs and the need for antibiotics. That is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me get a more complete picture, could you describe what happens when you have a UTI?
PATIENT: Well, it’s the usual, I suppose. A burning sensation when I go to the toilet, and a constant urge to go, even when there's nothing there. Sometimes a bit of a lower abdominal pain too, and the urine… well, it’s cloudy and often has a funny smell. It makes me feel quite weak and tired as well. It usually lasts a few days after starting the antibiotics.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Espinueva. That is very helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have something called… polycystic kidney disease. My doctor told me a long time ago. I don’t really understand it fully, to be honest. Something about lots of little cysts growing on my kidneys. It’s been monitored for years, but it hasn’t caused too much trouble until recently, I think.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease, okay. And do you know when you were first diagnosed with that, approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… it must have been… oh, goodness. Back in the early 2000s, I believe. Perhaps 2003 or 2004? I was in my fifties then. They found it during a routine check-up, something showed up on a scan. They said it was mild at the time, and just needed regular monitoring. I’ve been seeing a nephrologist over the years, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That's helpful to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never had any surgeries. Just the usual… dentist visits, you know? Nothing major at all. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, I believe. But as for anything like kidney problems… not that I know of. No one in my immediate family has ever been diagnosed with kidney disease. My siblings, I have a brother and a sister, they're both still alive and reasonably healthy, as far as I know. We don't talk as much as we used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your social history, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I live alone, Doctor. Never married. I used to work as a receptionist, but I retired a few years ago. Mostly I spend my time gardening and reading. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with my dinner sometimes. Perhaps a glass or two a few times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. Never had any allergic reactions to anything. I’ve taken various medications over the years, for minor things like colds and flu, but never any problems. I’m quite fortunate in that regard too, I suppose. I haven't had any skin rashes or breathing difficulties after taking any medication.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and gently palpate your abdomen and flanks to see if we can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm used to the doctor's visits, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. I'm just feeling around for any tenderness or masses. I do notice some mild tenderness to palpation on your right flank, but no obvious masses. On the left side, it’s less prominent. Do you feel any pain as I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s where it hurts. On my right side, definitely. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like I described. It’s a bit more noticeable when you press. And yes, a little bit on the left as well, but not as bad. It's… reassuring to know you’re feeling it too, though. Sometimes I wonder if I’m imagining it. It’s just been going on for so long.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that we’ve been able to identify the area of tenderness. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and look at your lower extremities. Everything appears normal there. Given your history of polycystic kidney disease, recurrent UTIs, and the flank pain, I’d like to order some lab tests. I want to check your kidney function, look for any signs of infection, and get a more detailed urine analysis. We should also consider a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at your kidneys and rule out any other potential causes of the pain. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever you think is best, I’m happy to go along with. A CT scan… will that involve any injections? I’m not terribly fond of needles, you see. But if it’s necessary to get to the bottom of things, I’m willing. I just… prefer to avoid them if possible. But yes, please, go ahead with the tests. I just want to feel better, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the injection, Mr. Espinueva. Yes, a CT scan typically involves intravenous contrast dye to help visualize the kidneys better. We can discuss alternatives if you're particularly anxious about it, but the contrast dye provides the most accurate imaging. We can also consider pre-medicating you with something to help you relax if you're concerned. For now, let's proceed with the blood work and urine analysis, and then we can discuss the CT scan in more detail. I’ll write the orders for those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. Let's do the blood work and urine analysis first. And then we can talk about the CT scan… perhaps with some pre-medication, if that's possible? I do appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, and offering alternatives. It makes me feel much more comfortable. Yes, please, I’ll go to the lab now. Thank you for your time, and for listening so patiently.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions while you’re at the lab. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Get well soon, Mr. Espinueva.
PATIENT: .
