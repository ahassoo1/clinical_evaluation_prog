DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my joints, mostly. They get…stuck, in the mornings. It’s hard to explain. Not painful, exactly, just… stiff. Like an old door that needs oil, maybe? I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. Things aren’t what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Stuck” is a good way to describe it. And it’s common for these things to come on gradually. You mentioned it’s worse in the mornings – does it improve throughout the day?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… better as I move around. A lot better. By the afternoon, I usually forget all about it. It's just…getting out of bed is the hard part. I used to just jump right up, but now… well, now I have to… wiggle things a bit. And sometimes I need a little help from my chair. It’s not a big deal, usually. But it’s…annoying, I guess. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. And it's good you're acknowledging it's becoming bothersome. So, primarily the stiffness is in the mornings, improves with movement, and you’d say it’s not so much pain as it is difficulty getting going?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly it! Difficulty getting going. That’s a good way to put it. And it’s not like…sharp pain, or anything. Just…tight. Like everything is…bundled up. I mostly just work with kids, you know? Running around with them keeps me moving, so it doesn’t bother me too much during the day. But… I guess I’m getting older, aren’t I? Everything creaks a little more each year.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, things do change as we get older! And staying active like you are is wonderful. Okay, let's get some more information. Besides your joints, have you noticed any other symptoms – any swelling, redness, warmth in those joints?
PATIENT: Hmm… swelling… not that I’ve noticed. Redness… no. Warmth… maybe a little sometimes, but I just figured that was from… moving around with the kids, you know? They’re very energetic! I don't think it's anything… serious, is it? I haven't been feeling sick or anything, if that helps. Just the…stiffness. Mostly. It’s hard to remember everything, honestly. Things… slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful that you haven’t noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth. And not feeling generally unwell is good to know. You mentioned things slip your mind – has that been a recent change, or something you’ve experienced for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a while, I think. Not new. It's just…getting worse, maybe? My daughter says I repeat myself sometimes. And I forget where I put my glasses… a lot. It’s… frustrating. But I don’t think it’s related to my joints, is it? I just thought I was getting forgetful. Old age, probably. My husband… he used to say I was always a bit scatterbrained, but… that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It’s good to have a complete picture. And it's not uncommon for memory changes to happen gradually. Let’s shift gears a bit. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I had… high blood pressure, I think? A long time ago. The doctor put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel… funny. And… I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that healed up okay. Other than that… not really. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my fruits and vegetables. Mostly. My daughter worries about me, though. She's always telling me to go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing your medical history, Lilliana. High blood pressure is important to know. Do you remember approximately when you were diagnosed with it, and for how long you were on medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that was… years and years ago. Maybe… ten years? More than ten, I think. The doctor, Dr. Peterson, he retired a long time ago. He put me on a little white pill, but it made me feel dizzy. So I stopped taking it after a few months. I didn’t really like taking pills, anyway. I figured I’d just watch my salt intake. My husband, George, he always said I worried too much. He's… gone now. It was a long time ago. I'm rambling, aren’t I? I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Lilliana. It’s helpful for me to get a complete picture. And I understand it's difficult to recall details, especially with time passing and changes in your life. Okay, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – arthritis, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had…arthritis, I think? In her hands, mostly. She had a lot of trouble opening jars. And my father, he had…heart trouble. He had a bad heart attack when he was still young. That’s why I try to stay active, you know? Don’t want to end up like him. My brother, he's still alive, but he has… diabetes. He’s not very good at taking care of himself. That’s all I can really remember, honestly. It was a long time ago, and… things just blur together after a while. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilliana. This is all very helpful. And it sounds like there is some family history of arthritis and heart disease, which is good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. George… my husband, he used to smoke a little, but he stopped years ago. Said it wasn't good for him. I always told him that! And I certainly don’t drink much, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. But that’s about it. I like to keep things… clean and healthy, you know? And I try to get enough sleep, even though… sometimes it’s hard. My joints ache a little when it’s cold, that’s about it. Honestly. I really don’t do anything unhealthy. I’m a good girl, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Lilliana. And it sounds like you take very good care of yourself. Okay, I think I have a good understanding of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your joints, listen to your heart, and get a general sense of how you’re doing. It will only take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A few minutes is no problem. Just… be gentle, okay? My joints are a little… sensitive this morning. And… I might wiggle a bit. Just a warning! I don’t like being poked and prodded too much, if you don’t mind. But I want to get to the bottom of this stiffness, so… go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilliana. I will be as gentle as possible. And please let me know immediately if anything is uncomfortable. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll take a look at your joints – starting with your fingers and wrists. I’ll just be gently moving them around, seeing if I can feel any swelling or tenderness. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. Pulse is 78 and regular. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given that you mentioned you haven't been taking your blood pressure medication. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. I’m noticing some mild tenderness on the base of your index finger on both hands, and some slight crepitus – that's a little crackling sound – when you bend them. No visible swelling or redness, though. Range of motion is slightly limited, but it doesn't seem severely restricted. Wrists feel stable and don't show any signs of inflammation. Your other joints – elbows, shoulders, knees – appear normal. Everything moves smoothly with no significant pain or discomfort. I'm also listening to your heart now. Sounds are regular with no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Crepitus… is that bad? My fingers do feel a little stiff sometimes. And they ache when it rains, you know? It's probably just old age, isn't it? My mother had terrible arthritis, so maybe it's just… in my genes. I don’t want to bother you with all my old lady problems. I’m sure you have more important patients to see. But thank you for looking. And you didn't hurt me, by the way. You were very gentle.
DOCTOR: It’s not “bothering” me at all, Lilliana, and I'm glad I was gentle. And crepitus isn’t necessarily bad – it can just be a sign of wear and tear in the joints, which is common as we get older. Given your history of stiffness, family history of arthritis, and what I’m feeling on the exam, it does sound like you may be experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis. It’s good that we’re catching this early. We can try a few things to help manage the symptoms and slow its progression. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll be severely limited in your activities. Would you be open to discussing some treatment options?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Osteo…what did you call it? Arthritis? Just like my mother? I… I don’t know. Treatment? What kind of treatment? Pills? I don’t like taking pills, you know. They make me feel funny. And I don’t want any injections or anything… that sounds scary. What else can you do? Is it going to get really bad? Will I end up in a wheelchair? I just want to keep moving, Doctor. I can’t sit still, you know? I like to be with the kids, and I don’t want to… slow down. I’m not ready to slow down.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be worried, Lilliana. It’s good we’re talking about this and addressing your concerns. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, and it doesn’t always mean you’ll end up severely limited or in a wheelchair. It can be managed effectively, and we have several options that don’t necessarily involve pills. First, let's rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms with some blood tests – just to be sure. Then, we can discuss options like gentle exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints, which can provide support and reduce pain. Physical therapy can be very helpful with this. We can also talk about over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if you're experiencing discomfort, but we don’t have to start those right away. There are also topical creams and gels that can help relieve pain. We can start with the simplest things first – exercises and gentle range-of-motion activities – and see how you respond. If those aren’t enough, we can explore other options. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Exercises… I suppose I can try that. I do like to walk, when the weather is nice. And the kids keep me moving, of course. But I don't want to overdo it, you know? I don’t want to make it worse. And I don’t want to spend a lot of money on… therapy. My daughter would be very upset with me if I spent a lot of money. She worries about me already. The blood tests… are they going to hurt? I don’t like needles. But if it will rule things out… I guess I can do that. And those creams… are they sticky? I don’t like sticky things. Oh, goodness… this is a lot to take in. I just want to feel better, Doctor. I don’t want to be in pain. And I don’t want to slow down. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Lilliana, that’s not too much to ask at all. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to feel better and stay active. And we’ll take things one step at a time. The blood tests are just a small prick – it’s quick, and most people don't find it very painful. We’re just checking for things like rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions to be sure it’s osteoarthritis. As for the creams, there are different kinds – some are a little thicker than others, but we can find one that you find comfortable. I’ll write you a lab order for the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re very good. And I’ll give you a handout with some gentle exercises you can start doing at home – nothing strenuous, just simple range-of-motion activities. We can discuss your results and how you’re feeling at a follow-up appointment in about two weeks. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds alright. I’ll try to remember. And the handout… is it going to be hard? I don’t want anything too complicated. I’m not very good with… instructions. My daughter usually reads things for me. And… thank you, Doctor. For not making me feel like an old lady. And for not telling me I have to stop doing everything. I appreciate that. I’ll go get the blood tests now, I suppose. Hopefully it won't hurt too much. And hopefully I can remember everything you told me. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. And you’re not an old lady at all! You’re a very active woman who’s taking good care of yourself, and we’re just going to work together to keep it that way. The exercises are very simple – just some gentle movements. And don’t worry if you forget something – that’s what the follow-up appointment is for. If you have any questions at all before the appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. You take care now. And try not to worry too much.
