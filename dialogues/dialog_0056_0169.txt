DOCTOR: Hi Derick, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's… my face and legs, mostly. They're puffin' up, see? Not like a bad injury, just… swollen. Been happenin' for a bit now, I reckon. Don't rightly know why it's happenin', that's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your face and legs. And you said this has been going on for a “bit now”?
PATIENT: Yeah, a bit. Hard to say how long, exactly. Time kinda… blurs, you know? Maybe a few weeks? Longer? It comes and goes, mostly worse in the evenin', I think. It's just… bothersome. Not painful, thankfully. Just looks awful, I expect. My wife used to fuss over it…
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good it's not painful, but swelling can definitely be concerning, even without pain. So, it's mostly in your face and legs, worse in the evenings… Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. Not that I've noticed. I eat pretty much the same as always, I suppose. Maybe… salt? I do like a bit of salt on my potatoes. Always have. But I've always liked salt and it’s never bothered me before. Don’t know if that’s got anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a consistent diet, with some salt intake. We can definitely look into that. And just to get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in your urination – like going more or less often, or any difficulty going?
PATIENT: Urination? Well… I go to the bathroom. Same as always, I suppose. Maybe… a little more often lately? But I drink a fair bit of coffee, so… hard to say if that’s the cause. Old age, maybe? Everything gets a bit… leaky, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly slightly more frequent urination, but you attribute that to coffee. Alright. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the swelling – things like shortness of breath, fatigue, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I get a bit winded climbin' stairs, but that’s just gettin’ old, I reckon. Fatigue… well, I’m always a bit tired. Workin’ with metal all day is hard on a fella. And no chest pain, thankfully. I had a cousin once who… well, let's not talk about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, fatigue likely related to work, and some breathlessness with exertion. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned somethin' about that a while back. Gave me some pills, I think. Didn't like takin' 'em, made me feel… foggy. Stopped takin' 'em after a bit. Everything was alright for a while, so I figured I didn't need 'em. Don’t rightly remember what else… My wife did all the keepin’ track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, but you stopped taking medication for it. We’ll need to address that. And any surgeries or hospital stays you can recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Had my appendix out when I was a lad. That's about it, I think. Nothing major. No hospital stays, not unless you count the time I broke my arm fallin' off the barn roof when I was younger. That wasn't a proper stay, just a quick fix and a cast. Everything else… I just patched myself up, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal as a child, and a broken arm. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Used to help my mother with the garden, handled all sorts of plants. Never had a reaction. Maybe a bit of a sniffle with pollen sometimes, but that’s just… spring, you know? Not a proper allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter ones, like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven’t taken anything regular in… well, a long time. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. I try to avoid pills if I can. Always felt they did more harm than good. My wife always said I was stubborn, maybe she was right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and face. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Sounds alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? My skin's a bit thin these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be gentle. Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I'm noting 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities, and mild facial edema, particularly around the ankles and eyes. Skin is warm and dry. Now, I’d like to run some basic blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out other possible causes for the swelling. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… ugh. Never been a fan of needles. But… if you think it's necessary, alright. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? And tell me if it's gonna hurt much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll be as quick as possible. It'll be a small blood draw, and it’ll sting for a moment, but it shouldn’t be too painful. I’ll send the sample to the lab, and we should have results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake. It can really contribute to fluid retention. We’ll go over the results when they come back and discuss a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Less salt, eh? That’s gonna be tough. Potatoes just aren’t the same without it. But… alright, I’ll try. For my health, I suppose. A few days, you say?
DOCTOR: Yes, a few days. I’ll also have the nurse print out a low-sodium diet guide for you. And if the swelling gets significantly worse – like it’s interfering with your breathing or causing you a lot of discomfort – please go to the emergency room right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Emergency room… well, that doesn’t sound pleasant. I'll try to stay outta there. No, I don't think so, Doctor. Just… try to be quick with that needle, alright? And thank you. For… not laughin' at me for stoppin' my pills.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’m not laughing at all, and I'm happy to help. Alright, let's get that blood draw done, and then we’ll be finished. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Alright then.
