DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won't stop. Been going on for… goodness, I’d say nearly three days now. It’s a bit embarrassing, really, when you’re my age.
DOCTOR: Three days of hiccups, that is quite a bit! And I understand completely – hiccups can be really disruptive, and a bit frustrating. Let's try to figure out what might be causing them. Can you tell me a little more about when they started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started right after I had a lovely dinner with my daughter, Lani. We went to that new Italian place downtown – Bella Notte, it’s called. I had the spaghetti and meatballs… and a glass of wine, maybe two. It was a Tuesday, so… August 1st, I believe. Yes, definitely Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started Tuesday evening, August 1st, after dinner at Bella Notte with your daughter Lani. You had spaghetti and meatballs and a glass or two of wine. And have they been pretty constant since then, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go, mostly. They're worse when I try to lie down, or after I eat anything, really. Even a little sip of water can set them off! But they do quiet down for a bit, then… hic …there they are again. It's like they have a mind of their own, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds incredibly frustrating. Worse with lying down and after eating... Okay. And besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven't felt sick or anything. No fever, no tummy trouble, no heartburn. Just… hic …these pesky hiccups! I’ve been sleeping alright, though. A little annoyed, of course, when one wakes me up, but not a lot of trouble getting back to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no nausea, no heartburn, and your sleep hasn’t been too disrupted. That’s good. Now, just to get a bit of a broader picture, do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago… probably twenty years now? And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, that’s why I walk with a cane sometimes. Nothing major, though. Oh! And I used to have high blood pressure, but it’s well controlled with medication now. I take Lisinopril, I think it's called.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about twenty years ago, arthritis in the knees, and well-controlled high blood pressure treated with Lisinopril. Thank you for letting me know. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, dear. I've never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks, and I always say no. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, traveling around with my late husband… never a problem.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And just to be sure, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the Lisinopril, I think. And sometimes I take paracetamol for my knees when they’re really aching. That’s it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Lisinopril for blood pressure and paracetamol as needed for your knees. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and taking a look at your throat. It’ll only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine, dear. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. Just be gentle with my knees, alright? They're a bit sensitive sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll be very careful. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Okay, everything sounds clear and healthy so far. Your heart rate and lung sounds are normal. And your throat looks fine - no redness or swelling that would explain the hiccups. Blood pressure is 138/82. Now, let's gently check your neurological reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. Though I’m not sure what that has to do with hiccups, but you’re the doctor, dear. Go ahead. I used to be pretty good at those tests, back in school… but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: It’s just to rule out anything unusual that could be contributing. Everything seems normal so far - reflexes are good and equal on both sides. Given your history and the physical exam, these hiccups sound like they're likely benign – meaning not caused by anything serious. Sometimes, they just happen! It could be related to eating quickly, or even a little bit of irritation from the wine. However, since they've been going on for three days, it's good to try a few things to see if we can get them to stop. Do you have any history of acid reflux or heartburn?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never had a bit of trouble with that. Maybe a little indigestion now and then, but nothing serious. I usually just have a cup of chamomile tea and it settles right down. I’ve tried holding my breath, like my mother always said to do, but that just makes me feel dizzy! And I tried drinking water upside down… that was a mess!
DOCTOR: Those are good things to try, though! Holding your breath and drinking water upside down can sometimes work, but they're not always pleasant! Since those haven’t helped, let’s try a medication. I'm going to prescribe you a medication called Baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant and can sometimes help calm the hiccups. We'll start with a low dose, and see if that helps. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A pill sounds easier than drinking water upside down, that’s for sure! Baclofen, you say? Is it… safe? I don’t want anything that will make me feel sleepy, or confused. I still like to go to my book club, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question! Baclofen is generally safe, and we’re starting with a very low dose to minimize any side effects. Some people can experience a little drowsiness, but it’s usually mild. It's very important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. I'll write the prescription, and I'll also give you some written instructions with potential side effects and what to do if you experience them. If you do feel unusually sleepy or confused, please stop taking the medication and give us a call. We can also discuss lifestyle adjustments, like eating smaller meals and avoiding carbonated beverages, which might help prevent hiccups in the future. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, dear. A low dose and instructions… good. And smaller meals… I suppose I do tend to enjoy a good big plate of food. Yes, lifestyle adjustments… I can try that. No more fizzy drinks, smaller meals… I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking your time with me. These hiccups are just… annoying, but it's good to know it's not anything serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad we could figure out a plan. It's good to rule out anything serious, and these hiccups should resolve with the medication and lifestyle changes. Here's the prescription and the instructions. If they don't improve after a week, or if you experience any concerning side effects, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, dear. You’ve been very thorough and kind. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. I suppose I'll go home and try to relax… and maybe have a chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. I hope you feel better soon. And yes, chamomile tea is always a good idea! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day.
