DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Bacy. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Bacy, you said? Yes... well, it’s this shaking. My hands, mostly. It’s been… bothering me. Not all the time, you understand, but enough to… well, it makes things difficult. I’m Lyman, by the way. Lyman Jezik. Though I doubt you needed that part. It’s just… the shaking. I suppose that’s what brought me in.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lyman. It’s good to know you properly. And yes, the shaking – that’s a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. More about it… Let me think. It’s… worse when I’m trying to do something. Like, holding a cup of coffee? Forget about it. Used to be able to fix anything around the house, now… not so much. And it seems to be getting worse, I think. Though, honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so who knows? It’s been going on… oh, I don’t know… a few months, maybe? Longer? It’s hard to say. I worked at the water treatment plant for a long time, you know. Lots of… pipes and things. Maybe that had something to do with it. Though, I doubt it. I mostly just… checked gauges. I don’t really know what’s going on with it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been going on for a few months, and it’s worse with activity, specifically when you're trying to do tasks like holding a cup or working with your hands. You mentioned it seems to be getting progressively worse. And you worked at the water treatment plant, checking gauges… We’ll definitely want to talk about that a bit later. Just to clarify, is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Not all the time, like I said. Sometimes I can be perfectly fine for hours, and then… bam. It just starts. It's not… predictable, if that makes sense. It's not like it happens at a certain time of day or after certain foods or anything. Just… random. And it’s not always the same. Sometimes it’s just a little tremble, barely noticeable. Other times… well, other times it’s hard to even hold a spoon. I really don't know what to make of it. Is this… serious? I just want to get it fixed, if that’s possible. I'm not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have something that comes and goes unpredictably, and varies in intensity. It's good that it's not constant. To get a better picture, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Now you’re asking me something. Let me think… I’ve been a bit tired lately, I suppose. But honestly, who isn’t? I’m 79 years old! I sleep alright, I think. Maybe not as well as I used to, but nothing terrible. My hands get cold easily, sometimes. But again, that could just be the weather. Or… old age. I don’t know. I haven’t really… noticed anything else specific. No pain, no dizziness, no… well, nothing else that stands out. I just want this shaking to stop. It’s making everything so difficult. I don’t even like to drink coffee anymore because I just spill it all over myself. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue and cold hands, but nothing else significant that you've noticed. And it's understandable that it's frustrating and embarrassing. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Goodness. Let me see. I had… the usual. High blood pressure, I think. Years ago. Took some pills for it for a while. And… I had my gallbladder removed, a long time ago. Other than that… not much, as far as I recall. I haven’t been to the doctor in… well, a long time. I don’t really like going to doctors. Everything always feels like a waste of time. I mostly just try to take care of myself. And… well, here I am. I suppose that says something, doesn’t it? I really don’t remember much about any of it. It was all so long ago.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. High blood pressure in the past, gallbladder removal. And you haven't been to the doctor recently. Do you happen to know what medications you took for your blood pressure, or if you're currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The pills… I really don’t remember the name. Little white pills, I think? Maybe pink? It was years ago. I stopped taking them eventually, the doctor said my blood pressure was alright. And no, I’m not taking any medications now. Just… trying to get by. I used to take a vitamin, maybe? But I don’t even remember that for sure. Honestly, I’m not much of a pill person. I prefer to just… deal with things. It’s probably silly, but I don’t like relying on things. Especially pills. They never seem to do much good anyway. I'm starting to feel a little tired just talking about all of this. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: No, we're getting there. And I understand not liking to take pills. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything. Never had any reactions, as far as I recall. No allergies to pollen or anything like that either. I used to work outside a lot, around the plant, and never had any trouble. Maybe a little hay fever sometimes, but nothing serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way. Though, I suppose I haven’t tried eating anything really exotic. Just… normal food. You know, meat and potatoes and things. I’m starting to shake a little bit now, actually. Is it okay if we just… get to the point? I’m not a fan of long conversations. Especially about myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We'll get to the point. I notice your hands are trembling a bit more now, Lyman. That's helpful to see. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Another long topic. Let me think. My father… he lived to be 85. Healthy as a horse, he was. Worked on a farm all his life. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. Died when I was still young. And my brother… he’s gone now. Had some… problems with his nerves, maybe? I don’t really know. It was a long time ago. Nobody really talked about these things much. We were more practical people, you know? More concerned with getting things done than with… medical histories. I don’t think anyone in my family had… shaking like this, though. As far as I recall. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. It was all a long time ago. Can we… get to the end of this now? I really don't feel well. I'm a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can move on. I apologize for the long questions, Lyman. It's just that a full picture helps me understand what’s going on. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Oh, good heavens. What does that even mean? Well… I was married, once. A long time ago. Divorced now. No children. I mostly kept to myself. Worked at the water treatment plant for… oh, 40 years, maybe? Retired a few years back. I don't really have much of a social life. Just… me. I live alone. I don't drink, don't smoke. Never really did. I used to enjoy gardening, but my hands… well, you know. It’s hard to do much anymore. I mostly just watch television. And… try to stay out of trouble. Honestly, there’s not much to tell. A quiet life. A very quiet life. I really don't understand what any of this has to do with my shaking. Can we… please… get to the end of this? I feel really bad now. And I'm getting dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. A quiet life, retired, no smoking or drinking. I understand you’re feeling unwell and dizzy. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes and coordination. This will help me get a better idea of what might be causing your shaking. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright… I suppose so. But please hurry. I really don’t feel well. And… be gentle with my hands, please. They're very sensitive right now. I just want this to be over. I hope you find out what’s wrong. I just want to feel normal again. Whatever that means anymore. Please… just hurry. I'm a bit scared, to be honest. I haven't been this sick in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I’d like you to extend your arms in front of you and touch your nose with your index finger. Repeat that a few times. I notice a tremor in both of your hands when you’re trying to touch your nose. It’s more pronounced on the right side. And I can see a slight rigidity in your muscles. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Okay, Lyman. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with essential tremor. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Essential… what? Is that… bad? I don’t understand. What does that even mean? And what other possibilities are there? Please, Doctor, just tell me straight. I don’t want to be confused. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. This shaking… it’s getting worse, isn’t it? Is there anything you can do about it? Anything at all? I feel so helpless. This is all very scary. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman, please try to stay calm. Essential tremor is a neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking. It's very common, especially as people get older. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome and make everyday tasks difficult. As for what other possibilities there are, we need to rule out things like Parkinson’s disease, thyroid problems, and medication side effects. To do that, I’d like to order some blood tests and a thyroid function test. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. They can do more specialized tests and help us determine the best course of treatment. There are treatments available for essential tremor. Medications can help reduce the shaking, and in some cases, surgery may be an option. We'll discuss all of your options once we have the results of the tests. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done. I’ll write you a requisition form for the blood tests, and I’ll also make a referral to Dr. Ramirez, the neurologist. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Tests… more doctors… It sounds like a lot. Parkinson’s disease? Is that… serious? I don’t want Parkinson’s disease. I just want this shaking to stop. I don’t understand all this medical jargon. Will the tests take long? And… what if it is Parkinson’s disease? What happens then? I’m not sure I can handle all of this. Can you… just tell me if it’s something really bad? Straight answer, please. I don’t want to be sugar-coated. I just want to know the truth. And… is there anything I can do right now to make the shaking stop? Anything at all? Even just for a little while? I’m really scared, Doctor. Really scared.
DOCTOR: Lyman, I understand your fear, and I want to assure you that we’re going to take this one step at a time. It’s important to remember that we haven't made a diagnosis yet. The tests are simply to help us determine the cause of your shaking. Parkinson’s disease is a serious condition, but it’s also relatively rare. And even if you were to be diagnosed with it, there are treatments available to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. We would discuss all of your options in detail. Right now, there's no way to completely stop the shaking without knowing the cause. However, there are a few things you can try to manage it. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol can sometimes help. Some people find that relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises, can also be beneficial. Holding a weighted utensil or wearing wrist weights might also provide some relief. I’ll write down these suggestions for you. I’m also going to prescribe a low-dose beta-blocker, propranolol. It's sometimes used to help reduce tremors, but it’s important to start with a low dose and monitor your blood pressure and heart rate closely. The most important thing is to get the tests done so we can determine the cause of your shaking and develop the best treatment plan for you. I’ll be here every step of the way to answer your questions and provide support. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Beta-blocker… another pill. I really don’t like taking pills. But… alright. If it might help. I just… I don’t want to become a burden to anyone. I live alone, and I don’t have much family left. I don’t want to end up needing constant care. Will the shaking… get worse? Will I eventually lose control of my hands completely? Will I be able to… take care of myself? These are silly questions, aren't they? I'm just scared. Really scared. Alright. Tests, pills, neurologist… I’ll do it. Just… please, Doctor, let me know as soon as you have the results. I need to know what I’m facing. And… thank you. Thank you for listening. It helps to… just talk about it. Even if it’s scary. I think… I think that’s enough for today. I just want to go home and rest. I’m really tired now.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly for asking those questions, Lyman. They're perfectly valid concerns, and I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to help you maintain your independence and quality of life. It's impossible to predict exactly how the shaking will progress, but early diagnosis and treatment can often help slow down the progression and manage the symptoms. We'll monitor your condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Here’s the requisition form for the blood tests, and this list has the suggestions we talked about. I’ll also make sure to schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the test results are available. Please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, you're not alone in this. We'll be here to support you every step of the way. Take care of yourself, Lyman. And don't worry too much. We’ll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Bacy. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate it more than you know. Alright. Tests, then. Let’s get it over with.
