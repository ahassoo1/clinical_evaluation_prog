DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Asami. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure where to begin. It’s… about planning, I suppose. For the future. I believe someone suggested I inquire about… documents? Something to do with making wishes known, should I… be unable to express them myself. An advance directive, perhaps? Or a POLST form, was it? I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s very responsible of you to think about this now. It can be a little overwhelming, all the terminology. You're right, you're likely thinking about advance care planning – things like a living will, which outlines your wishes for medical care, and a durable power of attorney for healthcare, which names someone to make decisions for you if you can’t. A POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit more specific, usually for people with serious illnesses. Let’s start with the basics. Are you currently experiencing any health concerns that are prompting you to think about this now, or is this more of a proactive measure?
PATIENT: Proactive, I believe. Though… it’s difficult to say precisely. I had a… a rather unsettling experience a few months ago. A fall, I think? Or perhaps it was a spell of dizziness. It’s all very hazy. Nothing was broken, as far as I recall, but it did make me realize… well, things could change quickly. It felt rather… precarious. No specific illness, no. Just… a desire to be prepared. And perhaps alleviate some worry for my… for those who would need to make decisions on my behalf. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: That’s very understandable, Evann. It’s wise to plan ahead, especially after something like that. It sounds like you've had a good insight. The haziness is something we should explore a bit further, just to rule out anything that could be contributing to it. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… I… believe I had some tests done a few years ago for my… my cholesterol. It was slightly elevated, I think. Though I don't recall if it required any ongoing treatment. And… I had a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis last winter. It took a long time to clear up. But beyond that… nothing significant springs to mind. I generally consider myself quite healthy, despite… recent events. It’s frustrating that I can’t be more precise. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Evann. It’s very common for people to have trouble remembering details, and we have your chart here to help us fill in the gaps. I see a note about a cholesterol check from 2023, and it was slightly elevated, but you were advised to monitor it with lifestyle changes. And yes, I see the bronchitis from last winter. It looks like you did require a course of antibiotics. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the bronchitis?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I don’t believe so. Nothing major, at least. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, naturally. And… I think I had a minor procedure done on my eye once, many years ago. Just a small growth removed. But nothing requiring a hospital stay. The bronchitis was the first – and hopefully last – time I’ve been hospitalized. I’ve always been rather fortunate, in terms of my health. Until… well, recently.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Evann. It sounds like you’ve had a relatively healthy life, and that’s wonderful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a difficult question. My family… isn’t very forthcoming with such information. I grew up in Mongolia, and it wasn’t common practice to discuss illness openly. I know my grandmother suffered from… some sort of weakness in her later years, but I don’t know the specifics. And my father… he was a strong man, but he passed away relatively young from… an accident, I believe. Nothing health-related, as far as I know. I wish I could provide more details, but I simply don’t have them. It’s… a cultural thing, I suppose. A reluctance to dwell on such matters.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s not uncommon to have limited information about family history, and I understand that cultural factors can play a role. We can work with what we have. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I have never smoked a day in my life, and I find alcohol… quite unpleasant, actually. And recreational drugs are… entirely outside of my realm of experience. I've always led a rather… disciplined life. I focus on my work, my art. Those are my indulgences. Not… those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Evann. A healthy lifestyle certainly contributes to overall well-being. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not currently. I haven't required any regular medication in… well, as long as I can remember. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. And… I used to take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, but I haven't gotten around to it this year. I really should be more diligent. It’s just… everything seems to slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I am aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. Though, as I mentioned, I don’t take much medication. So, perhaps that’s why. It's difficult to be allergic to something you rarely encounter.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Evann. Well, it sounds like we’ve covered a lot of important background information. Now, before we delve into discussing advance directives specifically, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your current health status. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Though, I confess, I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations. But I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I trust your expertise, Doctor Asami. I just… hope it won't be too unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also do a quick neurological assessment – check your reflexes and coordination. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within a normal range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, also normal. Respiration is 16 breaths per minute, nice and even. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are normal, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Coordination is intact. Everything sounds and looks good so far, Evann. No immediate concerns detected. Do you have any specific areas of discomfort or concern that you'd like me to focus on?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor Asami. Thank you. No, not specifically. As I mentioned, I did experience a bout of dizziness a few months ago, but it hasn't recurred. And… sometimes I feel a slight ache in my lower back, but it’s nothing debilitating. I attribute it to my work. I spend many hours hunched over my etching plate. It’s really nothing to worry about, I’m sure. Perhaps just a little stiffness. Nothing more. I’m more concerned about… ensuring my wishes are known, should something unforeseen happen. That’s why I came to you today, after all.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good you mention the lower back stiffness. I’ll just do a quick range of motion assessment. Okay, bending forward… good. Backward… a little limited range there, but nothing alarming. Side to side… slightly tight, as expected. It does seem like you have some muscle tension in your lower back. It's likely related to your work. Now, let’s talk about those advance directives. Are you familiar with the concept of a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: I believe… I read a little about them before coming here. A living will… that outlines my wishes regarding medical treatment, correct? If I were to become incapacitated and unable to communicate? And a durable power of attorney for healthcare… that names someone to make those decisions on my behalf? I confess, it all feels rather… daunting. And a little morbid, to be honest. I understand the importance of it, of course. But thinking about those sorts of scenarios… it’s not easy. Perhaps you could explain it to me in simpler terms? And help me understand what’s involved?
DOCTOR: You’ve got the basics exactly right, Evann. It is a little daunting, and it's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable thinking about these scenarios. Let's break it down. A living will, also known as an advance directive, is a document where you state what types of medical treatments you would want or wouldn't want if you were unable to make decisions for yourself. It's about your values and preferences regarding things like life support, resuscitation, and pain management. It only comes into play if you’re in a situation where you can’t communicate your wishes. A durable power of attorney for healthcare is just as important. It’s a document where you name a trusted person – a healthcare proxy – to make medical decisions for you if you're unable to. This person should be someone who knows your values and would advocate for your best interests. Do you have someone in mind who you would trust to be your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I am divorced, and… my family is not particularly close. I don't have any siblings, and my parents are… no longer with us. I have a colleague, Anya. She’s a fellow etcher, and a very dear friend. She's… sensible and compassionate. I trust her judgment implicitly. Would she be suitable? I’ve never discussed this with her, to be honest. But I believe she would honor my wishes. It feels rather… sudden to ask her something like this. Is there a specific protocol for approaching this conversation? Perhaps a script?
DOCTOR: Anya sounds like a very good candidate, Evann. It’s perfectly alright that you haven’t discussed this with her yet. It’s a sensitive topic, and it’s important to approach it thoughtfully. There isn’t a specific script, but I can certainly offer some guidance. The key is to be open and honest with her about your wishes and why you’re choosing her as your healthcare proxy. Explain that you’ve been thinking about advance care planning and that you want to ensure your values are respected if you were ever unable to communicate them yourself. You can tell her that you’ve chosen her because you trust her judgment and believe she would advocate for your best interests. It’s also important to discuss specific scenarios with her, like what types of treatments you would or wouldn't want in certain situations. You don't need to go into exhaustive detail, but it’s helpful to have a general understanding of her views and preferences. I have some informational brochures on advance care planning that outline common scenarios and questions you can discuss with her. I can give you those now. Would you like me to walk through some of those scenarios with you first, to help you prepare for the conversation with Anya?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… incredibly helpful. Walking through some scenarios beforehand would certainly ease my mind. I confess, I’m not particularly comfortable discussing end-of-life care, but I understand it's a necessary conversation. Perhaps we could start with… resuscitation? I’ve always found that aspect particularly unsettling. The thought of… being brought back, against my wishes… it’s rather frightening.
DOCTOR: Of course. Resuscitation is a very common concern, Evann. It’s good you’re starting there. It’s important to understand what resuscitation involves. It typically includes chest compressions, electrical shock with a defibrillator, and potentially intubation and mechanical ventilation. The goal is to restore heartbeat and breathing. Now, in the context of an advance directive, you can state whether or not you want resuscitation performed if your heart or breathing stops. You can choose to have "full code," meaning you want all possible measures taken, or "do not resuscitate" – DNR – meaning you don't want those measures taken. There’s also an option for “conditional DNR,” meaning you want resuscitation only in certain circumstances. Think about your values and beliefs. Would you want to be kept alive at all costs, even if it meant a prolonged and potentially painful recovery?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. I believe… quality of life is paramount. I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially, if there was no hope of recovery. I’ve witnessed… suffering, and I wouldn't want to endure that myself. I value dignity, and independence. I believe a "do not resuscitate" order is appropriate for me. If my heart were to stop, and there was no reasonable chance of recovery… I wouldn't want to be prolonged artificially. It feels… rather morbid to discuss, but it's a decision I've come to after careful consideration. Is there… documentation required? A specific form I need to complete? And how do I ensure Anya is aware of my wishes, should the need arise?
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful and well-considered decision, Evann. It’s important to be clear about your values, and you’ve articulated them very well. Yes, there is documentation required for a DNR order. It needs to be a formal, legally binding document, typically completed in consultation with a physician. I can provide you with the appropriate form, and we can complete it together. It will need to be signed by both of us, and witnessed. As for ensuring Anya is aware of your wishes, it’s important to have a conversation with her, and ideally, provide her with a copy of your advance directive. It’s also helpful to inform your primary care physician about your wishes, and ensure they have a copy of the document in your medical record. I have a wallet card you can carry that states you have an advance directive, and lists Anya’s name and contact information as your healthcare proxy. It will alert medical personnel to the existence of your document, should you be unable to communicate. Would you like me to provide you with those forms and the wallet card?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… incredibly helpful. The wallet card sounds particularly useful. I often travel for exhibitions, and it would provide peace of mind knowing my wishes are documented and accessible. Thank you, Doctor Asami. You’ve been… extraordinarily patient and understanding. This entire process felt rather daunting, but you’ve made it significantly less stressful. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any other documents or procedures I should consider?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and I’m happy to guide you through the process. Besides the DNR order, you might also consider completing a medical power of attorney, which grants Anya the authority to make healthcare decisions on your behalf even if you’re not at the end of life. It’s similar to the healthcare proxy designation, but it’s a broader document. You might also want to think about a living will, which outlines your preferences for specific medical treatments, like life support, dialysis, and tube feeding. We can discuss those scenarios in more detail if you’d like. Finally, it’s important to have a conversation with Anya about your values and beliefs, and ensure she understands your wishes. The more prepared she is, the better equipped she’ll be to advocate for your best interests. I have some informational brochures on all of these topics, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have. Do you feel ready to start completing the DNR order now, or would you like some time to think about it?
PATIENT: I think… I’m ready to start with the DNR order. I’ve spent considerable time reflecting on my wishes, and I feel confident in my decision. Completing the form now would provide peace of mind. Perhaps we can also discuss the living will briefly, after completing the DNR order? I want to ensure all my wishes are documented and understood. Thank you again, Doctor Asami. I appreciate your guidance and support. Let’s begin. .
DOCTOR: Excellent, Evann. I’m happy to hear that. Okay, let's start with your full name and date of birth… Alright, Evann. We’ve successfully completed the DNR order. This document will ensure your wishes are respected if you’re ever unable to communicate them yourself. Now, as you mentioned, let's discuss the living will. It outlines your preferences for specific medical treatments, like life support, dialysis, and tube feeding… Are you ready to begin?
