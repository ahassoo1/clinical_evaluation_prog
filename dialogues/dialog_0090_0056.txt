DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly? I haven't the faintest idea why my… associate… scheduled this appointment. Something about… stress, I believe? It's all rather disruptive, if you ask me. I’ve been a teacher for… well, a very long time. One simply gets on with things. There isn’t time for… dwelling.
DOCTOR: “Stress,” you say. Well, even those who “get on with things” can be affected by it, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s good you’re here to investigate. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Going on? Honestly, the students are… less disciplined than they once were. And the paperwork! An absolute mountain of it. They expect us to document everything these days. It’s quite unnecessary, really. A good teacher knows their students. Forms won't tell you that. It’s… a nuisance. A considerable nuisance. Is that what you need to know? Because frankly, I have a rather full schedule this afternoon.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your dedication to your students, Mr. Schlatterer, that’s not quite what I meant. When you say “nuisance,” are you experiencing any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Doctor, I am eighty-seven years old. Of course I have physical symptoms! My knees ache, my back creaks, and I occasionally forget where I put my spectacles. Is that what you’re getting at? I assure you, it’s simply the natural progression of… well, age. It’s not some grand medical mystery. Though, perhaps a stronger cup of tea would resolve the latter.
DOCTOR: I understand that these things can come with age, Mr. Schlatterer. But it’s important to rule out anything else that might be contributing. Have you noticed any changes in your aches and pains recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Good heavens, no. They’re… consistently unpleasant. They don’t ebb and flow, Doctor. They simply are. Look, I've always prided myself on my resilience. I don’t require coddling or… investigation. Is there a way to expedite this process? I really must be going. I have papers to grade, and frankly, this conversation is rather… draining.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand you're a busy man, but your associate brought you in for a reason. While you may feel resilient, it's my job to ensure there isn't something more serious going on. Have you experienced any difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Difficulty sleeping? Honestly, Doctor, are you implying I'm a delicate flower? I sleep perfectly well. Though, I do admit, the noise from the neighbours has been… regrettable lately. A rather boisterous young couple, if you must know. It's the neighbours who require assistance, not me. Really, this is quite… condescending. I think I’ve answered quite enough questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Let’s try a different approach. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? Doctor, I eat when I’m hungry. And my weight… is perfectly adequate, thank you very much. I maintain a sensible diet. Though, the cafeteria food at the university has… declined in quality, I must say. A rather bland selection, if you ask me. But that’s hardly a matter for a physician, is it? I believe I’ve addressed all your… concerns. May I leave now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, you’re avoiding my questions. It’s important to me to understand what brought you here today, even if you don't think there’s anything wrong. Have you experienced any dizziness, headaches, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Headaches? Doctor, I am not senile! I can assure you, my faculties are perfectly intact. This line of questioning is… frankly, insulting. I came here at the behest of a… well-meaning colleague, and I’ve indulged your inquiries to a reasonable extent. But I will not be subjected to this… interrogation. I believe I’ve wasted enough of both our times. Good day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, please. Just answer one question. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Mood? Energy levels? Doctor, I am a scholar! I have always been… reserved. And my energy levels are… sufficient. Sufficient for my duties, thank you very much. I will not tolerate this… psychological probing! I find your methods… unprofessional. I think… I think I’ve had enough. .
