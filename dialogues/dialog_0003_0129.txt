DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Yackey. I see you’re here today. Let's get straight to it; what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get this over with. It's my… well, it's my stool. It’s black. Like tar, practically. And I take those pain pills, you know, the strong ones, for my arthritis. Been taking them for years, and now this. It's probably those pills, isn't it? It has to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Black stool. Years on strong pain medication... Yes, that’s… a common side effect. Although, we can’t assume anything. Do you experience any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting along with this change in stool color?
PATIENT: Oh, abdominal pain? Sometimes. It's just… old age, you know? Everything aches. And nausea… well, I'm not a spring chicken anymore, things don't sit well sometimes. Vomiting, not really. Look, I just want to know if I'm going to die from this. Is it serious? Don’t tell me it’s something I ate, because I eat perfectly sensible food.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly sensible” is subjective, Ms. Hatchard. We need to be thorough. Let’s not jump to conclusions. The black stool… it could indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which needs investigation. Now, have you noticed any fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Bleeding where? Oh, for heaven's sake. Look, I'm 73, of course I’m tired! I get winded going up the stairs! That doesn't mean I'm bleeding internally! Honestly, are you even listening to me? I just want a quick fix, a pill to stop whatever's making my stool black, and I want to go home. This is ridiculous. You doctors always make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: We must rule out serious causes, Ms. Hatchard. It's my professional obligation. Now, have you ever had a colonoscopy or endoscopy performed?
PATIENT: Colon… what-oscopy? End-o-scopy? Heavens no! I don't let anyone poke around there. That sounds dreadful! What would I even need that for? I've never had any trouble, until these pills, I mean. Are you saying it’s because of my age? Because I’ll have you know, my mother lived to be 95 and she took pain pills too! And she didn't have any… what-oscopies. Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Your mother’s experience is… irrelevant. Everyone is different. Let’s proceed systematically. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've taken everything under the sun. Penicillin, aspirin, you name it. Nothing bothers me. Though I did have a bit of indigestion from that new cherry cough syrup last winter, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? Honestly, doctor, are you writing down anything I tell you? Or are you just trying to scare an old woman?
DOCTOR: Indigestion is noted. Now, regarding your current medications, can you provide me with a comprehensive list, including dosages?
PATIENT: Oh, for crying out loud. Comprehensive? Really? Well, there's the arthritis pills… let me see… they're orange, little ones. Two in the morning, two at night. And sometimes I take something for my blood pressure, a tiny blue one, but only when it gets high, which isn’t often. And…oh, and a vitamin D, because the doctor told me to. That's it. I think. Honestly, I have a little pill organizer, but my daughter usually fills it. She's the organized one. Is that what you need to know? The dosage? Goodness.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hatchard, the dosage is… important. Do you recall the names of any of these medications?
PATIENT: Names? Oh, goodness no. I don’t bother with names. I just tell my daughter what color they are and she does the rest. Honestly, it’s all a blur. The orange ones are for my joints. The blue ones are… well, for my pressure. Look, is this getting us anywhere? I just want to know if I need to go to the hospital. Because I really don't want to go to the hospital. It’s full of germs.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I need to check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. It's a standard procedure. Please lie back on the examination table. Then, we can discuss potential next steps.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to touch me? After all this questioning? Honestly. Fine. But don't poke too hard, my ribs are fragile. And hurry up about it, will you? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I'm palpating your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness in any specific areas?
PATIENT: Well, it's a little sore all over, isn't it? I mean, I'm an old woman! But no, not particularly sore in one spot. Just… achy. Like everything's tired. Honestly, you're pressing quite hard. Are you sure you’re supposed to be pushing that much? It feels a bit rough. I’m telling you, it’s probably just indigestion.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are…regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Now, given your age, your medication history, and the black stool, I recommend a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a fecal occult blood test. We also need to rule out any internal bleeding. I'm going to write you a referral for a colonoscopy. It's the most thorough way to investigate this.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Absolutely not! I told you, I don't want anyone poking around there. And a blood test? More needles? Honestly, doctor, you're trying to kill me! I just want a pill! A simple pill! Look, I’m leaving. This is ridiculous. I’m going to get a second opinion. A sensible opinion. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hatchard. As you wish. However, I must advise you that delaying proper investigation could have serious consequences. Here is a printed summary of our conversation and the recommendations I’ve made. Please take it to your next physician. Have a… good day. .
