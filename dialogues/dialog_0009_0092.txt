DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds, Oreste Guilds. It's… the breath, you know? Short. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too, kinda scratchy. Don't remember when it started, exactly. Just… happened. Old age, probably. What do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, thank you for telling me that. Shortness of breath and a dry mouth and eyes… that’s good information. And you’re right, it’s important to figure out what’s going on. “Old age” can cause a lot of things, but we want to make sure we aren't missing something treatable. To help me understand a bit better, could you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Treatable… hmph. Doctors always say that. I worked traffic, you know? Lights, signals… hot asphalt all day. Maybe it's that. Anyway… the breath? It gets bad when I… walk. Even just to the mailbox, sometimes. Not so bad when I'm sitting. And it feels… tight. Like someone's squeezing my chest a little. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense? I don't do good with explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Guilds. Working traffic, being out in the heat… that certainly could contribute. And the fact that it’s worse with walking and feels tight is very helpful information. It's good you're describing it as tight rather than painful. Now, you mentioned your mouth and eyes feel dry. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. More… comes and goes. It’s worse at night, I think. Wake up with my mouth feeling like sandpaper. And my eyes… itchy. I gotta blink a lot. Use drops sometimes. The cheap ones. Don’t really help much. Used to drink a lot of coffee, maybe that dried me out. Stopped that, though. Didn't seem to make a difference. You think it's the heat? Everything feels dry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the dryness comes and goes, is worse at night, and you've noticed it even after stopping the coffee. That’s good to know. It could be the heat, certainly. But dryness like that can have other causes, too. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High… what was it? Blood pressure? Never had no problems. Always been strong as an ox. Worked hard my whole life. Traffic lights don’t fix themselves, you know? Doctor told me somethin’ once… cholesterol, maybe? Numbers… I forget numbers. Don’t bother me much. I take somethin’ for… joints. Arthritis. Old age again. And Medicare pays for it. That’s all I remember. Don't like going to doctors, honestly. Always somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical conditions diagnosed, just some arthritis in your joints. And you take medication for that, which Medicare covers – that’s helpful information. It's very common to forget the details of past medical advice, so don’t worry about that. Do you happen to remember the name of the medication you take for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Uh… little white pill. That’s all I know. Comes in a bottle. Orange label, I think. No, maybe blue. Ask my neighbor, Maria, she picks up my refills sometimes. She's good with names. I just… take it when my joints ache. What’s the point of rememberin’ the name? It ain't like I gotta order it myself. Just tell me what’s wrong with my breath. That’s what I came here for.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Guilds. We can certainly look up the medication later. It's good you have Maria to help with that. And you’re right, let's focus on your breath for now. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you have any chest pain at all with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No pain. I told you that. Tightness, maybe. Like a band around my chest. Not sharp, not achin’. Just… uncomfortable. Like tryin’ to breathe through a straw. Sometimes feels like somethin’ is… stuck. And when I lie down flat, it gets worse. Gotta sleep with a couple pillows. What about coughin'? Do I cough? Sometimes. Little cough. Old man cough. Not much phlegm. Mostly just… dry. Happens mostly at night, too. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chest pain, but you do describe tightness. And the shortness of breath is worse when lying flat, and you have a dry cough, particularly at night. That is very helpful. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmph. Let me think. Now you’re askin’ about my feet? I wear boots all day, for work. They kinda always feel… tight. Never paid much attention. Used to be pretty nimble, but these old legs ain’t what they used to be. Maybe a little puffy sometimes, at the end of the day? Maria says I should put ‘em up. She’s always tellin’ me somethin’. But no, not swollen. Just… tired. And kinda achy. Like everything else. Honestly, I feel like a hundred years old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tiredness and achiness in your legs, but no significant swelling. Now, let's talk about your history. Do you have any family history of heart problems, lung problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… now that’s a tough one. Never talked much about health with my family. My father… worked the docks. Strong man. Died young, somethin’ with his stomach, I think. My mother… she was a cook. Always a little frail. Died old, though. No one really talked about… problems. Just lived their lives. Lots of Cubans in my family, though. And we all like to smoke a good cigar now and then. Used to, anyway. Quit a few years back. Doctor said somethin’ about… well, you know. Lungs. Didn't listen to him much, back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had stomach issues and your mother lived to be quite old. And a family history of cigar smoking. That's all helpful to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let me ask one more question. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… arthritis pill, that’s for sure. Sometimes I take somethin’ for my stomach. When it acts up. Little blue one. Can’t remember the name. And… oh! Maria gives me somethin’ for my blood pressure, she says I need it. But I don’t feel nothin’ different. Little white pill, too. Everything’s a little white pill these days. Honestly, I don’t keep track. She handles it. Just tell me what's wrong with my breath. I got things to do, you know? Traffic lights don't fix themselves, even in retirement.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. It sounds like you have several medications, and Maria is very helpful with keeping track of them. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I listen to your lungs and heart, and check your ankles?
