DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place for old people? My son, he want me to go there. He say I need… check first. He worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your son is concerned and wants you to get a check-up, and that’s very thoughtful of him. So, he's worried about something specific, or just wants a general check-up to make sure everything is alright?
PATIENT: No… not specific. He just… he say I forget things sometimes. And I… maybe he right. Old age, you know? I no remember everything like before. Is good to check, yes? Just to be sure. He pay for it, so… is good.
DOCTOR: It is good to check, absolutely. And it’s very common to experience some memory changes as we get older – it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. We’ll do a thorough assessment and see what’s going on. Let’s start with a little bit of information. I see here your date of birth is… August 15th, 1953, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. August 15. Long time ago! Is correct, yes. My son, he always good with dates. I forget.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that he helps you with things like that. Now, can you tell me a little about any other health concerns you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… health? I… sometimes my knees hurt. When I walk too much. And… I get tired easy now. Not like before. I used to work all day, no problem. Now… after a little bit, I need to sit. Is… normal for old people, right?
DOCTOR: Knee pain and fatigue… yes, those can definitely be more common as we age, but it's important to understand why you're experiencing them. The knee pain – is that in both knees, or just one?
PATIENT: Both knees, Doctor. Not all the time. When I go up the stairs, or… walk a long distance. And sometimes, when it is cold. Is not… so bad. I can still walk. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, both knees, worse with stairs, distance, and cold weather. And you said fatigue – is that just feeling tired, or do you feel weak as well?
PATIENT: Just… tired. Like… no energy. I sleep good, maybe seven, eight hours. But when I wake up… still feel like I need more sleep. Not weak. I can still do things… just… slow. And I get tired easy. Maybe I need… a vitamin? My friend, she take vitamins. Is good for energy, she say.
DOCTOR: That's good to know you’re sleeping well. And it’s always good to hear what friends are doing, but let’s try to figure out what's going on with you. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and knee pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, my hands… they feel a little bit numb. Not all the time. In the morning, mostly. And… I get… a little bit dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. Is… not very often. I just hold on to something. Old age, yes? Everything start to… not work so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your hands, especially in the morning, and some dizziness when standing up quickly. That’s helpful information. The dizziness – does it last a long time, or just a brief moment?
PATIENT: Just a moment. Maybe… five seconds. Not long. I just… wait a little bit, and it go away. I no worry about it too much. Is not like… falling down dizzy. Just… whoosh. Like the room move. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: A brief moment of dizziness when standing up is fairly common, but we still want to understand what might be causing it. It could be something simple like being a little dehydrated, or it could be a sign of something else. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think… when I was younger, the doctor say my blood pressure was a little bit high. But he give me a pill, and I take it for a little while, and then… I forget. I stop taking it, and I feel okay. Maybe I should have… but I no remember. And… I had some problems with my gallbladder a long time ago. They take it out. That was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that you stopped taking medication for, and gallbladder removal. Do you remember roughly when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… that was… oh, very long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? Maybe more. I no remember the exact year. It was in Honduras. When my son, he was still little. He was scared. I remember that. But the year… I no remember. Is okay if you ask my son? He remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. We can certainly ask your son for more details. It's helpful to have that information when we're putting together a complete picture. Now, have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… no, I don’t think so. Just the gallbladder. And… I have problems with my teeth. I go to the dentist, and they fix them. But that not… surgery, right? Just… fixing. I always have bad teeth.
DOCTOR: No, dental work isn’t considered surgery. Alright, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… once. When I was very young. I got… very sick. A fever, and… I don’t remember much. It was a long time ago. In Honduras. My mother, she take care of me. I no remember why I was sick. Just… very hot. And tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, one hospitalization in your youth, reason unknown. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No… no medications. I no like to take pills. They make me feel… funny. Just… sometimes, when my knees hurt, I take… ibuprofen. The white ones. But not every day. Just… when I need it. Is that… a medication? Is okay if you ask my son? He remember everything.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is a medication, yes. And that's good to know you only take it occasionally for knee pain. And it’s fine, we’ll confirm everything with your son. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… no allergies. I eat everything. I like to cook. My son, he like my cooking. No… I no think I have allergies. Maybe… dust. Sometimes I sneeze. But that not… allergy, right? Just… dust. Is okay if you ask my son? He remember everything.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, we've covered a lot of important information. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No… no smoke. Never smoke. Bad for you. My husband, he used to smoke, but he stop a long time ago. He say it was very bad for him. I no like smoke. Bad smell.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes… a little bit of wine with dinner. Just… a small glass. Not every day. Maybe… on the weekend. My husband, he like wine too. But not too much. Is okay if you ask my son? He remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your living situation?
PATIENT: I live with my husband. In our house. We have lived there for a long time. It is… small, but cozy. My son, he lives close by. He come visit us every week. He is a good son. We have a garden. I like to grow flowers. Is quiet. Is good.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Is good to check everything. Make sure I am okay. Is okay.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little bit elevated, but not overly concerning. Finally, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Oh… a little bit uncomfortable. But I can do it. See? Old knees. Is better when I move slow. Not so fast.
DOCTOR: I'm feeling some mild crepitus, which is a bit of grating feeling – that’s common with some wear and tear in the knees, Ms. Abdollahi. I don’t feel any significant swelling or warmth. It seems like you have some mild arthritis in both knees. Alright, that completes the physical exam for now. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Is that… bad? I just thought they were old. Will I… not be able to walk? My son, he like to walk with me. I no want to stop that.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Abdollahi. Arthritis simply means inflammation of the joints. It’s very common as we age, and it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll lose the ability to walk. There are many things we can do to manage it and keep you active. In your case, it appears to be mild. We can start with some simple measures like gentle exercise, weight management, and over-the-counter pain relievers when needed. We can also discuss some physical therapy exercises that can help strengthen the muscles around your knees. Do you have any other concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sound like… hard work. But… if it help me walk with my son, maybe I can do it. And the pills… I no like to take pills. But if it is not too many… maybe. Is good you explain everything, Doctor. I worry too much, maybe.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to worry, Ms. Abdollahi. Physical therapy can be tailored to your needs, so we can start slowly and gradually increase the intensity. And we certainly don’t want to prescribe any medication you’re not comfortable with. Based on our conversation and the exam, I think it’s likely that your symptoms are primarily due to mild osteoarthritis in your knees, along with some age-related fatigue. To rule out other possible causes for your fatigue, I'd like to order some routine blood work – just a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It will give us a better picture of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… is that… needles? I no like needles. But… if you think it is important… maybe I can do it. Is not too much blood, right? My son, he always take my blood. He is good at it. Is okay, if it is important. Is good to check everything.
DOCTOR: It does involve a small needle, I understand your apprehension. It's just a small amount of blood, taken from your arm. It will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on and ensure there’s nothing else contributing to your fatigue. It usually takes only a few minutes. We can schedule that for you today or tomorrow, whichever is more convenient. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with gentle exercise, like walking, and try to maintain a healthy weight. Over-the-counter ibuprofen can help with knee pain, but don’t take it for prolonged periods without talking to me first. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… tell me about the walking. How much I should walk? And… is it okay if my son walk with me? He is good company. I like to walk with my son. Is good for my heart, right?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you enjoy walking with your son! Yes, walking is excellent for your heart and overall health. Start slowly, perhaps 15-20 minutes a day, and gradually increase the distance and pace as you feel comfortable. Listen to your body, and don’t push yourself too hard. And absolutely, walking with your son is a fantastic idea! It's great motivation, and it's good for both of you. Do you think you'd be interested in a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Physical therapist… hmm. If they help me walk better… maybe. But I worry they will make me do hard work. I am old, Doctor. Is okay if I think about it? I need to talk to my son. He is good at this things. And… he will know what is best for me. Is okay if I call you later?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s a very wise decision. Talk to your son, and feel free to call me later if you decide you’d like a referral. We can discuss it further. So, to recap, we’ve ordered some blood work, and you'll think about a referral to physical therapy. I’ve also recommended gentle exercise and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is everything. You explain everything very good, Doctor. Thank you. I feel… better now. Just a little bit worried about the blood work. But… I trust you. Is okay. Is good to check everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm glad I could help ease some of your concerns. And don’t worry about the blood work – it will be quick and painless. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood and explain the process. If you have any questions or concerns at all after today, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Have a good day, Ms. Abdollalli. And enjoy your walk with your son!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too! Bye bye.
