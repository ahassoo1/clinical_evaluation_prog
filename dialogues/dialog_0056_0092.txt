DOCTOR: Hi Oreste, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my breathin’. Been gettin’…short. And my mouth feels like sandpaper, and my eyes too. Real dry. Don’t know why though. Never been like this before, not really. I just…feel old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and dry mouth and eyes… that's good information to start with. And you said this is new, hasn't happened before?
PATIENT: Newish. Maybe a few weeks? Hard to say, I don't keep track of every little thing. Used to be able to walk all day, now…not so much. And it’s not like a cold, you understand? No sniffles, no cough. Just…air doesn't fill my lungs like it used to.
DOCTOR: Right, no cold symptoms, that’s helpful. And it's impacting your ability to walk, how far would you say you can walk now compared to a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Walk? Not far. Used to walk to the store, 'bout ten blocks, easy. Now…maybe to the mailbox? And I'm puffin’ like an old engine by the time I get back. It's… embarrassing, really. A man should be able to walk!
DOCTOR: I understand, that sounds frustrating. Okay, let's try to get a bit more information. Do you notice this shortness of breath all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Worse when I try to do somethin’. Sittin’ here, I’m alright, mostly. But stand up, walk a bit…then it starts. And lately, it's been happenin' even when I'm just…relaxin'. Doesn’t make much sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with exertion, but also happening at rest now, that’s good to know. Any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Nah. Not really pain, no. More like…tightness, sometimes. But not like a sharp pain. Just a feelin’ like somethin’s squeezin’. Not all the time though, like everything else, comes and goes. I don’t know what's goin' on with this body anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, no sharp chest pain, just tightness sometimes. Okay. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet lately?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Let me think… I wear these old boots all the time, hard to tell. Maybe a little? I figured it was just from bein’ old. My feet always ache, never paid much attention. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be important, so thank you for mentioning that. And yes, it's good you're telling me what feels normal for you. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, if that's okay. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… sigh. Well, the usual old man stuff. High blood pressure, I think the doctor told me years ago. Been takin’ pills for it, can't remember which ones anymore. And my knees are shot. But that’s just from workin' too hard back in the day. That’s about it, I think. Don't go to the doctor much. Waste of time, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, and some knee problems. Do you remember who prescribed the high blood pressure medication, or have a list of medications you take anywhere?
PATIENT: Nope. No idea who prescribed it. Some doctor, years ago. And no lists. I toss those things out. Just take the pills the pharmacy gives me. They know what I need, right? Used to go to Dr. Garcia, but he retired…or moved away, one of the two. Can't remember which.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're currently taking medication for high blood pressure but don't have a specific list. We’ll definitely need to figure out what that medication is. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see…had my appendix out when I was a kid, that's about it. Maybe somethin' with my knee, a long time ago, but I don’t really recall. They poked and prodded, that’s all I remember. Everything hurts, so I can’t tell what hurts from old age and what hurts from somethin' else.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a child and possibly a knee surgery in the past. And now, about your family…any major health problems run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmph. My mother, she had…heart trouble. That’s what I remember. She died when I was young, though. And my father…he worked too hard, smoked too much. He coughed a lot at the end. Not much else. Didn't really talk about health problems, not in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your mother and smoking related problems in your father. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoked? Lord, yes. For years. Started when I was a kid, foolish thing. Quit… oh, twenty years ago? Maybe more. Long time ago. It was hard. But I stopped. Best thing I ever did, even if it didn't fix all the damage.
DOCTOR: Okay, you quit smoking about 20 years ago. Good for you, that's excellent. Now, finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never been allergic to nothin'. Sometimes get a rash from poison ivy, but that’s it. Just a little itch. Not a big deal. I’ve taken a lot of pills in my life, never had a reaction. I'm a tough old Cuban, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright Oreste, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and oxygen level. And I may want to take a quick look at your ankles and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Go ahead. Just get it over with. Don't poke too much. And speak up, you know. Old ears ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me... and another one. Your heart rate is a bit fast, and I hear some crackling in your lungs when you breathe in. Your blood pressure is a little high, 160 over 90. And your oxygen level is 92%, which is a bit low. There is some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Now, can you tell me if you've noticed any weight gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight gain? Hmph. Maybe a little. Hard to tell, I don’t weigh myself. I eat about the same as always. Cuban food, you know? Good food. But… maybe my pants feel a little tighter. What does it matter, anyway? I'm old, things shift around.
DOCTOR: It matters because weight gain, along with the swelling and your breathing issues, can indicate fluid buildup in your body. We need to figure out what's causing that. I'd like to order a couple of blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. We will also need to do a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests…X-rays… sigh. More poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just don't keep me here all day. I got things to do. What kind of results are you lookin’ for? Will it tell me what's wrong? I just want to be able to walk to the store again.
DOCTOR: We’re hoping the tests will give us a clearer picture of what's causing your shortness of breath and swelling. The blood tests can tell us how well your kidneys are working, which is important for regulating fluid in your body. The chest X-ray will help us see if there’s any fluid in your lungs, or any other problems. I’ll send the orders to the lab and radiology department now. They’ll call you to schedule the tests. I'll also have the nurse come in to give you a list of instructions, and to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if your breathing gets significantly worse, or you experience any chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Emergency room…Hmph. I avoid hospitals if I can. Okay, okay, I understand. Tests, follow up, and go to the emergency room if I can't breathe. Fine. Just hope it ain't nothin’ serious. I’m too old for serious. Tell the nurse to speak up, though. My ears…
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll make a note of that. I will have the nurse come in right away. She’s very good about speaking clearly. Hopefully, we can get this figured out quickly and get you back to walking to the store. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Nah. That’s all. Just…hope it ain't nothin' too bad. And thank you… I think. Tell that nurse to hurry up, though. I got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll get the nurse right away. Take care of yourself, Oreste. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before your appointment.
