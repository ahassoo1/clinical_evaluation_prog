DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too. Hmm, what brings me in… Well, my tummy feels… big. And I don't feel like eating much anymore. It’s just… not right, you know? I feel full after just a little bit. It’s been going on for… a little while now, I think. A few weeks maybe? It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And you mentioned your tummy feels “big,” and you’re not very hungry. Can you describe the feeling of “big” a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Big… It’s… puffed out, I guess? Not painful, just… swollen. Like when you eat too much, but I haven't been eating much! It feels… tight sometimes. Like a balloon, maybe? I don't know if that makes sense. It’s just… different than before. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Swollen, tight, like a balloon… and it’s been happening for a few weeks. No sharp pain, just discomfort. Alright. And has anything in particular worsened this feeling, or made it better?
PATIENT: Oh dear… worsened or better… That’s a good question. I don’t… I don't think so. Maybe… when I lie down flat it feels a bit… fuller? But that might just be because… well, everything goes down when you lie down, doesn’t it? I haven’t really tried to make it better, I just… try to ignore it. And maybe eat a little something. But like I said, I don’t have much appetite.
DOCTOR: Alright. It feels fuller when lying flat. And you haven’t noticed anything specific that relieves it. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh… you mean… going to the bathroom? Hmm… well, I haven't been… regular, I suppose. Not as often as before. And… it's a little harder to… you know. I didn’t think it was important, but… well, now you ask. I haven't told anyone. It's a bit… private, you know?
DOCTOR: It is private, and you've done the right thing by mentioning it. Changes in bowel habits are important. And how would you describe the stool itself, when you do go?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a little difficult to talk about. It’s… harder. Not like it used to be. And… sometimes it's smaller? Like… pebbles, maybe? I’m sorry, I don’t know the proper words. It's just… not normal. It’s been like this for a little while, too. Along with the tummy and the not being hungry. Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. We're gathering important information. Now, have you noticed any nausea or vomiting at all?
PATIENT: Nausea… oh, that’s… feeling sick to your stomach, right? No, not really. I haven't thrown up. But… sometimes I feel a little… queasy? Especially in the mornings. It doesn’t last long, though. Just a little… unsettled. And it’s not every day. Maybe once or twice a week? It’s not bad enough to make me… sick, if that makes sense. Just… a little off. I thought it was just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no vomiting, just occasional morning queasiness. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history… That’s a hard one. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve probably had all sorts of things! I don’t remember much these days. I used to go to a doctor… a long time ago, in Russia. But I don't remember what he treated me for. Just… general things, I suppose. I don’t take any medicines regularly. Nothing at all. And I haven't been to a hospital in… well, a very long time. I'm generally a healthy person, or I was, anyway. Maybe I have a little trouble with my knees sometimes, but that’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Ms. McConnon, it's important for me to have accurate information. Do you recall any surgeries or major illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness… surgeries… I… I think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago. That’s the only thing I can really remember. Everything else is… a blur. I was sick with the flu a few times, of course, like everyone. But nothing major, nothing that required… a hospital stay. I used to be very strong, Doctor. I worked hard all my life. But that was a long time ago. I don't remember much about being sick. It’s all… faded. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy as a child. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's… a difficult question. My parents… they both lived long lives, but I don’t remember what they died from. It was a long time ago. And I had so many siblings… I can’t remember their medical histories, either. We didn’t talk about those things much. It was a different time. Everyone just… got sick and… well, they got sick. I don't know if anyone had… heart disease or cancer. Maybe. I really don’t know. I’m sorry. It’s all… very foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. And finally, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Smoke? Drink? Drugs? Never! I've always been a very healthy person, Doctor. I take care of myself. I don't need those things. I drink tea, sometimes. And I eat… well, I try to eat, but like I said, my appetite isn’t very good lately. But those things… no, never! I wouldn’t dream of it. A simple life is the best life, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. McConnon, I’d like to perform a physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I’m not afraid. Just… be gentle, please? My tummy is a little sensitive. But do what you need to do. I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, and it is distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Alright. Now, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test. I also want to order a stool test to check for any abnormalities. We may also need to consider imaging, depending on the results of these tests.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I just want to feel better. All these tests sound… scary. What are you looking for? Will it hurt? I don’t like needles…
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, I understand your anxiety. It's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about tests. These tests aren't meant to scare you, they are simply tools to help me understand what's going on and determine the best course of action. The blood work will require a small needle prick, and it may be slightly uncomfortable, but it's very quick. The stool test is non-invasive; you’ll simply collect a small sample. Right now, I’m concerned about the distention and tenderness in your abdomen, as well as your decreased appetite and changes in bowel habits. The tests will help rule out several possibilities, such as infection, blockage, or other underlying medical conditions. We’ll start with these basic tests, and if necessary, we can discuss further imaging options. We’ll take everything one step at a time. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Infection… blockage… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Will it require surgery? I’m very old, Doctor. I don’t think I could handle surgery. And what if it’s… something bad? I just want to be comfortable. And maybe eat a little something again.
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, it's understandable that you're worried, and I want to assure you that we are not jumping to any conclusions. The tests are to gather information, not to confirm a diagnosis. Many things can cause abdominal discomfort, and most are not life-threatening. We haven’t even done the tests yet, so there’s no reason to worry about surgery at this point. If, after the tests, we determine that further intervention is necessary, we will discuss all of your options, and we will take your age and overall health into consideration. We would only recommend surgery if it was absolutely necessary and if you were a suitable candidate. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done and seeing what they reveal. It’s important to remember that we are here to help you feel better, and we will do everything we can to provide the best possible care. Do you want me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Explain the tests. Knowing what’s happening… it helps a little. Even if it’s… not good. What will they do with the blood? And the… stool? It sounds… embarrassing. I just want to understand. And I want to be comfortable. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. Let’s start with the blood work. We’ll draw a small amount of blood from your arm, and a phlebotomist will do that – they are very skilled at it. The blood will be sent to a laboratory, where they’ll analyze it to check for signs of infection, inflammation, and to assess your organ function, like your kidneys and liver. It will also tell us if your blood count is normal. The results will give us a broad overview of your overall health. Now, regarding the stool test, it’s a simple procedure. You’ll be given a container and instructions on how to collect a small sample of your stool – it doesn't have to be a large amount. The laboratory will analyze it to check for bacteria, parasites, or blood, which can indicate the cause of your discomfort. I understand it may feel embarrassing, but it's a very important part of the diagnostic process, and the lab technicians are accustomed to handling these samples with utmost professionalism and discretion. Both tests are relatively quick and painless, and the results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the next steps. Does that explanation help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. It’s… good to know what’s happening. And that it’s… routine. But what if… what if it is something bad? What are the… the possibilities? I don't want to be a burden. And I don't want to… well, you know. I just want to feel better. And maybe enjoy a cup of tea again.
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, I understand your fear, and it’s perfectly natural to worry about the worst-case scenario. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions before we have the test results. There are many possible causes for your symptoms, and most of them are treatable. Some possibilities include a simple infection, such as gastroenteritis, which often resolves on its own with rest and fluids. It could also be caused by a blockage in your digestive system, which can be caused by constipation or other factors. In rare cases, it could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as colon cancer, but it’s important to remember that this is just one possibility, and we won't know until we have the results. If, by chance, the tests reveal a more serious condition, we will discuss all of your options, including treatment and palliative care. We will ensure that you receive the best possible care and support, and we will never push you to undergo any treatment that you are not comfortable with. Right now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and gathering information. We’ll take everything one step at a time, and I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s enough for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m still scared, but… I trust you. Let’s get the tests done. The sooner we know, the sooner I can… well, the sooner we can figure things out. Thank you, Doctor. For being patient with an old woman.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. McConnon. It’s my pleasure to help. And you are not just “an old woman,” you are a patient who deserves the best possible care. Alright, let’s get the blood work and stool sample collected. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood, and she’ll explain the process to you. She will also give you the container and instructions for the stool sample. Do you have any difficulty walking, or would you like me to have a wheelchair brought in?
PATIENT: No, I can walk. Just a little slow, that's all. But… what if I can't… collect the sample? What if it’s… too difficult? I don't want to fail. And I don't want to delay things.
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, don’t worry about that at all. If you have any difficulty collecting the sample, just let the nurse know. She can provide you with additional assistance or explain the process in more detail. There are also specific devices available that can make it easier. It’s perfectly alright if it takes a few tries, and we won’t delay things if you need a little help. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable and safe. We'll figure it out together, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… together. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think I'm ready. As ready as an old woman can be. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will let the nurse know you’re ready. She’ll be in shortly. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. I’ll be nearby if you need anything. .
