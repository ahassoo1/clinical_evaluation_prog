DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it's a bit...difficult to explain. I've been having trouble with my speech, it's like…slurred, sometimes. It's been going on for a little while now, but I thought it would just go away on its own.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. It is best to figure these things out. “Trouble with your speech…slurred, sometimes,” you said. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It feels like…a few weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t really remember a specific moment it began, it was more gradual, I think. I just noticed it getting harder to say things clearly, especially at the end of the day. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Gradual onset is quite common. And it’s perfectly normal to not remember the exact moment these things start. “Harder to say things clearly, especially at the end of the day…” Is it worse with fatigue, or after a lot of talking?
PATIENT: Yes, I think you're right on the mark. It is worse when I'm tired, definitely. And after a long day at work… well, let’s just say my husband does most of the talking by dinner time! It's construction management, so there's a lot of communicating with the crews, a lot of shouting sometimes, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Construction management… that is a demanding job, and a lot of vocal strain. Alright. And is it just the clarity that's affected, or have you noticed any changes in your voice itself – is it hoarse, weak, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… sometimes it feels a little weaker, I suppose. Not all the time, but when I'm really tired, my voice just…doesn’t feel as strong. It’s hard to explain. It's not hoarse, not exactly, just…less powerful, maybe? It’s probably nothing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “less powerful” when fatigued. That’s helpful to know. Now, outside of your speech and voice, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… I've been a little more tired than usual, definitely, but I thought that was just from work. Oh! And my husband said I've been a bit clumsy lately, bumping into things. It's silly, really. I just put it down to being distracted, but now that you ask… I haven't been as coordinated, I guess. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Clumsiness and increased fatigue… alright. It’s good you mentioned that. It’s never silly to bring up anything that’s different from your usual, Adyn. It's important information. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. No, not that I've noticed, actually. I'm on my feet all day at work, running around the site, and I haven't felt any different there. I lift things, climb stairs… everything feels normal in that respect. But, sometimes, in the evenings, my hands feel a little…tingly, like pins and needles. It doesn't last long, just a few minutes now and then. Is that the same thing as weakness?
DOCTOR: “Tingling in your hands, a few minutes now and then…” No, that’s not quite the same as weakness, but it's still helpful to know. Alright. To get a better picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just a standard check-up. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I want to figure out what's going on, so please, do whatever you need to. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, let’s start with your reflexes. Could you just relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I'm relaxed. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay… good response on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, I’m squeezing. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Good, good strength in both arms and hands. Now, let’s move on to coordination. Could you touch your finger to your nose, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. And now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds clear… heartbeat is regular… No murmurs or unusual sounds. Everything sounds good there. I'm also going to quickly check your eyes. I'm looking for anything that could indicate a neurological issue. Just follow my finger with your eyes, please. Don't blink.
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay? It's a little hard to keep my eyes open without blinking.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. It is difficult. You did a great job. Okay, Adyn. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. Your symptoms – the slurred speech, fatigue, clumsiness, and tingling – could be due to a number of things. It could be something relatively minor, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. One possibility is a vitamin deficiency, like B12. Another is a neurological issue affecting your nerves or brain. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, vitamin levels, and thyroid function. I also think an MRI of your brain would be a good idea, just to rule out anything structural. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds a little scary, but… if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes. That sounds alright. Blood tests are fine too. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and get it fixed, if it needs fixing. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting more? Or avoiding anything specific?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable approach, Adyn. It is good to be proactive. For now, while we wait for the test results, I wouldn't worry too much about restricting your activities. Rest is always good, but don't feel like you need to completely stop everything. However, I would advise against any strenuous activity until we know more, just to be on the safe side. Also, avoid driving if you feel your speech is significantly impaired, as that could be dangerous. I'll write you a prescription for the blood tests and a referral for the MRI. The lab should be able to fit you in quickly, and we can schedule the MRI for next week. Once the results are back, we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. So, just try to rest a bit, avoid driving if my speech gets worse, and get the tests done. You said it might be a vitamin deficiency… is that common? And is it something that can be fixed easily?
DOCTOR: Vitamin deficiencies are relatively common, particularly B12 and Vitamin D. They can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, neurological issues, and speech problems. And yes, thankfully, most vitamin deficiencies are easily treatable with supplements or dietary changes. If that is the cause, we can usually get you feeling much better with a simple course of treatment. However, it’s important to remember that we don’t know the cause yet, and that’s why the tests are so important. Here are your prescriptions and the referral. The lab should contact you to schedule the blood tests, and the MRI center will call you directly to schedule the scan. If you don’t hear from them within a few days, please give my office a call, and we’ll be happy to assist you. Do you have any other concerns before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Finco. You’ve been very helpful, and I feel a lot better knowing we’re getting this checked out. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns that come up before your next appointment. We're here to support you. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
