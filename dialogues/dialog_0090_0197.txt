DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I need a card to drive for… well, people. Ride-sharing, you know? Uber, Lyft… that sort of thing. They want me to have a commercial driver’s medical card. Is that what this is for? I just want to make sure I can still do this. I need the money, see.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver’s license medical card… yes, I understand. So, it’s not necessarily a complaint, but a requirement for employment. That’s… alright. Still, we need to go through a proper examination to ensure you’re fit to drive safely. It's a fairly stringent process, as it should be. Before we get started, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, stringent is good! Wouldn’t want anyone getting hurt. As for my health… well, I’m 70, so things aren’t perfect. I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, mostly. And my vision isn't what it used to be – that's why I wear glasses, you see. Otherwise… I think I’m pretty good. I walk every day, try to eat right. Had a divorce a few years back, that was… stressful, but I’m managing. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: The divorce… while I appreciate your openness, that’s not directly relevant to the medical assessment, though I’m glad you’re managing. We need to focus on your physical health to determine your ability to operate a vehicle safely. The arthritis and vision changes are important. Can you tell me more about the arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh! Right, yes, physical. Sorry. I get rambling sometimes. The arthritis… it’s mostly in my knees, like I said. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold or damp. Doesn’t really stop me from walking, just… makes it ache. I don’t take any medicine for it regularly. Just try to keep moving, you know? And I avoid hills when I can. That’s important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your vision… you mentioned it isn’t what it used to be. Do you have a recent eye exam?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Let me think… it was about six months ago, maybe a little more. Dr. Yamamoto, over in town. He said my vision is corrected to 20/30 in both eyes with my glasses. He checks it every year, he’s very thorough. He prescribed me a new pair of glasses this time, that's what I'm wearing now. He said I have a little bit of cataracts developing, but nothing to worry about yet.
DOCTOR: 20/30 corrected vision is… acceptable, but we’ll need documentation of that exam. Do you happen to have a copy with you, or do you know if they sent anything to this clinic?
PATIENT: I brought a copy with me! I always do, you never know. Here you are. Everything’s right there, I think. Dr. Yamamoto’s a stickler for details. He likes to write everything down.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes. Dr. Yamamoto is quite thorough, as you said. 20/30 in both eyes with correction, as noted. Mild cataracts bilaterally, stable. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let’s see… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about ten years ago. I take a little pill for it every day. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. My doctor, Dr. Tanaka, keeps it under control. I get my blood pressure checked regularly. No diabetes, thankfully. And… no heart problems, as far as I know. I get a little short of breath sometimes when I walk uphill – probably just the arthritis and age, Dr. Tanaka says.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hypertension, controlled with Lisinopril. And shortness of breath with exertion… that is something we need to consider, even if Dr. Tanaka attributes it to arthritis and age. We can’t simply dismiss it. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. Yes, once. A long time ago, when I was in my thirties. Appendicitis. It was a really bad one, but I recovered just fine. That was… oh, goodness, over forty years ago! Everything else has been outpatient, nothing serious. Just a few broken bones here and there when I was younger, being foolish. Nothing in the last twenty years, I can guarantee you that.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, any past surgeries besides the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the appendix. I’ve always been lucky, I think. I haven’t needed much done. Mostly just regular checkups and the occasional flu shot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother had high blood pressure, like me. And she had some problems with her heart when she got older. My father… he was healthy as a horse, lived to be 90. No diabetes or cancer that I know of, on either side. Pretty unremarkable, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, just the Lisinopril. Sometimes I take a little ibuprofen for my knees when they’re really bothering me, but that’s it. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to be safe. That's all. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness no. Never smoked a day in my life. Alcohol… I might have a glass of sake with dinner sometimes, very rarely. And… recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a very sensible woman. Never been interested in any of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. Now, Mrs. Sciarotta, to properly assess your fitness for a commercial driver’s license, I'm going to need to conduct a physical examination. This will include checking your blood pressure, pulse, vision, reflexes, and range of motion. It's fairly standard. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I expected as much. Let’s get it over with, shall we? I have things to do, you see. But I understand it’s important. Just… try to be quick, if you can?
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Could you please remove your jacket and roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There you are. I try to stay calm when they take my blood pressure, it always seems to go up if I'm nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please sit comfortably.
PATIENT: Okay. I haven't had one of these in ages. Just… be gentle, please? My knees are a little sensitive today.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle. This won’t hurt a bit. Knee reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, somewhat diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Ankle reflexes are also 2+, slightly decreased. Now, I’m going to check your vision again. Could you please read the eye chart for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s see… Um… E… F… P… T… V… Okay. I think that’s as far as I can go without my glasses. My close-up vision isn’t very good, you know. I need them for reading.
DOCTOR: Alright. With your glasses on, can you read the bottom line for me?
PATIENT: Okay… Um… Let’s see… L… T… P… 7… 4… 6… 8… 2… Yes! I can see them all. Everything is clear with my glasses.
DOCTOR: Good. Your corrected vision is 20/30 in both eyes, as Dr. Yamamoto noted. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Deep breath… and… and… Is that okay? I sometimes feel a little… wheezy when I breathe deeply, but it's probably just from the walking.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular and normal. I do detect some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, bilaterally. Do you have any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: No, never. Not asthma, not COPD. Like I said, it’s probably just from the walking, or maybe a little bit of allergies. It’s been a pretty pollen-heavy season, you know. I don't take any medication for it, I just try to avoid being outside when it’s really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you please raise both of your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little… stiff. My shoulders aren’t as flexible as they used to be. It's a little sore, to be honest. I have some arthritis in my upper back too, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you please bend over and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh, no, no, I can’t quite reach. My knees… they won’t let me. It’s very painful, you know. I used to be able to do that easily. But not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s check your gait. Would you mind walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There you go. It’s a little… uneven, I suppose. I tend to limp a bit when I walk long distances, you know? It's mostly my left knee.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta. That concludes the physical examination. Thank you for your cooperation.
PATIENT: Goodness. Well, that was… thorough. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem to be frowning a lot.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Sciarotta, you're in reasonably good health for your age, but there are a few concerns. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, your lung sounds show some wheezing, and your gait is uneven due to arthritis in your knees and limited range of motion. While you can see adequately with correction, the physical limitations and potential respiratory issue are concerning when it comes to safely operating a commercial vehicle. You require a very high level of physical and mental alertness to perform that job safely. I'm hesitant to sign off on the medical card without further evaluation.
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. I see. So… what does that mean? I need this card, Doctor. I really do. What can I do? Is there anything I can do?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s what I recommend. First, I'd like you to schedule an appointment with a pulmonologist to evaluate the wheezing in your lungs. We need to determine the cause and ensure there are no underlying respiratory issues. Secondly, I recommend a consultation with an orthopedic surgeon to assess your knees and discuss potential treatment options, like physical therapy or injections, to improve your mobility. Additionally, I would suggest a cardiac evaluation to rule out any underlying heart issues that could be contributing to your shortness of breath. It’s important to address all of these concerns before I can confidently sign off on the medical card. In the meantime, I will not be able to issue the medical certification. It would be irresponsible of me to do so without a thorough assessment of your overall health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. It's a lot… a lot to take in. A pulmonologist… an orthopedic surgeon… and a heart doctor? Goodness. It’s going to be expensive, isn't it? I’m on Medicare, will it cover all of this? And… how long will it take? I need to get this sorted out quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Mrs. Sciarotta. Medicare should cover most of these consultations and evaluations, but you’ll want to confirm your coverage details with them. I can provide you with referrals to specialists who accept Medicare, and our office staff can assist you with scheduling appointments. As for the timeline, it’s difficult to say exactly. It will depend on the availability of the specialists and the results of their evaluations. We’re talking several weeks, possibly a couple of months, to get everything sorted out. In the meantime, I strongly advise against operating a commercial vehicle. It's not worth risking your health or the safety of others. I’m happy to discuss this further and answer any questions you have. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of my findings and recommendations, along with the referrals. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds acceptable. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your honesty, even if it’s not what I wanted to hear. I suppose… I suppose I have to do what’s best. It's just… it's going to be difficult. I rely on that money, you see. Could you please provide me with those referrals and the written summary? And… could you explain again what I need to tell Medicare? I get so confused with all the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Sciarotta. I completely understand your concerns. Let’s start with the referrals. Here you are. These specialists are well-respected in the area and familiar with the Medicare system. They’ll also likely have staff who can assist you with the paperwork. And here’s a copy of my summary for your records. Now, regarding Medicare, you’ll need to call them directly and explain that you're seeking referrals for a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine your eligibility for a commercial driver’s license. You'll need to provide them with the specialist’s contact information and your reason for the referral. Our office staff can provide you with their phone number and assist you with scheduling a call, if you'd like. Don't hesitate to ask them for help. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Kur. You’ve been very kind. It’s just… a lot to take in. I suppose I’ll get started with the phone calls. It’s going to be a busy few weeks. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Sciarotta. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Our staff is here to help. Wishing you the best, and I hope we can get this sorted out.
