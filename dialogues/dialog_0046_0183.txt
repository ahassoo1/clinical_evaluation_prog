DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It's nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Glowka, you say? Yes. Well, I’m just… tired. Always tired. Like… heavy tired. My wife, she says I need to come. She worries too much, always. But I am tired. It’s this… liver thing. Been with me a long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Grumman. It's good that your wife encourages you to seek care when you’re not feeling your best. It’s certainly important to address persistent fatigue. You mentioned a "liver thing" that you've had for a long time. Could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More? What is there to tell? The doctor… back in the city… he said something about it. Many years ago. I don’t remember all the big words. Something about… not working right? I stopped going to that doctor. Too far. And what could he do about it? It doesn’t hurt, you see. Just… makes me tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when medical explanations are difficult to follow, and it’s understandable why you didn’t continue with that doctor if the travel was difficult and you weren’t feeling it was helpful at the time. So, to clarify, you were seen by a doctor in the past who mentioned something about your liver not functioning optimally, and you've been experiencing fatigue since then?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… right. “Optimally.” Fancy word. But yes. Always tired. Even when I sleep… and I sleep plenty. More than my wife, even! She says I waste the day. But I need the sleep. It doesn’t… fix it. This tired… it’s always there.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily life, despite getting adequate sleep. That’s certainly concerning. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask you a few more questions. We'll go through a bit of your medical history, if that's alright with you. First, have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed over the years – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? No. Not that I know of. They check it sometimes… at the grocery store, you know? The nice lady with the machine. Always says it’s “fine.” Diabetes? No. I eat… normal food. Not too much sugar. Maybe a little cake sometimes. Heart problems? No. I still work, you see. I lift things. Heavy things. If my heart was bad, I couldn't do that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It’s helpful to know you haven’t been diagnosed with those conditions, and it's positive that you're still able to work and lift heavy objects. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a boy… very small boy, back in Ethiopia… I had my… a small thing removed. From my leg. A bone chip, they said. But that was… many, many years ago. And no hospital. Not really. A doctor came to the village. That’s all. Since then? No. Never been in a hospital.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. That sounds like a childhood procedure, and it doesn’t sound like it’s relevant to your current concerns. Now, could you tell me a little about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My wife, of course. She is… strong woman. Keeps me going. We have… children. Three. Grown now. They live in the city. Too busy for visits. Grandchildren, too. Six. But they are… city children. Different. My brothers… most are still in Ethiopia. I send money when I can. They are… farmers. Healthy, I think. They don't get tired like me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you have a close family, even if distance keeps you apart. To help me understand your current fatigue, I'd like to ask about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing alongside the tiredness. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Sometimes I eat more, sometimes less. Depends. Weight? I think I’ve… gotten a little bigger, maybe. Hard to say. My wife says I need to watch it. Bowel habits… regular enough. Nothing… different there. Everything goes… in and out. Like normal. Except when I travel. Then it’s… not so normal. But that’s the traveling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like there haven’t been any significant changes in those areas besides potentially some weight gain. Now, I’m going to ask about some less specific things, just to rule things out. Have you noticed any jaundice – a yellowing of the skin or the whites of your eyes?
PATIENT: Yellowing? No. My wife would tell me if I was yellow. She notices everything. I look… normal. Always normal. Maybe a little… tired looking, she says. But not yellow. Never.
DOCTOR: That’s good. And have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? Sometimes. At the end of the day. When I’ve been working. But it goes away. When I sit and rest, it goes down. My wife rubs them. Says it helps the circulation. I don’t know about circulation. Just… goes away when I rest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or dark urine?
PATIENT: No. No pain. My stomach… feels fine. Sometimes a little… full after I eat. But not pain. Nausea? No. I don’t get sick. Vomiting? Never. And urine… looks normal. Always normal. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Grumman. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and feel for any swelling in your legs. It shouldn’t take long. Would you mind getting up onto the table for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Exam. Okay. Listen to my heart… she always says it's strong. But I am getting old, you know? Everything gets… slower. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a bit slow, but the rhythm is regular. I don't hear any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. It's mildly distended, but not significantly. Finally, I’m going to check for swelling in your legs and ankles. I do notice some mild pitting edema in your ankles – that’s the slight swelling we talked about. It resolves quickly when I press on it. Okay, Mr. Grumman, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal, but the mild edema and distended abdomen, coupled with your fatigue, are concerning. I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Specifically, I want to check your liver function, kidney function, complete blood count, and electrolytes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more tests. Fine. Whatever you think is best. My wife always says I need more tests. She is always right. Liver function… that sounds about right. It's always been the liver. Check whatever you need to check. Just… tell me what it means, when you get the results. I don't understand all the big words.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Grumman. I’ll explain everything to you in plain language, and we can discuss the results together. I’ll also send a copy of the results to your wife, if you'd like. I’m ordering the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to draw the blood right away. It shouldn’t take long. You’ll need to be fasting for at least 8 hours before the test, so if you’ve eaten anything recently, we may need to reschedule it for tomorrow. Have you had anything to eat or drink since last night?
PATIENT: Last night… yes. Dinner with my wife. And this morning… a little coffee. Just a small cup. Is coffee bad? My wife says everything is bad. I didn’t eat anything after the coffee. But… eight hours? That’s a long time. Can’t I just… skip lunch?
DOCTOR: Skipping lunch would be fine, Mr. Grumman, but because you had coffee this morning, the results might not be entirely accurate. It's best to be as accurate as possible. The coffee can slightly affect some of the values. We can reschedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning, and you can fast from dinner tonight until then. That way, we’ll get the most reliable results. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… yes. Fine. Tomorrow morning. I will tell my wife. She will make sure I don’t eat anything. She is very good at that. So… I just come back here, tomorrow morning? Same time?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Grumman. Same time tomorrow morning. Please let the lab technician know you’re here for the fasting blood work I ordered. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or significant swelling, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… tired. Thank you, Doctor. I will see you tomorrow. I hope the tests don't take too long. My wife… she has things planned.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Grumman. I understand. I’ll make sure to get the tests done as efficiently as possible. Please take care of yourself, and I’ll see you tomorrow morning. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
