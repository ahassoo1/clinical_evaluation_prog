DOCTOR: Good morning. Dawnetta Hatchard, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. And look, I haven’t got all day, so if we could just get on with it… I’ve been taking these pills for years, you know. Years! And now this.
DOCTOR: “This” being…?
PATIENT: The… the other end. Dark. Not right at all. Like… well, you know. Black. It’s disgusting, frankly. And I take my pills, the doctor gave ‘em to me for my back, and now this. It’s probably those pills, isn’t it? They mess with everything, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re experiencing a change in stool color… dark stool, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dark! Like… like tar, almost. And it’s been going on for a few days now. Honestly, I don’t need a description, I see it. Are you going to fix it or just ask questions all day? I’ve got a garden to tend, you know. And my husband… well, he needs his lunch.
DOCTOR: Very well. To properly assess this, I need a bit more information. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, weakness, or fatigue along with this change in stool?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little… creaky, like always. I’m 73, things creak! Fatigue… well, I get tired, doesn’t everyone? Honestly, I’m on Medicare, I’m not expecting miracles. It’s probably just old age, or those blasted pills. Are you going to do something or just keep poking around with questions? I really don’t see what good all this is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s review your current medications. You said you’re taking something for your back… can you tell me the name of that medication, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly, I don't remember the name. It's a little white pill. Doctor gave it to me years ago. Something… naproxen, maybe? I take two of ‘em with breakfast, and sometimes one at night if it’s really bad. Honestly, I just take what they give me. It's all the same to me, pills are pills. Why does it matter which one?
DOCTOR: It matters because naproxen, like other NSAIDs, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding. And dark, tarry stools, as you've described, can be a sign of that. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool besides the darkness?
PATIENT: Bleeding? No! Not that I've seen. Just… dark. Like I said, tar. I’m not going poking around in it looking for blood, are you? Honestly, this is ridiculous. It’s probably just something I ate. I had beets last week, maybe that’s it. Though, it’s been days now… still, it could be the beets. Really, I think I'm fine. Can we just… write it off as something harmless?
DOCTOR: Beets, while capable of altering stool color, wouldn’t persist for days. Given your age and medication history, we can’t simply dismiss this. I'm going to need to perform a quick physical examination. Specifically, I'll need to check your abdomen and take your vital signs. It's a standard procedure. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to touch me? After all this questioning? Honestly. Fine. But don't expect any pleasantries. And be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. And try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, please. I'm checking for tenderness or any masses. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild discomfort in the lower quadrants. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Now, I’d like to order a stool occult blood test and a complete blood count. These will help us determine if there’s any internal bleeding.
PATIENT: Discomfort? Of course there's discomfort! You're poking at me! And what’s “occult”? Sounds dreadful. Honestly, you doctors and your fancy words. So, you're going to take more of my blood? I hate needles. And what if it’s something serious? Don't tell me I need surgery, I can't do surgery. My husband... he wouldn't cope. Just tell me if it's the pills. Is it the pills?
DOCTOR: "Occult" simply means hidden. The test checks for blood that you can't see with the naked eye. It is possible the naproxen is contributing to this, but we need to rule out other causes first. Until we have the results of the tests, I cannot definitively say what is causing this. I'm ordering the tests now. The lab technician will collect the samples. Once we have the results, we can discuss further steps. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Latex? Goodness, I don’t know. Probably not. I’ve been alive for 73 years, I think I'd know if I was allergic to something. Honestly, this is all so much fuss over a little dark stool. I just want it to go away. And don't tell me I have to come back again, I really don’t have the energy. Just... tell me when the results are in. And please, try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: The lab usually has results within 48-72 hours. My office will contact you when they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any dizziness, weakness, or significant abdominal pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, dizziness, weakness, emergency room… I heard you. Honestly, I’m not that feeble. I think I’ll be alright. Just… call me when you have the results. And don’t bother with a lot of explanations. Just tell me what I need to do. And try to be gentle with my old ears when you call, alright?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve documented everything. You will receive a call with the results within 72 hours. Please contact the office if your condition worsens. Have a good day. .
