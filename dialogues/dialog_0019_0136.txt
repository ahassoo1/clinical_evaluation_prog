DOCTOR: Good morning, Lucia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… it’s my… belching. It’s been happening a lot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, belching. And it’s been happening… how long is "lately," roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a month? Something like that. It's not all day, but… often after I eat. Especially if I eat fast.
DOCTOR: A month, mostly after eating, and worse when you eat quickly. Okay. Anything in particular trigger it?
PATIENT: Not really… not that I notice. Sometimes… maybe if I drink soda? But I don’t drink a lot of soda. Just sometimes with lunch. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be important, yes. Soda has carbonation, and that can certainly contribute to gas. Let's try to get a better picture of things. Aside from the belching, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe a little… full feeling? But I eat normal portions, I think. No pain, no… nothing else. Just the belching. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying is definitely a valid symptom! Okay. And have you noticed any change in your diet recently, or anything new you’ve been eating or drinking besides the occasional soda?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same food, I think. I work at the factory, so I usually bring my own lunch. Rice and beans, chicken… sometimes a little salad. Nothing new. Just… the usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And thinking a bit broader… have you had any issues with heartburn, indigestion, or nausea lately, even if it's mild?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No heartburn, no… what was the other one? In-di-gestion? No, nothing like that. I haven't felt sick to my stomach either. Just… the burps. A lot of burps.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Um… not much, really. I haven’t been to the doctor much. Just… the usual check-ups when I was a kid. No big problems. I don't take any medicine. I don’t have insurance, so I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical issues that you're aware of, no medications currently, and you try to stay healthy. That’s good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Nothing like that. I've been lucky, I guess. Just… these burps now. They're making me feel self-conscious at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And thinking about your family… any history of digestive problems – like, did your parents or siblings have issues with heartburn, gas, bloating, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Hmm… my Mama, she had a little trouble with… gas sometimes? But not bad. She just drank a lot of chamomile tea. I don't think my Papa had any problems. And I don't really talk to my siblings much anymore… so I don't know. Nothing serious, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay. So potentially some gas in your mother, but nothing major. To wrap up the history a little bit, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking, no drinking, no… anything like that. I don't do any of that. Healthy, remember? I try to be.
DOCTOR: Right, healthy! I remember. Okay, Lucia, thank you for that information. It sounds like, based on what you're telling me, it's likely this is related to swallowing air, perhaps when eating quickly. It’s often harmless, but can be uncomfortable. I’d like to listen to your abdomen, just to rule out anything else. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Listening is good. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Okay… and one more. Everything sounds… normal, thankfully. No unusual sounds or tenderness. It does seem like it’s likely just trapped air. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies. Not to food, not to medicine, nothing. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m lucky, like I said.
DOCTOR: Good. That simplifies things. So, based on everything we’ve discussed – the belching after meals, especially when eating quickly, no other symptoms, a normal abdominal exam, and no known allergies – I think we can try some simple changes first. I recommend trying to eat a bit slower, taking smaller bites, and avoiding carbonated beverages for a while to see if that helps. Also, try to avoid chewing gum, if you chew gum. Sometimes that can lead to swallowing excess air too. Would you be willing to try that for a week or two and see if things improve?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Slow down, smaller bites, no soda. I can do that. A week or two sounds fine. Thank you. Should I… come back if it doesn’t get better?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. If it doesn’t improve after a week or two of making those changes, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And if the belching gets significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms like pain, nausea, vomiting, or difficulty swallowing, please come in sooner. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Just… slow down and don't drink the soda. I can remember that. Thank you for listening to me. It was making me worry a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lucia. It's good to know what’s going on, even if it’s something simple. I’m glad I could help ease your worry. Just remember to take your time with meals. We don’t need any prescriptions or further tests at this time. And since you don’t have insurance, I’ll keep the notes as detailed as possible. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
