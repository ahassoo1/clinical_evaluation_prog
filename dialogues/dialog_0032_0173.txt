DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for having me. Well, I've just been feeling really cold lately, you know? Like, getting chills. It's a bit odd for this time of year, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. A bit unusual for August. Could you elaborate on these chills, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not like a fever chill, if that makes sense? It's more… waves of cold. They come and go. I'll be perfectly fine, then suddenly I'm shivering, even though I don't feel sick otherwise. It’s been happening for about a week, I think. Maybe a little longer. I haven't really kept close track. It's just... annoying, really.
DOCTOR: “Waves of cold,” alright. And you said you don’t feel generally unwell – no cough, no sore throat, no muscle aches?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No cough, no sore throat… maybe a tiny bit tired, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? I work a lot. It's not a bad tired, just… regular life tired, you know? Nothing that would make me think I was coming down with something. And no muscle aches, definitely not.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. I mean, my appetite is normal, I’ve been sleeping okay… Oh! Wait a minute. Now that you mention it, I’ve been a bit more thirsty than usual, maybe? But I just thought that was because it’s been warm-ish, even if I feel cold. I drink a lot of water anyway. Is that… is that a thing? Being thirsty?
DOCTOR: Increased thirst can be significant. It's good you mentioned that. Now, Ms. Aslan, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Not much to tell, really. I've always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was little – fell out of a tree, silly story. I don’t have any ongoing conditions, like diabetes or anything. And I don’t take any regular medication. I had my gallbladder removed about five years ago, but that’s it. Oh, and I was divorced last year. Does that count as medical history?
DOCTOR: That is… not typically part of the medical history, Ms. Aslan, though stressful life events can certainly impact one's health. No ongoing conditions, no medications… and the gallbladder removal five years ago. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully! My mum always worried about it, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Shellfish, nuts, pollen… all good. She tried to get me to take allergy meds as a preventative thing when I was younger, but I refused.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, tell me about your family. Any significant medical history on your mother or father's side?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think… My mum's side is pretty healthy, actually. She's still going strong, she's 78. She has a little arthritis, but that's it, and it's just normal wear and tear. My dad… that's a bit more complicated. He had high blood pressure, and he had a heart attack about ten years ago. He's doing okay now, he takes medication for it. And… oh, my aunt on his side had diabetes, type 2, I think. That's about it, I think. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and a heart attack in your father, type 2 diabetes in an aunt… alright. And what about your social habits, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Social habits? Do you mean… like, do I smoke or drink? No, I don’t smoke. I used to drink occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes – but I’ve cut back a lot since the divorce. It didn’t really agree with me, honestly. I work a lot, so I don’t really go out much. Mostly just… home, work, maybe a bit of gardening. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to complete the picture, could you tell me your height and weight, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I'm... about 5 foot nothing, really. 5'2", maybe? And… …around 154 pounds, I think. Somewhere around there. It fluctuates a bit, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Aslan. That's very helpful. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. It will just be a basic check of your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll begin. Blood pressure is 130/85. Slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiratory rate is 16, unlabored. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Gallbladder area is unremarkable, no pain on palpation. Everything seems within normal limits on initial examination, Ms. Aslan, however, given your symptoms of chills and increased thirst, and your family history of diabetes, I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Hemoglobin A1c test. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary. A1c… that’s the one for diabetes, right? My aunt was always talking about it. So, what happens next? Do I need to fast before these tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, the Hemoglobin A1c gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, water is fine. Here is the requisition form. You can take this to the lab downstairs, and they will schedule an appointment for you. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back to us. Once we have the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, experience excessive thirst, or notice any other concerning changes – please do not hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear. Fast for eight hours, get the tests done downstairs, and call if anything gets worse. Okay. 24 to 48 hours… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I think that's everything for now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is everything for now, Ms. Aslan. We will be in touch as soon as the results are available. You will receive a call from my nursing staff to schedule a follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you well, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. Have a good day.
