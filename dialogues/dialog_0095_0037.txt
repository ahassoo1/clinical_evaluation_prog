DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… the breathing. I have been… wheezing. It makes it hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, wheezing. I understand. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Maybe… two weeks? It started small, but now… it is more often. Especially when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, about two weeks, and it's getting worse, particularly with walking. Do you notice anything else happening when you wheeze?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes… my chest feels tight. Like… a band around it. And I cough a little, but not much. Mostly just the… whistling sound when I breathe. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: A tight chest and some whistling with your breath… alright. It's good you're describing these things to me. It doesn’t sound like something to ignore, but “normal” isn’t really the right word. It could be a number of things. Have you had a fever, chills, or any cough that brings up mucus?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And the cough… it is dry. No… nothing coming up. Just the… whistling. I feel tired sometimes, but I am an old woman. That is not new. Is walking a lot bad for this? I like to walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever and a dry cough. And you're feeling tired, which you attribute to age, understandably. Walking… well, it’s good you’re active, but we need to figure out why you're getting short of breath with it. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then we can talk a little more about your medical history. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Please listen. I want to keep walking if I can. It is important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit comfortably and breathe normally through your mouth, please. Okay. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, as you described. It's more pronounced on the left side. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Could you tell me if you have any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Asthma… no, I don’t think so. Not when I was young. My mother… she had some trouble breathing sometimes, but I do not know what it was. COPD… I do not know that word. Is that… bad? I have been healthy most of my life. Just some aches and pains, you know? Old age.
DOCTOR: COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It’s a lung condition that can make it hard to breathe, often caused by smoking, but it can happen to anyone. It’s good you've been healthy most of your life. Now, have you ever had pneumonia, bronchitis, or any other serious lung infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… pneumonia… I think so, once. A long time ago. When I was maybe… forty? I was very sick, in bed for weeks. But that was… a long, long time ago. Bronchitis… no, I do not think so. Just… colds sometimes. Normal colds. Nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, pneumonia once when you were around forty, and otherwise just typical colds. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. And I have not taken many medicines. Just… pain relievers for my knees sometimes. That is all. Is it possible it is just… a cold then? A bad cold?
DOCTOR: It could be a cold, but given the wheezing and the tightness in your chest, I’d like to rule out some other possibilities. We should check your oxygen levels and, possibly, get a chest X-ray just to be sure. Have you been around anyone who is sick recently?
PATIENT: Oh… an X-ray? That sounds… serious. I do not like the sound of that. But… if you think it is best. And… yes. My grandson came to visit last week. He had a terrible cough. He said it was just a virus, but… maybe I caught something from him? He felt very warm.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned your grandson. That increases the likelihood it could be a viral infection. The X-ray is just to be cautious, to rule out anything more serious like pneumonia or something else affecting your lungs. It’s a quick procedure, and it will give us a better picture of what’s going on. Before we do that, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pain reliever for my knees. It is called… Ibuprofen. And sometimes, I take a vitamin D tablet. My doctor told me to, because I do not get much sun. That is all, I promise. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen for your knees and Vitamin D. That’s good to know. Alright, Mrs. Kilton, let's check your oxygen saturation first. Then, if it’s low, or if you’re still feeling very short of breath, we’ll get that chest X-ray. It's a small procedure, and it will help me get a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. Just… I hope it is not too serious. I do not want to stop walking. It is… very important to me. You will tell me if it is bad, yes?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Kilton. And I will. We'll take it one step at a time. We'll get the oxygen level reading now, and then we can discuss what that means. It’s likely just a viral infection, but we need to be sure. Okay, let's see what your oxygen level is…
