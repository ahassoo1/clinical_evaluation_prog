DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn, let's get right to it. You're 69, I see. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, 69… feels older some days, I tell you what. Something about a check-up… for… acting? They said something about needing a clearance. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I mostly just… work at the theater. Ushers, you know? Tickets and such. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: A check-up for…acting?
PATIENT: Right. That sounds about right. A performance physical, I think they called it. I do a little bit of everything at the theater, sometimes they need extras, so… It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I just want to get it over with, if that's alright. Is there a form I need to fill out or something?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Right. Well, we need something official. Let's just say for the record, you're here for a general physical, requested by…the theater. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Existing conditions… Oh, dear. Let me think… My knees ache sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And my back… gets a bit stiff. But honestly, that's just old age, isn't it? Nothing a little stretching doesn’t fix. I don't think I have anything serious. No, no doctor has ever told me anything serious. I don't even have a regular doctor, if that tells you anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, goodness. I don’t really take much of anything, to be honest. Maybe some over-the-counter pain relievers for the knees, but nothing regularly. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. Not that I know of, anyway. It’s been a long time since I’ve needed anything serious. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s a tough one. My family… well, they were mostly in China. Didn't see them much, to be honest. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. I don’t really know much about what they had, if anything. Heart trouble, maybe? That seems to run in families, doesn’t it? I'm really not much help with this, am I? Sorry. It was a long time ago, and… things weren’t really discussed much.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s just skip that for now. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. Never. Not any of those. Never smoked a day in my life. A little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very occasionally. But nothing… regular. And definitely no… recreational drugs. I work at the theater, you know! I need a clear head for that. A very clear head.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam then. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, yes, I can. Slowly, though, please. Knees aren't what they used to be. Just take it easy, alright? I'm not as spry as I look… or used to look. What are we looking for exactly?
DOCTOR: Just checking your balance and coordination. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Hmm. A slight murmur, but not concerning given your age. Lungs are clear. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh! A little tender, yes. That’s probably just… indigestion, I think. I had a rather large lunch. Spicy noodles. Very tasty, but… not always kind to the stomach. Nothing serious, I assure you. Just a bit of discomfort. Is that going to be on the form? Because honestly, indigestion shouldn’t disqualify me from… whatever this is for.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, let’s check your reflexes. Hmm. A little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright. Well, everything seems… relatively normal for a 69-year-old. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's good to hear. No, no questions, I don't think. Just… can I go now? I have to get back to the theater. They're expecting me to help set up for the evening show. Is there anything wrong? You said “relatively normal”… that doesn't sound entirely reassuring.
DOCTOR: No, nothing serious. Just age-related changes. Diminished reflexes, a slight murmur… normal wear and tear. I'll write up a note stating you're cleared for light physical activity. No heavy lifting. Here. Take this to the theater. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Thank you, thank you very much. “Light physical activity”… that's me. Ushering, ticket taking… no heavy lifting, definitely. I appreciate your time, Doctor. And… have a good day.
