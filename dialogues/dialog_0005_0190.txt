DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s this… unsteadiness, I suppose. It’s… difficult to explain. I feel… off-balance, sometimes. Not constantly, but… enough to be concerning. It’s been happening for… well, I can’t quite recall when it started, truthfully. A few weeks, perhaps? It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And “off-balance” is… quite vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. It is vague, isn’t it? It's not like I'm falling over, Doctor. More like… a swaying. Like I’m on a boat, even when I’m standing still. And sometimes… things seem to spin, just a little. It’s brief, usually, but… unsettling. I find myself reaching for things just to steady myself. Is that clearer? I apologize for being… imprecise. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Swaying” and “spinning.” Vertigo, perhaps?
PATIENT: Vertigo… I believe I've heard of that. Is that… serious? I’m not entirely sure what it entails. It sounds unpleasant. Is it something that… goes away on its own, or… I’m rather… anxious about this, to be honest. It’s just… I lost my husband last year, and… well, I’m trying to manage things on my own, and this makes it harder.
DOCTOR: Losing a spouse is…difficult. I understand the added stress. Vertigo can be serious, but often it's not. There are many causes. Inner ear problems, sometimes. Other times… it's more complicated. Now, let's try to narrow things down. Have you had any headaches along with this?
PATIENT: Headaches… Occasionally, yes. Not severe ones, and not always with the unsteadiness. They’re… dull, more than anything. A pressure, really, at the back of my head. They come and go independently, I think. I’ve just been taking over-the-counter pain relievers when they occur. Does that… help? I apologize again for being so… rambling.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter…fine for occasional use. But we need to understand why you’re getting these headaches. Alright, let's move on. Any nausea or vomiting with this dizziness?
PATIENT: Nausea… Yes, sometimes. Not full-blown vomiting, thankfully, but… a queasy feeling. It often accompanies the spinning sensation, but not always. And it doesn’t last long, usually. Just… a wave of sickness. It’s… unpleasant, naturally, but I haven’t needed any medication for it. Is that… a common symptom, Doctor? I truly appreciate you asking these questions. It’s… helpful, even if I can’t provide precise answers.
DOCTOR: It can be common, yes. Many things cause nausea. It narrows the possibilities, though. Now, have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… That’s… an interesting question. Not consistently, no. Sometimes, very faintly, I think I hear a… high-pitched tone. But I always assumed it was just… the silence. I work out in the rural areas, you see, and it’s often very quiet. It’s not… persistent, or bothersome. Would that… be significant? I'm not certain I've ever mentioned it to a doctor before.
DOCTOR: Rural areas…right. The silence can play tricks on you. High-pitched tone…could be tinnitus. Which can be associated with inner ear problems. Alright. Let’s get a bit of background. Any history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections… As a child, yes. I believe I had several. Not terribly severe, from what I recall. My mother handled most of the medical care then. I don’t remember being hospitalized or anything of that nature. Just… a lot of earaches. And I believe I had my tonsils removed when I was young, as well. Would that be relevant, Doctor? I'm doing my best to remember, truly, but it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Tonsils removed…can be a factor. Now, any family history of dizziness, balance problems, or hearing loss?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family is… scattered. I haven’t been in contact with many of them for quite some time. My mother… she always had a bit of a tremor, I suppose. But I don’t recall her ever mentioning dizziness or balance issues. And my father… he passed away when I was very young. I truly don’t know, Doctor. I apologize for being unable to provide a more helpful answer. It’s… a sensitive topic. And my memory… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Scattered family… understandable. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just… over-the-counter pain relievers when I have a headache. Ibuprofen, sometimes acetaminophen. And… I take a multivitamin daily. That’s it, Doctor. Nothing prescribed, and nothing… regular, beyond that. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, until recently. I just want to understand what’s happening, and… hopefully, find a way to manage it. It’s unsettling to feel… off-balance.
DOCTOR: Alright. Open your mouth… say “ah.” Tongue out. Follow my pen… Okay. Your ears look clear. Throat looks fine. Pupils are responsive. I'm going to have you stand up now, and walk a straight line for me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just… let me know if I need to stop. I’m a bit unsteady, as you know. I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, stop. You do have some mild instability. Now, I'm going to check your balance more formally. Sit back down. Keep your eyes closed. And just… try to remain still.
PATIENT: Oh… Doctor? I… I feel a little off-balance now. It’s… difficult to keep still. I’m trying, truly, but…
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Sit back down. Based on this brief examination, it appears you have some mild balance issues. It could be a number of things. Most likely, it's benign positional vertigo – something relatively harmless. However, given your… history, and the fact that you lost your husband recently, it’s important to rule out other causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying issues. I’m also going to order an MRI to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: An MRI… Is that… necessary, Doctor? Is it something serious? I… I’ve always been a little claustrophobic, if I’m being honest. And blood work… that’s… alright, I suppose. I just… I’m worried it’s something more than just… vertigo. Losing my husband… it’s been difficult, and I haven’t been taking care of myself as well as I should, I admit. I just want to know what’s happening, and… hopefully, find a way to feel better. What do you think is the most likely cause, Doctor? Do you have any initial thoughts?
DOCTOR: Look, it’s standard procedure to rule out anything serious, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Standard procedure. When can I schedule the MRI, then? And… what should I expect? Will I be able to drive myself afterwards? I live quite a distance from the clinic, and… I don’t have much family nearby to help. And is there anything I can do in the meantime? Any exercises, or… anything to help with the dizziness? I just… I feel so unsteady, and I’m afraid of falling.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. My nurse will schedule the MRI for you before you leave. She'll give you all the instructions you need, including information about transportation. As for the dizziness, avoid sudden movements and try to stay well-hydrated. There are some exercises for vertigo, but honestly, they're not very effective unless we know the cause of your dizziness. Don’t push yourself. And frankly, your stress levels are likely exacerbating things. I’m going to write you a referral to a physical therapist, just in case. And I'll also order a vitamin D test. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s all for now. Thank you for your time. And for the referrals. I appreciate you… ruling things out. Even if it’s just standard procedure, it… it’s reassuring. I’ll speak with the nurse about scheduling the MRI. And I’ll try to stay hydrated, and… avoid sudden movements. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day. Next! .
PATIENT: .
