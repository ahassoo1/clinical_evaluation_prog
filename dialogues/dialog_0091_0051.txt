DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… lovely to meet you too. Let me see… my dear, what was it now? My grandson, he said something about needing to know… my blood type. Yes, that’s it! Something about needing to know for… things. Old age, you know. It slips my mind so easily these days. He said it was important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nini. Knowing your blood type is a good precaution, and it's quite common to want that information as we get older. Your grandson is quite right to be thoughtful. We can determine that with a simple blood test. Before we proceed with the test, though, I’d like to get a more complete picture of your overall health. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… goodness. That’s a long story, I suspect. I’ve lived a good long life, you know. Worked with ropes and… and things. Rigging, that was it! Down at the port, mostly. But what do you want to know, exactly? I forget names, terribly. And dates… well, don’t even ask. I have private insurance, if that matters. My husband… he arranged it, years ago. He was a practical man.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Nini. We don’t need exact dates, just a general understanding. And yes, knowing you have private insurance is helpful. Let’s start with this: have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. Arthritis, yes. My hands, they ache something awful in the cold. The doctor… back home, he gave me some cream for it. And my heart… it flutters sometimes. Not often, but it does. I wouldn’t say problems, exactly. More like… a little skip now and then. I had a good doctor, years ago, but he… well, he’s not around anymore. A very kind man. I don’t think I have diabetes. I always liked a sweet pastry, but nothing too bad, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. Arthritis in your hands and occasional heart palpitations. That's helpful to know. And you don't believe you have diabetes. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Oh, yes! When I was quite young, I broke my arm. Fell from a… a scaffolding, I think. Silly girl, trying to climb too high. And… let me see. Later in life, when my husband… well, he was very ill. I stayed with him, of course. A long time in the hospital then. No surgeries, though. Not that I recall, anyway. Everything gets so muddled, you know. It was a long time ago. A very sad time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nini. It's perfectly normal for details to become less clear with time, especially after difficult experiences. So, a broken arm as a child and hospitalization while your husband was ill. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Now that’s a difficult one. My mother… she lived to a good old age, but I don’t really remember her being ill, exactly. She was a strong woman. My father… he worked on the sea, a fisherman. He… well, he just wore out, I suppose. A lot of aches and pains, but nothing specific. My brother… he had a weak heart, I think. He died young. And my sister… she was always a bit forgetful, even when she was young. Is that what you mean? Like me, perhaps? Everything is so hazy… it's like looking through a fog. I really wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Nini. You’ve given me a good deal of information. It sounds like there may be a family history of heart issues and some memory concerns, which is helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your current lifestyle. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Let me see. Just the cream for my hands, the one the doctor gave me. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little something… a sleeping pill, I think. My grandson gives it to me. He worries about me. I don’t take anything regularly, though. Nothing for my heart, or anything like that. Just the cream and the sleeping pill when I need it. He’s very good, that boy. Always looking after me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Nini. Just the hand cream and an occasional sleeping pill. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, dear. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, down by the port! Fish, of course, all kinds of fish. And fruit… and pastries! Never had a problem. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. My skin gets a bit itchy sometimes, but that’s just the sun, I think. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors, you know, working with the ropes. A bit of sun never hurt anyone. Though I suppose it can now… everything changes, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Nini. No known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… Well, these days it's not very exciting! Mostly I stay at home. My grandson comes to visit, he’s a good boy. I read a bit, when my eyes will let me. And I like to sit in the garden, when the weather is nice. I used to be very active, you know, working down at the port. Lots of climbing and lifting. But those days are long gone. I don’t go out much anymore. Too many people, too much noise. I prefer the quiet. And a nice cup of tea. Is that what you want to know? I’m probably not very interesting!
DOCTOR: You are very interesting, Ms. Nini. It sounds like you've lived a full and active life, and now you enjoy a peaceful retirement. And it’s good to know you have your grandson looking after you. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam… yes, yes, that’s fine. I don’t mind at all. I used to be quite strong, you know, lifting those ropes. My heart’s probably a bit worn out now, but it’s still ticking, thankfully. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just be gentle with my hands, they ache so easily. And don’t mind if I ramble on a bit… things just pop into my head sometimes. It’s the age, you know. Everything gets a bit… muddled.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nini. I will be as gentle as possible. And please, don't worry about rambling. Take your time. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Oh, blood pressure… yes, of course. My grandson says my blood pressure is sometimes a bit high. He worries about me so. He’s a good boy, always looking after me. Is this going to hurt, dear? I don't like needles, you know. Not at all.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Ms. Nini. This cuff just inflates to measure your blood pressure. It might feel a little tight, but it shouldn't hurt. Your blood pressure is 145/85. That is slightly elevated, but not critically high. We can monitor that over time. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. I hear a slight murmur, which is not uncommon with age. It doesn’t sound concerning at this moment, but it’s good to be aware of it. Your lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? Oh dear. My husband… he had a murmur too, I think. Was it serious, Doctor? He wasn’t a strong man, you know. Always coughing. I don't cough much, thankfully. Just a little tickle in my throat sometimes. He was a kind man, though. Always brought me flowers. Is this murmur something I should worry about? My grandson will be so worried if I tell him. He frets over every little thing.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned your husband, Ms. Nini. A murmur simply means there’s an extra sound when your heart beats. Many murmurs are harmless and don’t require any treatment, especially those that are mild, like yours. However, because your husband had a murmur, it’s prudent to investigate further to rule out any underlying cause. I would like to order an echocardiogram, which is a non-invasive ultrasound of your heart. It will give us a much clearer picture of how your heart is functioning and allow us to determine if any treatment is needed. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An… echo-what-now? Ultrasound, you say? Is that… painful? I don’t like hospitals, you know. Too many noises and… and smells. My grandson said something about a scan once… Is it like that? Will it take long? I have my tea time, you know. And I like to sit in the garden when the sun is shining. I don’t want to be stuck in a hospital all day. Is there anything else I should worry about? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. I might forget what you’re telling me. Oh dear… this is all very confusing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Nini. It’s natural to be anxious about medical tests. An echocardiogram is not painful at all. It’s similar to a scan, but it uses sound waves instead of radiation. A technician will apply a gel to your chest and move a handheld device over your skin. It doesn’t take long, usually about 30-60 minutes. We can schedule it at the outpatient imaging center, which is much quieter and more comfortable than the hospital. And it certainly won’t interfere with your tea time or garden visits. To be clear, we're not assuming there's anything serious wrong. This is simply a precautionary measure, given your husband's history and the slight murmur I heard. It’s best to have a complete picture of your heart health. Now, while we’re discussing this, do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, well… chest pain, not really. A little flutter sometimes, but nothing to worry about. Shortness of breath… when I climb the stairs, perhaps. But I don’t climb many stairs these days, thankfully. And my ankles… yes, they do swell a bit in the evenings. My grandson says it’s the heat. He’s very observant, that boy. Always noticing things. He makes me wear those support stockings, you know. Not very fashionable, but he says they help. This scan… will it show everything? Will it tell us if my heart is… working properly? I just want to know I’m alright. I don't want to be a burden to my grandson. He's got his own life, you know. A good boy, that one. Always taking care of me. So, to recap… no chest pain, a little breathlessness, and swollen ankles. And this scan… it's not painful? Really?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Nini. The scan, or echocardiogram, will give us a detailed look at the structure and function of your heart. It will show us if your heart is pumping effectively, if the valves are working properly, and if there are any areas of weakness or damage. And you are absolutely right to ask about pain. It is completely painless. The technician will apply a warm gel to your chest, and the handheld device will move over your skin. You won't feel anything at all. Given your mild breathlessness and swelling in your ankles, and the murmur I detected, the echocardiogram is a very important step in understanding your overall heart health. It will help us determine if any treatment is necessary, or if we simply need to continue monitoring your condition. To summarise, we’ll schedule an echocardiogram at the outpatient imaging centre. It’s painless, takes about 30-60 minutes, and will give us valuable information about your heart. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t hurt. And it won’t take up too much of my grandson’s time, will it? He works so hard. He deserves a little peace and quiet. So, the echo-thing… at the outpatients… no pain… and it’s just to check my heart? Will I need to… prepare for it in any way? Should I avoid tea? Or pastries? I do love a good pastry, you know. And I like to sit in the garden. Oh dear… I’m starting to worry again. Everything gets so muddled. But alright. If it will put my grandson’s mind at ease, I’ll do it. If it will make him happy. He’s a good boy. Always thinking of me. Now… can we get back to the blood type now? I originally came to find that out, didn't I? Is that something you can do today? Or does it require another echo-thing?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Nini. I completely understand your concerns, and I assure you we will try to minimize any disruption to your routine. And you are absolutely right – you originally came to determine your blood type. We can certainly do that today. It’s a simple blood test that takes just a few minutes. We'll draw a small sample of blood from your arm, and the results will be available within a few hours. It doesn't require another scan or echo-thing at all. We have a phlebotomist on staff who is very skilled and gentle. Would you like to proceed with the blood test now?
PATIENT: Oh, good! Just the blood test then. No echo-things. That’s a relief. Yes, let’s get it over with. I don’t like needles, you know, but if it’s quick… and it will tell you my blood type… then alright. The sooner it’s done, the better. And then… can I go home and have a cup of tea? And sit in the garden? I do love a good pastry with my tea. My grandson makes a lovely Victoria sponge. He’s a good boy, that one. Always thinking of me. Just let me know when you're ready to draw the blood, Doctor. And please, be gentle. My arms are a bit… creaky these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nini. I will be as gentle as possible. And yes, after the blood draw, you are free to go home and enjoy your tea and garden. Our phlebotomist, Maria, is very skilled and will take excellent care of you. She’ll explain the process step-by-step and ensure you are comfortable throughout. Let’s head over to the examination room, and Maria will be with us shortly. Just relax, and we’ll have this completed in no time. I am glad you came in today. Is there anything else I can do for you before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with me. And for not laughing at my rambling. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. It’s the age, I suppose. Just… please tell my grandson everything is alright. He worries so much. He’s a good boy, that one. Always thinking of me. Let's go then. To the examination room. And then… tea time. Yes, tea time. That sounds lovely.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Nini. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I assure you, I was happy to help. And please, don't worry about rambling – it's perfectly natural, and I understand completely. I will certainly let your grandson know everything is alright, and we will discuss the results of both tests with him in detail. Maria is ready for you now. Let’s head inside.
