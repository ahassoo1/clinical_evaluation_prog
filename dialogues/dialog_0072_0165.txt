DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re sixty-five years of age. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Sixty-five, that’s right. Look, it’s this fever, see? Keeps comin’ back. Not every day, but enough to be a pain. It’s just… unsettling, ya know? I get chills, feel weak… then it goes away for a bit, then BAM, it's back. Been happenin’ for, oh, maybe a month now? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And you said it comes and goes. Can you describe what the fever feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a burnin' hot fever, ya know? More like… a deep chill. Like someone poured cold water on my bones. And I get tired. Real tired. Even just gettin' up to get a glass of water feels like too much sometimes. And my wife says I look flushed when it’s bad, but I can’t really feel that myself. Just… icky. That’s the best way to put it. icky.
DOCTOR: “Icky” is a useful descriptor, Mr. Brege. And you mentioned chills and fatigue. Have you been checking your temperature at all when you feel this way?
PATIENT: Nah, I haven't. Don't really bother with thermometers. My wife, Elena, she has one somewhere, but I never think to ask. I just… feel sick, ya know? That’s enough for me to know somethin’s wrong. I figure if it got really bad, I'd know to go to the emergency room. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, we should certainly get a baseline temperature now, if you don't mind. And just to be thorough, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Sure, take a temperature. Whatever you need. As for illnesses… hmm. I had the flu bad when I was a kid, but who hasn't? Back in Puerto Rico, we didn't go to the doctor for every little sniffle. Elena, she had pneumonia a few years back, but I didn't. No surgeries, either. Never needed 'em. Just… the usual aches and pains of gettin' old, I guess. I’m a chiropractor, see? I fix other people’s backs. Doesn't mean mine don't hurt sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that’s a tough one. My mother, she had… something with her heart, I think. High blood pressure, maybe? And my father, he worked hard his whole life. Always tired. But he just figured it was from the work. Lots of sugar cane farming in his family, if that matters. Nobody talked much about illnesses back then. It was just… how things were. My wife, Elena, her mother had diabetes. That's about all I can really tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to nothin’. I eat everything Elena puts in front of me, and she likes to experiment. She’s a great cook, but… sometimes a little too adventurous. No rashes, no sniffles, nothin’. I’m a pretty simple guy, Doc. Not much bothers me. Except this fever, of course. That’s a real bother.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single pill. I try to stay away from 'em if I can. Elena, she takes somethin' for her arthritis, but I don’t bother with any of that. I figure fresh air and good food are the best medicine. And maybe a little work keepin’ my hands busy. I can’t sit still for long, ya know? Drives me crazy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Mr. Brege, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be causing your fever and fatigue. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and I’ll take your temperature and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that’s fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t poke too much, alright? My back's a little sensitive. I fix other people’s backs, remember? Maybe be gentle with mine. Let's just get this done. I got things to do. Elena’s makin’ lunch.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brege. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please, have a seat here. Alright. Your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Your blood pressure is a bit high as well, 148 over 92. I'm hearing slightly diminished breath sounds in your lungs, and I feel some mild swelling in your neck lymph nodes.
PATIENT: See? I told you somethin' was wrong. A little bit of a fever, a little bit of a chill... that’s all it is. What’s the big deal? My blood pressure? I get stressed sometimes. Elena worries too much. What’s it mean, all this stuff? Just tell me straight. I don’t need fancy words. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, while these findings aren't necessarily indicative of a life-threatening emergency, they do warrant further investigation. The slightly elevated temperature, diminished breath sounds, and swollen lymph nodes could suggest an infection, potentially a respiratory one. The elevated blood pressure is also a concern and requires monitoring. I'm going to order a complete blood count – that’s a simple blood test to check for signs of infection – and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also recommend we repeat your blood pressure reading over the course of a few days to see if it remains consistently high. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests… X-rays… See, this is what I was afraid of. I just wanted to know what was makin' me feel icky. Now it’s all this… stuff. A chest X-ray? Is it gonna hurt? Look, Doc, I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. And I really don’t like needles. Can’t we just… try somethin’ else? Maybe some rest? Some chicken soup? Elena makes a mean chicken soup. And… how much is all this gonna cost? I ain't insured, ya know. Everything costs money these days. I just want to feel better, not broke.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I understand your concerns. However, without these tests, it’s difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms accurately and provide appropriate treatment. Rest and chicken soup are helpful for supportive care, but they won't address the underlying issue. Regarding the cost, I am aware you are uninsured. Our billing department does offer payment plans and financial assistance options. I can have them contact you directly to discuss those possibilities. I’ll also speak with the lab to see if there are any available discounts. The chest X-ray is non-invasive and doesn't involve any needles. It's a quick and painless procedure. The blood test will require a small blood sample, and, yes, it involves a brief needle prick. But it’s essential for identifying any potential infection. I strongly advise proceeding with these tests for the sake of your health. We need to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to schedule them?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. But you gotta promise me you’ll be gentle with the needle. And you better talk to that billing lady right away. Elena’s gonna kill me if I run up a big bill. And… can’t we just do the blood test first? I don't like the idea of gettin' X-rays. Maybe if the blood test is okay, we can skip the chest thing. Is that possible? Just… get it over with. I got lunch waitin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. We can certainly start with the blood test. That’s a reasonable approach. I'll write the order now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw the sample. I'll also have the billing department contact you immediately to discuss payment options. And I assure you, I will ensure the nurse is as gentle as possible with the blood draw. I understand your reluctance, but if the blood test results are inconclusive, we will need to proceed with the chest X-ray to rule out more serious conditions. Your health is our priority. Now, let’s get this blood test done, and we’ll take it from there.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… hurry up. I hate needles. And… tell that nurse to use a small one, okay? A really small one. And… can I have a glass of water after? My mouth feels kinda dry just thinkin’ about it. Let’s just get it over with. Stop talkin’ and get the nurse. Lunch is waitin’. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brege. I'll summon the nurse immediately. And yes, she will have a glass of water ready for you afterward. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come to room three for a blood draw?
