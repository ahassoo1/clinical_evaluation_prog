DOCTOR: Hi Aeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, you know? A jumpstart to get things going again. I’m not sure how to explain it properly, but I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not yourself” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s…hard to pinpoint. Just generally low energy, I suppose. Not necessarily tired all the time, but…unmotivated. Things feel like a bigger effort than they used to. And my…focus isn’t what it once was. I find myself getting distracted very easily. It's been going on for a few months now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of low energy, feeling unmotivated, and difficulty concentrating. That’s helpful. Do you find this is interfering with your daily life – work, hobbies, relationships?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. I work with…well, I shape things, mostly. Clay and plaster, things like that. It requires a lot of concentration and…finesse. It’s become harder to get into the flow of it, and I find myself making more mistakes. My husband…he’s very understanding, but I haven’t been as engaged with things we enjoy together, either. We used to garden a lot, but honestly, I just don't have the…oomph for it right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's impacting both your work and your personal life. Have you noticed any other changes, like changes in your sleep, appetite, or weight?
PATIENT: My appetite…hasn’t been huge, I suppose. Not that I’m not eating, just not as much as usual. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but nothing drastic. I haven't weighed myself recently, to be honest. Sleep…is mostly okay. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, but I don’t always feel very rested when I wake up. It's not a consistent thing, though. Some nights are better than others.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, some weight loss, and occasionally feeling unrefreshed despite adequate sleep. Have you experienced any sadness, anxiety, or feelings of hopelessness lately?
PATIENT: That's a…difficult question. I wouldn't say I'm sad, exactly. More…disappointed in myself, perhaps? Frustrated with not being able to enjoy things like I used to. And definitely anxious – worried about whether this will continue, if it will impact my work further. Hopeless…no, not hopeless. Just…concerned. It’s hard to explain. I don’t feel…overwhelmingly anything, if that makes sense. It’s just a general…low grade feeling of being off.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Aeisha. It sounds like you're describing a constellation of symptoms rather than one big feeling. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’ve had regular check-ups with my family doctor, of course, and everything’s always been…normal. I do have slightly high blood pressure, the doctor mentioned it at my last check-up, but it’s managed with diet and exercise – or, used to be managed with diet and exercise. That's probably related to this, isn't it? Perhaps the stress of feeling…this way?
DOCTOR: It's good you've been keeping up with regular check-ups. And it's possible the stress is a factor, definitely. The high blood pressure is something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very fortunate, no surgeries at all. And I don’t take any regular medications, aside from the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s…very infrequent. I prefer to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, no regular medications. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother…she had diabetes, later in life. And my father had some heart trouble, but he also smoked for many years, so I always assumed that was a contributing factor. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major on either side of the family, thankfully. Mostly just…the usual things. High blood pressure, a bit of arthritis here and there, nothing that runs particularly strongly in the family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that. Never been much of a drinker. And I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband enjoys a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stick to water, usually. And no, absolutely no recreational drugs. I’m a very…sensible person, I suppose. I find plenty of enjoyment in my work and my garden, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Aeisha. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Everything seems within normal limits on the initial physical exam. However, given your symptoms – the low energy, difficulty concentrating, and some weight loss – I'd like to order some blood work. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin levels , and do a complete blood count to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, I’m happy to do it. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? And get back to feeling like myself again. So, blood work sounds perfectly fine. Do I need to make a separate appointment for that, or can it be done here today?
DOCTOR: We can do it right here today. I'll write you a requisition, and our phlebotomist will come in to draw the samples. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. While we’re waiting for the results, try to focus on getting regular sleep, even if you don’t feel immediately rested. And gentle exercise – a short walk, some gardening – can sometimes help with energy levels. But don’t push yourself too hard. Just take this down to the lab. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate you listening so patiently. I understand it’s just a process of elimination at this point. Regular sleep and gentle exercise…I can certainly try that. Thank you for your time, Doctor Morenomartinez. I feel much better just having a plan in place. I’ll head down to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aeisha. That’s what I’m here for. And you’re right, it’s often a process of elimination. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
