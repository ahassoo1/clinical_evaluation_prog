DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. I want to feel more like myself again, if that makes sense. A sort of…reset, or a jumpstart, to my health. I’m not sure how to explain it better than that.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Stuck” is a good way to put it, actually. Many patients describe feeling that way. It’s helpful you’re being proactive about it. To get a better picture, can you tell me more specifically what “feeling like yourself” means?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It’s difficult to pinpoint, exactly. I have energy, yes, but it feels…flat. And I’ve been having trouble sleeping, not consistently, but often enough that it’s noticeable. It’s not that I can’t sleep, more that I wake up feeling…unrefreshed. And maybe a little…disheartened? I don’t know if that makes sense. I used to enjoy gardening, very much, but lately I just haven’t had the…enthusiasm.
DOCTOR: Okay. Flat energy, disrupted sleep, and a loss of interest in things you once enjoyed. Those are all things we should explore. Let's start with the sleep. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think…it’s been…worsening over the last six months, I’d say. Before that it was just occasional, a bad night here and there. But now? Probably three or four nights a week I wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. It's usually just…my mind racing, thinking about…everything and nothing, all at once. It doesn’t feel like worry, exactly, just…restless.
DOCTOR: Six months, three to four nights a week. And you said you wake up feeling unrefreshed, even when you do sleep. Alright. Do you have any pain or discomfort that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: No, not really. I have a little bit of stiffness in my lower back sometimes, but that’s just from gardening, I think. Nothing that keeps me awake or anything. It’s not like a sharp pain, just…aches a little after I’ve been bending over for a while. I take some ibuprofen for it occasionally, but that's it. It's definitely not related to the sleep issues, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back stiffness. And no other pain?
PATIENT: No, no other pain. Just the back, and it’s manageable. Really, it’s not a big concern. It's more this…lack of vitality, this feeling of being…drained, that’s bothering me. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know? I want to feel…alive again. Is that strange?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Pitzel. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to feel better, to feel “alive” again. We’ll try to get to the bottom of this. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve been very lucky, health-wise, for the most part. I had chickenpox as a child, and a bout of the flu last year, but nothing serious. My doctor always said I had a strong constitution. I've never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries. My husband always jokes I'm too stubborn to get sick.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history, no hospitalizations, no surgeries. That's good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 88, and she was quite healthy until the very end. She did have some arthritis in her later years, but that was about it. My father passed away when he was 72 from a heart attack, unfortunately. And my brother has high blood pressure, but he’s managing it with medication. Nothing else particularly noteworthy, I think. A lot of us are…sturdy people.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of heart disease and arthritis in the family. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I don’t smoke, never have. I might have a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, maybe once a month, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I believe in taking care of myself. My husband and I, we enjoy healthy cooking, walking in the park…simple things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker, minimal alcohol use. That’s good. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can remember. Sometimes, if I eat too many strawberries, my mouth gets a little itchy, but that’s just a mild sensitivity, not a true allergy. Nothing serious enough to warrant an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen for my back, when I need it. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I’m not very consistent with that. It’s been sitting on the counter for a while, to be honest. Nothing prescribed, nothing I take every day. It's just as needed, those two things.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no regular medications. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a neurological assessment. Sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll begin. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 132 over 78. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are normal, balance is good. Everything appears…within normal limits.
PATIENT: That's…reassuring, to hear. It’s just frustrating, feeling this way when everything seems alright, physically. So, what now, Doctor? Do you think we need further testing? Perhaps blood work?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. Everything is within normal limits on this basic exam. But given your symptoms – the fatigue, sleep disturbance, and loss of enthusiasm – I think some blood work is a good next step. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and basic metabolic panel. That will help us rule out any underlying medical causes. I’m also going to order a Vitamin B12 level. It can sometimes cause fatigue and neurological symptoms. Do you have any preference for where to have the blood work done?
PATIENT: No preference, Doctor, not at all. Whatever lab is most convenient will be fine. I trust your recommendation. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Fasting, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. For the most accurate results, I’d like you to fast for eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks – other than water – before your appointment. We’ll get those results back in a few days. In the meantime, I want you to keep a sleep diary. Write down when you go to bed, when you wake up, and how you feel when you wake up. That will give us more information about your sleep patterns. We'll review those results together and discuss the next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very thorough, Doctor. A sleep diary…yes, I can definitely do that. And fasting, no problem. I'll make sure to schedule the blood work as soon as possible. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. It's…a relief to feel like someone is finally taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It’s my job to listen, and I take your concerns very seriously. It’s important to find out what’s going on, and we’ll work through this together. Is there anything else I can address today, or do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I'll schedule the blood work and start the sleep diary tonight. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
