DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Pfennig, you say? Hmm. Yes, well… I just moved here. New place. Doctor told me to… check in, I think? Something about the… the government health thing. Medicare. Old man paperwork, always. I do makeup, you know. For… shows. Not important now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you recently enrolled in Medicare. That’s excellent. A “check-in” is a good way to put it – a general wellness visit to get to know you and your health history, especially since you're new to the area and to our clinic. So, we'll just go through some questions, and I'll do a quick physical exam. That sounds alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Oh. Must we? I keep myself very clean, thank you. All the performers, very… particular. But, alright. If it must be done. Just… quickly, please. I have things to do. What kind of questions? Not about my… work, I hope?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. It won't be anything invasive, just checking your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, listening to your lungs and heart, things like that. And no, I won’t be asking about the specifics of your work. We'll mostly focus on your overall health – any current symptoms you're experiencing, past medical history, family history, and any medications you’re taking. Let’s start with current symptoms. Are you having any pain, discomfort, or other health problems right now?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. My back… sometimes aches. Old age, I suppose. And my feet. Standing all day, for the shows. It's not… serious pain. Just… tired. Always tired. Is that a symptom? I drink tea. Lots of tea. And sometimes… a little vodka. For the nerves. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, back and foot aches, and feeling tired frequently. And you mentioned tea and a little vodka. Thank you for being so open. It’s helpful to know everything. Fatigue can have many causes, so we’ll explore that a bit further. First, let’s talk about the fatigue. When did you start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Noticing…? Oh, ages ago. Since… well, since the divorce, I think. She… took everything. The apartment, the cat, my good brushes. Very stressful. Maybe that? I don't sleep well, either. Always thinking. And the dreams… terrible dreams. So, yes. A long time ago, the tiredness. Before the new place, before the… Medicare things. It's just… life.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds like a very difficult time, Mr. Szmyd, and stress can absolutely contribute to fatigue and sleep problems. The divorce, losing your belongings, those are significant life events. Let's try to get a better picture of how this tiredness is affecting your daily life. On a scale of one to ten, with one being no fatigue at all and ten being completely debilitating, how would you rate your fatigue on a typical day?
PATIENT: One to ten… Hmm. Debilitating… what does that mean? Like… can't get out of bed? No. I get up. I work. It's just… harder. Everything feels… heavy. Maybe a… six? Yes, six. A solid six. On a good day. Some days… closer to an eight, perhaps. When the dreams are bad. Is that… normal? For an old man?
DOCTOR: A six to eight, especially with days fluctuating, is definitely something we want to investigate further. And it's absolutely not "normal" to feel that consistently fatigued, regardless of age. It's good you're telling me about this. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical… history. Oh, dear. That’s… a long time ago. I had… something with my stomach, years ago. In Russia. The doctor… gave me pills. Very strong pills. I don’t remember the name. And… a bad flu, once. But nothing… serious. No, I don’t think so. Mostly just… aches and pains. And the occasional cold. The Russian colds are very bad, you know. Very, very bad. And the dentist, always the dentist. But that’s not… medical history, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach issues in Russia treated with pills, a bad flu, and regular dental visits. That's helpful to know. We may need to get some records from your previous doctors, if that's possible, to get more details on the stomach issue. Now, regarding your family history – do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, my family. A long time gone. My mother… she died when I was young. Something with her heart, I think. Very sad. My father… he worked in the factory. A strong man. He died… old age, mostly. Lots of smoking. And my sister… she moved to America, years ago. I haven't seen her since. I don't know… about her health. We don’t… speak. It's a long story. Not important now. Mostly just… sad stories. Family is… complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand. Maternal heart issues and a father with a history of smoking. That’s good to know. It’s okay if family relationships are complicated; we can work with what information you have. Now, let’s talk about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh. Just… the tea. Lots of tea. And sometimes… a little vodka. For the nerves. No pills, no. I don’t like pills. They make me… sleepy. And… sometimes I take something for my back, when it’s really bad. Over-the-counter… I think. From the store. I don’t remember the name. It’s… blue, maybe? And no allergies. No. I am Russian, we are strong. We don’t have allergies. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tea, occasional vodka, and an over-the-counter medication for your back – possibly blue. No known allergies. Thank you for being so forthcoming, Mr. Szmyd. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat and ears. It won't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Must we? Really? I told you, I am perfectly clean. But… alright. Quickly, please. Very quickly. And don't… poke too much. My skin is sensitive. Old man skin. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let's take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That’s a little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. I’m also hearing a very faint murmur. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds on both sides. Finally, let's take a quick look at your throat and ears. Throat looks clear, and ears are normal. Okay, that’s all done. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Szmyd.
PATIENT: Elevated? Murmur? Diminished? What does all that mean? I don’t like this. It sounds… terrible. Like something is broken. Am I… dying? Is it the vodka? I knew I shouldn't have had that vodka.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t worry, Mr. Szmyd. It doesn't mean something is broken, and it's certainly not an immediate emergency. Elevated blood pressure means your heart is working a little harder than it should. The murmur is a slightly unusual sound, and sometimes harmless, but we want to investigate it further. Diminished breath sounds can be normal in older individuals, but we’ll want to monitor that as well. The vodka likely isn’t helping, but it’s not the primary cause of these findings. We need to do some more testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order some blood work and an EKG – that’s a simple test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. I also recommend a chest X-ray to get a look at your lungs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? More… poking and prodding? It sounds… awful. Like a hospital. I hate hospitals. Are you sure it’s necessary? Couldn't I just… drink more tea? And maybe less vodka? My mother always said doctors just want to find things wrong. Is that true?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Szmyd. I know hospitals can be frightening, and I wouldn't recommend anything unnecessary. The blood work will give us a lot of information about your overall health – things like your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. The EKG will quickly assess your heart rhythm and look for any abnormalities. The chest X-ray will help us evaluate your lungs and rule out any underlying issues. These tests aren’t about finding something wrong; they’re about getting a complete picture of your health so we can make the best decisions for your well-being. Think of it like checking the engine of a car – we need to look under the hood to make sure everything is running smoothly. I can assure you, these tests are relatively simple and painless. We’ll do them right here in the clinic, and I'll explain the results to you thoroughly. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood work, EKG, and chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Do what you must. But quickly, please. And no poking. And I want the results explained to me… in English. Simple English. No doctor talk. And no surprises. And if it’s something bad… I want a second opinion. Just in case. My mother always said… never trust just one doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I completely understand. We’ll do everything as quickly and comfortably as possible. I promise to explain the results in plain English, no medical jargon. And you absolutely have the right to a second opinion, and I’m happy to help you arrange that if needed. I'll have the nurse draw your blood first. Then we’ll do the EKG right here in the exam room – it involves placing some stickers on your chest. Finally, I’ll send you over to the radiology department for the chest X-ray – that shouldn’t take long. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm. Will it… hurt? And… how long will it take? I have things to do, you know. Shows to prepare for. Makeup doesn't just… happen. It takes time. And… will I be able to drink tea afterwards? I need my tea. It calms my nerves. All this… poking and prodding… it's very nerve-wracking.
DOCTOR: The blood draw might feel like a quick pinch, but it’s usually over very quickly. The EKG and chest X-ray are completely painless – they don’t involve any poking or prodding at all. The whole process should take about an hour, maybe a little longer. The nurse will let you know when your blood work is done, and I’ll review the results with you as soon as they’re available. And yes, absolutely, you can drink your tea afterwards. In fact, I encourage it! It’s perfectly fine to continue your normal routines, including enjoying your tea. Would you like me to call the nurse for you now to start the blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can have my tea. And tell the nurse… be gentle. Very gentle. I have delicate veins. Old man veins. And… don’t squeeze too hard. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I'll let the nurse know to be very gentle. “Hi, Maria?
