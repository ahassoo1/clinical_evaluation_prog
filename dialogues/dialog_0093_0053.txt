DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been having trouble going to the bathroom. Just…not being able to go as easily as I used to. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. There’s no need to be embarrassed at all; this is a very common concern, and we can certainly address it. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It’s not like I can’t go, exactly. It just…takes a long time, and I have to strain a bit. And sometimes, I feel like I didn’t quite empty everything out, you know? Like there’s still a little bit left. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That feeling of incomplete evacuation can be quite bothersome. And the straining is something we definitely want to look into. Could you describe the stool itself?
PATIENT: Oh…the stool. Hmm. Well, it's usually…normal colored, I suppose. Not too dark, not too pale. It's…formed, mostly. Sometimes a little on the hard side, if I haven't had enough water, I think. But not diarrhea or anything like that. Just…solid. Sometimes in smaller pieces than usual, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Yadao. So, generally formed, normal color, occasionally a bit hard and sometimes appearing in smaller pieces. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or around your rectum?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, no blood. Definitely not. I would have noticed that, wouldn't I? No, everything looks normal, besides the smaller pieces sometimes. It's just…the difficulty getting it out. And the feeling of not being completely empty, like I said. It's just…uncomfortable. Is it something serious, Doctor? I do worry a bit.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear there's no blood present. While any change in bowel habits warrants investigation, it doesn't necessarily mean something serious is going on. The feeling of incomplete evacuation and difficulty with passage certainly needs to be addressed. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet… Well, I try to eat healthy. I have a small breakfast – usually oatmeal with some fruit. Lunch is often a sandwich, maybe a salad. And dinner… well, it varies. Sometimes soup, sometimes fish with vegetables, sometimes just leftovers. I don’t eat a lot of red meat. And I love my bread, I must admit. I try to drink enough water, but maybe I don’t always. I do enjoy a cup of tea with my meals, though. Does that sound alright? I'm not much of a sweets person, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a reasonably healthy diet, Ms. Yadao. The bread is good to know, and we can discuss if that might be contributing. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I’ve been taking pills for that for…oh, maybe ten years now? And I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that hasn’t bothered me since. Other than that… not much, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. And I've had both of my COVID shots, of course. Do you need to know anything else?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. That's helpful. Knowing about the high blood pressure is important. And the gallbladder removal is good to have on record. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. Just the one for blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knees, if they’re acting up, but that’s just ibuprofen, over the counter. And sometimes I take a little something for sleep, if I can’t get to sleep, but that’s just a small dose. Nothing else regularly, no. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, occasional ibuprofen and a sleep aid. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bees, but I haven’t been stung in years, and I don’t think I’m allergic anymore. I can eat anything, thankfully. I like to try new foods, you know? My mother always said I had a strong stomach. But no, nothing I’m aware of. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Yadao. Alright. Before we proceed, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… Well, my mother had some heart trouble when she was older, and my father had diabetes. I don’t know much about my grandparents, really. They both died when I was quite young. My brother is healthy as far as I know, but we don’t see each other very often. Nothing really stands out as a major concern, if that makes sense. Just the usual things, I suppose. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Yadao. Knowing about the heart trouble and diabetes in your family is good to have. Now, to get a better picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief rectal exam to assess the tone of your muscles and check for any abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A rectal exam… Well, that doesn't sound very pleasant, does it? But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I suppose I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle? It's a bit embarrassing, but I want to figure out what's going on. How long will it take?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. I understand your hesitation, and I assure you, we will proceed with the utmost care and respect for your comfort. It will be a brief exam, just a few moments. I will explain everything as I go, and you are free to stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. First, let's listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table, and I'll begin.
PATIENT: Alright. Here goes nothing. Just…let me know if you’re doing anything before you do it, please? I’m a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just…a little pressure, like you said. It's not painful, just… I feel it. A bit uncomfortable, but not painful. It feels a bit like…when I haven’t eaten enough, maybe? But no sharp pain, thankfully. Is that normal? It feels a bit…full, maybe? Like I need to…well, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao. The fullness is good to know. No sharp pain is reassuring. Everything feels relatively normal so far. Now, to complete the exam, I would like to perform a brief rectal exam. I will ask you to bend over or lie on your side, and I will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to assess the tone of your muscles and check for any abnormalities. As I mentioned before, you are free to stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Would you prefer to bend over or lie on your side?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is the part I was dreading. Lie on my side, I think. That sounds… less exposing, perhaps? I feel a bit silly even saying that. Just… please be quick? And gentle, like you promised.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. I'm going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This may cause a slight sensation of pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Please try to relax as much as possible. I'm assessing the tone of your muscles and checking for any abnormalities. I do not feel any masses or tenderness. The muscles feel a bit weak, but not significantly. There is no blood present. Okay, Ms. Yadao. That's complete. I'll be right back to discuss my findings.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but I'm still relieved it's over. Weak muscles, you say? What does that mean? Is that…serious?
DOCTOR: It wasn’t too bad, thankfully. Weak muscles, in this context, can contribute to difficulty with bowel movements. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's something we need to address. It could be due to a number of factors, including age, decreased physical activity, or a history of straining. Based on my examination and your history, I suspect you may be experiencing fecal impaction and decreased muscle tone. This means that stool is building up in your rectum and colon, making it difficult to pass. The straining you mentioned can worsen this. I recommend we start with a bowel regimen to help soften and move the stool. This can include increasing your fiber intake, drinking plenty of fluids, and potentially using a gentle stool softener or laxative. We can also discuss pelvic floor exercises to strengthen your muscles over time. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Fiber… fluids… exercises… That sounds… manageable, I suppose. I can try that. I do like prunes, so maybe I can eat more of those. And I can definitely try to drink more water. Pelvic floor exercises… those sound a bit complicated, to be honest. I'm not very good at remembering things like that. Would you have something written down I could take home with me? And what about the stool softener? Is that something I need a prescription for?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Prunes are a great start! They are a natural source of fiber and can be very helpful. I'll write down a list of high-fiber foods for you, as well as a daily fluid goal. As for the pelvic floor exercises, I have a handout with simple instructions and diagrams. It's called "Kegel Exercises," and it can be very effective. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment with a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor health if you would prefer. Regarding the stool softener, I recommend docusate sodium, which you can purchase over-the-counter. I'll write the dosage on the handout as well. Start with a low dose and see how it works for you. If that doesn't provide enough relief, we can discuss other options. Do you have any questions about this plan?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, thank you. High-fiber foods, fluids, docusate sodium, Kegel exercises… Kegel exercises… where do I even start with those? And how often should I do them? And what if they don't work? I worry about trying new things, you know? I don't want to make things worse. And… what if it's something more serious than just weak muscles?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Yadao. Let's address them one by one. Regarding the Kegel exercises, you can start by squeezing the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat 10-15 times, several times a day. The handout has more detailed instructions. It may take a few weeks to see improvement. As for worrying about making things worse, that's understandable. We'll start with a gentle approach and monitor your symptoms closely. If things don’t improve or if you experience any new symptoms like severe pain, bleeding, or fever, please contact me immediately. Now, regarding your concern about something more serious, it's always important to rule out other possibilities. Based on my examination, I don’t suspect anything serious at this time. However, if your symptoms persist despite following this plan, we can consider further testing, such as a colonoscopy, to rule out any underlying issues. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in this plan. We will work together to find the best solution for you. Do you have any other concerns or questions that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. But if you think it's necessary, I suppose. It’s just…I get anxious about these things. Okay. Let’s try the fiber, fluids, and docusate sodium first. And the Kegel exercises, if I can remember how to do them. When should I schedule a follow-up appointment? Just to check in and see if things are improving? And what if I forget what you’ve told me? I do get a bit… forgetful, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Ms. Yadao. Let’s start with the conservative measures first. A colonoscopy is not something we need to worry about right now, but it’s good to know it’s an option if needed. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks. That will give you enough time to see if the plan is making a difference. And don’t worry about being forgetful. That’s perfectly normal. I’ll send a copy of this handout to your pharmacy as well as to your email, and I’ll also have my nurse call you in a week to check in and see how you’re doing. She can answer any questions you may have and provide additional support. Also, please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to help. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've been very patient with me, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel a bit better now, knowing what I need to do. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my worries.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we're working as a team. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
