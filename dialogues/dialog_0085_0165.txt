DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s been… well, a few weeks now, I guess. Not fun, let me tell ya.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fever that keeps coming back for a few weeks. That doesn't sound pleasant at all. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts kinda slow. Feel a little achy, then just… warm. Not a real bad warm at first. Then it gets higher, you know? Like… 101, 102 sometimes. Then it breaks, I sweat a lot, and feel okay for a day or two. Then it’s back. It's… annoying is what it is. And it throws my back outta whack, too. Figures, right? Being a chiropractor and all.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does sound frustrating, especially with your work as a chiropractor. A fever that comes and goes like that is something we need to investigate. When did you first notice it starting?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was right around the Fourth of July, I think. We had a family barbecue, lots of people. Maybe that’s when it started. Hard to say exactly. Everything kinda blends together after a while, ya know? But definitely sometime after the holiday. My wife, Elena, she remembers it being right after, 'cause she made me tea when I first felt sick. She's got a good memory.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, starting around the Fourth of July. And it sounds like it began with some achiness?
PATIENT: Yeah, achy all over. Like I pulled a muscle, but everywhere. And tired. Really tired. I thought maybe I just overworked myself at the office, but it didn't go away even when I rested. And then… the fever started. It’s like a bad flu, but it keeps comin’ back. Does that make sense? I ain’t good at explainin’ things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Brege. You’re explaining it very well. So, achiness and fatigue before the fever started. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fever – like a cough, sore throat, rash, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough. No sore throat. No rash. Bowel habits… nah, pretty normal. Maybe a little… loose sometimes when the fever breaks, ya know? But nothin' serious. Mostly just sweat, achiness, and the fever itself. It’s just… wearin’ me down. Honestly, I just want to get back to work. I got patients waitin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, sore throat, or rash. And some loose stools with the fever breaking – that's good to know. And I understand wanting to get back to your patients. Let's talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not really. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And… arthritis in my hands, but it's not bad. Just a little stiffness sometimes. Other than that, pretty healthy, if you can believe it. I eat okay, try to get some exercise… well, when my back ain’t botherin’ me, anyway. I definitely don’t have anythin' serious, Doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a child and some arthritis in your hands. No other significant medical history. And you generally consider yourself healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. I've always been lucky that way. I tell ya, Elena keeps tellin' me I should have gotten my knees done years ago, but I put it off. I figured I'm a chiropractor, I can fix myself, right? But this fever... this ain't somethin' I can crack my way outta.
DOCTOR: No, it certainly doesn’t sound like something a chiropractic adjustment would fix. That's good to know you haven't had any surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me see… my father had heart problems, yeah. He passed away when he was in his seventies. My mother, she had high blood pressure. And… my aunt Elena, my wife’s aunt, she had… somethin' with her joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, maybe? She was always complainin' about her hands and knees. Other than that… nothin’ I can think of. We weren't much of a talkin' family, ya know? Mostly kept to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in your wife’s aunt. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she tried it once when she was a teenager, but I made her stop right quick. Nasty habit. No, Doc, I'm a clean livin' man. Except for maybe the occasional sweet pastry. Elena makes a mean flan.
DOCTOR: A good flan is hard to resist! Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, Doc. Nothing heavy. Mostly red wine. My wife and I, we like to relax after a long day. It helps with the arthritis, ya know? Or that’s what we tell ourselves, anyway. It ain’t like I’m out drinkin’ every night. Just a little somethin' to take the edge off.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. That's good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nah, no regular medications. I take some ibuprofen sometimes for my back, but that’s it. And no allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anythin'. Elena's always askin' me if I wanna try her home remedies, but I usually just stick to the ibuprofen. She means well, but… sometimes I just want somethin' simple, ya know? I just wanna feel normal again, Doc. And get back to work. I got people countin’ on me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Brege. It sounds like you’re generally a very healthy man, and it’s frustrating when something like this comes along. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your temperature and blood pressure. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's get it over with. The sooner I know what's goin' on, the sooner I can get back to fixin' other people’s backs. This back ain't helpin' matters, let me tell ya. Just… hurry it up, Doc. I got a schedule to keep. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, just relax. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. First, let’s take your temperature and blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given you’re a bit anxious. Temperature is 101.5 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
