DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… something about my foot. Been troubleing me for weeks now. A sore, really. A nasty one, at that. I don’t usually bother doctors, you know. But this one… won't seem to heal.
DOCTOR: Right, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for weeks. I understand you don't usually come to the doctor, so I appreciate you coming in today to get it checked out. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom of my left foot, near the heel. Feels like a… a constant ache, but when I put weight on it, then it really hurts. Sharp pain, you see? And it's gotten… weepy. Not pleasant, at all. I've been trying to keep it clean, but it just doesn't seem to be doing any good. I suppose that's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a constant ache on the bottom of your left foot near the heel, made worse with weight-bearing, and it’s become weepy. Keeping it clean hasn’t helped much, which is understandably concerning. Now, has this happened before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Several times. Though not exactly like this. I have the sugar sickness, you know. The diabetes. My husband, God rest his soul, he had it too. And he always had trouble with his feet. Always sores popping up. This feels… similar, but maybe worse. He ended up… well, it’s not a nice story. That’s why I’m so worried about this one.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, especially with your husband’s experience. Diabetes can certainly cause foot problems, and it’s good you’re taking this seriously. So, you’ve had other sores before, but this one feels different, and more concerning. You mentioned the "sugar sickness"—diabetes—do you know what your most recent blood sugar levels have been?
PATIENT: Levels? Oh, dear. Honestly, Doctor, I leave all that to the nurses. They stick me and poke me and write things down. I just know they tell me to watch what I eat. Lots of fruit, they say. Not too much rice. It all gets a bit muddled, you know? I haven’t really paid attention to the numbers. I just try to follow what they tell me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Louine. We can certainly get that information from your records. I just ask because consistently high blood sugar can make it harder for sores to heal, and increase the risk of infection. Let’s take a look at the foot then, if that’s alright with you. Could you please take a seat and lift your left foot onto the examination stool?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Anything to get this sorted. It’s just… I’m not very good with looking at it myself, you see. Makes me quite queasy. Be gentle, now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. I see the sore here on the bottom of your heel. It does look a bit inflamed, and there's some drainage present. I'm not seeing any signs of bone exposure at this moment, which is good, but it is concerning. The skin around it is a little warm to the touch as well. I'm going to gently palpate around the area – just press lightly – to see if there’s any tenderness beyond the sore itself. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. Just be careful. It’s always felt…deep. Not just the surface. And yes, that area just beside it… that’s where it really aches. Not sharp, but a dull, throbbing pain. Like someone’s hitting it with a little hammer, you see? Not a big hammer, mind you. A small one.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling that tenderness as well, Louine. It does sound like there’s some inflammation deeper within the tissue, which is what I suspected. We’ll need to rule out a deeper infection. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. A simple blood test to check your blood sugar levels and white blood cell count, which can indicate an infection. And an X-ray of your foot to see if there's any involvement of the bone. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I suppose so. I don’t particularly like tests, but if you think it’s necessary… Just… please don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. This is terribly uncomfortable, you know. And it reminds me of my husband…
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation and your concerns, Louine. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. I'll personally make sure the lab prioritizes them, and I’ll review the results myself as soon as they’re available. It shouldn't take more than a couple of hours, hopefully less. In the meantime, to help prevent further irritation and potential infection, I'm going to apply a sterile dressing to the sore and recommend that you keep weight off of your left foot as much as possible. Do you have any crutches or a walker at home?
PATIENT: Crutches? Oh, goodness no. Haven't needed those since… well, a long time ago. I have a cane, though. A nice wooden one. My husband gave it to me. But… walking on it too much… it puts a strain on my hands, you see? Arthritis. Awful pain. I mostly just shuffle around the house.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cane with arthritis in your hands… that makes things trickier. Shuffling around is better than putting full weight on it, certainly. We'll try to avoid that as much as possible until we get the test results back. In the meantime, it’s very important to keep the wound clean and dry. I’ll give you specific instructions on how to care for it at home, including how often to change the dressing and what signs of infection to look out for—increased redness, swelling, pain, drainage, or fever. Do you have any allergies to medications or dressings?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. My husband always said I was as tough as an old boot. I used to be able to eat anything. But now… I don’t eat much of anything, really. Everything seems to upset my stomach these days. But no, no known allergies to dressings or… whatever you put on wounds. Just… be gentle, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, and we’ll definitely be gentle. I'll use a hypoallergenic dressing, just to be safe. To recap, we’ve ordered some blood tests and an X-ray to check for infection and bone involvement. We’re keeping weight off your foot as much as possible, using a cane for support, and keeping the wound clean and dry. I’ll give you detailed instructions on wound care and signs of infection to watch out for. While we wait for the results, do you have anyone who can help you around the house, if needed?
PATIENT: Help? Oh, dear. No, not really. My daughter lives on the mainland. She calls sometimes, but… she’s got her own life, you see? Her children. A busy woman. I manage. I always have. But… a little help would be nice. But I won’t ask. Never been one for asking for help.
DOCTOR: I understand, Louine. You’re a strong woman, and it’s admirable that you’ve managed on your own for so long. We’ll do everything we can to get this sore healed as quickly as possible so you can get back to your routine. I'm going to write down all the instructions for you, including clear information on wound care, signs of infection, and when to contact me immediately. And I’ll also include a list of resources available in the area, just in case you do need some assistance. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Will this take… a long time to heal? That's what I'm really worried about. My husband’s foot… it just kept getting worse and worse. I don't want that to happen to me. And... is it going to be very painful?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Louine. It’s completely understandable to worry about that, given your husband’s experience. Whether it will take a long time to heal and how painful it will be depends on the results of the tests. If it's a simple infection, we can usually get it under control with antibiotics and proper wound care. If there’s bone involvement, it will be more complicated and take longer. I want to assure you, we’re going to do everything we can to prevent that from happening. We’ll monitor your condition very closely, and I’ll adjust the treatment plan as needed. I’m also going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage any discomfort while we wait for the results. It's not a strong medication, but it should take the edge off. I will call you as soon as the test results are available, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have a preferred phone number I can reach you at?
PATIENT: Yes, the number is 555-1212. That's the landline. I don't bother with those cell phones. Too complicated. And please, Doctor, call even if it's bad news. I'd rather know than… wonder. Thank you. You seem… very kind.
DOCTOR: Alright, 555-1212. And absolutely, I will call you as soon as I have the results, even if it’s not good news. You deserve to know what’s going on, and I’ll be here to explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. I'm glad you feel that way, Louine. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in your care. Here are the written instructions, along with the list of local resources. Please read them carefully. If you experience any sudden increase in pain, redness, swelling, or fever, or if you notice any foul-smelling drainage from the wound, please contact me immediately, even if it’s outside of regular office hours. I'll have the nurse help you get settled and schedule the X-ray. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor Auelua. You've put my mind a little bit at ease, at least. I appreciate your kindness. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I'll just… shuffle off and try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Louine. That’s exactly what I aim for. Please, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. The nurse will be right with you to assist with the X-ray. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: .
