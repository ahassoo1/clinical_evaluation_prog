DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Uh, my heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not normal fast. More like…flapping? I don’t know how to say it. It happens on and off.
DOCTOR: I understand. A fluttering or racing sensation… that’s a very good way to describe it. And you say it happens on and off?
PATIENT: Yes. Not every day. Maybe… three, four times a month? Sometimes it lasts a few minutes, sometimes longer. Hard to say exactly. Usually when I’m… resting. Not when I’m working hard. Working keeps it steady, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s interesting – that it’s more noticeable at rest, and seems to be less frequent during activity. Could you describe what you mean by “resting”?
PATIENT: Uh… like, sitting. Watching TV. Maybe after I eat a big meal. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, before I get moving. It’s not when I’m at the factory, pushing things, fixing machines. That keeps me busy, keeps it… normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it appears to be more prominent when you are relaxed or shortly after eating, and less so during physical exertion. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes – certain foods, perhaps, or specific times of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… foods? No, I don't think so. I eat… well, mostly what my wife cooks. She makes good food! Maybe coffee sometimes? I drink a little coffee in the morning, but not too much. Time of day… no, not really. It just… happens. It doesn’t seem to follow a pattern.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when this “fluttering” happens, do you experience any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Other things? Uh… sometimes I feel a little… short of breath. Not like I’m choking, just… like I can’t get enough air. And maybe a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… wobbly. It goes away when the heart stops flapping.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath and a sensation of lightheadedness accompanying these episodes. Have you ever experienced chest pain, or any discomfort in your jaw, neck, or arms when this happens?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not in my chest, not anywhere else. Just the… heart feeling funny and a little hard to breathe. My wife asks me if I’m okay, because I look… pale, I think. But no pain. Never any pain.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I went to a doctor a few years back for a cold, but nothing serious. My wife, she has… something with her sugar, but not me. I feel okay, mostly. Work is hard, but I’m used to it. Never been told I have anything wrong with my heart before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Not even as a kid, when I broke my arm playing football. Just a cast. That was a long time ago. Everything else… just the normal colds, you know? Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do you know of any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had problems with his legs, old age things. But not his heart. My mother… she died when I was young. Too young. I don't really remember. My sister is okay, I think. She lives far away. We don’t talk much. I don’t know about her health. Nobody in my family… I don’t think anyone had heart trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. I drink… sometimes, with dinner. A little wine, maybe. Not every night. And no… not any of those other things. I work hard, I go home, I sleep. That’s it. Simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medicines. Nothing. I just… try to rest when I can. My wife gives me tea sometimes, when I’m feeling bad. But no pills, no anything. I don't like taking things if I don't need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Puder. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds good. You can listen, check, whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s wrong. Long as it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly. Your pulse is 78 and regular at rest. I'm listening to your heart now… Your heart rhythm is generally regular, but I do detect a slightly irregular beat occasionally. It’s subtle, but present. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulses are all present and strong. Now, I'm going to check your thyroid. No abnormalities detected. Overall, your physical exam is relatively normal, but the occasional irregular heartbeat is something we should investigate further. I’d like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to get a more detailed picture of your heart’s electrical activity. We should also do some blood work to check your thyroid levels and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… an EKG and blood work. Sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s important, yes. I trust you, Doctor. You're the doctor! I just want to know what's wrong. When do we do these things? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s not complicated, Mr. Puder, just a few simple tests. And you're right to ask if it will hurt – the EKG is completely painless. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. The blood work will involve a small needle prick in your arm, but it’s usually quick and not too painful. We can do the EKG right here in the clinic. As for the blood work, we can draw it before you leave, and I’ll send it to the lab. The results usually take a few days to come back. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol. If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. No caffeine, no alcohol. Watch for bad feelings. EKG now, blood now, wait for results. Sounds okay. Um… how much will all this cost? I don’t have… insurance. My wife works, but it doesn’t cover much. I don't want a big surprise.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Puder. I understand that the cost can be a concern, especially without insurance. The EKG will cost approximately $150, and the blood work will be around $200. I know that's not ideal, and I'll see if we can work with a payment plan or if there are any assistance programs available at the clinic. I also have a list of local resources that might be helpful. I’ll speak with our billing department after your tests and provide you with a clear breakdown of the costs and any available options. I want to ensure you receive the care you need without undue financial burden. Would you like me to proceed with the EKG and blood work now?
PATIENT: Yes, let's do it. The sooner I know, the better. It's okay, I'll figure something out. My wife, she's good with money. Thank you for being understanding. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with the EKG. If you could please lie down on the examination table, I’ll get you set up. It’s a quick and painless procedure. I’ll explain each step as we go along. And don’t worry, we’ll work through this together. My primary concern is to get you a clear understanding of what’s going on, and we’ll address the financial aspects afterward.
PATIENT: Okay. Just tell me what to do. I’ll lie down. I just hope it's not something bad. My wife will worry if I get sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Puder. It's natural to worry, but let’s not jump to conclusions before we have the results. We’re simply gathering information at this point. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Okay, I’m starting the EKG now. It will take just a few minutes. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Just breathe normally, and try to stay still. Alright, the EKG is complete. It looks good so far. Now, let’s proceed with the blood work. If you could please roll up your sleeve, I’ll draw a small sample of blood. It’ll just be a quick prick, and it shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay. The EKG is done. Just a quick prick, you said. I don't like needles, but… I’ll try. As long as it’s quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Puder. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Just try to relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Okay, this might feel a little cold. Just a little pinch now. Alright, all done. Just hold pressure on this for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. And that’s all there is to it. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Ouch. That wasn't fun. It stings a little. But it's over now. Thank you. It's just… I don't like needles. So… what happens now? When do we get the results? And will you explain them to me?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Puder. Needles aren’t pleasant for anyone. I appreciate your patience. The lab usually takes about 2 to 3 business days to process the results. I’ll have my assistant contact you as soon as they’re available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. During that appointment, I’ll walk you through each result, explain what they mean, and discuss the best course of action. I’ll use plain language, and I encourage you to ask any questions you have. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good for now. Two or three days for the results. Call me when they’re ready. And… schedule a follow-up. Plain language, you said. That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. You were very kind. I think I’ll go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. I’m glad I could help. Rest is a good idea. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. My assistant, Sarah, will be in touch to schedule that. Get some rest, and I look forward to seeing you soon. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
