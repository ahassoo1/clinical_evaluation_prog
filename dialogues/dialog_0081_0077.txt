DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Paulino, you say? Hmm. Well, they sent me. Said I had to come. Something about…the mine. Been working there a long time, you know. Never had trouble before, but the young people now, always worrying about everything. They say I need…checking. Don’t feel sick, though. Not one bit.
DOCTOR: "They sent you," alright. And this "mine"... is this a recent development, this concern from your colleagues?
PATIENT: Recent? No, no. It’s been… a few weeks now, maybe. Since that new safety man came. Always poking around, asking questions. Used to be, a man just did his job. Now they want to know everything. And write it all down! Makes a man feel… small. But the wife… she said it was best to just come. So here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. So, to clarify, you’re feeling completely healthy yourself, but this new safety protocol at the mine has prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Healthy as a horse, I tell you! Always been strong. Worked hard all my life. This new man… he kept talking about dust and…air. Something about things you can’t even see being bad for you. I been in that mine for forty years! Forty years! Never needed a doctor before. Dust is just…dust.
DOCTOR: Forty years is a significant amount of time, Mr. Bigger. And you haven't experienced any shortness of breath, cough, or any other respiratory issues during that time?
PATIENT: Respiratory… what now? Look, I breathe. Everyone breathes. Sometimes it’s dusty, sometimes it’s not. Never had a cough that bothered me. Maybe a little tickle in the throat sometimes, but nothing a good cup of tea can’t fix. This is all… a waste of my time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. However, long-term exposure to dust, even if you don’t feel immediate effects, can sometimes lead to problems later on. It’s prudent to rule things out. Now, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Hmm. Well… the wife says I sleep a lot more. But she always says that. Says I snore like a walrus, too. She’s always complaining about something. I feel…tired, I suppose, like any old man would. But I still get up and do my work! I still move rocks. Still strong, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone noticed any weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, the wife says I’m getting bigger. She keeps telling me to watch my belly. Always fussing over the food, too. “Eat your greens, Delmon!” she says. Like I haven't been eating for eighty years! I eat what I always eat. Plenty of yam, some fish… good, strong food. Never lost my appetite.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Bigger, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examine me? For what? I told you, I feel fine! But… the wife… she would be angry if I didn’t listen. Always saying I don't take care of myself. Fine. Go ahead. But don’t expect to find anything. Waste of time, I tell you. Complete waste.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath for me...and exhale slowly. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though there's a slight diminished breath sound on the lower lobes. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90, pulse is 78 and regular. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, if you could just follow my finger with your eyes... Reflexes are intact, no obvious deficits.
PATIENT: Hmmph. See? Told you. Everything’s fine. Just an old man. A little tired, maybe, a little…bigger, like my wife says. But fine. Perfectly fine. Can I go now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: While your physical exam doesn't reveal any immediate concerns, given your long-term exposure to dust at the mine and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend a chest X-ray and a basic blood work panel to rule out any potential issues. It's a precautionary measure, Mr. Bigger. And I think it would put your wife's mind at ease. We can schedule these tests here at the clinic. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Chest X-ray? Blood work? Now you're just trying to find something! This is ridiculous. The wife will be happy, you say? Fine. Fine! Do your tests. But if it’s all a waste of time, you owe me an apology. And a good cup of tea. Now, when can I get this over with?
DOCTOR: We can get the blood work done today. The X-ray can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. I’ll have my assistant schedule those for you. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and maintain a healthy diet, as your wife suggests. We will review the results when they come in and discuss them then. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m a strong man. Never been allergic to anything in my life. Dust, maybe. But a man’s gotta work, right? No, no allergies. Just…get it over with, quickly. My wife wants me home to fix the roof.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never needed any. A little balm for the aches sometimes, that’s all. But that’s not a medicine. It’s… a rub. My daughter brings it. No pills, no potions, nothing. Always been a healthy man.
DOCTOR: Alright. My assistant will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your X-ray. I’ll see you again once the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or a persistent cough, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Chest pain? Look, I've been breathing for eighty years. If something was wrong, wouldn't I know? Yes, yes. I understand. Just get it over with. I need to go home now. Fix the roof, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. My assistant will be with you shortly. It was... a pleasure meeting you. Stubborn. But it’s best to be thorough.
PATIENT: .
