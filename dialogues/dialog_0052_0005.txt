DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Shely. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today because I am looking into a place for a senior to live. A facility, you understand. They require a doctor to give their approval first, and I believe that is what you are here for. A check-up, so to speak.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Tkac. A pre-admission physical is quite common. That is perfectly within my scope of practice. To ensure I can provide the facility with a comprehensive assessment, I'll need to gather some information from you. We'll go through your medical history, perform a physical exam, and discuss any current concerns you may have. Let’s start with the History of Present Illness. Are you currently experiencing any specific health issues or symptoms that you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Well, now. That sounds very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. As for current… illnesses, no, not really. My bones ache a bit sometimes, like they do with age, but nothing that keeps me from my baking. I make sourdough, you see. It requires a good deal of kneading. It keeps the hands busy, you know? Aside from that, just the usual… forgetting where I put my spectacles, and things of that nature. Nothing serious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Tkac. Sourdough baking does sound demanding! And occasional forgetfulness is perfectly normal at your age. We’ll document that as well. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… I had the measles as a boy, of course. All the children did. And when I was a young man, I broke my arm falling off a horse – a foolish thing, that was. Healed well enough, though. No complications. I had a touch of pneumonia in 1972, I believe it was. Spent a week in bed, but recovered fully. Nothing major since then. I’ve always been a strong man, I suppose. Good Lakota blood, you know. We are built to endure. I did have my appendix out when I was in my late 30s, but that was a routine matter. Doctor Miller performed the surgery, a good man. I don’t believe there is anything else significant. No chronic conditions, no long-term illnesses, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That’s very helpful. Measles, a fractured arm, pneumonia in 1972, and an appendectomy – all documented. And no chronic conditions, which is excellent. Now, regarding past surgical history, it sounds like the only surgery was your appendectomy with Doctor Miller. Is that correct?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Just the one. Doctor Miller was a fine surgeon, as I said. He had a steady hand and a kind manner. It was a simple procedure, thankfully. No trouble at all. I was back on my feet in a week, baking bread again before the month was out. A baker cannot be idle for long, you see. The dough demands attention.
DOCTOR: Indeed, the dough does seem to demand attention. Well documented, Mr. Tkac. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother… she lived to be quite old, nearly ninety. She passed peacefully in her sleep. She had a weak heart in her later years, I believe, but it wasn't a sudden thing. A gradual weakening. My father was a strong man, like myself, and he lived a long life as well, though he succumbed to an infection – influenza, I think, during the epidemic of '18. My sister… she had a touch of the consumption when she was young, but she recovered. As for other relatives... it's difficult to say. We didn’t keep close track of such things, living as we did, so far from towns and doctors. There wasn't much in the way of serious illness that I recall. Mostly just the common ailments, things that people recovered from. No heart trouble, no consumption, no… cancers, as you say. We were a hardy people, Doctor. Built to withstand hardship. That's the Lakota way, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That provides a valuable overview. Maternal history of a weak heart, paternal history of influenza, and no significant family history of heart disease, cancer or other chronic conditions – all documented. Now, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, as you can probably tell, I live a quiet life. Always have, always will. I’ve never been one for crowds or commotion. I live alone in my own home, a small place, but comfortable enough. I keep busy with my baking, as I've mentioned. It keeps me occupied. I don't drink, and I've never smoked. I have a few friends, mostly older folks like myself, and we visit occasionally for a cup of coffee and a chat. Mostly we talk about the old days, and complain about our aches and pains. I used to go to church regularly, but it’s been a while. I still consider myself a spiritual man, though. I spend a lot of time outdoors, walking in the hills and listening to the birds. It’s a peaceful existence, Doctor. Simple, but fulfilling. I don't have any family nearby, not anymore. I manage quite well on my own, though. I’m a self-sufficient man, always have been.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Non-smoker, no alcohol consumption, active lifestyle with baking and walking, and a social life with friends – all documented. You seem to be very resilient and self-sufficient. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications. Never have. I believe in letting nature take its course, as much as possible. I’ve always been careful about what I put into my body. As for allergies… no, not really. I've never had a reaction to anything. Perhaps a bit of a sniffle when the pollen is high in the spring, but nothing serious. No allergies to food, no allergies to medications, nothing like that. I've been fortunate, I suppose. A strong constitution, you see. Lakota blood, again. We are a hardy people.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No current medications and no known allergies – that’s very good to know. Now, Mr. Tkac, I would like to perform a brief physical exam to get a more complete assessment. This will include listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears and throat, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I have no objections at all. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tkac. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning given your age. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops auscultated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Good air entry throughout. Now, I’ll just take a look at your ears and throat. Please open wide and say "Ah." Throat is clear, no erythema or exudates. Tympanic membranes are clear bilaterally. Finally, I’ll just perform a brief neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and coordination. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am happy to cooperate. There. Is that alright? I always had good eyesight, you know. Spent a lot of time tracking deer in my younger days. It requires a steady gaze.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Good smooth pursuit and tracking. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Good strength in all extremities. Gait is steady and balanced. No significant abnormalities observed. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits for your age. Your vital signs are slightly elevated blood pressure, but your heart and lungs sound clear, your neurological function is intact, and your gait is steady. I’m documenting mild hypertension. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about anything we've discussed so far?
PATIENT: Well, now. That sounds quite reassuring, Doctor. Mild hypertension, you say? Is that something to be worried about? I’ve always been a healthy man, as I said. I don't like the idea of being labelled with… ailments. But if it requires some attention, I suppose I’m willing to listen. Just tell me plainly what you think is best. I trust your judgment, as I said, but I’d appreciate a clear explanation. I'm a simple man, you see, and I don't understand all the medical jargon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Tkac, and I appreciate you asking. Mild hypertension, or high blood pressure, is very common as we age. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re unhealthy, but it’s something we want to monitor and manage to prevent potential complications in the future, like heart disease or stroke. In your case, it's a mild elevation, and we can likely manage it with lifestyle modifications – things like maintaining a healthy diet low in salt, regular exercise, and stress reduction. I'm not talking about immediately starting you on medication. We can recheck your blood pressure in a few months and see if it has come down with these changes. Would you be comfortable with that approach?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Lifestyle modifications… I can certainly manage that. Healthy diet, regular exercise, stress reduction… I already do most of those things, to be honest. Baking keeps me busy, and walking in the hills is quite relaxing. Perhaps I can cut back on the salt a bit. No medication, you say? That’s reassuring. I’d prefer to avoid that, if possible. Yes, I am comfortable with that approach. Recheck in a few months… that sounds sensible. Thank you for explaining it so plainly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. Now, does this affect my ability to move into the senior living facility? That's the main reason I came, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. I'm glad I could clarify. And no, this mild hypertension should not affect your ability to move into the senior living facility. I will write a note for them outlining your overall good health, the minor elevation in blood pressure, and my recommendation for lifestyle modifications with follow-up monitoring. It’s a very common situation, and facilities are accustomed to it. I will also recommend you continue to see your primary care physician for regular check-ups. They can help you monitor your blood pressure and overall health. Do you currently have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I see Doctor Eleanor Grant. She's a good woman, very thorough. I've been seeing her for about ten years now. She's located in town, not too far from the senior living facility. I believe she’ll be quite happy to hear your recommendations. She's always been good about keeping track of my health, making sure I'm up to date on my vaccinations and things of that nature. Is there anything else you need from me? Perhaps a copy of your notes for Doctor Grant?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Doctor Grant is a fine physician, and I’m happy to hear you have a good relationship with her. Yes, I can absolutely provide a copy of my notes to Doctor Grant, with your consent. I'll have the administrative staff fax or email them directly to her office. Is it alright if I proceed with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be wonderful. Please do. Fax or email, whichever is most convenient for your staff. I have no objections at all. This has been a very helpful visit, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, and I appreciate your thoroughness and patience. Thank you again for everything. I believe that is all I require for the facility. Is there any paperwork I need to sign?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the administrative staff prepare a summary report for the facility, as well as the note for Doctor Grant. There’s a consent form authorizing the release of medical information to the facility that I’d like you to sign, just for formality’s sake. It simply confirms that you allow us to share this information with them. Here you are. It's just a simple form. Let me know if you have any questions. Once you’ve signed it, we’ll get everything sent off.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here you are. All done. I appreciate your attention to detail. Everything seems to be in order. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. Now, I believe I am ready to proceed with the application for the senior living facility. Is there anything else I need to do here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Perfect, Mr. Tkac. Thank you. No, that's all you need to do here at the clinic. I’ll have my staff send the documentation to the facility. You should receive confirmation from them shortly. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Tkac. I wish you all the best with your transition to the senior living facility. Please don't hesitate to contact me or Doctor Grant if you have any questions or concerns in the future.
