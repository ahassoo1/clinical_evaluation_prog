DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. Please tell me, in concise terms, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. It's about my ear. Or, more accurately, the lack of hearing in it. And my face feels… strange. Droopy, I suppose is the word. Happened yesterday, just… suddenly. It’s very inconvenient, you understand. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. A sudden onset of hearing loss and facial drooping… rather concerning. Now, let’s be precise. Which ear is affected?
PATIENT: The left one. Obviously. Do I look like I wouldn’t know which ear is bothering me? Honestly, some questions… It's the left. And it's not just a little muffled, it’s… gone. Completely. And as I said, the left side of my face feels… weak. It’s quite noticeable, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. "Gone" is rarely precise, Ms. Nissenbaum. But left ear, complete hearing loss, facial weakness… Have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in either ear, or any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No dizziness. And no, there's no ringing. Just… silence. And this dreadful feeling on my face. It’s not pain, doctor. It’s… unsettling. Look, I don’t understand why you need all these details. My ear stopped working and my face feels funny. Isn’t that enough to go on? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Details are always necessary, Ms. Nissenbaum. A sudden unilateral hearing loss with facial weakness warrants a thorough investigation. Now, have you had any fever, headache, or any recent illness – even a common cold – preceding this?
PATIENT: No fever. No headache. And no, I haven’t been sick. I take excellent care of myself. I eat well, I exercise – well, I used to, before this whole ear situation. Look, I haven’t got time for a detailed medical history. It just happened. Yesterday. Out of the blue. Is that enough for you or do you want me to recall my entire childhood?
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll proceed with a brief examination then. Please sit. I need to assess the facial nerve function and examine your ear canal. And please, try to remain still. I haven't got time for unnecessary delays.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get on with it. Honestly, the inefficiency of this whole process is appalling. I have appointments, you know. And a life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Close your eyes tightly, and don't let me pull them open. Hmm. And now, smile for me. Raise your eyebrows as high as you can. Okay. The left eyelid is weak, and there’s definite drooping on that side of your mouth. I also see some slight paralysis of the left forehead muscles. Your tympanic membrane appears normal, though. No obvious signs of infection.
PATIENT: Well, you don't need a doctor to tell me my face is drooping! I can feel it. Is this something serious? I mean, will I be able to… function? I have commitments. People expect things of me. This is just… unacceptable. What is it? Some kind of… stroke? Or a virus? Don't tell me it’s something I did. I take very good care of myself.
DOCTOR: It could be several things, Ms. Nissenbaum. The most likely scenario, given the sudden onset, is Bell's palsy – a paralysis of the facial nerve. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. A stroke is less likely given the isolated nature of the symptoms, but cannot be entirely dismissed. A viral infection could also be a cause, though we'd expect other symptoms typically. I’m going to order a stat MRI to rule out any central nervous system cause. I will also order blood tests to check for inflammation and rule out other potential causes. Until we have the results, I recommend a course of high-dose corticosteroids. They can reduce inflammation and improve the chances of recovery.
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? Corticosteroids? Honestly, doctor, this is all rather dramatic, isn’t it? I just want my ear to work again. And my face to look normal. Is that too much to ask? And what are these… side effects? I read things online, you know. I do not want to be bloated and gain weight. I have a reputation to maintain. Can't you just give me something… simpler? A pill, perhaps? Something that won't disrupt my life? I really do not have the time for all this. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concerns, but this is not something we can simply "fix" with a pill. A proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial. The corticosteroids are the standard of care for Bell’s palsy, and the side effects are generally manageable. Weight gain is a possibility, yes, but it’s often temporary. However, without treatment, the paralysis could become permanent. I will write you a prescription for a seven-day course of Prednisone. Take it exactly as prescribed. I am also referring you to a neurologist for a consultation. The MRI results will be sent to him directly. Do you understand?
