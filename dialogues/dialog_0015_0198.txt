DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been thinking lately… I’d like to learn more about mindfulness, or meditation, if that’s something you can help with. I just feel…scattered sometimes, and I thought maybe that could help me focus a little better.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I’ve heard it can be good for… well, for feeling calmer, and being present. Honestly, I’m not exactly sure how it works, or even where to begin. I read a little online, but it all seemed a bit… abstract, you know? I was hoping you could explain it, and maybe suggest some resources if it seems like a good fit.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you’re consulting a physician, not a…life coach. While I appreciate you taking an interest in your well-being, my expertise lies in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. Feeling “scattered” isn’t a medical ailment. However… …it could be indicative of underlying issues such as anxiety or depression. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. I didn’t mean to… I suppose I just thought it was something doctors were getting into these days. Sorry. Well, let me think… I sleep alright, usually. I wouldn’t say I’m sad, exactly, but… sometimes I feel a little overwhelmed. Work is demanding, you know, making sure the tracks are safe… it can be stressful. And I worry about my mother, she’s getting older. Does that count? I don't really feel anxious, just… preoccupied, I guess. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: "Preoccupied." Right. And is this preoccupation interfering with your daily life, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. It's mostly just… forgetting things. Not important things, usually. Like, I left my coffee cup at work yesterday, and I nearly missed my bus this morning because I was thinking about a report. Small things, but they add up, you know? And sometimes it's hard to concentrate on anything for very long. It's not constant, but it’s definitely noticeable. Does that make sense? I'm not sure I'm being very clear.
DOCTOR: So, you're experiencing occasional forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating. Let’s explore this further. Do you have any history of head injury or neurological problems?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Never had a concussion or anything like that. My memory was always pretty good, actually. I have to remember a lot of technical details for my job, you know – signal timings, track layouts, safety regulations… It's just… lately it feels like my brain is a little bit… full. Like there's too much going on at once, and things get lost in the shuffle. I've never had any problems with… well, with thinking, before. I don’t have any family history of… of anything like that either, as far as I know. My mother's always been very sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, really. I don't take any regular medication. Occasionally I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. And I rarely get headaches, to be honest. I try to stay healthy, eat well, get enough sleep… it’s just… this feeling is new. I'm not used to being this… scattered.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, “scattered” is not a medical term. We need to be precise. Let’s move on to a brief review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: You’re right, of course. I apologize for being so vague. I just… I don't know the right words. No, nothing much. My appetite is normal, I think. Maybe a little less when I'm stressed, but nothing significant. And my weight… well, I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my clothes still fit. I’m about the same, I think. I try to eat healthy – mostly vegetables and fish, things like that. Not a lot of processed food. I'm a bit heavier than I used to be, but that's just age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I feel perfectly healthy, physically. That’s why I’m confused about all this. I don’t have a cold or anything. It’s just… a mental thing, I guess. Sometimes I just feel… disconnected. Like I’m not fully present. It’s hard to explain. Does that make any sense at all? I feel like I'm rambling. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: "Disconnected," you say. Ms. Sugino, I’m going to ask you to undergo a basic cognitive assessment. It’s a simple test to evaluate your memory and concentration. It’s standard procedure when a patient presents with these types of concerns. It will take about fifteen minutes. Would you be willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. If you think it would be helpful, I’m happy to do it. I just want to understand what’s going on. Fifteen minutes is no problem at all. I hope it doesn't take too long – I have to get back to work this afternoon. But if it helps, I'm willing. What does it involve, exactly?
DOCTOR: It involves a series of simple tasks—remembering words, recalling dates, solving basic arithmetic problems. Nothing complicated. It’s just a baseline assessment. We'll start with a short-term memory test. I’m going to read you three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. Go ahead. I'll try my best. I'm good at remembering things, usually. It's just… recently I've been a little bit… distracted. But I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Apple… Table… Pencil. Now, repeat those words back to me, please.
PATIENT: Um… Apple… Pencil… and… Table. Is that right? I think I got them in the right order. It was a little harder than I expected. Did I do okay?
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of simple arithmetic questions. What is 15 minus 7?
PATIENT: Let me think… 15 minus 7… that would be… 8. Is that correct? I used to be very good at math in school, but it’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, can you spell the word “world”?
PATIENT: Um… W-O-R-L-D. Is that right? It’s been a while since I had to spell anything. My job doesn't really require much spelling, mostly technical terms. But yes, W-O-R-L-D.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino, that’s enough for now. Based on this brief assessment, and your reported symptoms, I’m concerned about possible early cognitive decline. While it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these issues. I'll also order a basic blood panel to check for vitamin deficiencies or thyroid abnormalities, which can sometimes mimic cognitive problems. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good at all. Early cognitive decline… That sounds… scary. A neurologist? Well, if you think it’s necessary, I suppose so. I just… I thought I was just a little stressed and tired. I didn’t realize it could be something serious. A blood panel is fine, yes. Whatever you think is best. It’s just… I feel a bit overwhelmed now. Could you explain a little more about what this means? And what does a neurologist do, exactly? I’m probably just being silly, but I’m a little bit frightened.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, it's perfectly normal to be frightened. I’m not suggesting that you have a serious condition, but it’s important to be proactive and investigate these symptoms thoroughly. “Cognitive decline” simply refers to a decrease in mental abilities, such as memory, thinking, and reasoning. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, fatigue, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or, in some cases, neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. They will conduct a more comprehensive evaluation, which may include a neurological exam, cognitive testing, and brain imaging scans, such as an MRI or CT scan, to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the appropriate treatment plan. We’ll start with the blood panel to rule out any simple causes. I'll also write you a referral to Dr. Anya Volkov, a highly respected neurologist in the area. I’ll have my staff schedule an appointment for you. Is there anyone you would like me to inform about this?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes a little more sense. Thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. Dr. Volkov… I haven’t heard of her, but if you recommend her, that’s good enough for me. No, no one really. I’m single, and my mother is quite independent. She wouldn’t want me worrying her. I can let her know if anything serious comes up, but for now, I think it’s best to keep it to myself. Will the blood panel take long? And… how long does it usually take to get an appointment with a neurologist? I really need to get back to work, you see. It's a busy time for the railway. But I understand if it takes a while. I just… I don’t want to fall behind.
DOCTOR: The blood panel will be quick, Ms. Sugino. My staff will draw a small sample of blood right here in the office. The results usually take about 3-5 business days. As for Dr. Volkov, her schedule is quite full, but I'll have my staff expedite the referral. It typically takes about 2-3 weeks to get an appointment, but I’ll see if they can accommodate you sooner given your concerns. In the meantime, I recommend prioritizing rest and managing stress. Avoid any mentally demanding tasks if possible. And please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe memory loss, confusion, or difficulty with speech or movement. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate it. And thank you for trying to get me in to see Dr. Volkov sooner. I just… I feel a little bit better knowing that we're doing something about it. I'll go and see the staff about the blood panel. Thank you again, Doctor Trestrail. I hope I haven’t wasted your time.
DOCTOR: You haven’t wasted my time, Ms. Sugino. My staff will assist you with the blood work and schedule your appointment with Dr. Volkov. Please take care of yourself. And try not to worry unduly. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
