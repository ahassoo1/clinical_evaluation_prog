DOCTOR: Talofa, Amy. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I suppose, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… not particularly painful, usually. Just a bit of a dull ache sometimes. I first noticed it maybe a month or two ago? It doesn’t seem to be getting much bigger, but it hasn’t gone away either. It’s… firm, I would say. Not squishy.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or two ago, firm, not squishy, and a dull ache sometimes. Okay. And is the ache constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It’s not… always there. More noticeable after I’ve been on my feet a lot, I think. Or if I’ve been… lifting things. Nothing too strenuous, mind you, but I do help my wife in the garden sometimes. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s related to activity, especially being on your feet or lifting. Good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My… everything’s been pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No changes in bowel habits, and definitely no blood. I haven’t noticed any weight loss either, thankfully. I eat pretty well.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No changes in bowel habits or weight loss. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that at all. I’ve been feeling… normal, other than this lump, of course. No fever, no chills, no sweating at night. Just… a bit worried about what it could be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills or night sweats. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask some more general health questions, if that's okay. Have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, a long time ago. No complications, thankfully. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. No serious illnesses that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a teenager, pneumonia a few years ago, otherwise healthy. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a bit tricky. My mother had some heart problems later in life, but that’s about all I know for sure. My father… he passed away when I was young. I don’t really have much information about his medical history, unfortunately. My wife's family is healthy, as far as I know. No history of cancer or anything like that on either side. It’s not a topic that was really discussed much in my family, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mother with heart problems, father passed away young with unknown history, wife's family healthy. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications at all, thankfully. And no allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, no reactions to any foods or anything like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. Just… this lump. It's the only thing that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, no allergies. Okay, Amy, I'd like to do a physical exam now, if you're comfortable with that. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. I'm going to gently feel your abdomen to get a better sense of the lump – its size, shape, and consistency. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Just… be gentle, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I'll gently palpate the area. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I feel a firm mass in your lower abdomen, roughly the size of a walnut, located about two inches to the right of your belly button. It doesn't seem particularly tender to the touch, but it's definitely there. I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes in the area. It’s not easily movable. Now, to get a better understanding of what this could be, I'd like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds… thorough. Blood work is fine too. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I just want to know what it is. Is it… serious? I’m a little worried, to be honest. Do you have any idea what it could be at this point? Even a rough guess would be helpful.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Amy. It's good you're taking this seriously. It's difficult to say definitively what it is without the imaging and blood work, but based on what you've told me and my initial exam, there are a few possibilities. It could be a hernia, a lipoma , or, less commonly, something else. The CT scan will help us rule out anything more serious and give us a clearer picture. The blood work will help assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. I want to emphasize that it's important not to jump to conclusions. Many of these possibilities are not serious. But it's best to get it checked out thoroughly. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. A hernia… that sounds… uncomfortable, but not too alarming. A lipoma… is that something you have to remove? And how long will it take to get the results from the CT scan and blood work? I’m a bit anxious about waiting. And will I need a referral for the CT scan? I have Medicare, so I want to make sure it’s covered.
DOCTOR: Those are all good questions, Amy. A hernia can be uncomfortable, and sometimes requires surgical repair, but it's a common procedure. A lipoma is usually benign and often doesn’t require treatment unless it’s causing pain or is cosmetically bothersome, but it can be removed if you want. The results from the blood work should be available within a couple of days, and the CT scan results usually take 24-48 hours, sometimes a little longer depending on the radiologist’s schedule. I will call you as soon as I have the results. Yes, you will need a referral for the CT scan. I’ll send that to [Name of local imaging center], which is in-network with Medicare. I’ll also have my nurse contact you to schedule the appointment. The imaging center will verify your insurance coverage, but Medicare generally covers medically necessary CT scans. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, and I feel a little less anxious knowing what to expect. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and answer all my questions. I'll wait for the nurse to call about scheduling the appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help ease your worries a bit. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before the nurse calls. We'll get to the bottom of this. Alright, take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
