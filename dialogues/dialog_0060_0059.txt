DOCTOR: Right. Adyn, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Adyn Swaby. It’s… a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Nooruddin, wasn’t it? Though, truthfully, I don’t quite recall how I got here, if I'm honest. Everything feels a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Hazy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not a bad haze, just… difficult to place things. Like, I know I’m here about my speech, because someone mentioned it, but… the details are escaping me. I apologize for that. It’s been happening more and more lately, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try to piece it together, shall we?
PATIENT: That sounds… lovely, actually. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I’m married, you see, and my husband’s been… concerned. He brought it to my attention, I believe. I work as a construction manager, though I’m not entirely sure what I’ve been managing lately, to be perfectly frank. It's all a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: Construction manager, you say. And how long have you been experiencing this… "blurriness," as you call it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky question. It feels… gradual? It hasn’t been sudden, not that I recall. Maybe… the last few months? It’s difficult to pinpoint, truly. There are days it's barely noticeable, and others… well, others like today, where I can hardly recall what I had for breakfast. I do have Medicare, if that's helpful?
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. And you’re a young woman to be having such… memory difficulties. Perhaps a bit stressed with the construction work?
PATIENT: Stressed? Perhaps. It is demanding work, coordinating everything and making sure things run smoothly. Though, I wouldn't say it's been more stressful than usual recently. It's more that… things just feel… disconnected. Like I'm watching a film of my own life, instead of actually living it, if that makes any sense. I'm 19, and about 200cm tall, if that's relevant. And I weigh about 147, I believe. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s try to get some concrete information then. Tell me, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this… disconnection?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. I haven’t been feeling unwell, not physically, at least. No headaches, no dizziness… I haven’t noticed any weakness or numbness. The slurred speech is the main thing, really. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. My husband said it's gotten worse when I'm tired. And… oh! Now that you mention it, I do sometimes feel a little… clumsy. Like I’m tripping over air, if you know what I mean. Nothing major, just… off balance occasionally.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech and clumsiness… interesting. Do you have any family history of neurological problems?
PATIENT: That’s a bit difficult to say, actually. I… don’t really know much about my family history. My parents… weren't the most forthcoming with details. I grew up in Jamaica, and family gatherings were more about celebrating than… discussing medical conditions, if you understand. I don’t recall anyone specifically being ill with anything neurological, but I couldn’t say for certain. It's a bit of a blank, to be honest. I really wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I am aware of, no. I haven't taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for headaches, and I've never had any reaction to those. I… I don't think so. Though, again, my memory isn't what it used to be, so I could be forgetting something. It’s… frustrating, I apologize. Is this normal for someone my age?
DOCTOR: Normal?
PATIENT: Well… is this something that happens often to people? Especially young people? I wouldn’t want to be a bother, and I don't wish to waste your time if this is simply… stress or something. Perhaps I’m overreacting. I just… I feel like I’m losing myself a little bit. It's a scary feeling. I suppose my husband is worried because he’s seen me… not myself, as he puts it. I just want to know what’s happening, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. It won't take long. I'm going to test your reflexes, coordination, and a few other things. Just follow my instructions as best as you can.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Yes, please, go ahead. I’ll do my best. I hope I don’t… make a fool of myself. I’m a bit worried I’ll stumble or… I don’t know. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Just let me know what to do.
DOCTOR: First, let's check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax, and let your arms fall limp in your lap. I’m going to tap on a few of your tendons. Just let your muscles respond naturally. Don't try to control it.
PATIENT: Oh! That was… unexpected. Is that normal? It felt a little… forceful. And… is that a good reaction? I'm not very good at this, I’m afraid. It felt… quick. Should it be that quick? I apologise for being so… anxious.
DOCTOR: It's… reactive. Now the other side. A bit brisk, wouldn’t you say?
PATIENT: Brisk? I… I don't know. I haven't had my reflexes checked before. I suppose it's just how I am? I mean, I’m a construction manager, so I’m quite physically active, perhaps that's it? Is that… a bad thing? It’s just… I’m worried I'm doing something wrong. I’m trying my best to relax, truly I am. I’m a bit clumsy sometimes, as I mentioned, but I don’t usually feel… jerky.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s check your eye movements. Follow my penlight with your eyes only, without moving your head.
PATIENT: I… I think I'm following it alright. Is it going too fast? It’s a little difficult to keep perfectly still, I apologize. My eyes sometimes feel… tired, especially at the end of a long day. Is that normal? I’m trying my best, Doctor. It's just… a little hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Is everything alright? It feels a little… cold. I didn’t realise I was so… breathless. I’m a little anxious, perhaps that’s it. I apologise for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and the initial exam findings… it could be a number of things. We’ll need some further investigation. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain, and some blood work to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions.
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… serious? What kind of things are you ruling out? I mean, is it… something to worry about? I… I don’t like the sound of this. And what about my husband? Should he be worried? I'm scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Look, it's standard procedure. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We're just being thorough. We need to rule out things like multiple sclerosis, a brain tumor, or a stroke. It’s always best to be certain. I'll give you a referral to a neurologist, who can interpret the results and discuss the best course of action. Don’t panic. We’ll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis? A brain tumor? I… I don’t understand. I just wanted to know why I was feeling so… disconnected. Why my speech was slurred. I… I feel so scared, Doctor. And what if it is something serious? What does that mean for my husband? For my life? Please… can you explain it to me? In a way I can understand?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're upset. But let's not jump to conclusions. These are just possibilities. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. A brain tumor… well, that’s what it sounds like. It’s a growth in the brain. But again, these are just possibilities. The neurologist will be able to give you a definitive diagnosis after reviewing the MRI results. Right now, you need to focus on getting the test done. I’ll give you the referral information, and you can schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Here. This is Dr. Sharma’s contact information. Don't Google everything, alright?
PATIENT: Don’t Google everything…? But… what if I need to know more? What if I want to understand what's happening to me? My husband… he'll be terrified. And I… I don’t even know where to begin. I… I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, I have other patients waiting. I've ordered the tests, and I've given you a referral to a specialist. That’s all I can do at this point. If you're feeling overwhelmed, perhaps you should talk to your husband. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Wait… please… Is there anything… anything at all… I can do? Any questions I should ask? Any signs I should look for? I just… I feel so lost. Please… don’t just leave me like this. .
DOCTOR: .
