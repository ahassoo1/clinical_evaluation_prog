DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda…sore. Not always sore, but they get that way if I bump 'em or somethin'. Been botherin' me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. Bumps on the shins…sore with bumping. Okay. And how long have you been noticing these bumps, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That's a good question. Let me think… I wanna say maybe… three, four months now? It started with just one, I think. Then another, and another. Now there's quite a few. It’s slow, you know? Not like they all popped up overnight.
DOCTOR: Right, slow progression. Okay. Have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse besides bumping them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I wear long pants a lot when I’m workin’, and that kinda protects 'em, I guess. But other than that… nah. They just…are. They don’t seem to get better on their own, that's for sure. My wife keeps tellin' me to put somethin' on 'em, but I don't know what.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Oh, I do a little bit of everything at the warehouse. Mostly movin’ stuff around, you know? Freight, boxes, pallets… heavy liftin' sometimes. Been doin’ it for… oh, a long time. Forty years, maybe more. It’s honest work.
DOCTOR: Okay, warehouse work, heavy lifting. I see. And do you recall any specific injury to your legs that might have happened around the time you first noticed these bumps?
PATIENT: Injury… hmm. Not that I remember, exactly. It’s a warehouse, Doctor. I bump into things all the time. Little scrapes, little knocks… nothing major, I don’t think. I usually just rub it off and keep goin'. It’s hard to remember one specific thing. Maybe somethin' happened and I just…didn't notice it much at the time. It's possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at them. If you could point to one of the most bothersome bumps, that would be helpful.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here. This one right here. This one gets itchy sometimes, and it’s the most… noticeable, I guess. It's kinda tender to the touch, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It’s a firm, raised nodule, about half a centimeter in diameter. Reddish-brown in color. Skin temperature is normal around it. No signs of active infection – no pus, no significant warmth. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I’ve got a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me. But I take my medicine every day, keeps it under control, mostly. And my wife says I snore pretty loud. But other than that… nothin' really. Oh! And my knees get kinda creaky in the cold. But that's just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, controlled with medication. Snoring. Creaky knees. Good to know. Any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin'. My wife always gives me the medicine, makes sure I get the right dose and all that. She’s a good woman. I just… take what she gives me. Never had to worry about allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back if it's really botherin' me. But not every day, just when I need it. Other than that, no. Just the pills for my blood pressure. My wife keeps track of all that stuff, really. I’m not the best at rememberin’ things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just quickly check your blood pressure today. It's 135/85, which is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Considering you take medication, we may need to adjust the dosage if this continues. Now, just one more thing. Have you had any recent travel, or been exposed to anyone who is sick?
PATIENT: No travel, Doctor. Haven’t left the state in…oh, goodness, must be ten years now. And no, nobody I know is sick. We mostly stay to ourselves. My wife and I just go to church and then come home. So, no exposure to sick people, not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, these bumps could be shin nodules, sometimes called fibroma nodules. They're pretty common, often caused by minor trauma, like bumps and scrapes. They can be slow-growing and aren’t usually serious. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a simple skin biopsy. It’s a quick procedure where we take a small sample of the tissue and send it to the lab for analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A biopsy? You gotta…cut a piece out? Is it gonna hurt? And what if it’s… somethin' bad? My wife… she gets worried easily. I don't wanna scare her. Is it somethin' I should be really worried about, Doctor? I just wanna make sure it's not serious.
DOCTOR: It's a very small procedure, Mr. Aluia. We use a local anesthetic, so it shouldn’t be painful – just a little pinch, like a bug bite. And honestly, the chances of it being something serious are quite low. We do it just to be thorough, to rule out anything unexpected. Most likely, it will confirm it's a benign fibroma nodule. It’s better to be safe, you see. And we’ll discuss the results as soon as we have them, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a little pinch, you said? Not too bad then? And you think it's probably not serious. My wife will be relieved to hear that. Alright, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, then go ahead. Do what you gotta do. Just… try to be quick, alright? And let me know right away what you find out. I don't like bein' in the dark.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. We'll proceed with a small skin biopsy, then. It will only take a few minutes. I’ll numb the area first, and then take a small sample. After that, we’ll put a bandage on it. I'll give you instructions on how to care for it. It’s important to keep it clean and dry. And don’t worry, we’ll get the results back within a week or so, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. While I do this, do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm good. You explained it pretty clearly, Doctor. Just get it over with, and hopefully, it's nothin' serious. Thank you. I’m a little nervous, but… I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia, I’m going to make a small incision now. You might feel a slight stinging sensation… and there we go. Just a small sample. Now, applying a little pressure to stop the bleeding… Okay, all done. Here's a bandage. Keep it clean and dry, and avoid any strenuous activity for a few days. We'll get the results back within a week, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. Any immediate questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything. Just… one thing. Could you maybe… write down the instructions for my wife? She worries about these things. She’s a good woman, but she gets anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Aluia. These instructions cover everything your wife needs to know. Keep the bandage clean and dry, watch for any signs of infection – redness, swelling, pus, or increased pain. If she notices anything concerning, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And remember, we'll have the results back within a week. Do you have any other concerns before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you very much. You put my mind at ease. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll see you next week then. Take care now. .
