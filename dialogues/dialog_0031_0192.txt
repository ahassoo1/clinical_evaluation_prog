DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 51 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, 51. Look, don't bother with the 'pleasure' part. I'm here for this… army thing. The test. Gotta get it done. Don't see why it needs a doctor, to be honest. Seems like a waste of time, but my wife said I need to do it.
DOCTOR: I understand your… reservations, Mr. Hartness. This examination is required for your enlistment, as it helps ensure your health and well-being, and the well-being of others, should you be accepted into service. It’s quite standard procedure. To start, could you elaborate on what specifically this “test” entails?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What's to elaborate on? They sent a letter. Physical, some questions, that's it. Standard, you said? Should be. I'm in good shape. Always have been. Worked with engines my whole life. Keeps a man strong. Don’t need a doctor poking around telling me I'm not. Honestly, it feels a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It’s not my intention to insult you, and I assure you, this is not about questioning your strength. It's about comprehensively assessing your overall health status to identify any potential issues that might not be apparent. To begin that assessment, let's go through a little bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. Got a cold now and then, like anyone, but never hospitalized. My wife nags me to go to the doctor for the smallest thing, but I always tell her I'm fine. Waste of money. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that's it. Fixed it up myself, almost. A friend helped with the cast.
DOCTOR: Alright, no hospitalizations, a broken arm as a child… and you handled that with a friend’s assistance. Good to know. Have you had any surgeries at any point in your life?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. Why would I need surgery? I told you, I'm fine. Always have been. I fix machines, I don’t need fixing. This is getting ridiculous. Are you writing all this down? What's it for, exactly? It's not like you're gonna suddenly discover something wrong with me now.
DOCTOR: I am documenting everything, Mr. Hartness, as is standard medical procedure. It allows me to have a complete understanding of your health background and ensure I can provide the most accurate assessment possible. Let’s move on. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family? My father… he smoked too much. Lung problems, eventually. Didn’t take care of himself. Mother was alright, bit of arthritis when she got older, but nothing serious. Grandparents… don’t really remember them that well, to be honest. They lived in the countryside. Old people stuff, I guess. What difference does that make to me? I'm not them.
DOCTOR: Family history can provide valuable information regarding potential predispositions to certain conditions, Mr. Hartness. It helps us understand your risk factors. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t take anything. Never have. Don’t believe in all that stuff. My wife tries to get me to take vitamins, says I need them, but I tell her I get everything I need from my food. Real food. Not those fancy pills. I drink coffee. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn’t count as medication, Mr. Hartness. Good. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not really. I mean, I don't like dust, if that counts. Makes me sneeze. And I get irritated by wasps, but who doesn't? Serious allergies? No. I've handled all sorts of things working on engines - chemicals, metals, grease... never had a reaction. My skin's tough.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known serious allergies. Now, to complete the history, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What kind of question is that? I work. I fix engines. I come home. I eat dinner with my wife. I watch the news. I go to bed. It’s a simple life. A good life. Don't go making it complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hartness. A straightforward lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Absolutely not. I told you my father smoked, and look what happened to him. No. Never touched the stuff. My wife would kill me if I even thought about it. It’s disgusting.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? I have a beer with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, on a Friday. Nothing crazy. It helps me relax after a long day. My wife has a glass of wine. We’re not alcoholics, if that’s what you're thinking. It’s just… normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. A beer or two on occasion. Now, before we proceed with the physical examination, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your health or any concerns you may have?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. Like I said, I’m fine. I just want to get this over with so I can prove to everyone I'm perfectly capable and get on with it. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of time and money. But my wife… you know. She worries too much. Just… let’s just do the test. The quicker, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. Let’s proceed with the physical examination. I understand your desire to expedite the process. First, I’m going to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then, I will listen to your heart and lungs, examine your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Please remove your shirt and shoes, and I’ll ask you to sit on the examination table. Do you have any discomfort or limitations I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Discomfort? No. Look, just get on with it. I haven't got all day. And try not to take too long poking around. It's a bit… undignified, to be honest. Fine, I’ll take my shirt off. But quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I will be as efficient as possible. Could you please extend your arm, palm up?
PATIENT: Just hurry it up. My wife's making a roast. And I like the roast.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Again, deep breath in… and exhale. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No pain. Just… uncomfortable being poked and prodded. It's fine. Everything’s fine. Always has been. You're not going to find anything wrong. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I could be fixing an engine right now. A real job.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I'm going to check your reflexes. This will involve a quick tap on your tendons. Please relax your arm. Triceps reflex is normal as well. Squeeze my hands as tightly as you can, please.
PATIENT: There. Happy? Strong as an ox, I tell you. Always have been. Used to bending metal, you know. This is all a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, very strong grip. Excellent. Alright, Mr. Hartness, the physical examination is complete. Overall, your physical condition appears good. However, given your age, and to ensure a comprehensive assessment, I recommend we order some routine blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. These tests will give us a more detailed picture of your health status. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Blood work? More money wasted? Look, I’m fine. I told you. I’m perfectly capable. This is just… unnecessary. My wife will want me to do it, I suppose. She always does. Fine. Do the tests. But don’t expect to find anything wrong. It's just paperwork, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Hartness. It’s not about expecting to find something wrong, it’s about ensuring a thorough evaluation. I'll write the orders for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall. Once the results are back, we'll review them together. It typically takes 24-48 hours. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just tell me when I can go. And where to get this blood work done. I’ve got a roast waiting for me. And an engine to fix tomorrow. Honestly, this whole thing has been a complete waste of time, but my wife… you understand. Just get me the paperwork and let me get out of here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. Here is the requisition form. You can take this to the lab just down the hall – room 104. They’re open until 5 PM today. Once you've had the blood work done, please call our office to schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's everything. Thank you… I suppose. Just… let me go. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. Have a good day, and enjoy your roast. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
