DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Yoshino, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… forgetting things. Not huge things, but… little stuff. It's been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's good you brought it up – it’s definitely worth looking into. Lots of things can cause memory issues, and we’ll try to figure out what’s going on. When you say “forgetting things,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and… the word just won’t come to me. It’s not all the time, but it happens enough that I notice. And I worry it’s going to get worse. Sometimes I even repeat myself without realizing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds frustrating, and it's good you're paying attention to it. Forgetting why you went into a room, difficulty finding words, and repeating yourself… those are all things we want to explore. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly… maybe six months? It started slowly, just little things here and there. I thought it was just stress, honestly. But it feels like it’s been happening more lately. I’d say definitely more noticeable in the last couple of months.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months with a recent increase in the last couple of months. And you mentioned stress – is there anything particularly stressful going on in your life right now?
PATIENT: Well… my mother has been needing more care. She lives alone, and I’m trying to help out as much as I can, but it’s… a lot. I'm single, so it falls mostly on me. And work is busy, always is. I guess those are the main things. Nothing major happened, just a build-up, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, caring for your mother and a busy workload – that definitely is a lot to handle. Stress can absolutely contribute to memory issues. Let's talk a little bit more broadly about your memory. Aside from the things you’ve already mentioned, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't know. It’s hard to say. Sometimes I feel a little… disoriented? Like I’m not quite sure what day it is, or… things like that. Not often, but it's happened a couple of times recently. And I think I’m getting more easily frustrated when I can’t remember things. It’s just… annoying. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Feeling disoriented and increased frustration are definitely things we want to note. Okay, let's move on to some other questions just to get a better picture. Do you have any history of medical problems, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but nothing serious. My doctor always said I was healthy as a horse. Blood pressure is usually good, I get it checked regularly at my dentist office, and I don't have diabetes. Never been tested for thyroid problems, actually. I just… always felt pretty good, so I haven't spent a lot of time at the doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No major medical history, and generally feeling healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries or anything like that. Just the pneumonia, a long time ago. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was… a very long time ago. Seriously, just the pneumonia. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Let’s talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have a history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she… well, she was a bit confused towards the end of her life, but we never really knew what it was. They just said she was getting old. And my uncle, he had some trouble with his memory, but he drank a lot, so we assumed it was that. No one really talked about it much. So… I don't really know. It's possible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit unclear on the family history, but possible. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I only drink occasionally. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every day. Definitely not enough to cause problems, I wouldn’t think. I try to be healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements.
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a multivitamin, just a basic one. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. That’s about it, really. No regular prescription medications or anything like that. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I've never had a reaction to any medication. I’m pretty lucky that way, too, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, Ebony, I think I have a good initial picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical and neurological exam, if that's alright. This will help me assess your overall health and check your memory and reflexes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I want to figure out what’s going on, so I’m happy to do whatever you need me to. Just tell me what we’re doing.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don't mind, please have a seat here. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll do a few quick neurological tests – check your reflexes, balance, and coordination, and then we'll do a very brief cognitive assessment, just to get a better understanding of your memory and thinking skills. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Just let me know if anything feels weird or uncomfortable. I'm a little nervous, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Your reflexes are normal. Now I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Just keep your head still. Good. Now, I'm going to do a very short memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I'll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Repeat those back to me, please.
PATIENT: Apple, Table, Penny.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, we’ll move on to another part of the exam. I'm going to ask you to spell the word "world" backwards. Just take your time. This isn't a test, just helps me get a sense of things.
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. D-L-R-O-W. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct! D-L-R-O-W. Now, can you tell me the date today?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… it’s… August… the 2nd… 2025? I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, that's right. August 2nd, 2025. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to repeat earlier: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh… um… apple… and… table… I’m really sorry, I’m drawing a blank on the third one. It's right on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t quite get it.
DOCTOR: That's okay, Ebony. It's not a problem at all. This is just a starting point. From this quick exam, it seems like you are experiencing some mild difficulty with immediate recall and some challenges with complex tasks like spelling backwards. The rest of the neurological exam was normal. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. It could be a number of things - stress, anxiety, a vitamin deficiency, or it could be early signs of cognitive changes. I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I’d also recommend a more comprehensive cognitive assessment with a neuropsychologist. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and figure out how to fix it. Blood work and a more detailed assessment… sounds good. That makes me feel a little better, actually, knowing we’re going to look into it properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll order the blood work now, and the lab results should be back in a few days. I’ll also give you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neuropsychologist here in town. She’s excellent. Her office will call you to schedule an appointment. The assessment will take a couple of hours, but it will give us a much clearer picture of your cognitive function. In the meantime, it's important to prioritize stress management. Are there any strategies you currently use to reduce stress, or would you be interested in exploring some options like mindfulness exercises or relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: I don't really do anything specific for stress, to be honest. I just… try to keep busy, I guess. Maybe that's not the best approach. I'm definitely open to exploring some other options. Mindfulness exercises… that sounds… peaceful, actually. If you have any recommendations, I’d be grateful.
DOCTOR: Okay. There are several apps available – Headspace and Calm are both popular choices. They offer guided meditations and relaxation exercises. I can also provide you with some information on local mindfulness classes. Beyond that, ensuring you get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, and stay physically active are all important for brain health. I’ll print out some information on stress management techniques and the referral to Dr. Ramirez for you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Yoshino. You’ve been very helpful, and I feel a lot less anxious now that we have a plan. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re taking this one step at a time. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And please, prioritize self-care. I’ll see you back here once the lab results are in. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: .
