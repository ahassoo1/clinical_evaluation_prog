DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It's lovely to meet you. I see here you're with Medicare, and that you're a member of the Cherokee Nation – thank you for sharing that with us. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Seems like just yesterday I was seeing old Doctor Hemlock… though, goodness, that was… a while ago now, wasn't it? Well, to answer your question… I've just been feeling… poorly. Mostly sick to my stomach, and I don't seem to be able to eat much before I get full. It's been going on for a bit, and it's really getting me down. I just don't have the energy I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit unsettled when things change, and it sounds like you've been dealing with this for some time now. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “a bit,” could you give me a rough idea of how long you’ve been experiencing the nausea and feeling full quickly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… how long has it been? That's the hard part, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be. I'd say… maybe a couple of months now? Possibly longer. It started gradually, you see. Just not feeling quite right after meals, then it got worse and worse. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, though. Everything seems to blur together these days.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Kelder. It's very common for things to blur together, especially as time goes on. A couple of months is helpful to know. And you mentioned it started gradually, worsening over time. Could you describe what the nausea feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like a sharp sickness, if that makes sense. More like a queasiness, a sort of unsettled feeling in my stomach. It comes and goes, but it's pretty constant, you know? It doesn't always make me throw up, thankfully, but it makes me not want to eat. And when I do eat… well, that's when I get full so quickly. Even just a little bit of food seems to do it. It’s just… uncomfortable, really.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. A constant queasiness with early fullness… I appreciate you describing it so clearly. And thankfully, you haven't been experiencing vomiting. Now, besides the nausea and early fullness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. And I've lost a little weight, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. Just my clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. Oh! And sometimes my stomach feels… bloated, like it's full of air, even when I haven't eaten much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. Increased fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and bloating… those are all important things to note. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tricky question, Doctor. I’ve seen a lot of doctors over the years. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe… thirty years ago now? And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a while back, but they fixed it with a little… a little thing. A pacemaker, I think it was. It’s been fine ever since, though. Other than that… I don't really recall anything major. I used to get terrible arthritis in my hands, but that’s just part of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That's very helpful. I see here in your records you had a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in 1995, and a pacemaker implanted in 2010. Good to confirm that. And you mentioned arthritis in your hands. Have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal and pacemaker implantation?
PATIENT: Oh, my… Let me think. I had a hysterectomy a long time ago, when I was still quite young, I believe. It was… necessary, the doctor said. And I've had a couple of skin tags removed over the years, but those aren't really surgeries, are they? Just little… snips. Nothing major, like the other ones.
DOCTOR: Thank you. A hysterectomy – that's good to know. And yes, those skin tag removals are generally minor procedures. Now, Ms. Kelder, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And something for my arthritis, but it doesn't seem to help much anymore. Oh, and sometimes I take a little something for sleep, when I can’t get to sleep. But other than that… I don’t really take much. I try to avoid pills when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. So, medication for blood pressure, arthritis, and as needed for sleep. Do you happen to know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… no, I don't, Doctor. I just have my daughter fill my prescriptions, and she keeps track of everything. I don't really pay attention to the names. They all just look like a jumble of letters to me! I just take what she gives me, and when she tells me to.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. We can easily obtain a list from your pharmacy. We'll get that sorted out. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don’t think so, Doctor. I used to get a little itchy when I ate strawberries as a child, but I haven’t eaten strawberries in years. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Ms. Kelder. And no known serious allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… family history. That’s a long story. My mother lived to be a very old age, almost ninety, but she had a lot of trouble with her heart in her later years. My father passed away when I was quite young, from… something with his lungs, I think. And I had a brother, but he passed away many years ago. He had… some kind of sickness, but I don’t really remember what it was. It was a long time ago. My daughter says we have a history of… something with the stomach on my mother’s side, but I don’t really know what that means.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. A history of heart trouble on your mother’s side, lung issues in your father, and a potential history of stomach problems on your mother’s side… that’s helpful information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never have. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and she wouldn't allow it in the house. I’ve always avoided it.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Kelder. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, back when my husband was still alive. But I haven’t had anything to drink in years. It just doesn’t seem appealing anymore. It reminds me of… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder. That's perfectly alright. And finally, just to get a better picture of things, could you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… well, I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of vegetables, some fruit. I like soup, especially in the winter. I used to cook a lot more when my husband was still alive, but now I mostly just eat… simpler things. Toast, sometimes. Or a little bit of chicken. It's hard to get motivated to cook for just myself, you see. And lately, like I said, I haven't been very hungry.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. A diet of mostly vegetables, fruit, and simpler foods, with reduced appetite recently. Alright, Ms. Kelder, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Just be gentle, please. My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart rate is a bit slow, which is likely related to your pacemaker, and I hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. That could indicate some fluid buildup. I'll need to investigate that further. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. It’s a little tender in the upper abdomen, and I don’t feel any masses. I do note some bloating. And finally, I’ll check your reflexes and strength. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and your strength is slightly reduced, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Everything seems to be within normal limits, considering your history and age, but the mild crackles in your lungs and abdominal tenderness warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, dear… crackles in my lungs? That doesn’t sound good. And tenderness in my stomach… well, that explains why I’ve been feeling so poorly. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that we're identifying these things, Ms. Kelder. The crackles in your lungs and the abdominal tenderness could indicate a few different things. It could be a mild infection, some fluid buildup related to heart failure, or something related to your digestive system. It’s too early to say definitively without further testing. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test. I also want to order a chest X-ray to take a look at your lungs and rule out any serious issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… blood tests and an X-ray. That sounds… a bit scary. But I suppose it’s better to know what’s going on, isn’t it? Yes, Doctor, you go ahead and do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please let me know what the results are as soon as you get them. I don’t like being left in the dark.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder. I understand your concern, and I'll make sure to explain everything to you clearly as soon as we have the results. The lab work will give us information about your overall health, and the X-ray will help us visualize your lungs. The nurse will draw your blood now, and we can schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. It will only take a few minutes. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend continuing to eat small, frequent meals and staying hydrated. If your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or fever – please call the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me right now, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you for listening to me. I’ve been feeling so poorly for so long, and I’m glad you’re taking me seriously. And… thank you for being so kind. It’s nice to have a doctor who cares. Oh! One thing… will my insurance cover all of this? I worry about the bills.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It's my pleasure to help, and I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. And absolutely, that's a very valid concern. You have Medicare, and these tests are covered under your plan. We will submit the claims for you. There may be a small co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan, but our billing department will contact you if there are any charges you need to be aware of. They can also answer any questions you have about your coverage. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and then she can schedule your chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been a great help. Oh… tell your nurse to be gentle, please. My veins aren't always easy to find.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder. I will be sure to let her know. She's very experienced and will be as gentle as possible. I'll let you get settled, and the nurse will be in shortly. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before we get the results. It was lovely meeting you, Ms. Kelder. I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow.
