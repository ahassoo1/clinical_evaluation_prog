DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s my muscles. They’ve been…weak. It’s hard to explain, really. It’s just…not as easy to do things as it used to be. Like, carrying groceries, even just getting up from a chair sometimes. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Muscle weakness for a few weeks now, making everyday tasks more difficult. That’s certainly something we should look into. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s…all over, I think? Not one specific spot, but everything feels a bit…sluggish. Like I’m wading through water, if that makes sense. And it seems worse in the afternoons, definitely. Mornings are…okay, but by the time evening rolls around, I'm pretty tired just from normal stuff. I haven’t really noticed it getting better at any point, and maybe a little worse each week, but it’s hard to say for sure. It's not painful, just…difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s a generalized weakness, not focused in one particular area. It worsens throughout the day, is more noticeable in the afternoons and evenings, and hasn’t improved over the past few weeks. No pain associated with it, just a general difficulty. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, definitely. Not just the muscle thing, but just…exhausted, even after a full night’s sleep. And, now that you mention it, I’ve been a little bit clumsier than normal. Dropped a few things, bumped into furniture…nothing major, but enough to notice. Oh! And I think my appetite’s been a little off, too. Not that I haven’t been eating, just not as hungry as I usually am. Does that…make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that all makes perfect sense. Increased fatigue, some clumsiness, and a decreased appetite alongside the muscle weakness. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had the flu a few times, a bad cold last winter…the usual stuff. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Which is why this whole thing is…weird. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in…well, a long time. I usually just tough things out, but this isn’t going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior significant medical diagnoses or surgeries. Generally healthy until now. I understand. What about your family?
PATIENT: Uh, family… My father had…high blood pressure, I think. And my mother…she had arthritis, bad enough she needed a cane later in life. That’s about all I can think of, honestly. No one else that I know of had anything serious, or at least, nothing they talked about much. They’re both…gone now, sadly. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: I see. A history of hypertension in your father and arthritis in your mother. And currently, are you taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. I try to eat healthy, get enough sleep…that sort of thing. Like I said, I usually just…deal with things. Which clearly isn't working this time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Good to know. Now, to get a better sense of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and a general neurological assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds…fine. Whatever you think is best. Just…try to be quick, if you don’t mind? I have a few things I need to get back to this afternoon. Not important, but…things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as efficient as possible. If you could sit up there for me, that would be great. We'll start with your reflexes. Okay, reflexes are…slightly diminished, but within normal limits for now. Alright, now let’s check your strength. Please try to resist as I push against your arms and legs. Okay, strength is…slightly reduced in all extremities, but not significantly. Coordination appears intact. No significant tenderness or atrophy noted. Heart and lungs sound clear. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems…relatively normal, although there is some mild generalized weakness.
PATIENT: Okay. So…what does that mean? Is it something serious? I really don’t have time for…a long illness. I have things I need to do. And, honestly, I don’t really have…insurance. So, big medical bills aren’t great.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. McKinnon, and I want to assure you we’ll take things one step at a time. The generalized weakness we’ve observed, along with the fatigue and decreased appetite, could be caused by a number of things. It’s unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, based on the examination, but we do need to investigate further to determine the cause. Considering your symptoms and lack of prior medical history, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including vitamin deficiencies – particularly vitamin D and B12 – thyroid issues, or potentially early signs of a neuromuscular condition. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will assess your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and basic muscle enzymes. They can help us rule out several common causes of weakness and fatigue. As for the cost, I understand your concern about insurance. We can discuss options for more affordable lab testing, and I'll do my best to keep the costs as low as possible. There are some community resources that may be able to help as well. Would you like me to provide you with some information on those?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood tests… That’s…fine, I guess. It's just…another thing to worry about. Vitamin deficiencies…I do spend a lot of time indoors. And thyroid issues…my mother had something like that, maybe? I can't really remember. Community resources…yeah, that would be great, actually. Any help would be appreciated. I really don’t want to end up with a huge bill I can’t pay. I…I just need to get back to work. I have responsibilities. So, the faster we can figure this out, the better. What do I need to do to get the blood tests done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. McKinnon. We’ll move as quickly as we can. Here's the requisition form. You can get these tests done at [Local Hospital Lab Name] or [Another Local Lab Name]. They are both relatively affordable, and accept walk-ins. The form has the address and phone number for both locations. You don’t need an appointment. Just take this form and your ID with you. It should take about 15-20 minutes to get the blood drawn. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, try to get some sunlight if possible – even just 15-20 minutes a day can make a difference. And make sure you’re staying hydrated. Here’s some information about local resources that can assist with healthcare costs. It includes information on financial assistance programs and low-cost clinics. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s…everything. Two to three business days…okay. I’ll try to get it done tomorrow. I really appreciate you keeping the costs down and giving me the information on the resources. Thank you, Doctor Abady. I…I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something about it. I hope it’s nothing too serious. I’ll call if I have any questions. Or, I’ll wait for your call in a few days.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns before our follow-up. We'll get to the bottom of this. And remember, we'll work with your financial situation every step of the way. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
