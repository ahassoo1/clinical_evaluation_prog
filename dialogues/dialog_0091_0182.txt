DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes, well. The paperwork said I needed to come in for…clearance. For the surgery. Honestly, a waste of a perfectly good morning, if you ask me. I’ve had this planned for months. Just need a signature, really. Don't see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin, and I apologize for any inconvenience. While the paperwork initiates the process, a brief consultation is necessary to ensure your safety and optimize your preparation for surgery. It allows me to review your medical history and current condition. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about the surgery you’ve scheduled?
PATIENT: Surgery? It’s…cosmetic. Face lift. Is that what you need to know? Honestly, it’s nobody’s business. But my daughter insisted I get checked out. Said the surgeon won’t touch me without it. A perfectly sensible woman, my daughter. Unlike some people. It's just…things are starting to droop. You understand. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Orwin, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s entirely reasonable for your daughter to want to ensure you’re in the best possible health before proceeding with any elective procedure. And, of course, your comfort and well-being are my primary concerns as well. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me when you first noticed these changes—when did things start to “droop,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice? That’s a difficult question. Probably…five, maybe six years ago? It was gradual, you see. A little here, a little there. I didn’t pay much attention at first. I was busy, always busy. Running the business, you know. Terrazzo work. It's… demanding. And then my wife… passed. After that, I suppose I just…stopped caring as much. Everything went downhill then. Now it's…noticeable. Quite noticeable, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you've been through a great deal. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that other concerns may have taken a back seat. To help me assess your overall health and suitability for surgery, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well, I had my prostate acting up a few years back. Had a little procedure for that. Nothing serious, thankfully. And my blood pressure… it tends to run a bit high, sometimes. The doctor put me on some pills for it. A little white one, I think. I take it every morning. Honestly, I can’t remember the name of it. And…arthritis in my hands, naturally. All this terrazzo work, you see. It’s not gentle on the joints. Otherwise…I'm pretty good for eighty-one, if I do say so myself.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you’ve been managing these conditions reasonably well. To clarify, could you tell me approximately when you had the prostate procedure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it must have been… oh, around 2018, I think. Yes, 2018. Right after the awful winter storm we had. Couldn't get out of the house for weeks. Had to cancel a big job. A real nuisance. It was a quick thing, thankfully. In and out, the doctor said. Didn’t bother me too much. Just glad it’s over with.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. And are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… I take something for my hands, sometimes. When they really flare up. Ibuprofen, I think? Or maybe naproxen. Something like that. Over the counter. Not every day, just when they ache. And…oh! A little vitamin D, my daughter told me to take it. Said I wasn’t getting enough sun. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for that comprehensive list, Mr. Orwin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I used to get hay fever when I was a boy, running around in the fields. But that stopped years ago. Nothing I can think of that bothers me these days. I eat pretty much anything. Except maybe oysters. Never liked those slimy things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father… he lived a long life. Almost ninety. But he had a bad heart towards the end. My mother, she passed away when I was young. Cancer, I think. Lung cancer. And my sister…she had high blood pressure, like me. Nothing else I can really think of. We weren’t a terribly close family, if I’m honest. Everyone kept to themselves.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. That provides useful information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I have things to do, you know. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which is not uncommon at your age, but we’ll make note of it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure. It's a little elevated, 145/88. As expected, given your history. Your pulse is regular, but a bit fast. I see some swelling and stiffness in your hands, consistent with arthritis. Finally, I’ll briefly examine your throat and check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems reasonably well-controlled, given your age and medical history, but the elevated blood pressure warrants further discussion and potential adjustment of your medication.
PATIENT: Hmph. I knew it. Always something. My daughter will be thrilled. So, what does this all mean? Am I going to get the surgery or not? Don’t tell me I’ve wasted all this time and money.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, based on my examination and the information you've provided, I don't foresee any absolute contraindications to proceeding with the facelift. However, your slightly elevated blood pressure does require attention. Ideally, we'd want that better controlled before elective surgery to minimize risks. I recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician to discuss adjusting your blood pressure medication. Once that’s under better control—ideally below 130/80—and with their clearance, I believe you’re a suitable candidate for the procedure. To be absolutely thorough, I also suggest a basic EKG to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, given the murmur I detected. Would you be comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: An EKG? More tests? Honestly, it’s ridiculous. But…my daughter. She’d never let me live it down if I refused. Fine. Fine! I’ll get an EKG. And I’ll see the doctor. But I expect this can all be done quickly. I haven't got all day. So, what do I need to do now? Give me the papers, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. Here is a referral for an EKG, and I’ve also included the contact information for a few highly-rated cardiologists in the area. I will also send a summary of our consultation to your primary care physician to facilitate the medication adjustment. Once you have the EKG results and their clearance, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can finalize the surgical plan. In the meantime, please continue taking your current medications as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it done. I've wasted enough of my time today. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I understand. Thank you for coming in. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
