DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, Doctor… Andraca, is it? I’m not here to chat. I want a baby. And I want it to happen easily. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I expect there won't be any… problems. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, I understand. You're looking to start a family and want to discuss options for conceiving. That’s perfectly reasonable. To help me understand your situation and determine the best course of action, I’m going to ask you a few questions, if that's alright. We’ll cover some medical history, and then discuss your cycle and any prior attempts. First, can you tell me a little about your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: My… cycle? Honestly, Doctor, do you really need to know everything? It comes and goes. It's… regular enough. What difference does it make? I'm 51, not 16. I've had periods for decades, I think I have a general idea of when they happen. Are you suggesting something is wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s not about suggesting anything is wrong. It’s simply standard procedure when we’re looking at fertility. Knowing the typical length of your cycle – from the first day of one period to the first day of the next – gives us a baseline. It helps us understand the timing of ovulation, which is important for conception. Even if it's "regular enough," a little more detail helps. Roughly how long is your cycle, on average?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Look, it's… around 28 days, give or take. Maybe sometimes a little longer, sometimes a little shorter. I haven’t exactly been measuring it, you know. I have a life. Is that sufficient, or do you need a precise calendar from the last fifty years? Because I certainly don’t have one.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Shteynberg, thank you. A 28-day cycle is a good starting point. And you’re absolutely right – your time is valuable. Now, have you been trying to conceive with a partner?
PATIENT: That's… a personal question, isn't it? Let's just say I'm exploring all my options. I'm divorced. And I want a baby. Whether I need a… partner to accomplish that is beside the point. Is this clinic equipped to handle… modern methods? Or am I wasting my time with outdated approaches?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Shteynberg. We do offer a range of fertility options, including intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization , as well as guidance on donor options if that’s something you’re considering. We strive to provide comprehensive care tailored to each patient's individual needs and circumstances. To help me determine the best approach for you, could you tell me if you’ve had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Yes. Once. A long time ago. It… didn’t end well. I'm not going to delve into the details. It’s irrelevant now, isn’t it? It was before… everything. It's certainly not something I want to rehash with a complete stranger. Let’s focus on future possibilities, Doctor, not the past. Are you capable of helping me, or not?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Shteynberg. You're not obligated to share anything you're not comfortable with. Knowing there was a previous pregnancy is helpful information, but we absolutely don't need to discuss the details if you prefer not to. Given your age and previous pregnancy, it would be prudent to run some basic blood tests to assess your ovarian reserve and overall health. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More waiting, more poking. Fine. As long as it's efficient. And you tell me the results immediately. No drawn-out procedures, no unnecessary delays. I haven't got all day, you know. I have… commitments. Get it done. Quickly. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I’ll order the tests now, and the nurses will get you set up. We'll strive to get these processed as quickly as possible. I will review the results personally as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. Before we proceed with the lab order, do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
