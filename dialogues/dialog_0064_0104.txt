DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time. My throat...it hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. Not sure why it’s hurting. I just…do my work. It’s important work, you know. Separating and filtering. Very precise.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sore throat for a few days. I understand you're busy, so we’ll try to be efficient. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More…? Well, it’s just…sore. When I swallow. And…it feels scratchy. Like sandpaper, maybe? I don’t know. I don’t usually get sick. Too much to do. I run the machines, you see. Can't be stopping for every little ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, scratchy and sore when you swallow. Does it hurt to talk as well, or just when you eat and drink?
PATIENT: It's...a little worse when I talk, yes. I have to…force it, sometimes. I have a lot to say, you know? Important things. But this…this makes it hard. Honestly, I don't even know why I’m here. My sister said I should come. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your sister’s a good one to listen to, it sounds like. And it's good you came in. Just to rule things out. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever…? I don’t…check for those things. I don’t have time to be feeling myself! Body aches? Maybe a little tired, but that’s from the work. Long hours. The machines don’t run themselves, you know. Everything has to be precise. I don’t know what a “chill” even is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever that you're aware of, and the tiredness is likely from work. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or congestion?
PATIENT: Cough…? No. Not really. Maybe a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing…serious. A runny nose? No. I keep myself very clean. Very proper. Congestion…what is congestion? Is that…a machine thing?
DOCTOR: No, congestion isn’t a machine thing. It’s…when your nose feels blocked up, like when you have a cold. Okay. So, no cough, no runny nose, no congestion. Have you had any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath at all?
PATIENT: Breathing…? No. I…breathe, of course. I need to breathe to work. Don't be silly. Shortness of breath? No. I stand up straight, I take deep breaths, I keep everything running smoothly. Honestly, I think my sister is sending me on a wild goose chase. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. I understand your concerns about time. Just to be thorough, I’d like to quickly examine your throat and listen to your lungs, if that’s alright. It will only take a few minutes. It might help me understand what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I have schedules to keep. Machines don’t run themselves, you know. And don’t touch anything. I keep everything very clean.
DOCTOR: Of course, Tammie. Cleanliness is important. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, if you could open your mouth wide and say “Ah,” please. Okay. Your throat is a little red, but your lungs sound clear. No obvious signs of anything serious right now. I don’t see any white spots or pus back there.
PATIENT: See? I told you. It's nothing. Probably just…tiredness. Can I go now? I really need to get back to the machines. They’re very…temperamental, you know. Everything has to be precise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it's likely a mild irritation, possibly from overuse or dryness. I recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids – warm tea with honey can be soothing. However, because you’ve been feeling unwell for a few days and to rule out anything more serious, I would like to recommend a rapid strep test. It’s a quick swab of your throat to see if it's a bacterial infection. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: A…swab? You mean…stick something down my throat? Absolutely not. I do not like things down my throat. My sister and her worries again. I told you it's nothing. Rest and tea? Fine. I can do that. But no swabs. Absolutely not. Now, can I please go?
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. I understand. No swab. In that case, let's focus on supportive care: rest, fluids, and warm tea with honey. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, have trouble breathing, or have severe pain when swallowing – please seek medical attention immediately. Here’s a handout with information about sore throats and when to see a doctor. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…tea. And rest. And to get back to my machines. They are…counting on me. Honestly, this has been a waste of time. Thank you, Doctor. But I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Get well soon, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if things don’t improve. Have a good day.
