DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome. Now, you're a… a sprightly ninety, if I’m not mistaken. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Yes, ninety years come August the tenth. Seems like just yesterday I was a little girl… but that was a long time ago. I’ve been feelin’ kinda… weak lately, and the nurse said somethin’ about my blood pressure bein’ high. That’s why I’m here, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Right. Weakness and elevated blood pressure. Hmm. Now, “weakness” is a rather broad term, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. It ain’t like I can’t do things, just… tire out quicker. Especially when I’m bakin’. Used to be I could be on my feet all day makin’ pies and breads, now I gotta sit down every hour or so. And sometimes my head feels a little… swimmy. Not dizzy exactly, just… light. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. And this has been happening… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… maybe six months or so? It started slow, I didn't pay much mind at first. Thought it was just gettin’ old, you know? But it’s been gettin’ worse lately. I make a batch of biscuits and I'm pooped for the rest of the day. Never used to be like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this weakness and lightheadedness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My hands ache somethin’ awful sometimes, but that’s just the arthritis, I figure. And… oh! I’ve been havin’ headaches, but they come and go. Not real bad, just a dull throbbin’ at the back of my neck. Mostly when I’m stressed. And I’ve been a bit more… forgetful, maybe? But at my age, who isn’t forgetful?
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness is… common, yes. But we should document everything. Now, these headaches... are they accompanied by any vision changes, nausea, or sensitivity to light?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. Just… a headache. Plain and simple. No blurry vision, no feelin’ sick to my stomach, and light don't bother me none. Just a dull ache. Honestly, Doctor, I think I worry too much. Always have. My husband, bless his soul, used to say I was a hypochondriac. But I do like to be sure.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's take a look at your vitals and do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you had your blood pressure checked regularly outside of the clinic?
PATIENT: Not really. Just when the nurse checks it here. I don’t own one of them machines. Never thought I needed one. I always figured if somethin' was wrong, I’d just come see a doctor. Is it somethin’ I should get? I don’t trust those things much, always seemin' different every time.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, yes. But they can be inaccurate. We'll get an accurate reading here today. Now, let's start with your heart and lungs. Please sit back and relax. Take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Alright… just let me know if you need me to do somethin’. I ain’t used to all this pokin’ and proddin’, but I trust you know what you’re doin’. My mama always said a good doctor was worth their weight in gold.
DOCTOR: Good. Heart sounds… regular, but a bit rapid. Lungs are clear, but there's a slight decrease in breath sounds at the bases. Any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a bit. Feels… just like bein’ tapped, I reckon. A little uncomfortable, maybe, but no pain. My chest always feels a little tight when the weather changes, though. Could be that. We had a real humid spell last week. Everything felt damp.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Keep your leg relaxed… and just let it drop.
PATIENT: Oh! That tickles a bit. And… feels a little strange. Feels the same on this side, I suppose. I always had weak knees, even when I was young. Used to fall all the time.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished, but not significantly. Now, let's check your hands. Can you squeeze my fingers?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? My grip ain’t what it used to be, arthritis, you know. It's a constant ache. Especially in the mornings. Makes it hard to open jars sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s weaker than it should be. And there is some visible swelling in the knuckles. Now, finally, I’m going to check your feet and ankles. Please extend your legs. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Just the usual achiness. My ankles swell up a little at the end of the day, especially if I've been on my feet too long. I usually just put my feet up and that helps. They still work alright, though. That's the important thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. That's enough for now. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I got the arthritis, like I said. And I had the flu somethin' fierce a few years back. Nearly took my life, it did. And… oh, I had my gallbladder out when I was about sixty. Besides that, I've been pretty lucky, I reckon. Kept myself busy, always bakin’ and gardenin’. Fresh air and hard work, that's what keeps a body goin’. Don't take much medicine, either. I like to avoid it if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the gallbladder, like I said. Back in… oh, goodness, must've been 1983 or '84. Doctor said it was goin' bad, needed to come out. It was a quick recovery, thank the Lord. Haven't had any trouble with it since. Never liked bein' in the hospital, though. Smells like… well, like sickness.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. That’s a long story. My mama lived to be 95, but she had a bad heart. My daddy… he didn’t live as long, somethin’ with his lungs. And my brother… he had the sugar, they called it. Diabetes, I think. Lots of trouble with his feet. Seems like there’s always somethin' ailin' somebody in my family. I try not to dwell on it, though. Worryin' never fixed anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for the arthritis, when it flares up. It’s called… Ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. I don't take it every day, just when my hands are achin' too bad to work. And sometimes I take a little somethin’ to help me sleep, but not often. Mostly I just try to rest. A warm bath usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I ain't never had a bad reaction to nothin'. I've been lucky that way, too. My mama always said I had a strong constitution. She used to make me drink all sorts of herbal teas when I was little, said it built up my immunity. Maybe that's why I don't get sick much. Although, like I said, I had the flu somethin’ fierce a few years back. But that was the worst of it. Don't think I'll ever forget that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, it sounds like you’re dealing with a combination of age-related changes, some arthritis, and possibly some mild hypertension. Your weakness is concerning, and we need to investigate that further. I'm going to order some blood work to check your overall health, including your kidney function, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count. I'm also going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm, given your reports of weakness and the rapid heart rate I detected. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… EKG… goodness. That sounds like a lot. I don't like havin' things poked and prodded, Doctor. Is it somethin’ serious? I just thought I was gettin’ old. You think somethin’ is really wrong with me? I was hopin’ it was just a little somethin’ I could fix with a warm bath and a good night's sleep. I don't want to be a bother, and I certainly don’t want to spend all my time in doctor’s offices.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Steines. We need to rule things out. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it’s important to get a clear picture of what's going on. The tests will help us determine the cause of your weakness and ensure your heart is healthy. At your age, it’s even more important to be proactive about your health. Now, I'm going to write you a referral to the lab and the cardiology department. They'll schedule the appointments for you. I’ll also prescribe a low dose of Lisinopril to help control your blood pressure. It’s a very common medication, and it has minimal side effects. We’ll monitor you closely. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… is that a strong medicine? I don’t like takin’ pills, Doctor. And I don’t want to be hooked on nothin’. My sister got on somethin’ for her arthritis years ago, and she couldn't get off it if her life depended on it. She was miserable. And what if these tests show somethin’ terrible? I don't want to know if I'm dyin’, I just want to feel better. Could we just… wait and see? Maybe it’ll go away on its own? I’ve gotten over things before, I reckon. I’m a tough old bird.
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, with all due respect, “waiting and seeing” is not a responsible approach to your health. You are reporting significant weakness, and your blood pressure is elevated. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to serious complications, such as a stroke or heart attack. Lisinopril is a very mild medication, and it’s not addictive. It simply helps to lower your blood pressure and reduce the strain on your heart. And the tests are not about finding something “terrible.” They are about gathering information so we can provide you with the best possible care. I understand your concerns, but I am obligated to recommend the appropriate course of action to ensure your well-being. Now, I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks so we can discuss the test results and adjust your treatment plan if necessary. Will you agree to that?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best… I’ll do it. But I still don’t like it. I just… I don't want to be a bother. And I don't want to spend the rest of my days in and out of doctor’s offices. I got things to do, you know? Bakin’ to do, gardens to tend… I just want to feel like myself again. Two weeks, you said? Alright. Two weeks. Just… promise me you won’t tell me nothin' too scary. I’m an old woman, Doctor. I don’t know if I could handle it.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Steines. I will do my best to explain everything clearly and concisely. Now, here are the referrals and the prescription. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work. And the cardiology department will call to schedule the EKG. I've also written a note for your primary care physician, so they are aware of our findings. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or sudden weakness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Chest pain… shortness of breath… yes, I understand. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I reckon I’ll… I’ll go now. And… try not to worry too much. Thank you again. .
