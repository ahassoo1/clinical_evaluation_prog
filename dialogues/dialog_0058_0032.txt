DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… a delicate matter, really. Something of an… inconvenience. I don’t quite recall all the details, to be honest, but my wife insisted I come. She’s quite insistent, you see. It’s… a discharge. From… down there. It’s rather embarrassing to speak of, but I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn't it? Though I must say, at my age, one expects certain things to… simply stop working, not… leak.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. Well, it’s good you came in, even if it’s… uncomfortable. It’s never ideal, at any age, to have unexpected discharge. And it is important to figure out what’s going on. Now, let's try to be a little more specific, if you don't mind. Could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Goodness. I’m not a… a chemist, Doctor. It’s… wet. And… not entirely clear, if that makes any sense. A bit… yellowish, I believe my wife said. Though I didn't examine it myself, naturally. It’s just… there. On my undergarments. It’s a nuisance, more than anything. And quite… unpleasant. Is this something common, Doctor? Surely, at my age… it shouldn’t be happening.
DOCTOR: It's… unusual, yes, for someone your age. But not impossible. "Wet" and "yellowish" is a start, but we need more detail to even begin to narrow down the possibilities. Has there been any odor?
PATIENT: Odor? Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes. A slight one. Not… overpowering, mind you. But not entirely fresh, shall we say. A bit… stale. Like… old linens, perhaps? Though I assure you, my wife keeps a very tidy home. It's just… a faint scent. Barely noticeable, unless one is… close. Really close. And my wife is quite perceptive, so she may be exaggerating, as wives often do.
DOCTOR: "Slight, stale odor." Right. And has this been happening for a long time, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: Recent, I believe. Though my memory isn't what it once was, you understand. Perhaps a week? Maybe ten days? It's all a bit… blurred. My wife noticed it first, and she immediately became quite alarmed. She’s always been a worrier. Before that… nothing. Everything was… perfectly normal. Or as normal as one can expect at eighty-three years of age. Is it serious, Doctor? Please, be frank. I haven’t much patience for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say without a proper examination, Mr. Krok. But discharge, especially with an odor, shouldn’t be ignored. It could be something relatively minor, but it could also indicate an infection, or something else that requires attention. We're going to need to do a quick examination. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An examination? Well… I suppose so. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of… prodding. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we simply prescribe something? An ointment, perhaps? My wife has a great many remedies… though she’s usually wrong. But still, it would be preferable to… that. And please, be quick about it, Doctor. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, prescribing something without knowing what we're treating is irresponsible. I am a doctor, and my responsibility is to provide appropriate care, not simply guess at a solution. A quick examination is necessary to determine the cause of the discharge, and therefore, the correct course of action. It won't be pleasant, I understand, but it's essential. I’ll be as quick and discreet as possible. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to prepare. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Discreet… they all say discreet. At my age, one loses all sense of dignity, you know. A quick examination… as if it were a broken spring, not… that. Honestly, the younger generation… no respect for privacy. Still… my wife would have my hide if I refused. Best to get it over with, I suppose. Though I do wish she hadn’t insisted on this particular doctor. She’s a bit… abrupt, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. I'll explain everything as I go. We're just going to take a quick look to see what’s causing the discharge. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, Doctor, I’m not as… flexible as I once was. And please, do be gentle. This is all rather… unnerving. This is preposterous… absolutely preposterous. At my age… one shouldn’t be subjected to this sort of indignity.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I'm just going to take a look now. … There's some mild inflammation… and a small amount of purulent discharge, as you described. The area is tender to the touch. No visible masses. … Hmm. It appears there’s a small ulcer present. It doesn’t appear particularly deep, but it is definitely causing irritation. This could be a sign of an infection, potentially a localized skin infection. We'll need to take a swab to determine the specific bacteria present.
PATIENT: Ulcer? Good heavens. An ulcer… that sounds dreadful. Is it… contagious? My wife… she wouldn’t be pleased if I’d brought something home with me. And what sort of bacteria? Are they… dangerous? Honestly, Doctor, you’re not making me feel any better. This is all very alarming. Is it treatable? With… pills, perhaps? I absolutely refuse to have any sort of… procedure. I’ve heard horror stories, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, please try to remain calm. It's unlikely to be contagious, but we'll take precautions regardless. As for the bacteria, we won't know until the lab results come back. Most skin infections are easily treatable with antibiotics, and in the vast majority of cases, it doesn’t require any sort of "procedure." However, we need accurate information to prescribe the correct antibiotic. I’ve taken a swab for culture and sensitivity. We should have the results back in 48 to 72 hours. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic cream to apply twice daily. Keep the area clean and dry. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully. If the redness or pain worsens, or you develop a fever, contact the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Broad-spectrum… antibiotics. Very well. Though I must say, I’ve never been one for creams. They always feel… sticky. And 48 to 72 hours? That’s an eternity when one is in discomfort. Very well. Clean and dry… sticky cream… antibiotics. I suppose I haven’t much choice, have I? And… a fever? Good heavens, I haven't had a fever in decades! Yes, Doctor, I understand. Follow the instructions… clean and dry… sticky cream. Though I do wish this hadn’t been necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here is the prescription for the antibiotic cream. The pharmacy will provide instructions on how to apply it. We’ll follow up once the lab results are back. It’s important to remember hygiene, Mr. Krok. And if the condition doesn't improve within a few days of completing the course, we'll need to consider other options. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Hygiene… yes, of course. Hygiene. My wife is always lecturing me about hygiene. It seems everything comes down to hygiene these days. No, Doctor, I don’t believe I have any further questions. Though I must say, this has been a most… unpleasant experience. I appreciate your… assistance, I suppose. Though I do hope I won't be needing your services again anytime soon. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get dressed, and have a good day, Mr. Krok. .
