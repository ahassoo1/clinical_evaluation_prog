DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's this tiredness, really. Even with the machine, I find myself awfully sleepy during the day. It's just… draining, you know? I’ve been using the CPAP for a while now, and it should be helping, but it doesn’t always feel like it does.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness even with the CPAP machine… that's good information to start with. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up, not usually. But I’ll be reading, or watching the news… and just kind of… drift off. Or feel incredibly sluggish, like I’m wading through mud. It happens most afternoons, I’d say. Sometimes even during dinner. It makes it hard to enjoy things, and my daughter worries about me driving. She's a good girl, always looking out for me. I try to fight it, you know, have a coffee, but it doesn’t always do the trick.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite disruptive, and I appreciate you sharing that your daughter is concerned—that's very thoughtful of her. When you say "afternoons," roughly what time does this usually start?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… usually around 2 or 3 in the afternoon. It can be a bit earlier if it's a really warm day. Or if I haven't had a good night's sleep – although, like I said, even with the machine, the sleep doesn’t always feel restful. It's hard to explain. I wake up, but I don't feel… refreshed, you know? Like I haven’t really been asleep at all. It's just… a feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand. Not feeling refreshed even after using the CPAP is important. Now, could you tell me a bit about how you're using the machine?
PATIENT: Certainly. I make sure to wear the mask every night, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s not the most comfortable thing in the world, but I’ve gotten used to it. I clean it regularly, like the nurse showed me. I’ve tried different settings, the pressure, you know? They adjusted it a couple of times after the first sleep study. I use the ramp feature, to start slowly. I try to keep it on all night, but sometimes… I admit, I take it off if it feels too tight or leaks. Not often, but it happens. Usually when I get up to use the bathroom. Do you need to know the exact pressure setting? I have the card with all the numbers right here in my wallet.
DOCTOR: That’s very thorough of you, Mr. Paske, and good that you keep track of everything. Knowing the pressure is helpful. If you wouldn’t mind, could you hand me that card when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. It has all the details from the sleep center. They said it was important to keep this with me. It’s got the pressure settings, the type of mask… everything, I think. I hope it helps. It’s all a bit technical for me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, I see here you're on 12 centimeters of water pressure with a nasal pillow mask. And you've been using this setup for about six months. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder removed years ago, back in the eighties. And I’ve got a little bit of arthritis, mostly in my knees. It bothers me when the weather’s bad. Oh, and the doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a bit high, so I take a pill for that. Otherwise… I think that’s it. Nothing major, I hope. I try to stay active, walk a bit when I can. My blood pressure has been pretty good at my checkups, as far as I know. Is that the kind of information you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. And good that you're staying active. Do you take any other medications besides the cholesterol pill?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I take something for my knees when they’re really bothering me, an anti-inflammatory. It's not every day, just when I’ve been on my feet too much. And I have some cream for a patch of dry skin on my arm. Other than that… no, I don’t really take much. I try to avoid pills if I can. I prefer a good cup of chamomile tea, if that makes sense. Do you need to know the name of the anti-inflammatory? I think it’s… naproxen, maybe? I have a bottle at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen as needed for your knees, and a cream for your arm. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. I remember being a little boy, and trying all sorts of things… never bothered me. I've never had any trouble with penicillin or any other medications. I think I'd know if I had an allergy, wouldn’t I? It’s just… not something I’ve ever experienced.
DOCTOR: Yes, you would definitely know. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or sleep apnea?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father… he had heart problems when he got older. He had a stroke, actually, when he was in his seventies. And my mother had diabetes, but she got it later in life as well. As for sleep apnea… not that I know of. Nobody ever talked about snoring or anything like that in my family. My brother snores a bit, but he’s a big man, always has been. But nobody ever went to a doctor about it. Does that help, Doctor? It’s hard to remember all the details from so long ago.
DOCTOR: That's helpful. Okay, so heart disease in your father, diabetes in your mother. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even tried it. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she used to smoke, but I never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit. And I certainly wouldn't start now. I always preferred a good glass of wine with dinner, but I've cut back on that lately. My daughter says it's better for me. I try to listen to her.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’re listening to your daughter. And lastly, how much alcohol do you drink in a typical week?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I've been cutting back. Used to have a glass or two of wine most nights with dinner. But now, maybe three or four glasses a week, if that. I don't drink liquor, just wine. And I don't drink every day. More on weekends, if I'm with my daughter. It's not a big amount, I don't think. I certainly don't feel like I have a problem with it. Is that enough detail, Doctor? I’m happy to tell you more if you need me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Now, Mr. Paske, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable or anything. I'm not as spry as I used to be, you know? But I’ll do my best. Where do you want me to start?
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute, and your rhythm is regular. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing on exhale. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… interesting. No, I don't have any history of asthma, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with bronchitis either. I did have a bit of a cough a few months back, during the winter, when everyone was getting sick. But it wasn’t too bad, just a little tickle in my throat. I thought it was just a cold. It cleared up on its own after a week or so. The wheezing… is that something to worry about? It’s not something I’ve ever noticed before. Is it connected to the tiredness, do you think? I'm starting to worry a bit now, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Your ears look clear, no signs of infection. Your throat is a little red, but no visible signs of infection. I do notice your tongue is slightly coated. The mild wheezing and the coated tongue, combined with your tiredness and the history of a recent cough, could suggest a few possibilities. It could be a lingering post-viral effect, or potentially a mild upper respiratory issue. However, given your age and the ongoing tiredness, we should rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray to get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… oh dear. Is that really necessary, Doctor? It sounds a bit… serious. And a blood test… I don’t mind the blood test, but the X-ray… I’ve never had one of those before. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose so. I want to get to the bottom of this tiredness, you know? It’s just… it’s starting to worry me. And my daughter… she'd want me to do whatever it takes. Yes, alright, Doctor. Let's do the tests. Just… please explain everything to me afterwards, okay? I don’t understand a lot of the medical terms. And tell me what to expect, with the X-ray, and the blood test. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Paske. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything thoroughly. A chest X-ray is a quick and painless procedure. You’ll simply stand in front of a machine, and it will take a picture of your lungs. It doesn't involve any radiation beyond what you're exposed to naturally in the environment. As for the blood test, we'll just need a small sample, and it will tell us about your overall health and rule out any underlying infections or deficiencies. I’m going to write up the orders for the lab and X-ray now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for scheduling the X-ray. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you continue using your CPAP machine as prescribed. Also, it's important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. If your tiredness worsens or you develop a fever, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s alright for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Continue using the CPAP… yes, I'll do that. And stay hydrated… that's good advice. I do drink a lot of coffee, though. Maybe I should switch to water. Just one thing… is this tiredness… could it be serious? I mean, am I looking at something really bad here? I hate to ask, but I need to know. It’s just… I’ve got things to do, you know? Grandchildren to see, books to read… I don’t want to be sick. And… how long will it take to get the results back? A day? A week? I'm a bit of a worrier, you see. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. It's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, Mr. Paske. I want to reassure you that it's unlikely to be something serious, but we're doing these tests to rule out any potential issues and get a definitive answer. The tiredness could be a number of things – a lingering effect of a previous illness, a mild respiratory problem, or even a vitamin deficiency. The lab results typically come back within 24 to 48 hours, and the X-ray report should be available within the same timeframe. Once I have the results, I'll contact you immediately to discuss them and create a plan of action. In the meantime, try not to stress too much. Focus on getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. And if you have any concerns or notice any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Now, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
