DOCTOR: Hi Pierce, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s…well, my skin. It’s darkening. And I feel terribly fatigued. It’s most inconvenient, you understand. I haven’t the energy for my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue… that is worth looking into, especially when it's impacting your energy levels. Let's start with the skin changes. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? It's…darker. It wasn't always this way, naturally. It's… all over, I suppose. I don’t pay close attention to such things. I work with iron, you know. Rebar. Perhaps it’s the sun. Though I do try to cover up. Really, I haven't the faintest idea why it’s happening. It's simply… a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, “a nuisance” we can definitely try to figure out. So, it's darkening all over, and you’ve noticed this recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Goodness, Doctor, how am I supposed to pinpoint a precise date? Months, perhaps? A few months, at least. Time…blurs when one is busy. It’s not as if I sit around cataloging the subtle shifts in my complexion. I have work to do. It’s… bothersome, is all. And tiring. Everything is tiring these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months. And you said everything is tiring. Is that fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. It's… a deep weariness. Not the sort one recovers from with a good night's sleep. It’s… pervasive. Makes focusing on the work… difficult. I find myself needing… frequent rests. An unacceptable situation, really. A man has a reputation to uphold, you understand. I am not accustomed to being… sluggish.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant fatigue, impacting your work. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the darkening skin and fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. My appetite… isn't what it once was. I haven’t much interest in food, to be frank. And… my joints ache a bit. Nothing debilitating, mind you, just… a general stiffness. Old age, perhaps? Though I’ve always been… robust. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t spend my days scrutinizing my body for ailments. It simply works, or it doesn’t. I expect you are paid to determine why it doesn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some joint stiffness. Thank you. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Goodness. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve had the usual…colds, perhaps. A touch of the flu here and there. Nothing serious. I've always prided myself on my health. A strong constitution, you see. No, I haven’t been “diagnosed” with anything of consequence. I assure you. I’ve never needed to be. Though my wife… she insisted on a check-up once. A waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so generally good health, no major past medical issues. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Absolutely not. I haven't the patience for such things. Lying on a table while someone…pokes around? Unthinkable. I've always avoided hospitals whenever possible. A breeding ground for germs, you know. No, I have never undergone a surgical procedure. And I intend to keep it that way. Now, is there anything useful we can discuss regarding my current predicament? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family history then. Do you know if any of your family members have had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, Doctor, my family is… extensive. And mostly… deceased. My parents… passed away long ago. I had several siblings, but I haven't spoken to most of them in decades. I couldn’t possibly tell you if anyone suffered from… what was your question again? Significant medical conditions? It was a very long time ago. And frankly, I wasn’t paying attention to their health. I was busy building a life for myself. Now, please, let's not dwell on the past. It’s irrelevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's alright if you don't have detailed family history information. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor. Do I look like the sort? I am a respectable man. I do not partake in such… debauchery. A glass of tea with dinner, perhaps. But alcohol, smoking, drugs? Absolutely not. I maintain a disciplined lifestyle. It's the key to longevity, you know. Now, are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply cataloging my personal habits? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol, smoking, or recreational drugs. Just tea. And yes, we are getting somewhere. Now, one last thing about your background. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor. None that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm a remarkably resilient individual. Honestly, this line of questioning is rather… unnecessary. I feel perfectly fine, all things considered. It's this… darkening and fatigue that's troubling. Perhaps if you focused on that instead of my tea-drinking habits, we might actually accomplish something. Now, are you going to examine me, or are we going to continue this pointless interrogation? I haven't got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. You’re right, let’s move on to the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with. Quickly, if you please. I have… commitments. And this chair is rather uncomfortable. I trust you’re thorough? I haven’t the patience for repeated visits. Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another… okay. Your heart sounds regular, a bit of a murmur, but not concerning for your age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I notice a diffuse darkening of the skin, particularly on your hands and face, as you mentioned. It doesn't seem to be localized to any one area. There’s also some dryness. Okay, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse now… Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Do you have any pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: A bit tender, perhaps. Not painful, exactly, just…sensitive. I do try to keep my skin moisturized, but it's difficult with the work I do. Iron dust, you know. Gets everywhere. It’s… uncomfortable. Now, what does all this mean? Am I ill? Because frankly, I haven’t the time for a lengthy convalescence. I have obligations. And this… examination is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness to the touch. I understand your concern. Based on what you’ve told me – the darkening skin, fatigue, decreased appetite, joint stiffness, and the tenderness – there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. Given your age and symptoms, one thing that comes to mind is hemochromatosis – a condition where the body absorbs too much iron. It can cause fatigue, skin darkening, joint pain, and other symptoms. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. Other things could be causing this, and we need to rule those out. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your iron levels, liver function, and blood sugar. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Good heavens. This is becoming… complicated. Iron levels? Is that related to my work? I handle iron, Doctor. It's hardly surprising if my system is… affected. But blood tests… it all sounds rather… intrusive. And time-consuming. Liver function? Now you're frightening me. I assure you, I live a temperate life. No excesses. Very well. If you insist. But I expect a swift turnaround. And a clear explanation of the results. No medical jargon, please. I haven't the patience for deciphering complicated reports. And if it turns out to be something minor, I expect an apology for the inconvenience. Now, where do I go for these…tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The tests are relatively quick, and we can get the results back in a few days. It's not necessarily anything to worry about, but it's important to rule things out. We'll get you a lab order. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The technician will take a small blood sample. I'll also have the nurse print out a sheet with clear instructions. And I promise to explain the results in plain language. No medical jargon, as you requested. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you stay hydrated and try to get some rest when you can. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I believe that will be all. Just… ensure the tests are expedited. My time is valuable, you understand. And please, no unnecessary alarm. I’ve lived a long life, and I intend to continue living it. One final thing… will this affect my ability to work? I have deadlines to meet, you see. And my reputation… it’s important. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ve wasted enough time here. Show me the way to this…lab.
DOCTOR: Of course. The lab is just through that door, second room on the left. The technician will take care of you. As for your ability to work, let's get the results first. It's hard to say at this point. Once we know what's going on, we can discuss whether any adjustments need to be made. Here's the lab order and instructions. Please let the nurse know if you have any trouble. Thank you for your patience, Pierce. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
