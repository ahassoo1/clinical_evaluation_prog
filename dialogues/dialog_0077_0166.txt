DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some…well, numbness in my leg. It's been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Numbness, you say. Alright. And how long exactly has it been going on, if you could recall?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, I believe, around the first week of June. So, roughly two months now. I can remember the exact date was June 6th, as it was the day after my cousin’s birthday party. I was helping him move some furniture, quite heavy things actually, and noticed it a little while after. It wasn’t terribly bothersome at first, just a slight tingling.
DOCTOR: June 6th... furniture moving... I see. And can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to explain precisely. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, not like it’s “gone”. It's more like… a constant tingling, almost like pins and needles. And sometimes it feels… cold. It's mostly in my left leg, running from my thigh down to my foot. Occasionally, I get a bit of it in my toes. It seems to come and go, but it’s usually there, at least a little.
DOCTOR: A tingling, pins and needles sensation, coldness, primarily in the left leg from thigh to foot, intermittent but generally present. Does anything seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… prolonged standing definitely makes it worse. And walking long distances, too. If I’m sitting for a while, it tends to ease up, though it never fully goes away. I also noticed it's worse when it’s cold outside, if that makes any sense. I work mostly indoors, creating animations, so it isn’t a huge problem, but when I do have to go out… it's noticeable.
DOCTOR: Prolonged standing, walking, cold weather… all potential factors. Have you experienced any weakness in that leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… that's a bit harder to say. It doesn’t feel completely weak, but sometimes my leg feels… heavier than usual. Like it takes more effort to lift it, especially when I’m tired. I wouldn’t say I’ve tripped or anything, but it's not quite as nimble as my other leg, if that makes sense. It's a subtle difference, honestly. I haven’t thought much of it until recently, when the numbness became more consistent.
DOCTOR: Heavier feeling, some difficulty with lifting… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel or bladder function? No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… normal in that regard, if you don't mind my asking why you bring that up. I understand you have to ask all sorts of things, but I wasn’t expecting that question, and I’m not sure I understand what that has to do with my leg.
DOCTOR: Of course, I apologize if that was unexpected. It's simply part of a thorough examination, to rule out any potential issues with the nerves in your spine that might be affecting your leg. We need to consider all possibilities. Now, let’s move on. Have you experienced any pain anywhere - back, neck, or even in the leg itself alongside the numbness?
PATIENT: Ah, I see. That makes sense. No, no pain, not really. Sometimes my lower back feels a little stiff after I’ve been sitting for a long time working, but I just assumed that was from posture. It’s never sharp or radiating, just a general… tightness. And no pain in the leg itself with the numbness; it’s purely a sensation of tingling and coldness, as I mentioned. It’s a rather strange feeling, honestly. I’ve never experienced anything like it before.
DOCTOR: No pain, just stiffness in the lower back after prolonged sitting. Alright. Now, do you have any past medical problems, or have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I’ve been quite healthy, all my life. No past medical problems or surgeries. I did break my wrist when I was a child, maybe eight years old, but it healed perfectly. Otherwise, nothing significant. I've always been pretty active, even though my job requires me to sit for hours. I make sure to get plenty of exercise when I'm not working.
DOCTOR: No past medical history or surgeries... good. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. And no allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. I drink a fair amount of coffee, if that counts, but that’s about it. I try to stay away from sugary drinks, otherwise.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, Mr. Kinjerski, it would be helpful if I could perform a quick physical examination. Just to assess your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Let me know if there's anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just lie down on your back, that would be perfect. I'll start with checking your reflexes. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, I'm going to test the reflexes in both legs. I'll be tapping on your tendons with this small hammer. This is completely normal, and shouldn’t cause any pain, just a brief, tapping sensation. Okay, relax your leg… good. And now the other leg… excellent. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. I'll ask you to resist as I try to move your leg. Can you press your heels into the bed, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. Pressing my heels into the bed now. Is this alright? It feels… normal so far.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Excellent resistance. And now, I want you to lift your left leg… keep it straight. Just lift it as high as you comfortably can. And now the right leg… good. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your legs with this… can you tell me when you feel the touch?
PATIENT: Okay, lifting my right leg now. Yes, I can feel it. Is this alright? I feel the touch perfectly fine, it feels… normal. Do you want me to say anything specific when I feel it?
DOCTOR: Good, good. Just let me know when you feel the touch, that's perfect. Alright, Mr. Kinjerski, everything appears to be structurally normal. Your reflexes are present and symmetrical. You have full range of motion. There is a slight decrease in sensation on the outer side of your left lower leg, compared to your right. You have some weakness when lifting your left leg against resistance, but it is subtle. Given your history and these findings, the most likely explanation is some mild compression of a nerve in your lower back or leg, possibly related to your posture or prolonged sitting. We call this sciatica, although it doesn't seem to be severe.
PATIENT: Sciatica? I’ve heard of that, but I didn’t think it would be… well, me. I spend a lot of time sitting, it’s true, but I try to maintain good posture. What does that mean, exactly? What can be done about it? And is it something serious? I suppose I should ask… will I need surgery?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned. Sciatica simply refers to pain radiating along the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down your leg. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious in your case, and surgery is very rarely required. In fact, the vast majority of cases resolve with conservative treatment. The slight decrease in sensation and weakness we observed could be due to the nerve being slightly irritated or compressed, likely from prolonged sitting or poor posture. We’ll want to rule out any other potential causes, but it doesn’t sound like anything alarming. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, I'd like you to focus on improving your posture, especially while sitting. We can get you some information on ergonomic setups for your workstation. Second, gentle stretching exercises can help relieve pressure on the nerve. I'll provide you with a handout outlining some specific stretches you can do at home. Third, over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage any discomfort. And finally, I want you to avoid any activities that exacerbate your symptoms. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Stretching and improving my posture… I can certainly work on that. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer, so an ergonomic setup is a good idea. I’ll try the pain relievers if needed. Would physical therapy be helpful, do you think? Perhaps someone could show me the correct way to stretch and strengthen my back muscles? I’m a little worried about making it worse if I do something incorrectly. And how long should I try these things before… before we consider other options?
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question. Physical therapy would be very beneficial. A therapist can assess your posture and muscle imbalances, and teach you specific exercises tailored to your needs. They can also help you avoid any movements that could aggravate your symptoms. I’m happy to write you a referral. As for how long to try these things, let's give it about four to six weeks of consistent effort – stretching daily, maintaining good posture, and using the pain relievers as needed. If you don't see any improvement after that time, or if your symptoms worsen, then we can consider other options, such as imaging – perhaps an MRI – to get a more detailed look at your lower back. But for now, let's focus on conservative treatment. We'll start with the referral to physical therapy and see how that goes. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you very much for your time and explanation. I feel much better knowing what might be going on, and having a plan of action. The referral to physical therapy is greatly appreciated. I'll schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, consistency is key with these things. I wish you all the best, and I hope to hear good news at your next appointment. Have a good day, and take care.
