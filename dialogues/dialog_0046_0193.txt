DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Glowka. Very nice to meet you as well. It is… a little embarrassing, honestly. I am here because of… well, too much gas. It is causing me some… discomfort. It has been happening for a while now, and I thought maybe you could help.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. There's absolutely no need to be embarrassed – gastrointestinal issues are very common, and we see patients for this quite often. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. "Discomfort" is a good starting point – can you describe that discomfort a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It is… a bloating feeling, mostly. Like I have too much air inside. And sometimes, it is… painful. Not a sharp pain, but… a heavy feeling. It happens after I eat, usually. It doesn’t matter what I eat, really. That is… puzzling, to me. I have tried to eat lighter foods, but it still happens. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, bloating and a heavy feeling, occurring after meals, and it doesn't seem to be linked to any specific food. That is a bit puzzling, as you said. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… maybe six months ago? It was very gradual. At first, it was just a little bit of extra air. I didn’t think much of it. But it slowly got worse… and worse. Now, it happens almost every time I eat a meal. It’s been… consistently bad for about three months, I would say. And it is… getting slightly more frequent, even with smaller meals.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset about six months ago, progressively worsening over the last three months, and now consistently occurring with most meals. That’s helpful information. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the bloating and discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Sometimes… my stomach makes noises. Loud noises. It is… quite embarrassing in public. And… I do feel a little tired, more than usual. Not extremely tired, but… sluggish. And occasionally, after a meal… a little bit of… well, diarrhea. But not always. It is… intermittent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, we have the bloating, discomfort, increased gas with audible noises, some fatigue, and intermittent diarrhea. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I have never been… sick, really. I have had a cold, of course. And a flu, once. But nothing… serious. I do not take any medications. And I do not have any… allergies that I know of. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose… measles, mumps, chickenpox… But that was many years ago. I have always been… a healthy person, until this started. It is… concerning, to me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Goodstein. No prior medical conditions, no medications, no known allergies. And you mentioned having typical childhood illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have always been fortunate, in that regard. I have never needed surgery. And I have… never been in the hospital. Not even when I was a child. I broke my arm once, playing football, but they just put it in a cast. It healed… perfectly. I am… not a fan of doctors, generally, but this… this is bothering me enough to come. I hope… you can help me.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s good to know, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on and find a solution. Now, a few questions about your family. Is there any history of gastrointestinal issues – like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease – in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother… she had some stomach trouble, sometimes. She would complain of… indigestion. But she never went to the doctor about it. And my father… he was always very strong. No stomach problems, as far as I know. My grandmother… she had some trouble swallowing, when she got older. But that was… old age, I think. No one that I recall… with something like… irritable bowel syndrome, or whatever you said. They were… mostly healthy people, too. It is… hard to say, really. We did not talk much about medical things. It was… not a habit in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some general stomach complaints in the family, but no specific diagnoses of gastrointestinal conditions. That's helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I have never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I do not drink alcohol. Not even a glass of wine. And I… certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I am a very… simple man. I eat, I sleep, I work. I try to live a… clean life. I work at the fast food restaurant. It is not glamorous, but it is honest work. And I try to eat… healthy, but it is difficult with the job. Sometimes… I have to eat what is available.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Non-smoker, no alcohol or recreational drug use. And you work at a fast food restaurant. That might be a factor we consider. Now, last few questions about your diet. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Usually, for breakfast… I have a piece of toast, and a cup of coffee. Sometimes… an egg, if I have time. For lunch… I usually eat at the restaurant where I work. A sandwich, usually. Or a burger. Whatever is quick. For dinner… I try to cook something at home. Maybe some chicken, and potatoes. Or some pasta. I eat… mostly simple foods. I do not eat a lot of… spicy things. Or… processed foods. But sometimes… it is hard to avoid them. With the work… and everything. I do drink a lot of water, though. I try to stay… hydrated. I hope… that makes sense. It is… not a very exciting diet, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like you have a fairly typical diet, with some challenges due to your work. Okay, let's do a brief physical exam. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness or masses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I understand… you need to do what you need to do. I just… hope you can find out what is wrong. It is… very frustrating, this gas. I will… try to relax. Please, tell me if you feel anything… unusual. I just want to… get back to feeling normal. It is… all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds. There is some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no masses or significant guarding. It doesn't seem acutely painful, but it is a bit sensitive to the touch. Heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms related to a functional gastrointestinal disorder. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests.
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? I am… a little nervous, to be honest. I do not… like doctors, and I do not… like tests. Are they… painful? Will they take a long time? I just want… a simple answer. Is it something serious? I hope… it is nothing too bad. I just want to… feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Goodstein. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about tests. They are not usually painful, and we will do everything to make you comfortable. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool sample for occult blood and infection, and a celiac disease screening panel. The complete blood count will check for any signs of infection or anemia. The metabolic panel looks at your kidney and liver function and electrolyte levels. The stool sample will rule out any bleeding or infection in your digestive tract. And the celiac disease screening is to see if you have an intolerance to gluten. It's a relatively simple blood test. These tests will help us narrow down the possible causes of your symptoms and determine the best course of action. They should take no more than 30 minutes at the lab, and the results usually come back in a few days. While we can’t rule anything out completely without these tests, based on your description, it doesn't sound like anything acutely serious. But it's important to be thorough. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a little better, I suppose. Thirty minutes… I can manage that. And you do not… think it is something terrible? That is… reassuring. The stool sample… that sounds… unpleasant. But if it helps… I will do it. And the blood test… I do not… like needles, but… I will try. You said it will take a few days? Can you… tell me when I should call for the results? And… what if something is wrong? What are the… possible things that could be wrong? I just want… to be prepared. It is… hard for me, to be nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Goodstein, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. It's always best to be prepared. I’ll write down the lab orders for you, with the address and phone number. The receptionist can also help schedule the appointment. Based on your history and exam, some possibilities include Irritable Bowel Syndrome , which causes bloating, gas, and changes in bowel habits. Another possibility is Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth , where there's an excess of bacteria in the small intestine. Less common, but we need to rule them out, are things like lactose intolerance or celiac disease. The stool sample and blood tests will help us determine which of these, if any, is the cause. I’ll call you in about five business days with the results. If you experience any worsening symptoms in the meantime—severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool—please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions about those conditions, or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: IBS… I have heard of that. My aunt… she had something like that. But she was… very different than me. She was… always complaining. I just have… the gas. And the tiredness. Is IBS… curable? Can you… treat it? And SIBO… what is that? Do I have to… take medicine? I do not… like medicine. And… if it is lactose intolerance, do I have to… stop eating dairy? I like cheese. It is… all very confusing. I just want… a simple answer. Please, tell me… what is the most likely thing that it is? If you had to… guess.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a simple answer, Mr. Goodstein, and I wish I could give you one right now. Unfortunately, without the test results, it's difficult to say definitively. IBS is a chronic condition, and there's no cure, but it’s very manageable with lifestyle changes – diet adjustments, stress reduction, and sometimes medication to help control symptoms. SIBO is an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, which can cause bloating, gas, and malabsorption. It is usually treated with antibiotics. And lactose intolerance means your body has trouble digesting lactose, the sugar in dairy products. If that’s the cause, reducing your dairy intake is usually helpful. If I had to guess based on what you’ve told me, I would say IBS is the most likely possibility. However, it's important to rule out the other causes first. It's also very common for people to have multiple contributing factors, and it often takes some time to figure out the best approach. We will start with the tests and go from there. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, eat smaller, more frequent meals, and manage your stress levels. Are you under a lot of stress at work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The work… it is stressful. The customers… they are not always nice. And the manager… she expects a lot. It is… a fast-paced job. And I have to… stand all day. It is… tiring. And… sometimes, I do not have time to… eat properly. It is… a difficult job. I just want… to find out what is wrong. And… get back to feeling normal. Please, tell me… when can I schedule the tests? And… do I need to… do anything special before the tests? Fast? Or… anything like that? It is… hard for me, to remember things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the stress at work is definitely a contributing factor. We’ll keep that in mind as we work to figure out what’s going on. The receptionist can schedule the tests for you right away. For the blood test, you don’t need to fast – just eat normally. For the stool sample, the lab will give you instructions on how to collect it. It’s a fairly simple process, and they can answer any questions you have. We’ll take things one step at a time. Once we have the test results, we’ll discuss them and develop a plan that’s right for you. I'm confident we can get you back to feeling normal. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, or shall I have the receptionist assist you with scheduling the tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all for now. Please, just… let me know when the results are in. And… thank you. You have… been very helpful. It is… reassuring to talk to someone who… understands. Please, have the receptionist… schedule the tests. And… thank you again. It is… much appreciated. I hope… this works.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I understand your anxiety, and I’m here to help in any way I can. I’m confident we’ll figure things out together. I’ll have the receptionist assist you with scheduling the tests. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, Mr. Goodstein. .
