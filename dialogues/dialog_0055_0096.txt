DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I am Dr. EADDY. It says here you're 32 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Arbin Komarov, that’s me. Thirty-two, sadly, though it feels like a lot longer sometimes. I’m here because… well, I’ve been having trouble with the sun. Really bothering me, it is.
DOCTOR: The sun, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's… hard to explain. It’s not a sunburn, not exactly. More like… my eyes really hurt when I’m outside, even with sunglasses. And my skin feels… sensitive, gets really red easily. It’s been happening for a few months now, getting worse each time. I used to be able to handle the sun just fine.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sensitive skin and light sensitivity… Are you experiencing any pain besides the discomfort in your eyes, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Well… not pain, exactly. More like a burning feeling sometimes, on my face and neck. It’s not constant, but when it happens, it’s pretty unpleasant. And… oh, this might sound silly, but things just seem brighter than they used to. Like, even inside, the lights bother me a bit more now. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: "Silly," is hardly the appropriate term, Mr. Komarov. We are attempting to ascertain a medical issue here. Now, have you noticed any changes to your vision at all?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry Doctor, didn’t mean to sound… unimportant. No, no changes to my vision exactly. Everything still looks clear, I can see fine. But… maybe things are a bit… washed out? Like the colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. It’s subtle, really hard to say. I haven’t really thought about it until you asked.
DOCTOR: Subtle changes… alright. And have you been experiencing any fatigue, or headaches accompanying this sensitivity?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And… come to think of it, I have been getting headaches, not every day, but maybe two or three times a week. They’re not terrible, just a dull ache, usually behind my eyes. I thought it was just stress, to be honest. It’s been a rough year…
DOCTOR: Stress is certainly a factor to consider, Mr. Komarov, but we must rule out other possibilities. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing chronic. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Just the usual childhood illnesses when I was little. Nothing major. I lost my wife last year, so I’ve been having regular check-ups with my family doctor, just to make sure everything was okay. He didn’t find anything, but… that was before all this started with the sun sensitivity. He said it was probably grief.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than routine matters?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And no hospital stays, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was just a cast and a few weeks of being clumsy. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky health-wise. I take a daily multivitamin, just to be safe. And… I did have a really bad flu a couple of years ago, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin, Doctor. And sometimes, if I get a really bad headache, I’ll take ibuprofen, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, to be honest. My wife… she always said they weren't a good idea unless you really needed them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with food or medicine. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife always joked I had a cast-iron stomach. That's about it, I think. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: One final question, Mr. Komarov. And please be thorough. Have you noticed any rashes, joint pain, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No rashes, no joint pain. And… no, I haven’t lost any weight. Actually, I think I might have gained a little, if anything. Comfort eating, I suppose. It’s been a difficult year. I don’t think I’ve been looking after myself very well. But… no unexplained weight loss, no. I just feel… tired, and sensitive to the sun. That’s about it. Do you think it could be stress, Doctor? Is that what you think?
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly exacerbate certain conditions, Mr. Komarov. However, based on your symptoms – the light sensitivity, the headaches, the subtle changes in vision – and to rule out more serious possibilities, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. It will include an eye exam and a neurological assessment. Will that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best, I’m happy to do whatever you need. I just want to figure out what’s going on. An exam sounds good. Is it… is it anything serious, Doctor? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It is best to be thorough, Mr. Komarov. Please follow me to the examination room. I assure you, it is premature to jump to any conclusions. We simply need to gather more information. Now, if you will please sit up on the examination table, and let us begin.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Lead the way. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I will assess your visual acuity. Can you read the letters on this chart, please, starting with your right eye?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Okay, let me see… uh… is that an 'E'? And then a… 'F'? I think. It’s a bit blurry, to be honest. It’s harder than I thought it would be. I think I’m going to need a moment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. We'll proceed with the left eye now. Do your best. Now, can you read the first line, please?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… um… that’s a ‘P’, then an ‘R’, and… is that a ‘D’? It’s still a bit fuzzy, Doctor. It's not as clear as it used to be, that's for sure. I think my left eye is a bit worse than my right. It’s hard to be certain though.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I will examine your pupils. Please look straight ahead. The pupils are… sluggish in their reaction to light. And there appears to be some mild pallor in the optic discs. I'm also noting a slight tenderness to palpation around the temples.
PATIENT: Tenderness? I haven't noticed that, Doctor. Maybe it's just the headaches. What does… what does “sluggish” mean? Is that bad? And what were you saying about the optic discs? I'm getting a bit worried now, if I’m honest. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: "Sluggish" refers to the speed at which your pupils constrict when exposed to light, Mr. Komarov. A normal reaction is brisk. Mild pallor refers to a slight paleness of the optic nerve. These findings, coupled with your reported symptoms of light sensitivity and headaches, warrant further investigation. While I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis at this time, your symptoms are atypical and require a more thorough workup to rule out potentially serious conditions.
PATIENT: "Potentially serious"? What kind of conditions, Doctor? Is it something to do with my brain? Or my eyes? Should I be calling my family? I... I'm really starting to panic now. What do you suggest we do?
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, please try to remain calm. It is premature to speculate on specific diagnoses. However, based on your symptoms, we need to consider conditions affecting the central nervous system, as well as potential ocular pathologies. To that end, I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and, most importantly, an MRI of the brain with and without contrast. Additionally, I am referring you to an ophthalmologist for a thorough eye examination. This will help us to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and formulate an appropriate treatment plan. We will discuss the results of these tests in detail once they are available. In the meantime, avoid direct sunlight as much as possible, and please contact my office immediately if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new neurological symptoms.
PATIENT: MRI…? That sounds… serious. Is it something really bad, Doctor? What are you thinking it could be? Is it… is it cancer? I... I don’t know if I can handle this. My wife… she… she had a bad illness. I don’t want to go through that again. I just want to know… is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, please allow me to reassure you. Ordering an MRI does not automatically mean you have a serious condition. It is a precautionary measure, a diagnostic tool that allows us to obtain a more detailed view of your brain and identify any potential underlying causes of your symptoms. While it is essential to consider all possibilities, including more serious conditions, it is equally important to remember that many less concerning issues can also cause similar symptoms. I understand your anxiety, especially given your past experience. However, it is crucial to remain hopeful and focus on obtaining a clear diagnosis so we can develop an appropriate treatment plan. We will proceed with these tests in a timely manner, and I will be available to answer any questions you may have along the way. For now, let us focus on obtaining the necessary tests and gathering more information. We will discuss the results in detail once they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Komarov. My staff will assist you with scheduling the necessary tests and arranging a consultation with the ophthalmologist. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. I wish you well. .
