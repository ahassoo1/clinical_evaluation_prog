DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Hatchard. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s this… stuff. My, well, you know. It’s black. Been happening for a bit now, and frankly, it’s worrying. I take those pain pills, the orange ones, every day for my arthritis, you see. Been on ‘em for years. Is that what this is about? I don’t have time for a lot of poking and prodding, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Stuff,” you say. Black… stool. Right. And you attribute this to your “orange pills” for arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, what else would it be? I eat perfectly normal. Meat and potatoes, mostly. Not one of those fancy diets, thank goodness. And I haven’t been feeling sick, just the… color. They’re naproxen, I think? Whatever the doctor gave me years ago. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I read things online, and it’s always something awful. But honestly, I doubt it's anything serious. It's probably just the pills.
DOCTOR: Online, you say. Yes, well, that’s often a mistake. Naproxen can cause gastrointestinal upset, yes, but black stool is rarely a benign finding. To clarify, how long exactly has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe a month ago? A month and a half? It wasn’t constant at first, just every now and then. But it’s been more frequent the last week or so. Honestly, I kept hoping it would just go away. I don’t make a fuss over little things, you know? But it’s… persistently dark. And I don’t need a lecture, Doctor. I know pills aren't good for you.
DOCTOR: A month and a half. Right. And you’ve noticed no other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I haven’t been vomiting or anything. A little tired, maybe, but I’m 73, Doctor! What do you expect? My joints ache, naturally. And my stomach… it’s a little rumblier than usual, perhaps. But nothing dramatic. Honestly, I just want to know if I need to stop taking the pills, or if I’m going to need some… tests. Though I really don’t have the patience for a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: “Rumblier than usual.” And any change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, not really. I eat the same amount as always. Maybe I don't feel like a huge steak these days, but that’s just getting older. I still enjoy my food. Though, now that you mention it… I have been a little… sluggish, I suppose. But that could be anything. Honestly, I'm a practical woman, Doctor. I don’t sit around analyzing every little feeling. Is this going to take long? I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Sluggish… Right. Very well. I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. We need to check your abdomen and, unfortunately, a rectal exam will be necessary to determine the source of the melena. It’s standard procedure. Don’t make a fuss, Mrs. Hatchard; it will be quick.
PATIENT: A… a what now? Absolutely not! I am not… I don’t even… Are you serious? I came in here because my stool is a funny color, and now you want to… poke around? No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ll just stop taking the pills, thank you very much. I don't need any of that nonsense. I’m a perfectly healthy woman, aside from the arthritis, and I’m not going to be subjected to… that. Really. I think I'll just go. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Hatchard. As you wish. However, I must strongly advise against self-treating and urge you to reconsider. Discontinuing medication without proper medical guidance can be… detrimental. I am documenting your refusal of a necessary examination. I will provide a referral to a gastroenterologist should you change your mind. Have a… pleasant day. .
