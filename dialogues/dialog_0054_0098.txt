DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I just kinda wanted to check things out, you know? I ain't really sick sick. Just… curious, I guess. Been meaning to get a check-up for a while now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Demondre. Preventative care is excellent. It's good you're thinking about this now. "Checking things out" is a good reason to come in. To get a better idea of your overall health, let’s start with a little bit of your medical history. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. Work’s work, you know? Long days on the water, but I can handle it. No big aches or pains or nothin’ like that. I get tired, but that’s normal, right? Being on a ship and all. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Probably since I got divorced, honestly. Everything was kinda hectic then.
DOCTOR: I understand. Long days on the water can be tiring, and life events certainly throw things off. It's good you're prioritizing your health now. Since it’s been a while, let’s try to cover a few things. Just to be thorough. To start, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. When I was a little kid, I had chickenpox, I think. And I broke my arm once, fallin’ outta a tree. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing serious since then. No surgeries, no nothin’. Just the usual colds and stuff, you know? Nothing that sent me to the hospital or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… uh… my mom's still around, she's okay. A little high blood pressure, I think, but she goes to the doctor regular. My dad… he passed away a few years back. He worked on ships too, like me. He had some trouble with his lungs, coughin’ a lot towards the end. And I got a sister, she lives in the city, I don't see her much. She seems alright, far as I know. She always was the healthy one.
DOCTOR: I see. Lung trouble in your father is good to know, especially given your profession. We’ll want to keep that in mind. Do you know if he had anything specifically diagnosed, like COPD or emphysema?
PATIENT: Uh… honestly, I don’t. Nobody really talked about it much. Just that he coughed a lot and got tired easily. He just… slowed down, you know? He didn’t go to the doctor much either. Old school, kinda stubborn. He just figured it was part of gettin’ old and workin' hard. Sorry, I wish I knew more. It wasn't something we really talked about.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Demondre. It’s common for those details to be unclear. We can still work with what you know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, sir, never. My dad smoked a little when I was a kid, but it always smelled awful. And he always coughed so much… I just never wanted to start. I drink sometimes, a beer or two with dinner, but nothin’ crazy. And I try to eat okay, when I can. It's hard on a ship, lots of processed stuff, but I try to get some fruits and vegetables when we dock.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the smoking, and moderate alcohol use is fine. And I understand the challenges of eating healthy on a ship. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Just a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. But that’s it. Nothing the doctor prescribed, nothin’ like that. I usually just try to get what I need from my food, when I can. I ain't one for takin' a bunch of pills if I can help it. I figure a little sunshine and fresh air is better than anything you can buy in a bottle.
DOCTOR: I agree – a healthy lifestyle is often the best medicine. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. I get mosquito bites like everybody else, but that’s just itchy, nothin’ serious. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, honestly. My sister’s got some food allergies, but I don't think that runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything you are particularly concerned about today?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I get this little pain in my chest, kinda like a muscle ache. It doesn't last long, and it doesn't happen often. But I was wonderin' if I should mention it. It just kinda comes and goes, and I figured it was probably just from liftin' heavy stuff on the ship. But I thought it was better to be safe than sorry. It ain’t worryin’ me too much, but… just figured I should tell you.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you to mention it, Demondre. It’s always best to be thorough. Chest pain, even if it’s mild and infrequent, is something we need to investigate. To get a better understanding, can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. It's kinda in the middle of my chest, sometimes feels like it’s spreadin’ to my left arm a little. It usually happens after a long day of workin', liftin' crates and stuff. And it doesn't last long, maybe five or ten minutes, then it goes away. I can still breathe okay, and it doesn’t hurt to move, not really. But it kinda makes me feel… uneasy, you know? Like somethin' ain’t right. It doesn’t happen every day, maybe once or twice a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, Demondre. That's helpful information. It sounds like it could be musculoskeletal, related to the physical demands of your job, but given the location and the fact that it radiates to your arm, we'll need to rule out anything more serious. To do that, I'd like to perform a physical exam, including listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling around for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I trust your judgment. I ain’t scared of a little check-up. Just want to make sure everything's okay, you know? I got a lot of work to do, and I need to be in good shape. Let’s get to it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's a good attitude. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this time. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out... again... and again. Your lungs sound clear, good air movement on both sides. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do detect a very faint murmur. It’s subtle, but we'll want to investigate that further. Now, I’m going to gently feel around your chest to check for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Just feels… normal. A little sore, maybe, from all the work, but nothin' sharp. That’s probably just my muscles, Doc. I’m used to bein’ a little beat up. That murmur… is that bad? I ain’t heard nothin’ about that before. Everything always sounded fine to me, at least. I ain't one for payin' much attention to my body, if you know what I mean. I just kinda push through it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people don't notice murmurs unless they're specifically listening for them. It's not necessarily a sign of a serious problem, but it warrants further investigation to rule out any underlying issues. It could be a completely benign functional murmur, or it could be something more that needs attention. Your pulses are strong and regular. Now, just to complete the exam, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back. Your abdomen sounds normal, no tenderness or unusual sounds. Okay, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I’d like to order a few tests just to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Tests are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I trust your judgment. I just wanna make sure everything's okay, so I can keep workin'. What kinda tests are we talkin' about? Blood work? X-rays? I ain’t scared of needles, not really, but I gotta know what to expect. And how long it's gonna take to get the results? I got a ship to catch, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand you have commitments. We'll keep things as efficient as possible. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check your overall health, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, and an EKG to assess your heart's electrical activity. We'll also get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, especially given your history and the murmur. The blood work and EKG can be done here in the clinic today. The chest X-ray can be scheduled at the imaging center down the street. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. We can discuss them over the phone, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment if you prefer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. 24-48 hours is fine. I can wait that long. I’d prefer a phone call if you don’t mind. Easier for me to schedule around work that way. And I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly. Some doctors just tell you what's wrong, without tellin' you why. You seem like you actually care. So, let’s get these tests done, then. Just let me know when you’re ready, and I'll get changed if I need to. Thanks again, Doc.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. I believe in keeping patients informed and involved in their care. That's my priority. Alright, let's get started with the blood work. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw a few vials of blood. Just relax, and it will be over before you know it. For the EKG, we'll just have you lie on a table and attach some small sensors to your chest. It's a quick and painless procedure. I'll have the nurse come in and explain the process in more detail. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: Nope, I think I'm good, Doc. You explained everything pretty well. Just gonna relax and get it over with. Appreciate your help. I trust you know what you're doin’. Let’s get to it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the nurse come in now. Thank you for coming in today, Demondre. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
