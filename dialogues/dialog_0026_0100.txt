DOCTOR: Good morning, Lytisha. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, honestly, it’s a bit of a blur. Something about a test? A screening, I think they said on the phone. My memory ain't what it used to be, you see. It's for... work, I believe. Something they need me to do for the job.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lytisha. Many things can affect memory. A work screening, yes. That sounds right. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit more about why your work is requesting this screening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking… I operate… big machines. For roads, you know? Paving and such. It’s… safety, I suppose. They want to make sure I’m… alert. That’s the word. I handle a lot of heavy equipment, and I wouldn’t want to… well, you get it. It’s been a few years since I started this job, though. Everything’s a bit fuzzy. I think they just started requiring this recently? I don’t rightly remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. So it’s a safety screening related to operating heavy machinery. And it’s fairly new. Let’s see… the record here shows a baseline physical a few years ago, but nothing specific about a cognitive or alertness assessment. To get started, could you tell me about any changes you've noticed lately – anything at all?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, I do get… tired easier. And I sometimes… misplace things. Keys, mostly. Or I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there. Little things, really. Nothing major, I don’t think. My husband… well, he passed a few years back, and I reckon that’s been hard on me. Maybe it’s just that. It’s hard to say. I try not to dwell on it too much, you know? Life goes on. I just want to keep working, if I can. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and grief can certainly affect memory and energy levels. It’s good you’re staying active, that’s very important. These little things you’re describing – the fatigue, misplacing keys, forgetting why you went into a room – those are things we should explore a bit further. To get a better understanding, let's do a quick review of your overall health. Have you had any other medical issues in the past – any serious illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, maybe twenty years ago now. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder – silly me! Nothing too serious, though. Mostly just aches and pains, you know? Old age creeping up on me. I see the doctor for my blood pressure, sometimes it gets a little high. And… I think I had pneumonia a few years back, but that was just a bad cold, really. I don't usually bother the doctors unless it’s really bad. I try to tough things out. Honestly, I can’t recall much else. Everything’s a bit of a muddle these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Hypertension, so we’re monitoring your blood pressure. And a history of pneumonia. Do you recall what medications you're currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you're asking the hard questions! I think… just a little white pill for my blood pressure. It's… amlodipine, maybe? I think that's the name. My daughter helps me fill the bottles, so I don't always pay attention. And sometimes I take something for aches and pains, but it's just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Ibuprofen, I think. Nothing fancy. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. It just makes me feel… cloudy.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. That's helpful. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies… Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I eat pretty much anything. I do get a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just from spicy food. My husband used to make a wonderful jambalaya, but it always gave me indigestion. But that’s not an allergy, just a… sensitivity, I suppose. I can’t think of anything I’m actually allergic to. Is that alright? Should I be?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lytisha. No known allergies is good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried it once or twice, but I wouldn’t let him near it. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, not since my husband passed. He liked a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I never cared for it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I’m a simple woman. I like my garden and my church. That’s about it. I do drink coffee, though. A cup or two in the morning. Is that alright? I hope that doesn’t cause any problems. It's the only thing that gets me going these days!
DOCTOR: A cup or two of coffee is perfectly fine, Lytisha. No concerns there at all. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I usually wake up around seven, though I’m not always the best at getting right up. I have my coffee, and maybe a little something to eat. Then I work in my garden for a bit, if the weather’s nice. I have a pretty big garden, lots of tomatoes and peppers. Then I go to work, operate the big machine, pave some roads. It's hard work, but I like it. I come home, fix myself dinner, maybe watch a little TV. And then I go to bed. It's a simple life, but I like it. I usually try to get to church on Sunday, too. It keeps me grounded. It's just… lately I've been feeling a little more tired than usual, and a little more forgetful. That's why I'm here, I suppose. I want to make sure I can still do my job safely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to help any way I can. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm not too fond of doctors, if I'm honest, but I understand it's necessary. I just want to get this over with and find out what's going on. I just want to keep working, if I can. It keeps me busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Lytisha. I'll explain everything as we go, and we'll take things at your pace. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your pulse is a little elevated at 78, but that could be from being a little anxious about the exam. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Your reflexes are normal. And finally, I'll just check your ears and throat. Your ears and throat look clear. Overall, physically, everything seems within normal limits. Now, I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good. Everything seems fine, you say? That's a relief. A cognitive assessment… hmm. Is that going to be hard? I'm not very good at tests, you know. My mind doesn't work like it used to. But if you think it's necessary, I'll try my best. Just be patient with me, alright? And explain everything clearly. I get confused easily these days.
DOCTOR: It won’t be hard at all, Lytisha. It's just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. It's not a pass or fail test, just information to help me understand what's going on. And I will absolutely be patient with you, and explain everything clearly. First, could you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Today is… um… August…? Is it the second? Yes, I think it’s August 2nd. 2025, right? I think so. I try to keep track, but sometimes the days just… blur together. I hope I got that right. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Lytisha. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… now you're asking… Hmm. That’s a tricky one. We're… out in the country, aren’t we? Is it… Mill Creek? No… I always get them mixed up. Is it… Harmony? Oh dear, I’m so sorry. I know we’re somewhere rural, but I can’t seem to remember the name of the town. It’s on the tip of my tongue… But it's just not coming to me. Is that alright? I feel so foolish.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Lytisha. These things happen. It's not a test to trick you. We’re in Harmony, you’re right on the edge of remembering. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. I’ll say them slowly, and then I’ll ask you to remember them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I think so. Three words… Yes. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. I just hope I can remember them. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. But I’ll give it a shot. Please go slowly, alright?
DOCTOR: The three words are: apple, table, penny. Try to remember those. Take your time. And don't worry if you don't get them all. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. What year did World War II end?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… World War II… That was a long time ago! Let me think… Hmm… I remember my father talking about it… Was it… 1945? Yes, I think it was 1945. Is that right? I’m not very good with dates, you know. I remember the events, but not the years. Is that alright? Should I have known that?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly correct, Lytisha. 1945 is right. Very good. Now, can you count backwards from 100 by 7s?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re really testing me! By 7s… That's… hard. Let me think… 100, 93… 86… 79… Oh dear, I’m getting confused. 72… 65… I think… Is that right? I’m losing track. This is harder than it looks! I’m so sorry. I just can’t seem to keep it straight. Should I stop?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lytisha. It's perfectly okay to stop. You've done very well. Now, let’s go back to those three words I asked you to remember. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Three words… Let me think… Apple… I think… and… Oh dear, it’s on the tip of my tongue… A table… yes, I remember a table. And… something shiny… a… a coin? A nickel? No… a penny! Yes, I think it was apple, table, and penny. Did I get them right? I’m so sorry if I missed one. My mind is just… foggy these days.
DOCTOR: You remembered two of them correctly – apple and table. Penny was close – it was indeed penny. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your orientation. Do you know what day of the week it is today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… day of the week… Let me think… Is it… Tuesday? No, that doesn’t feel right… Is it… Friday? No… Oh dear, I’m so confused. I know it’s close to the weekend… Is it… Wednesday? I always get them mixed up. I’m so sorry. My mind is just… not working properly today. Is that alright? I feel so foolish.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Lytisha. Many people have difficulty with the days of the week. Based on the assessment, you are experiencing some mild cognitive impairment, particularly with short-term memory and orientation. It's not alarming, but it does warrant further investigation. Given your symptoms and the results of the assessment, I recommend a few things. First, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. Second, I’d like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Blood work and a neurologist… That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I’m not very good with doctors, you know. I get anxious easily. Is it something I did? I try to take care of myself, you know. I eat healthy and I get enough sleep. Is it… bad? I just want to keep working, if I can. It keeps me busy, you know? I don’t want to lose my job. I need to know what’s going on. What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel anxious, Lytisha. Let me assure you, it doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. These tests are simply to get a clearer picture of what's going on and rule out any potential causes for your memory and orientation issues. The blood work will check for things like vitamin deficiencies – particularly B12 – thyroid problems, and other common conditions that can affect cognitive function. The neurologist will perform a more in-depth assessment of your memory, thinking skills, and overall neurological health. They may use tests like brain imaging to get a clearer picture. It's possible there's a simple explanation, like a mild vitamin deficiency or a side effect of medication. Or, it could be something else entirely. But it's important to find out, so we can develop a plan to address it. Regarding your job, it’s unlikely this is something that would immediately prevent you from working. However, depending on the results, we may need to discuss some modifications or accommodations to ensure your safety and well-being. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… a little less scary, I suppose. Vitamin deficiency… yes, that could be it. I do try to eat healthy, but maybe I’m not getting enough of something. And brain imaging… that sounds… intimidating. But if it helps, I suppose. Modifications… yes, I understand. I wouldn’t want to put anyone at risk, you know? Safety is important. So, blood work and a neurologist… and then we’ll see what happens? What if it is something serious? What are my options? And will my insurance cover all of this? I have Medicare, you know. I worry about the cost. I'm a widow, and I have to be careful with my money.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lytisha. It’s good to be prepared and ask questions. Let's take things one step at a time. First, we’ll get the blood work done. That will give us a good baseline. The neurologist will then schedule a comprehensive assessment. If the tests reveal something more serious, such as early signs of dementia or another neurological condition, there are several options available. These may include medication to manage symptoms, therapies to improve cognitive function, and lifestyle changes to support brain health. We’ll discuss all the options with you in detail if that happens. Regarding your insurance, Medicare typically covers these types of tests and evaluations. However, it's always best to confirm with your insurance provider to understand your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. I have a referral coordinator here at the clinic who can help you with that process, if you’d like. They’re very familiar with Medicare coverage and can navigate the paperwork for you. Does that help ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That does help, thank you. A referral coordinator… that would be wonderful. I’m not very good with paperwork, you know. I get confused easily. So, blood work first, then the neurologist, and the referral coordinator will help with the insurance. What about driving? I drive to work every day. If something is wrong with my brain… should I be driving? I wouldn't want to put anyone at risk. That worries me. And I like my independence, you know. I don't want to lose that. It’s a long drive, and it would be hard to get to work if I couldn’t drive. I feel… a little overwhelmed, to be honest. But I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s good to know you’re here to help.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Lytisha, and a valid concern. Driving is a significant responsibility, and we need to ensure your safety and the safety of others. Until we have the results of the neurological evaluation, I recommend that you avoid driving, especially long distances. It's best to err on the side of caution. We can discuss alternative transportation options in the meantime, such as having a family member drive you or utilizing public transportation if available. I'm writing down a referral for the neurologist, and I’ll also include the contact information for the referral coordinator. They can help you schedule the appointment and navigate the insurance process. Here is the information. Please contact them at your earliest convenience. We will schedule a follow-up appointment with me once you've had the neurological evaluation, so we can discuss the results and develop a plan. Remember, we're taking things one step at a time. We don't have all the answers yet, and it's important not to jump to conclusions. We'll work together to figure out what's going on and ensure your well-being. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I think that’s everything, thank you. You’ve been very helpful, and you’ve eased my mind a little. It’s good to know you’re here to help. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and explain everything so clearly. It’s hard to remember things these days, and I worry about forgetting important details. But you’ve been very patient with me. I’ll contact the referral coordinator and schedule the appointment with the neurologist. And I’ll avoid driving until I know what’s going on. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your kindness and understanding. I think… I think I’ll go home now. And try to relax. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lytisha. It was my pleasure to meet you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. Take care of yourself, and try to relax. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, Lytisha.
