DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's a bit... complicated. My daughter, she wants a baby. And she thought… she thought I should come talk to someone first. About… things. Before she tries. I don't really know what I need to talk about, to be honest. It's been a long time since… well, since any of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It's very thoughtful of your daughter, and it's perfectly alright if you're not sure where to begin. It is a lot to think about. It sounds like she's considering starting a family, and she wants to make sure everything is as healthy as possible – which is wonderful. So, let’s just take things slowly. When you say "things," are you thinking about your own health, perhaps things that might affect a pregnancy, or are you worried about something else?
PATIENT: Hmm… my health, I think. Yes. It's been… a while. I haven’t really been to a doctor in years. I used to be pretty strong, working, you know, traveling… Sales Engineers, that was my job. Lots of walking, lots of… everything. But that was a long time ago. I don’t know if… if I'm still good. Is that what she wants to know? If I'm… healthy enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what she wants to know, and it’s a very reasonable concern. It’s great she's thinking ahead. And don’t worry about it being a long time since you’ve seen a doctor. We’ll just take a thorough look and see where we stand. Let's start with some basics. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure… maybe? The doctor mentioned something once, a long time ago, when I was still traveling. But he gave me some pills, and I took them for a bit, and then… I stopped. I can't really remember why. Everything is a bit… fuzzy. No diabetes, I don't think. And my heart… I feel okay. I get a little breathless sometimes, walking up hills, but that's just… old age, right? I don't know about anything else. I haven’t been really sick sick in years. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. It's not uncommon for things to be a little fuzzy with time. The high blood pressure is something we’ll definitely want to check, and we can look into why you stopped taking the medication. And getting breathless walking up hills is good to know – we’ll take that into consideration. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not really. Sometimes, if my knees bother me, I take… I don’t even know what it’s called. Some sort of painkiller. The little white pills. But I don’t take them often. Maybe once a month, if that. And nothing else. I try to… avoid taking things, if I can. My mother always said, "Too much medicine is worse than the sickness." Something like that, anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s a good philosophy, and it's wise to be cautious. We’ll definitely respect that. Okay, so no regular medications. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Surgeries… I think so. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And… maybe my appendix? I can’t really remember. It was a blur. Lots of white walls and… pain. And… I think I was in the hospital once, when I broke my arm. I was climbing a tree. It's all so long ago. I’m sorry. I’m not very helpful, am I? Everything is just… a bit of a fog.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Verrall. It is a long time ago, and it's perfectly normal to not remember every detail. We'll try to piece things together. Tonsils and appendix, okay. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your parents or siblings might have had?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. She was always tired, and she… she died when I was young. But I don't really know what she died of. Nobody really talked about it. And my father… he was strong, a farmer. But he had trouble with his stomach, I think. Always complaining. My sister… she was healthy, as far as I know. But we didn't see each other much. She moved away. I don't know about her family, if she had any problems. It's… complicated. We didn't keep in touch. I’m not sure if that helps. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Heart problems with your mother, and stomach trouble with your father – we'll keep those in mind. It’s alright that you don't have all the details. We’ll work with what we have. Now, before we do a physical exam, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don't like smoking. Always smelled bad. My father used to smoke, though. A pipe. He always smelled of… burnt leaves. He used to sit outside, looking at the fields. It made my eyes water. I always went inside. No, I've never smoked. And I don’t drink much either, just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Very rarely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, very little alcohol. Now, Mr. Verrall, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s not too bad. I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take it slow and easy. It’s just a routine check-up to get a baseline. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright? I don’t… I don’t breathe very well sometimes. Especially when I’m walking up hills.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. I am listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to being a bit nervous, or simply from talking. Your lungs sound… a little diminished in some areas. I'll need to listen more carefully. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit high, 145 over 90. That’s something we’ll need to monitor. Now, let’s take a look at your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. High blood pressure… like the doctor said before? I remember him mentioning that once. The pills… I can’t remember why I stopped taking them. It’s all so fuzzy. Are you going to… hit my knees with something? I’ve seen that in movies. It looks… painful.
DOCTOR: No, I won’t be hitting your knees! I’m just going to use this little hammer to check your reflexes. It’s a very gentle tap. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon with age. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears and throat. Open your mouth and say "Ah." Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little dry, but nothing concerning. Now, let’s just feel your abdomen. Please lie back. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the lower right quadrant. Nothing majorly concerning, but we'll keep an eye on it. And finally, I’m going to check your pulse in your feet.
PATIENT: Okay… Tender… where? On the right side? I sometimes get a… a strange feeling there. Like a… a dull ache. It comes and goes. I thought it was just… old age. It feels… a little cold, doesn't it? My feet. I always have cold feet. My wife used to make fun of me. She said I needed socks, even in summer. Is everything alright, Doctor? You’re very quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verrall, everything seems… within reasonable limits for your age, but there are a few things I want to investigate further. Your pulse is a little weak in your feet, and your abdomen is tender in the lower right quadrant, as you mentioned. Your lungs also sound diminished. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood work and a urine sample. The blood work will check your kidney function, liver function, and look for any signs of infection. The urine sample will check for any urinary tract infection. I’d also like to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. Blood work, urine sample, chest X-ray. That sounds… a lot. Is it something serious, Doctor? I’m… I’m not very good with hospitals. And all those tests… it makes me nervous. My wife… she always took care of all that. I just want to… make sure my daughter can have a healthy baby. Is there anything… anything wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. These tests are just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong. We’re just being thorough. The diminished lung sounds could be due to a number of things—everything from mild congestion to something a bit more significant. The tenderness in your abdomen could be something simple like constipation, but we want to rule out anything more serious. And the weak pulse in your feet could be due to poor circulation. I don’t want to worry you unnecessarily, but it’s important to address these things. These tests will give us the information we need to make the right decisions. We'll get these tests scheduled as quickly as possible. I will also give you a referral to a cardiologist just to get their opinion on the pulse in your feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… a cardiologist. Okay. Everything you say… I trust you, Doctor. It’s just… a lot to take in. My daughter… she wants this so much. I want to be healthy for her. And for the baby. When do I… when do I have to do these tests? And… will it hurt? I really don’t like needles. I always faint.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Verrall. It is a lot to take in, and it's alright to be worried. Let’s get this organized. For the blood work, we can schedule that for tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. It usually takes about 30 minutes. And for the urine sample, you can collect that at home and bring it with you to the lab tomorrow. As for the chest X-ray, we can schedule that for Friday morning at the imaging center down the hall. It’s a very quick procedure—just a few seconds. And about the needles… I know you’re nervous about them. We’ll take it very slow and easy. The phlebotomist at the lab is very experienced with patients who are anxious about needles. They can also use a numbing cream if that would help. And if you feel faint, just let them know immediately. They're prepared to handle that. We can also have someone stay with you during the blood draw, if you like. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Tomorrow, Friday… blood work, urine sample, X-ray. And the cardiologist… you’ll arrange that? My daughter… she can come with me, can’t she? For the tests? I… I think I’ll need someone with me. And… thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very kind. I hope… I hope everything is alright. For the baby.
DOCTOR: Of course, your daughter can absolutely come with you to all the tests. Having someone there for support is a very good idea. And you are very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I’m here to help in any way I can. I will have my nurse schedule the appointment with the cardiologist and give you all the details before you leave. They will also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the tests. We'll get these tests done and see what the results show. Don't worry too much. We'll take things one step at a time. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain—please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll… I’ll see you tomorrow. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It was nice meeting you. I’ll see you tomorrow. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
