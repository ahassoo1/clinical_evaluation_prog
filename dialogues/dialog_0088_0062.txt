DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Piet. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue, and I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and I am hoping to discuss a possible exemption.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. I understand you're seeking a medical exemption from the mask requirement at your workplace. Let’s gather some information to see if that’s appropriate. First, can you tell me a little more about why you're requesting an exemption?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it isn’t a matter of…disagreement with the practice, Doctor. It is simply that I experience some…difficulty breathing when my face is covered for extended periods. It causes a feeling of…constriction, and honestly, a bit of panic. I work with vulnerable people, and I want to be able to perform my duties effectively, and safely for everyone involved. I’ve tried different types of masks, but the sensation remains the same. It’s…uncomfortable, to say the least. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything related to this, if that is what you are asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it sounds like wearing a mask is causing you some shortness of breath and anxiety. And you haven’t been evaluated by another doctor for this specifically?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. I have not. I’ve been…hesitant to seek medical attention for it, truthfully. I didn’t want to appear as though I was trying to avoid a reasonable safety precaution. It started gradually, and I hoped it would resolve on its own. But it hasn’t, and my employer is now requiring documentation for an exemption. That is why I am here today, seeking your professional opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to explore this a bit further to determine the best course of action. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the breathing difficulty and anxiety when wearing a mask?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Occasionally, I’ve noticed a bit of dizziness, Doctor. Not severe, but enough to feel…off-balance. And sometimes, my heart races a little. It’s usually fleeting, and subsides when I remove the mask. But it does accompany the other symptoms on occasion. I also get a bit of…sweating, and a mild headache. Though, I am prone to headaches generally, so I wasn't sure if that was related.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, a racing heart, and some sweating alongside the breathing difficulty, anxiety, and occasional headache. Do you have any history of asthma, COPD, or other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I have been, thankfully, quite healthy my entire life. I do not have any history of asthma, COPD, or any other lung conditions. I've always been physically active, and have good stamina. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and the job requires a certain level of physical ability, as you might imagine. I passed all the required medical evaluations for that position with no issues.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No heart conditions either. I have had regular check-ups over the years, and my heart has always been strong and healthy. My blood pressure is usually quite good, and I haven’t ever been diagnosed with any arrhythmias or anything of that nature. I pride myself on taking care of my health, so I am usually pretty aware of any changes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not currently taking any medications. I have not required any prescription drugs for quite some time. I do take a daily multivitamin, and occasionally some over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, as I mentioned, but that is all. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, if that makes sense. I believe in allowing my body to heal naturally, when it can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any known allergies. I've never experienced any allergic reactions to medications, foods, or anything else, as far as I am aware. I can eat pretty much anything without issue, and have never had a rash or difficulty breathing after consuming something new. My family has always been quite fortunate in that regard. It seems we are not prone to allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any instances of heart disease, lung problems, or anxiety disorders in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. On my mother’s side, my grandfather had some heart trouble later in life, but it was attributed to age and lifestyle choices, I believe. As for lung problems, no, not that I am aware of. My mother and her siblings were all very healthy. On my father’s side… My father’s brother struggled with anxiety for many years, but it was never formally diagnosed. He mostly managed it on his own. Other than that, no significant family history of heart or lung problems, as far as I know. We weren't a family that spoke much about health concerns, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone currently, and I don’t smoke, nor have I ever. I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned, with regular exercise and a balanced diet. I am retired from the military, and now work as a Protective Service Worker, assisting vulnerable individuals in the community. It is a fulfilling, though sometimes stressful, profession. I do not use any recreational drugs. I have always been a rather disciplined person, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like the mask is triggering some physiological responses – anxiety, shortness of breath, racing heart – without a clear underlying medical cause. To rule out anything serious, I would like to do a quick physical exam. Specifically, I want to listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and assess your oxygen saturation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for a thorough examination, and I am happy to cooperate in any way that I can. Listening to my lungs and heart, checking my blood pressure, and assessing my oxygen saturation – yes, please, go right ahead. I appreciate your diligence. I want to be certain we are covering all bases.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130/80. Not bad. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs or abnormal rhythms detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. Oxygen saturation is 98%, which is excellent. Okay, everything sounds normal on this quick exam. However, to be completely thorough, I think it would be beneficial to get an EKG, just to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. Also, given your reported anxiety, a basic blood panel to check your thyroid and vitamin levels might be worthwhile. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. That sounds very sensible, and I agree wholeheartedly. An EKG and a basic blood panel to check my thyroid and vitamin levels – yes, please. I want to be certain we are addressing everything. I trust your professional judgment, and I am happy to undergo whatever tests you deem necessary. I would feel much more confident with a more comprehensive assessment. When can we schedule those?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Let me get those orders entered for you. We can get you scheduled for an EKG and blood draw tomorrow morning at 8 am. The blood draw will take about 15-20 minutes, and the EKG will only be a few minutes. Here are your requisition forms. Please take these to the lab tomorrow morning. They are located just down the hall. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I would advise you to continue to avoid wearing a mask if it's causing you significant discomfort. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is perfectly clear. Tomorrow at 8 am for the EKG and blood draw, and then a follow-up appointment once the results are available. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. And thank you for taking my concerns seriously. I appreciate your time and attention. I do not believe I have any further questions at this moment. I will see you then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. I'll have my nurse schedule that follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Just to reiterate, we're ruling out any underlying cardiac or thyroid issues, and checking your vitamin levels. If your symptoms worsen before your follow-up, or if you experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any work restrictions I should document for your employer while we await results?
PATIENT: That is very thoughtful of you, Doctor. No, I do not require any formal work restrictions at this time. I can continue to perform my duties, as long as I can avoid wearing a mask. I can certainly communicate that to my employer. I suppose documenting that I am temporarily exempt from mask requirements while undergoing medical evaluation would be sufficient. I appreciate you asking, and for all your assistance. I feel much more reassured knowing we are taking a proactive approach. Thank you again, Doctor Piet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. I'll document that you are temporarily exempt from mask requirements pending the results of your EKG and blood work. My nurse will be in shortly to review these instructions with you, and to schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and compassionate care. You have put my mind at ease. I will await my nurse, and I look forward to discussing the results with you when they are available. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. You’re very welcome. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
