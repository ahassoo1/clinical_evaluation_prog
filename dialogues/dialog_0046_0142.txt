DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi Doctor. Right. Well, it’s… headaches, mostly. Really bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come, it's… not fun. I get all sweaty and my heart races, you know? It's happened a few times now, and I figured I should probably get it checked out. Honestly, I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. Just… sometime ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches that come and go, and are accompanied by sweating and a racing heart. That definitely warrants a closer look. When you say "sometime ago," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the thing. It’s… fuzzy. Maybe… six months? A year? It feels like it's been a while, but time kind of blends together, you know? It's not like they started suddenly, more like… they gradually got worse, and then started happening more often. Does that make any sense? I wish I could be more precise. It’s just… hard to remember details.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jaxston. It's very common to not recall exact timelines when describing symptoms. Six months to a year is helpful, though. And you’re right to mention they gradually worsened – that’s a key detail. Could you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Right, the headaches… um. They're… throbbing, mostly. Like a really bad pressure, all over my head. Sometimes it feels like it’s focused behind my eyes, other times it’s more on the sides. And it’s not just a little ache, it’s… really intense. Makes it hard to think, hard to do anything, really. I usually just have to lie down in a dark room. And like I said, that’s when the sweating and heart racing kicks in. Is that… helpful? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all rambling, Jaxston. This is all very helpful. Throbbing headaches, pressure all over, sometimes behind the eyes, sometimes on the sides… and intense enough to make you lie down. And accompanied by those other symptoms – sweating and racing heart. Do you notice anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. I haven't really noticed anything specific, to be honest. It doesn't seem to be linked to stress, or… what I eat, or anything like that. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been working for a long time, but I do a lot of different things at work, so it's hard to pinpoint. Other times it just… happens out of nowhere. Which is the most frustrating part, I guess. I wish I could at least avoid something if I knew what was causing it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s difficult when there isn’t a clear trigger. And it's good you've considered potential stressors and dietary factors. Let's move on to some other questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes. Not every time, but yeah, a few times I've felt really sick to my stomach when one of these headaches hits. I haven't actually thrown up, if that makes sense. Just… really nauseous. And I get really sensitive to light, like, even normal room light feels too bright when I'm having a bad one. I usually have to close the curtains and everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea without vomiting and sensitivity to light. That’s helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently – blurry vision, seeing spots, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah. I think so. It's kind of hard to explain. Sometimes my vision gets a little… wavy, like looking through heat haze. It doesn't last long, just a few minutes, usually right before a headache starts. I thought it was just my eyes getting tired from working, but… maybe it’s connected? I haven't been to the eye doctor in ages, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s very important information, Jaxston. Wavy vision before the headaches is definitely something we need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox and all that. But nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that healed fine. I don’t take any regular medications, and I haven't been hospitalized for anything. I got divorced a couple of years back, which was… stressful, but that’s about it. I feel like I'm not a very interesting patient, honestly. Just a headache sufferer.
DOCTOR: You're not a headache sufferer just, Jaxston, and your history is valuable. Divorce can be very stressful, and it's good you acknowledge that. Let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of headaches, migraines, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom used to get really bad headaches sometimes, but she never really talked about them. Just said she had a “sensitive head”. My dad was pretty healthy, as far as I know. He passed away a few years back. I don’t really know much about my grandparents' medical history, to be honest. We weren't very close. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I'm not much of a family history person.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Knowing your mother experienced headaches is useful, even without a formal diagnosis. And finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never been a smoker. I have a beer every now and then with friends, maybe once a month or so. But nothing regular. Definitely don't do any drugs. I try to stay pretty healthy, all things considered. Work keeps me busy enough. Is… is this going somewhere? Are you thinking it’s something serious? Sorry, I’m probably being paranoid.
DOCTOR: You're not being paranoid at all, Jaxston. It’s natural to be concerned when you’re experiencing these symptoms. I’m gathering information to determine the best course of action. Okay, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam now. I'll check your vital signs, do a neurological assessment – that includes testing your reflexes, strength, and coordination – and look in your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m a little worried, but I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels weird. I'm not great with medical stuff, so... just take it easy on me, okay? Where do you want me to start?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. I’ll explain everything as we go. We’ll start with your vital signs. Could you please sit up on the exam table?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I'm not very good at this whole medical thing, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 128/82, pulse is 78 and regular, and temperature is 98.6, all within normal limits. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Ears look clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This involves a small hammer to your knees and ankles. It might be a little uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Knees and ankles… sounds… fine. I'm a little nervous, but I’ll try to relax. Just… don’t hit me too hard, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Is that enough? I don't want to break your hands or anything. I'm not very strong, honestly. It's mostly just… work. Lots of repetitive stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength is 5/5 in all extremities, which is good. Now I’m going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with yours?
PATIENT: Here… and here… is that okay? I'm a little out of practice with this stuff, I haven't done anything like this since… well, probably high school gym class. I'm not very coordinated, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, coordination is slightly diminished, but not significantly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to use an ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eyes. This allows me to examine the optic nerve and blood vessels. It may be a little bright, so please let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay… bright light… It's… a little uncomfortable, but I can handle it. Is everything okay? What are you looking for back there? Sorry, I’m probably asking too many questions. I just… get anxious at the doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Jaxston. It's good to be informed. I’m looking for any signs of swelling or damage to the optic nerve, which can sometimes indicate increased pressure in the brain. Okay, the optic discs look normal. No papilledema or other abnormalities. Based on the exam findings and your history, the diminished coordination is something we need to monitor, but it's not immediately concerning. The wavy vision, headaches, and accompanying symptoms are what I’m most focused on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven't really taken much medication in my life, honestly. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, like ibuprofen or something. But nothing serious. I don’t usually have any reactions to anything. I'm pretty boring that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Like I said, I don't really take anything. I’ve been trying to avoid medication as much as possible, honestly. I just… don't like the idea of putting all those chemicals into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston. That’s helpful. Based on your history and the physical exam, I suspect you may be experiencing migraine headaches. However, the diminished coordination and the reports of wavy vision warrant further investigation to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to get a more detailed look at your brain structure and rule out any neurological issues.
PATIENT: MRI… Is that… serious? What are you looking for? I've heard bad things about MRIs. Is it going to be painful? Claustrophobic? I don't do well in small spaces… I'm probably overreacting, aren't I? Just tell me what it involves, okay? What are the risks? I need to know.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be anxious about an MRI, Jaxston. It's a common concern. It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s a precautionary measure to get a clearer picture of what's going on. An MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s a non-invasive procedure, which means it doesn't involve any incisions or injections. It's also painless. The biggest concern for some people is the enclosed space. You lie on a table that slides into a tunnel. It's not a small space, but it can feel confined. We can give you medication to help you relax if you're feeling claustrophobic. We can also offer an open MRI, which is less enclosed, although the image quality isn’t quite as good. The risks are minimal. If you have any metal implants in your body, like a pacemaker or certain types of surgical clips, it could be a contraindication. We'll need to ask you some questions about that before proceeding. There’s also a very small risk of allergic reaction to the contrast dye, if we decide to use it. We'll discuss all of this in detail before the procedure, and you can decide if you're comfortable proceeding. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Okay… that… does help a little. No metal implants, definitely. And I haven’t had any surgeries or anything. Claustrophobic… that’s my biggest worry, I think. I get anxious in elevators, even. An open MRI… is that an option? Maybe that would be better. I don’t want to be completely enclosed. What about the contrast dye? What’s that for? And what are the risks of not getting the MRI? I need to know everything before I agree to anything. Sorry, I’m probably being a pain. I just… I don't like feeling trapped.
DOCTOR: You're not being a pain at all, Jaxston. It’s important to ask questions and feel comfortable with any medical procedure. An open MRI is definitely an option. It's less enclosed, and many people find it more comfortable. However, the image quality isn’t quite as detailed as a traditional MRI, which could make it harder to identify subtle abnormalities. We can discuss the pros and cons and decide which option is best for you. The contrast dye, called gadolinium, is sometimes used to enhance the images and make it easier to see certain structures in your brain. It can help us identify inflammation, tumors, or other abnormalities. The risks of the contrast dye are minimal, but there’s a very small risk of allergic reaction or a rare condition called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, which is more common in people with kidney problems. We'll check your kidney function before administering the dye. As for the risks of not getting the MRI, we won’t have a clear picture of what's going on in your brain. We can still manage your headaches based on your symptoms, but we won't be able to rule out other potential causes, such as a tumor, aneurysm, or multiple sclerosis. This could delay diagnosis and treatment if you do have a more serious underlying condition. I recommend we start with blood work – the CBC and CMP – to assess your overall health. Then, we can discuss the options for imaging – traditional MRI or open MRI – and decide which one is best for you. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds… reasonable. Blood work first, then talk about the MRI options. That’s good. I feel a little better knowing we're not rushing into anything. Can I still drive after the blood work? And how long does it take to get the results back? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Like, should I fast? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can definitely drive after the blood work. It's a simple procedure, and shouldn't affect your ability to drive. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We'll call you as soon as they're available. And yes, you do need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We'll give you a slip with detailed instructions when you schedule the appointment. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the blood work for you now. She'll also provide you with a detailed list of instructions and answer any further questions you may have. In the meantime, if your headaches worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or weakness, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's… everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And patient. I really appreciate it. I guess I’ll just wait for Sarah to call and schedule the blood work. Hopefully, it won't be anything too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Sarah will be in touch shortly to schedule the blood work. And remember, we'll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
