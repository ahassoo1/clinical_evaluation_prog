DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… I just moved here, so I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? It’s… for healthcare, you know? I have Medicare. I don’t really… remember much about getting all this started.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Bonck. Establishing care with a new doctor can be a little confusing. We’ll get everything sorted out. Medicare is accepted here, so that’s one less thing to worry about. To start, could you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Um… general health? Like… am I sick? I don't feel sick. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but… everyone does, right? I work with machines all day, so my back kinda aches. But that’s just from work, I think. I don't really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good way to put it. “Do you feel sick?
PATIENT: Right. Okay. No, not really sick. Just… tired a lot. And the back. It’s not bad bad, just… there. My husband, he says I should get it checked, but I always put it off.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re thinking about getting it checked now, and that your husband is encouraging you to prioritize your health. We can definitely take a look at your back today. To get a better understanding of what might be causing the fatigue and back discomfort, could you tell me a little more about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, um… okay. I work at the factory. I put parts together, check them, make sure they’re right. Lots of bending, reaching. It’s… noisy. I’ve been doing it for… a while now. I think three years? Maybe four? Time gets… mixed up sometimes. I mostly work with… metal things. Big metal things.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Bending, reaching, and working with heavy machinery… that can certainly put a strain on your body. And a noisy environment can contribute to fatigue as well. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you might have, or any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Uh… surgeries? I… I don’t think so. Maybe when I was little? I really don’t remember. I had my tonsils out maybe? But it was so long ago. As for other… conditions? Nothing that I know of. I get headaches sometimes, but… everyone gets headaches, right? And my hands get kinda numb if I work too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, headaches, and some numbness in your hands with prolonged work. We’ll make a note of those. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… allergies? I don’t think so. I eat everything. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. My husband says I should be careful with shellfish, but I don’t really eat much of that anyway. So… no allergies?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… sometimes I take something for the headaches. Like… ibuprofen? Or… acetaminophen? Whatever the red bottle is. And sometimes a multi-vitamin. My husband gets them for me. But that’s it. I don’t take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed for headaches, and a multivitamin occasionally. Good. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. Um… that’s hard. My mom… she had some problems with her heart, I think. She was sick for a long time. And my grandpa… he had something with his lungs? But I don’t really know what. I didn’t… spend much time with them. It's… fuzzy. My husband knows more about that stuff, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It's common for family medical history to be a little unclear. Any information is helpful, and it's okay if you don't have all the details. We can always try to gather more information later. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, definitely not. I don’t smoke. I… I don’t like the smell. And I don’t drink. Never have. I don’t really… go out much. My husband doesn’t like that stuff either. And… no, definitely not drugs. Never.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Um… okay. A physical exam? What does that… involve? I don’t really like doctors poking at me. But… if you think it’s important… sure.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bonck. It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious. I'll explain everything as I go, and we can go at your pace. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your back. I'll also check your reflexes and range of motion. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, and if anything does feel uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Would you like to start by checking your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Okay… blood pressure first. That sounds… okay. Not too scary. Just… please be gentle? And tell me what you’re doing, okay? My husband always says I get nervous when I don't know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bonck. I will explain everything as I go and be as gentle as possible. We’ll take it slow. I'm just placing this cuff around your arm to measure your blood pressure. It will inflate briefly, and you might feel some pressure. It won't hurt. Just relax your arm and breathe normally. Okay, let’s see… Your blood pressure is 130/85. That’s slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. We can monitor that over time. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Would you mind taking a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… deep breath. Is that okay? It feels… weird.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Ms. Bonck. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any unusual noises. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your back to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Palpate? That means… you’re gonna touch my back? Be very gentle, please. It hurts sometimes when I bend over, but it’s not… a sharp pain. More like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, palpate means I'm going to gently touch your back to feel for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasms. I’m starting here, on the lower back… Does that feel tender?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that one. That one hurts a little. Not bad bad, but… definitely feels it. It’s like… a knot. A tight knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a bit of muscle tightness there as well. It sounds like you likely have some muscle strain in your lower back. That’s not uncommon, especially with the type of work you do. And how about on this side?
PATIENT: That one… yeah, that’s tight too. Not as bad as the one right on my spine, but… definitely feels it. Like… it needs to be rubbed out, maybe? My husband sometimes rubs my back when it hurts, and that helps a little.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know your husband’s rubs provide some relief. It sounds like massage might be helpful. Alright, Ms. Bonck, that completes the physical exam. Overall, your vital signs are stable, your heart and lungs sound clear, and it seems you have some muscle strain in your lower back. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I suspect this is a musculoskeletal issue, likely caused by the physical demands of your job. However, to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Does that mean… needles? I don't like needles. But… if you think it’s important… okay. As long as it doesn't take too long. And you’ll tell me what it’s for?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does involve a small needle, I understand your apprehension. It will only be a small amount of blood, and it will be quick. It's just to get a better baseline of your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammation or other issues. It should only take a few minutes, and we can get you comfortable. The blood work will check things like your red and white blood cell count, kidney and liver function, and blood sugar levels. It will help me get a more complete picture of your health and determine the best course of treatment for your back pain. We'll also discuss some initial steps we can take to manage your pain, such as over-the-counter pain relievers, heat or ice therapy, and gentle stretching exercises. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… pain relievers and heat… that sounds… okay. I already have the pain relievers, like you said. And my husband has a heating pad. Stretching… I guess I can try that. I’m not very flexible, though. So… you want me to get the blood work done now? Where do I go? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can get the blood work done now. There’s a lab just down the hall—room 203. The nurse will draw a small sample of blood. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes, including the wait time. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once they're available, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with the over-the-counter pain relievers as needed and applying heat to your lower back for 15-20 minutes several times a day. Avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your pain. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… the blood work, then come back later. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. And you were gentle.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bonck. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to let the nurse know if you have any concerns during the blood draw. And remember, we'll discuss the results in detail at your follow-up appointment. Here's a lab requisition form—just take this to room 203. Take care, and I'll see you soon. If you experience any worsening symptoms—such as fever, numbness, or weakness—please contact the clinic immediately.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again. I will. Bye.
