DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, apparently. My husband made the appointment. He worries too much. Honestly, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, as determined by your husband. That's good he's looking out for you. Even if you feel fine, it’s important to check it out. High blood pressure often doesn't have symptoms, which is why it’s sometimes called the “silent killer.” To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you've ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. And honestly, I doubt I have high blood pressure. He just checked it a couple of times and got worried. He reads too much on the internet. I've never had any problems, really. Except maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't?
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ms. Dudney. It's good to be questioning things. We'll certainly do our own assessment today. It’s always best to be thorough. Just to be complete, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor for check-ups, and if so, when was your last visit?
PATIENT: Look, I work. A lot. Civil engineering isn’t exactly a desk job, you know? I don’t have time for “check-ups.” Last time I went to a doctor was… honestly, I don't remember. Probably when I broke my wrist a few years back. Something like that. It wasn’t a regular thing. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand that you’re busy, Ms. Dudney, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Knowing about the broken wrist is helpful. Let's quickly touch on your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any health conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: My grandma had…something with her heart, I think. She was old. Everyone in my family is pretty healthy, actually. Lots of strong Navajos. I really don't know all the details. My mom never talked about it much. Can we just get this over with? I have a site inspection this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Dudney. I appreciate your patience. Knowing about your grandmother's heart condition is helpful, thank you. Just a couple more quick questions, then we can proceed with the examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat whatever, take whatever, no problems. Seriously. This is getting ridiculous. Are you going to take my blood pressure or what?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies – good. And I apologize for the amount of questions, Ms. Dudney. I just want to get a complete picture of your health. Alright, let's get to the blood pressure check, then. I'm going to take a few readings, and we'll also listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry it up. I have things to do. And please, don’t tell me I need to change my diet or something. I eat perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Dudney. I will certainly take your preferences into consideration. I’m not here to dictate your lifestyle, just to assess your health and help you stay well. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Seriously? Is it really necessary to squeeze so hard? It feels like it's cutting off my circulation. I need that arm for work, you know.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Dudney. I didn't mean to cause any discomfort. I’ll be more gentle. The cuff needs to be snug enough for an accurate reading, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just breathe normally, and we’ll have the reading in a moment. It's 162 over 98. That is elevated. I'm going to take it again on the other arm just to confirm.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? And please don’t tell me it’s my fault. I told you I was fine. This is just ridiculous. I need to get back to work. What's the point of even bothering with this if you’re just going to tell me I’m… elevated? It's probably just from being stressed out, running late, and dealing with this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. It's perfectly valid to feel this way. “Elevated” means that your blood pressure is higher than the recommended level. A normal reading is generally considered to be below 120/80. Your readings are consistently above that, and it’s important to investigate further, even if you’re feeling fine. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s your fault, and it doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong. Stress can contribute to temporary increases, but consistently elevated readings warrant further evaluation to rule out any underlying causes. To get a better understanding, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. But if this takes long, my husband is getting an earful. He shouldn’t have wasted my time. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Dudney. I appreciate your patience. This will only take a few moments. I’m listening for any unusual sounds or irregularities. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. I’m just checking your thyroid gland now. Thyroid feels normal as well. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No. I wear work boots all day. They make my feet swell, sometimes. It's from standing, not from anything wrong with me. Honestly, this is pointless. My grandpa lived to be ninety, and he ate fried bread every day. So there. And he definitely didn't go to doctors.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Dudney, and a strong family history is certainly a positive thing. It’s true that lifestyle factors play a big role in health, and everyone has different tolerances. However, even with a strong family history, it’s important to address any concerning findings and rule out any potential issues. Given your elevated blood pressure and the fact that it's consistently high, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of your overall health. These tests will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and cholesterol, among other things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Now you want blood? Seriously? No. I don’t want any needles. I hate needles. This is getting ridiculous. Tell me it's just stress and let me go back to work. I have a site to manage, you know. A real job. Not poking people with needles. This whole thing is a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to needles, Ms. Dudney, and I apologize for any discomfort the thought causes. However, given your consistently elevated blood pressure, it's difficult for me to definitively say it's just stress without further investigation. The blood tests will provide valuable information to help determine the underlying cause and ensure your overall health. I understand you have a demanding job, and I want to respect your time. However, ignoring consistently high blood pressure can lead to serious complications like heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. I strongly recommend at least considering the blood tests. If you’re hesitant about a full panel, we could start with a few basic tests to get a clearer picture. If you absolutely refuse, I can document that in your chart. But I also want to be upfront and say that without further investigation, I cannot confidently rule out any underlying medical issues. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Ms. Dudney. But I want to ensure you have all the information necessary to make an informed choice about your health.
