DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right, Dr. Korrell. Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur, remembering exactly why I booked this... something about not sleeping well? And, well, feeling a bit... not exactly fit, I suppose. It’s just… things haven’t been right since… well, you know. It's all a bit fuzzy, though. I mostly just wanted someone to have a look, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Not sleeping well and feeling generally unwell… yes. Vague symptoms are… less than ideal, unfortunately. It makes it difficult to pinpoint the cause. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific, huh? Look, I'm not a man who enjoys dwelling. I used to be able to work all night, tuning pianos, fiddling with strings… didn’t need much sleep at all. Now? I wake up tired. And achey. I don’t do aches. It's not like I’ve been pushing myself, either. Not really. Just... existing, I suppose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Existing… right. And this has been going on for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It feels like ages. Months, definitely. Maybe… six? Seven? After… everything. Time sort of lost its meaning, to be honest. It’s not like I keep a calendar. Or much of a routine, for that matter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Months of disrupted sleep and generalized aches. And you said “after everything”?
PATIENT: My wife… she passed. About eight months ago now, give or take. It… changed things. I lost my… drive, I suppose. Not that I talk about it much. It’s just… easier not to. Everything feels… muted, now. And I’m not the type for grief counselling, if you get my meaning. I just want to feel normal again, if that's even possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. A significant loss can certainly have a profound effect on both your mental and physical wellbeing. It’s not uncommon for symptoms like fatigue and aches to develop in these circumstances. However, we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. Let’s start with a quick review of your systems. Do you have any fevers, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fevers? No, I don't think so. I haven’t bothered taking my temperature in… well, ever, probably. Chills, sometimes. But that's usually just if I'm cold. And night sweats… occasionally. But I live in a small flat, it gets stuffy. It’s probably just the bedding. I really don't fuss over such things. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, Mr. Redfern, even if it's not precise. Okay. How about your appetite?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Some days I can eat a horse, others… a biscuit. I'm not a particularly fussy eater, mind you. Just… not terribly hungry most of the time. I mostly eat to… well, to have to. It's not a pleasure, if I'm honest. I used to enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite. Alright. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Now you're getting into… personal territory, aren’t you? Look, I’ll be blunt. It’s… irregular. Sometimes normal, sometimes… not. I haven't paid much attention, to be honest. It's just… another thing. Is this going to be a long process?
DOCTOR: It's necessary to gather a complete history, Mr. Redfern, to properly assess your condition. Irregular bowel habits can be indicative of several issues. Now, are you experiencing any abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea?
PATIENT: Look, I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, if I eat anything rich. Bloating, perhaps. I wouldn’t call it severe. And nausea? Not really. Just… a general feeling of… off-ness. Like everything’s a bit… muted, remember? It’s hard to explain. Honestly, Doc, I just want to feel like myself again. All these questions…
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Redfern. However, "off-ness" is… not a diagnosis. Let's move on to something else. Have you noticed any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? Well, I haven’t exactly been piling it on, have I? I’ve lost a bit, I suppose. Not intentionally. Just… not much appetite, remember? Clothes are a bit looser. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Weight loss, unintentional. Alright. Now, let's talk about past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. A bit of flu now and then, the usual. A bad back once, from bending over pianos all day. Nothing serious. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, to be honest. Up until… well, you know. Never been much for doctors, either. Always seemed to sort itself out.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Definitely not. I don’t…do hospitals, if you get my meaning. Never had a need for them, thankfully. Scraped a knee as a boy, but my mother just put a plaster on it. That's about the extent of my surgical experience.
DOCTOR: No past surgical history. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of any medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My father… he had a bit of a heart problem, towards the end. Nothing dramatic. My mother… she was always healthy as a horse. That's about all I know, really. We weren’t a particularly close family, if I’m honest. It's not something I ever paid much attention to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history. Now, let's discuss your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for the lungs, you know. And I have to keep my lungs in good condition for… well, for tuning pianos. And breathing, of course.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Occasionally. A bit of brandy during the cold winter months. Nothing excessive, mind you. I’m not a drinker. Never really been one for strong spirits. It doesn't… agree with me.
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol consumption. Now, do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Are you serious? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. What sort of question is that? I'm a musician, Doc, not… whatever you're implying. That’s… quite insulting, actually.
DOCTOR: Apologies, Mr. Redfern. Standard questions, I assure you. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I think I get a bit of a stuffy nose during the pollen season, if that counts. Nothing major. And I once had a bit of a rash after eating some shellfish, years ago. But I haven’t touched shellfish since, so it’s not really an issue. Apart from that… no. I'm not a particularly allergic man.
DOCTOR: Mild seasonal allergies, shellfish allergy. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I avoid medication whenever possible. Always have. Bad for the system, you know. I prefer to let nature take its course. And besides, I haven’t really needed anything. Until now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. No current medications. Well, we’ve covered quite a bit. Now, I’d like to conduct a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh. Right. Well… I suppose so. As long as it’s quick. I'm not terribly fond of being poked and prodded, if I'm honest. But if it’s necessary… go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Redfern. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/85, pulse is 72 and regular. That's… slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished at the bases. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but I do note some mild distension. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Finally, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear, throat is mildly injected, no exudate. Alright, Mr. Redfern. That concludes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me, and the results of the examination, it seems we have a constellation of vague symptoms – fatigue, aches, decreased appetite, some mild abdominal distension, and slightly diminished lung sounds. It could be a number of things. Given the recent loss, it could be related to grief and stress. However, we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a chest X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A lot of tests, huh? Look, Doc, I’m not terribly fond of hospitals or… poking around in my system. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. Go ahead. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. And that it doesn't show anything…serious. I’m not really up for serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Redfern. It is a lot, but these tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll get the results as quickly as possible. The lab work should be back in a couple of days, and the chest X-ray will be read within 24-48 hours. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and schedule you for the chest X-ray. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on getting as much rest as possible, eating a healthy diet, and staying hydrated. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Not really. I suppose… will these tests be expensive? I'm on a bit of a fixed income, you see. And… will they tell me why I feel so… muted? That's the main thing, isn't it? Knowing what's wrong. If anything is wrong. It’s just… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Redfern. Medicare should cover most of these tests, but we'll verify that with the billing department and let you know if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. As for the tests telling us why you feel "muted," that's the goal, of course. The blood work will check for any underlying infections, anemia, or vitamin deficiencies. The thyroid test will rule out any thyroid issues, which can cause fatigue and depression. And the chest X-ray will look for any lung abnormalities. It’s possible that these tests won’t give us a definitive answer, and we may need to explore other possibilities. But it's a good starting point. I'll write a note to the billing department about your concerns, and we'll make sure you're informed of any potential costs. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… enough for now. A lot to take in. I just… hope it doesn’t show anything too serious. And thank you, Doc. For… listening. It’s been a while since anyone really listened.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Redfern. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. Take care of yourself. We’ll be in touch with the results as soon as we have them.
PATIENT: .
