DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Georgiou. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been noticing some weakness, especially in my muscles, and my eyelids… they’ve started to droop. It’s been getting worse over the last few months, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… that is something we should look into. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. It started… I’d say around April, maybe early May. It was very subtle at first, just feeling a little more tired than usual, and perhaps a bit of difficulty keeping my eyes fully open at the end of the day. But it’s definitely become more noticeable since then. It’s… it’s affecting things, you know? Simple things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re bringing it up now, rather than waiting. Can you tell me more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t do things, Doctor. It’s just… things take more effort. Like, if I’m doing something overhead – hanging curtains, reaching for something on a high shelf – my arms get tired quite quickly. And sometimes, when I've been on my feet for a while, my legs feel… heavy. It’s hard to describe. Not painful, just… weak. And the weakness seems to come and go a bit, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Fluctuating weakness is definitely important information. And you mentioned it’s more noticeable with certain activities. Does it happen after a specific time of day, or is it more related to how much you’ve been doing?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I don’t think it’s necessarily tied to the time of day, more… the amount of activity. If I’ve had a busy day at work, or been doing a lot around the house, it’s worse in the evening. But sometimes, even on a relatively quiet day, if I overdo it with something – like gardening, for example – it’ll start to flare up. I work in facilities management, so there's always something to do. It's a bit hard to avoid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like exertion makes it worse. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about the eyelids. You said they’re drooping – is it both eyelids, or just one?
PATIENT: It’s both, Doctor. But… I think the left one is a little worse than the right. It's not dramatic, but I’ve noticed people asking if I'm tired, or if I’m not getting enough sleep. It’s… a little embarrassing, to be honest. And it’s starting to affect my vision slightly, particularly in the afternoon. I have to raise my eyebrows a bit to keep my eyes open fully.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're noticing and addressing it. Vision changes are important. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I want to check your muscle strength, reflexes, and get a closer look at your eyes. Then we can discuss some potential causes and maybe some tests we can run. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I’d like to figure out what’s going on, if possible. I'm a bit worried, naturally, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s start with your eyes. I’m going to shine a light in them and have you look in different directions. Then I'll check your muscle strength in your arms and legs. It won’t be painful, just simple movements. Okay. Your reflexes seem normal, and there isn’t any tenderness in your muscles. However, I did notice some mild drooping of both eyelids, more so on the left, and a bit of weakness when I tested your arm and leg strength. It’s not severe, but it’s definitely something we need to investigate further. Do you have any trouble with chewing or swallowing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any trouble with chewing or swallowing. Everything feels normal there. I haven't noticed any changes in my voice or anything like that either. Just the weakness and the eyelids, as we've discussed. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I lead a fairly active life, and this is slowing me down. Is it… something serious? I’m trying not to jump to conclusions, but… it's hard not to worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gedalya. It’s always unsettling when your body isn’t behaving as it should. Given your symptoms – the fluctuating weakness, the drooping eyelids, and the fact that it's impacting your daily life – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is Myasthenia Gravis, which is an autoimmune condition that causes muscle weakness. Another could be something related to a vitamin deficiency or, less commonly, a neurological issue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check for specific antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis, as well as your vitamin levels and general muscle health. I also think an MRI of your brain would be a good idea, just to rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood tests and an MRI… alright, yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I’m a bit apprehensive about the MRI, if I’m honest – I’ve never had one before – but I understand it’s necessary. Will the results take long to come back? And… is it expensive? I’m… not currently insured.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about the MRI, Gedalya. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way if you’ve never had one before. It’s a painless procedure – you just lie very still in a scanner for a bit. It can be a little loud, but we can provide you with earplugs. As for the results, the blood tests usually take a few days to come back, maybe 3-5 business days. The MRI results can take a bit longer, potentially up to a week, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I’m aware you’re currently uninsured, and I understand that can be a concern. Let's see what the cost will be and then we can discuss options for payment. We may be able to arrange a payment plan, or explore some assistance programs. Our billing department can help you with that. I don't want the cost to be a barrier to getting the care you need. I will write the orders for the tests now. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. Thank you for being so understanding about the insurance situation. It’s a relief to know there might be options. I suppose it's best to get the tests done as quickly as possible. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's… less daunting now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies, that’s good to know. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and imaging center. They’ll contact you to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a note for work explaining that you're undergoing some medical testing and may need to take some time off if you start to feel significantly weaker. Here are the orders for the blood tests and MRI, and this note for your employer. If you start to experience any new symptoms – double vision, difficulty breathing, or significant difficulty swallowing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very thoughtful of you to provide the note for work. I appreciate that a great deal. Double vision, difficulty breathing… alright, I’ll remember that. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible. Thank you again for your time and your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting for the results. We’ll be here to support you. Take care, and I’ll see you when the results come back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. I will. Have a good day. .
