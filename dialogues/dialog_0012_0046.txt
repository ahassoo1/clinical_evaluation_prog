DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Yoshino. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. That's good thinking to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about that pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to describe precisely. It’s not necessarily painful, but it’s a constant feeling of needing to go to the bathroom, even when I’ve just gone. It’s more…uncomfortable, and sometimes a little urgent, you know? Like I have to go, right away, and then…often nothing much happens.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant urge, even after voiding, and sometimes not much comes out. That is uncomfortable. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, roughly two months now. It wasn’t constant at first, just occasional, but it’s definitely become more frequent over the last few weeks. I can recall the exact date, if that’s helpful? June 8th, I believe. I was visiting my sister that weekend.
DOCTOR: June 8th, okay, that's helpful to have a specific date. And it's progressively worsened over the last few weeks. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – things like pain when you urinate, fever, blood in your urine, or changes in how your urine smells?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. No pain at all when I go, no fever, and the urine looks normal, as far as I can tell. The smell hasn’t changed either. It really is just the pressure and the frequent urge. It's just...disruptive, honestly. And a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain, fever, or changes in your urine is reassuring. Disruptive and worrying are fair feelings. Have you had any changes in your fluid intake recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Not really, I don’t think. I generally drink about the same amount of water each day – maybe six to eight glasses? I haven’t started any new beverages or anything like that. And I haven’t been exercising more intensely, or doing anything different that might explain it. I can recall precisely how much I drank on an average day, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Six to eight glasses is pretty standard. And no changes in activity level or what you're drinking. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like urinary tract infections, bladder problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized or had any surgeries. I do have Medicare, so I’ve had regular check-ups, of course, but nothing significant has ever been flagged. I can recall the name of my previous primary care physician, Dr. Ramirez, if you’d like.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – generally healthy, no prior diagnoses or hospitalizations. And you’ve had regular check-ups with Dr. Ramirez. Have any close family members – your mother, sisters, or daughters – experienced similar bladder problems or urinary issues?
PATIENT: That's a thoughtful question. My mother had a bladder infection once, many years ago, when I was a child, but she recovered fully. My sister hasn’t had any problems that I know of. I don’t have any daughters. I recall my mother mentioning it briefly during a phone call; she said it was quite unpleasant, but it resolved with antibiotics, as I recall. It was sometime in the early 1990s, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had a UTI in the 90s, but no other family history of bladder issues. And you're currently not taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: That is correct. I don’t take any medications at all, not even over-the-counter things regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's infrequent. I recall the last time I took ibuprofen was on July 12th, for a mild tension headache after a long drive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. That's helpful. Alright, Marialena, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and do a gentle pelvic exam to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It won’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful or concerning. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Yoshino. I understand. Please proceed. I’ll certainly let you know if anything feels uncomfortable. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m going to do a quick pelvic exam. I'll just be checking for any tenderness or signs of infection. I'm using a warmed speculum... Is that comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's…comfortable enough, thank you. It’s a little unusual, of course, but not painful. I appreciate you explaining each step. It helps to know what to expect. I recall reading about this procedure previously, so I wasn't entirely unprepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks normal externally. And internally, your vagina and cervix appear healthy. I don't see any signs of infection or obvious abnormalities. There's no noticeable tenderness when I gently move your cervix. I’m just palpating your pelvic organs now… Everything feels normal in size and shape. Okay, that's all done. Everything felt normal on the exam. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything immediately concerning, but to rule out a urinary tract infection or other issues, I'd like to order a urine test. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. A urine test sounds like a very sensible precaution. I'm happy to proceed with that. I recall reading that it's a simple procedure, so I'm not worried. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me thoroughly. It's reassuring to hear that you haven't found anything immediately concerning.
DOCTOR: Great. I’ll have the nurse come in and collect a urine sample. It’s best to use a midstream clean catch – I’ll explain that to you when she gets here. While we wait for the results, I want to ask about your social history – things like smoking, alcohol consumption, and your occupation. This can sometimes help us understand potential contributing factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Dr. Yoshino. Please proceed. I'm happy to provide any information that might be helpful. I'm a graphic designer, and I don't smoke or drink alcohol. I can recall the details of my work schedule if that is helpful. I generally work regular hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, graphic designer, no smoking or alcohol, regular work hours. That’s good to know. How would you describe your stress levels generally?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I would say my stress levels are… moderate. My job can be demanding at times, with deadlines and client requests, but I generally manage it well. I have a supportive husband, and I enjoy my work, so it's not overwhelming. I recall practicing mindfulness techniques on occasion to manage stress.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate stress, supportive husband, and you use mindfulness techniques. That's excellent. Do you experience any difficulty with constipation or bowel movements?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don’t. My bowel movements are regular and…normal, as far as I can tell. I maintain a fairly healthy diet, with plenty of fiber. I recall discussing this with my previous physician during a routine check-up. She confirmed everything appeared normal at that time.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Regular bowel movements. Alright, Marialena, I’m going to order that urine test now. We’ll check for infection, blood, and other abnormalities. It should take about 15-20 minutes to get the results back. While we're waiting, is there anything else you'd like to tell me or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No, I believe I’ve covered everything. I appreciate your thoroughness, Dr. Yoshino, and your patience. I’m grateful for your attention to this matter. I don’t have any questions at the moment, but I will certainly ask if anything comes to mind. I recall reading about possible causes of bladder pressure, but I didn't want to self-diagnose.
DOCTOR: That's very wise of you. Let’s wait for the results of the urine test before we jump to any conclusions. I’ll be right back with the results as soon as they are available.
