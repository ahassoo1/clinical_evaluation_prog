DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though, frankly, I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for…well, let’s just say my daughter insisted. She’s convinced this…this marijuana is the answer to everything. I’m here, I suppose, to get one of those certificates she keeps talking about. For…medical purposes. Though I must admit, I have my doubts.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your daughter is encouraging you to explore medical marijuana, and you’re here to discuss whether that might be appropriate and obtain the necessary certification if it is. That’s perfectly reasonable. Just to be clear, when you say “certificate,” are you referring to a medical marijuana card?
PATIENT: A card, a certificate…it’s all the same thing, isn’t it? She made it sound very official. Something about being able to purchase it…legally. I wouldn’t want to be breaking any laws, of course. I’ve always been a law-abiding citizen. It’s just…I don’t see what good it could possibly do. But she’s quite insistent, and frankly, it’s easier to humor her than to argue.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you’re approaching this with caution and wanting to ensure everything is done legally. Yes, a medical marijuana card is what allows legal purchase and use, if you qualify. To determine if you qualify, I need to understand what symptoms or conditions you’re hoping to address with medical marijuana. Your daughter mentioned she thinks it might be helpful – is there a specific reason she feels that way?
PATIENT: Well, she says it's for my…my nerves. She thinks I worry too much. Honestly, who doesn’t worry these days? But she claims it will help me “relax.” She says it’s much better than those…those pills the other doctor gave me. Made me drowsy, they did. Couldn't even keep up with my soaps! Though, I suppose a little worry is a small price to pay for being able to watch my stories. It’s just…it all seems rather…undignified, doesn't it? A woman of my age…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. It’s perfectly valid to feel hesitant, and you’re right to weigh the benefits and drawbacks. So, it sounds like the primary issue is anxiety or worry, and your daughter believes medical marijuana might be a better alternative to the medication you previously tried due to the drowsiness it caused. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about when you experience this worry?
PATIENT: It's not…constant, Doctor. It’s more…situational. When things aren't just so. You know? My house has to be immaculate, everything in its place. And if my husband leaves his slippers in the wrong spot…well, it just sets my teeth on edge! And the news, of course. All that negativity. It’s enough to make anyone anxious. And then there’s the grandchildren…they mean the world to me, but they’re always getting into mischief! It’s a constant worry, protecting them from…well, everything. It's exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So it sounds like your anxiety is linked to a desire for order and control – maintaining a tidy home, worrying about your grandchildren’s safety, and being affected by negative news. It’s very common to feel anxious in those situations, Ellan, and it's understandable that it’s causing you distress. To help me understand the extent of this anxiety, would you say it interferes with your daily life?
PATIENT: Interferes? Well, it certainly doesn’t help. I find myself constantly checking things. Making lists, rearranging…it takes up a considerable amount of time, if I’m honest. And sometimes…sometimes I just can't sleep. I lie awake, going over everything in my head. Did I lock the doors? Did I turn off the stove? Are the grandchildren safe? It's…frightening, really. And it leaves me quite tired, of course. I’m not as spry as I used to be. It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but there it is.
DOCTOR: Please don’t feel embarrassed at all, Ellan. It takes courage to share these things, and you’re doing a wonderful job describing how this anxiety affects you. It sounds like it’s significantly impacting your sleep and daily routines, and causing you considerable distress. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… the doctor years ago said my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a pill for that. I stopped taking it though, it made me feel so dizzy. And I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but it’s mostly manageable with some creams and…well, avoiding the cold weather. Nothing major, really. I've always been a relatively healthy woman. I eat my vegetables, you know. And I try to get a little bit of exercise, when the weather permits. I haven't really been sick sick, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ellan. So, you've had some mild hypertension in the past, and some arthritis in your knees, but otherwise consider yourself generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single surgery, thank heavens. And I've only been to the hospital once, when I broke my wrist as a child. Fell out of a mango tree, it was. A silly thing, really. I was always a bit of a tomboy, climbing trees and running about. But that was a long time ago. No, I haven't had any serious medical interventions, Doctor. I pride myself on my good health, truly. It's just this…worry, it's been wearing me down lately.
DOCTOR: That’s very reassuring to hear, Ellan. No surgeries or hospitalizations aside from a childhood injury. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, when they're acting up. A cream, I believe it's called…diclofenac? And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I'll take a little bit of chamomile tea. But that's it, Doctor. Really. Nothing regular. I prefer to avoid pills if I can, you know? They always seem to have so many side effects. I'm a very simple woman with simple needs, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diclofenac cream for your knees as needed, and chamomile tea for sleep occasionally. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…I don't believe so. I've never had a reaction to anything, thank heavens. I'm not particularly sensitive, you see. I eat everything, I can tolerate most climates…nothing bothers me, really. My daughter always worried about me trying new foods when we traveled, but I’ve always been a bit of an adventurer. No allergies to report, Doctor. I'm quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ellan. No known allergies. Now, I understand your daughter is the one who suggested medical marijuana. Is there a family history of anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me see… My mother, bless her soul, she was always a worrier, just like me. Constantly fussing over everything. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had a bit of a…nervous disposition, I suppose. He was always a bit jumpy, easily startled. But beyond that…no, not really. No one ever went to a doctor for anything like that. We just…dealt with it, you know? Family pride, I suppose. It wasn’t something we talked about much, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a history of anxiety traits in your mother and a somewhat nervous disposition in your uncle. That’s helpful information. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your reflexes. It will just take a few minutes and help me get a more complete picture of your overall health. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Well…I suppose so. Though I haven’t had my blood pressure checked in ages. I always hated those machines. They always make me nervous! But…if it’s necessary, I suppose I can endure it. Just…please be gentle, Doctor. And don’t take too long, alright? I have my stories to get to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we’ll take our time. I understand your concern about the blood pressure machine, and we’ll go at your pace. First, let’s just check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. But please, no sudden movements. And try to make it quick, if you wouldn't mind. I do get a bit flustered when things are…unexpected.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything as I go. This might feel a little tight for a moment, but it won’t hurt. I’m just going to inflate the cuff now. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/85. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. It's common for blood pressure to be higher in a clinical setting, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. That’s good. Now, let's just check your reflexes…Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Though I haven't had my reflexes checked since…well, I can't even remember! I hope I haven't lost too much agility in my old age. Please be careful, alright? I don't want to pull a muscle.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. It just means your nervous system is slowing down a bit, which is perfectly normal. Alright, that’s all for the brief physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Now, based on our conversation and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing anxiety related to a desire for control and order, which is interfering with your sleep and daily routines. You have a history of mild hypertension and diminished reflexes, but otherwise appear generally healthy. Before we discuss whether medical marijuana might be appropriate, I want to be thorough. Have you ever sought any professional help for your anxiety, such as therapy or medication?
PATIENT: Well…no, not exactly. I mentioned that doctor years ago gave me something for my blood pressure, but that wasn't for the worry. My daughter suggested seeing a therapist once, but… frankly, the thought of talking to a stranger about my personal feelings… it just doesn’t sit right with me. We just…deal with it, in my family. We always have. It’s just not something we’re accustomed to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like seeking professional help hasn’t been a tradition in your family, and you prefer to manage things on your own. That's perfectly valid. Given your history, and the fact that medication previously caused drowsiness, we can certainly explore whether medical marijuana might be a suitable option for managing your anxiety. However, I want to be clear that it’s not a cure-all, and it’s important to have realistic expectations. There are several different strains of marijuana with varying levels of THC and CBD. THC is the psychoactive component that can cause the “high” feeling, while CBD has anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties without the same psychoactive effects. We would likely start with a strain that’s higher in CBD and lower in THC to minimize any potential side effects. Do you have any questions about medical marijuana before we proceed?
PATIENT: Well…yes, actually. That’s precisely what my daughter said! Something about THC and CBD… it all sounds rather complicated. And frankly, a little bit scary. I don’t want to feel…out of it, or confused, or…anything like that. I need to be sharp, you know? I have my stories to watch! And my grandchildren to keep track of. What are the risks, Doctor? And what if it doesn’t work? I don't want to waste my time and money on something that won't help.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ellan, and it’s good you’re thinking about the potential risks and benefits. Let's address the risks first. The most common side effects of medical marijuana are dry mouth, dizziness, and drowsiness. Some people experience anxiety or paranoia, but that’s more common with strains that are higher in THC. That’s why we would start with a low-THC strain. It’s also important to be aware that marijuana can interact with other medications, so we’ll need to review your medications carefully. It can also impair your judgment and coordination, so it’s important not to drive or operate heavy machinery while using it. As for whether it will work, there’s no guarantee. Everyone responds to marijuana differently. However, studies have shown that it can be effective in reducing anxiety and improving sleep. We would start with a low dose and gradually increase it until you find the optimal amount. We would also monitor your symptoms closely to see if it’s helping. If it doesn’t work, we can always discontinue it and explore other options. It’s important to remember that it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Would you like me to explain the different methods of administration – such as smoking, vaping, edibles, and tinctures – and their potential effects?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s…a lot to take in. Smoking…absolutely not. My mother always warned me about smoking. And vaping sounds just as dreadful. Edibles…well, I suppose that’s a possibility, but I'm not a baker, you know? And tinctures…what are those, exactly? Do they taste awful? Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds rather…complicated and unpleasant. I'm not sure I'm cut out for this. Perhaps my daughter was mistaken. Perhaps I should just stick to my chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, Ellan, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. And you’re absolutely right to consider all your options. It sounds like smoking and vaping are definitely off the table, and you’re not comfortable with baking. Tinctures are actually quite simple. They’re liquid extracts of marijuana that you take under your tongue, like a sublingual medication. The taste can vary depending on the brand, but many brands offer flavored options to mask the taste. It’s a relatively discreet method of administration, and the effects are typically felt within 15-30 minutes. However, if you’re not comfortable with any of these methods, we can certainly explore other options for managing your anxiety. Perhaps a referral to a therapist specializing in anxiety management would be a better fit. Or we could discuss other medications that have a lower risk of side effects. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… I think I'm leaning towards the therapist. It still doesn't sit right with me, talking to a stranger about my feelings, but… it sounds less frightening than all of this. And frankly, the thought of messing around with tinctures and edibles… it's just too much for an old woman. Perhaps my daughter was a bit too enthusiastic. Do you know a good therapist, Doctor? One who’s…understanding? And perhaps a little bit discreet?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible decision, Ellan. It’s perfectly okay to prioritize what feels comfortable for you, and a therapist might be a better fit. Yes, I do have a few recommendations. Dr. Emily Carter specializes in anxiety and stress management, and she has a very gentle and compassionate approach. She also maintains strict confidentiality, which I know is important to you. Her office is located about 20 minutes from here. I can provide you with her contact information and a brief overview of her services. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. And thank you. You've been very patient with me, and you've explained everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing I have options. Perhaps…perhaps this won’t be so bad after all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. I’m glad I could help. Here’s Dr. Carter’s contact information and a brief summary of her services. She’s very good at creating a safe and supportive environment for her patients. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been most helpful. Thank you again for your time and patience. And please… tell Dr. Carter I appreciate her discretion. I suppose it's time I gave her a call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. I’ll be sure to mention your preference for discretion to Dr. Carter. I’m confident she’ll provide you with excellent care. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful day, and I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And…thank you again. You’ve given me hope. .
