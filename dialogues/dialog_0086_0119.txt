DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s what one comes to a doctor for. It’s… a problem. A rather unpleasant problem, involving… a gentleman friend.
DOCTOR: Right. An… unpleasant problem. I see. Well, try not to feel embarrassed. We deal with all sorts of things here. Perhaps you could start by telling me a little more specifically what's been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must I be graphic? It’s… discharge. Yes, discharge. From him. It’s… not exactly a polite topic, is it? And frankly, I don't appreciate having to discuss such things with… well, anyone, let alone a woman. He assures me he’s perfectly healthy otherwise, but this… this is new. And rather worrying.
DOCTOR: Right. Discharge. From your… partner. Okay. While I understand your discomfort, Ms. Wartick, it is important to be specific when discussing medical issues. We need to understand the nature of the discharge – color, consistency, odor – any associated symptoms like burning, itching, or pain. And it’s quite common for men to experience issues, so please don’t feel it’s something to be ashamed of. Has he experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I didn't examine everything. I simply noticed it. It’s… yellowish, I suppose. And… it smells. Not terribly, but… not fresh. He says it doesn’t hurt, precisely, but he feels… a little uncomfortable. A slight stinging, perhaps, after… well, you understand. Honestly, I'm more concerned about what I’ve been exposed to, if you must know. Is it… contagious? I haven't been feeling quite myself lately. A bit run down, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Yellowish discharge, slight odor, some discomfort, and you're concerned about potential exposure. “Not feeling yourself” is rather vague, Ms. Wartick, but we can get to that. It could be contagious, depending on the cause, which is why we need to determine what’s going on with your partner. Now, has he seen a doctor about this?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. Men and doctors… it’s a whole ordeal. He thinks it’s “nothing.” Just a little… irritation. Honestly, they’re so stubborn. He’d rather suffer in silence than admit to a weakness, you see. That’s why I’m here. I need to know if I need to… take precautions. And if I need some sort of… testing. I do not want to catch anything unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Wartick, while I understand your… frustration with your partner’s reluctance to seek medical attention, it does make things more difficult. It's really important for him to be examined to determine the cause of the discharge. It could be a simple infection, or something more serious. However, since he refuses, we can proceed with some testing on you to rule out any potential exposure. We’ll need a urine sample, and I’d like to do a pelvic exam. It won't be pleasant, I'm afraid, but it’s necessary. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Really, Doctor? Must we? I assure you, I am… quite particular about such things. And frankly, the thought of it is… unsettling. Couldn’t we just… prescribe something? A broad-spectrum antibiotic, perhaps? Just in case? I’ve heard those work wonders. I’d much prefer to avoid any… invasive procedures, if possible. It’s simply… undignified.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your discomfort, but prescribing antibiotics "just in case" is not responsible medical practice. It can lead to antibiotic resistance and won't address the underlying problem. We need to identify the cause of the discharge to ensure appropriate treatment. If your partner refuses examination, we can test you for common sexually transmitted infections, but that won't necessarily tell us what he has. And frankly, relying on guesswork is not going to provide you with the peace of mind you seek. A simple pelvic exam will allow me to rule out any obvious issues and potentially collect a sample for further analysis. It's a standard procedure, and I assure you, I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Do you wish to proceed with the exam, or would you prefer I refer you to a specialist?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But I expect a great deal of… discretion. And I do hope it won’t take long. Honestly, the indignity of it all. And please, no unnecessary conversation. I find it… distracting. Just get it over with, Doctor. Quickly and efficiently. And then, tell me what sort of… preventative measures I should take, should this… gentleman persist in his foolishness.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table, and I will explain each step as I proceed. I assure you, the procedure will be as quick and efficient as possible. And afterwards, we can discuss preventative measures. Before we begin, are you currently experiencing any pain, burning, or itching in the pelvic region?
PATIENT: No. Nothing… noticeable. Just a general feeling of… unease. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather unpleasant. Let’s just get it over with, shall we? The sooner this is finished, the better. And please, be careful. I do not appreciate unnecessary discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax as much as possible. I’m going to start with a visual examination… I don't see any obvious signs of infection… Your cervix appears normal. Now, I'm going to collect a sample for testing… This may cause a slight discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. Alright, that’s all done. The sample will be sent to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. I'm also going to take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs… Just routine. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing alarming. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, while we wait for the test results, I recommend avoiding sexual contact with your partner until we determine the cause of the discharge. And, frankly, you may want to reconsider your relationship with someone who disregards his own health and yours. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Reconsider my relationship? Doctor, really! That’s… quite presumptuous. He’s a… complex man. And frankly, I’m not about to… discuss my personal life with you. But… what if it’s something… serious? What if I’ve caught something? Will I need… injections? Or long-term medication? And what about… the discomfort? Is there anything I can do for that in the meantime? A cream, perhaps? Or a… soothing wash? I do not appreciate feeling… vulnerable.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I apologize if my suggestion regarding your relationship was presumptuous. It was merely a suggestion, based on my professional experience. However, neglecting health concerns is rarely a sign of a healthy dynamic. As for your concerns, it’s too early to say if you’ve contracted anything. We need to wait for the lab results. If the tests come back positive, treatment will depend on the specific infection. Some infections require injections, others can be treated with oral medication. In the meantime, to alleviate any discomfort, you can use a mild, unscented soap and water to cleanse the area. Avoid douching or using feminine hygiene products, as these can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria. If you experience any burning, itching, or unusual discharge, contact me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Mild soap. No… unnecessary products. And contact you if anything… untoward occurs. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather… unsettling. And frankly, I’d much prefer to avoid any further… unpleasantness. When will the results be back? And how will I… be informed? A phone call? Or do I need to… return to the clinic? Honestly, I detest waiting. It’s simply… dreadful.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within three to five business days. We will contact you by phone to inform you of the findings. Please ensure your contact information is up-to-date. If you haven’t heard from us within five business days, feel free to contact the clinic to inquire about the status. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: No. No, I believe that is all. I sincerely hope this… resolves itself quickly and efficiently. And frankly, Doctor, I trust you will handle this with the utmost discretion. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Ms. Wartick. We will be in touch. Have a good day.
