DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, get on with it, will you? I haven’t got all day. It’s about this… procedure. The one for my face. My daughter booked it, you see. Said I needed it. Honestly, a bit much, if you ask me, but here I am. Pre-clearance, she called it. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Orwin. "Pre-clearance" is a good way to put it. Your daughter is thoughtful to get everything arranged. So, this procedure… could you tell me what you understand it to be?
PATIENT: Understand? Honestly, it’s all a bit of fluff. She said something about… lifting. Lifting the skin. Said I looked… tired. Nonsense, really. I’ve been working with terrazzo my whole life. Hard work keeps a man young! But she insisted on something to “freshen me up.” I suppose it involves cutting, doesn't it? I don't like the sound of that. And I expect it'll be expensive. Is that all you need to know about what I understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for clarifying. So it sounds like this is a facial lifting procedure, scheduled by your daughter, and you’re primarily concerned about the cutting involved and the potential cost. Just to be thorough, could you tell me if you've had any similar procedures done in the past?
PATIENT: Similar procedures? Good heavens, no! I'm 81 years old, not some… fashion doll. Terrazzo work, that’s what I’ve had done. Years of it. Knees ache, back’s a bit stiff, but that's from work, not vanity. Never had anything cut or lifted or… whatever they do. You’re asking a lot of questions. Are we getting anywhere with this? I’d rather just know if I’m healthy enough and be done with it.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask that, Mr. Orwin. I apologize if I’m taking too long. I just want to make sure we cover everything. So, no prior surgeries or cosmetic procedures. That’s good to know. Let’s talk about your overall health then. Do you have any current medical conditions – anything that your regular doctor has diagnosed, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe. The doctor mentioned it a few years back. Said I needed to watch the salt. I mostly ignore him, to be honest. Too much salt makes the food taste better. Diabetes? No. Never had that. Heart problems… well, it gets a bit tight sometimes when I’m really exerting myself, but that’s just… old age, isn’t it? Terrazzo is hard work, I keep telling you. What else do you need to know about my… health? I feel fine, mostly. A bit tired, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, and occasional tightness in your chest with exertion. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones, for blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Oh, I take a little something for my knees. Something the pharmacist recommended. Glucosamine, I think it's called. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take one of those… sleeping pills. The red ones. Can’t remember the name. That’s it. Nothing for the blood pressure. Never liked taking pills, if I can avoid it. Makes me feel sluggish. Is that what you want to know? This is getting tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, glucosamine for your knees and a sleeping pill as needed. Knowing what medications you’re taking is very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I used to get hay fever when I was a boy, but that went away years ago. I can eat anything, and I've never had a reaction to any pills or anything. Honestly, I’m a pretty hardy Norwegian. We’re built tough. Is that sufficient? I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded just answering all these questions.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Orwin. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed with the pre-clearance for the procedure, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline of your current health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Oh, for goodness sake. Is that necessary? I feel perfectly fine. Honestly, poking and prodding isn't going to tell you anything you don't already know. But… I suppose if it gets my daughter off my back, I’ll let you have a look. Just be quick about it, will you? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand your concerns about time, and I will be as efficient as possible. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll just take a quick look at your general condition. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get on with it then. But don’t go digging around too much, I warn you. And be gentle! This old body isn't as resilient as it used to be. Honestly, all this fuss over a little… lifting. It’s ridiculous. Hurry up, will you? My back's starting to ache already.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Just relax for a moment. Deep breaths, if you can. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 158 over 86. I'll listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, if you wouldn’t mind opening your mouth, I’ll just take a quick look at your throat.
PATIENT: Irregular? What do you mean, irregular? Is something wrong? I told you, poking and prodding isn't going to tell you anything. I feel perfectly alright! My heart’s always been… sturdy. Get it over with. Honestly, this is becoming quite unpleasant. I haven't been this examined since... well, I can’t remember. Hurry up, will you? My neck’s getting stiff.
DOCTOR: Everything looks fine in your throat, Mr. Orwin. No swelling or redness. Your pulse is a little weak and irregular as well. Your temperature is normal. Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on this quick examination, your blood pressure is elevated, and your heart rhythm is somewhat irregular. It's good your temperature is normal. These findings, along with your history of high blood pressure, do give me some pause about proceeding with elective surgery at this moment. I want to be cautious and ensure your heart is stable before we consider any procedures. Would you be open to getting an EKG and consulting with a cardiologist before we move forward?
PATIENT: An… EKG? A cardiologist? Good heavens, no! I’m not ill! I just want a little… lifting. This is getting ridiculous. My daughter is going to be furious. All this fuss… for nothing. I feel fine! Perfectly fine! I've been working hard all my life. A bit of tightness, a bit of irregularity… that’s just old age. I don’t need poking and prodding and consultations with… specialists. Honestly, I think I'm wasting my time here. I'm going home. Tell my daughter I said… well, tell her I’m not sure. This is all a bit much. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your safety. Proceeding with elective surgery with uncontrolled high blood pressure and an irregular heart rhythm carries risks. I strongly recommend that you at least discuss these findings with your regular doctor and consider getting an EKG for a more thorough assessment. It’s a simple test that can give us valuable information. Here’s a summary of my findings, and I’ll also send a note to your primary care physician. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or change your mind. Have a good day, Mr. Orwin.
