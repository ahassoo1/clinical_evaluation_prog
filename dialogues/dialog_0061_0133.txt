DOCTOR: "Bula! Good morning, Melvenia. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It's nice to meet you as well. I just need some forms signed, really. Some papers the hospital sent me... they need 'em notarized, I think? Or verified. Something like that. I just want to get this all sorted out, if you don't mind. I don't have insurance, so it's a bit complicated.
DOCTOR: "Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can definitely help with getting those forms completed. It can be tricky navigating things without insurance. Just to be sure I understand correctly, the hospital sent you these forms and they require a healthcare professional's signature to verify some information?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Exactly. They said something about needing proof of… well, I don’t remember what exactly. Something about my health, to make sure I can handle the procedure. It's a simple one, really, just a little thing, but they’re being very strict. I just want to get it over with, you know? And the sooner these forms are done, the sooner I can schedule it.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that makes sense. And what procedure are you planning on having, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just a… a small growth removed. On my arm. It’s been there a while and the doctor said it's best to take it off. Nothing serious, honestly. I just wish they hadn't made the paperwork so complicated! It feels like more trouble than the growth itself. Do you need a lot of details about it? I can tell you what the other doctor said, but I don’t remember all the fancy medical terms.
DOCTOR: “No, no fancy terms needed at all! Just tell me what you remember the other doctor saying – anything about how long it’s been there, if it’s changed, and if it’s causing you any discomfort. And don’t worry about being precise; we can sort through it all. How long has the growth been on your arm?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It’s been… oh, probably close to a year now? Maybe a little longer. It hasn't really changed much, to be honest. It's just… there. It doesn't hurt or anything, doesn't itch, doesn't bother me at all. That's why I put off getting it checked for so long. But the other doctor said it was better to be safe, so here I am. I hope that makes sense? I'm terrible with timelines.
DOCTOR: "That makes perfect sense, Melvenia. It's good you're getting it checked out, even if it isn’t bothering you. And a year is helpful to know. Has it grown at all in the last year?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. Honestly, I barely notice it most of the time. My daughter reminded me about it just last month, she said it looked a little different, that’s why I finally made an appointment. But I really couldn’t tell the difference myself. It's small, you know? Maybe the size of a pea? A small pea. I’m probably not being very helpful with these details, am I?
DOCTOR: “You’re being very helpful, Melvenia! Every little detail helps. So, it's roughly pea-sized and your daughter noticed it potentially looking a little different recently. Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your skin anywhere else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing else. Just this little bump. I spend a lot of time in the garden, so I get a few scratches now and then, but nothing unusual. I usually just put some cream on them and they heal up fine. I haven’t noticed any new moles or anything like that, if that’s what you’re asking. Honestly, I mostly just want to get these forms signed so I can get this over with. Is this going to take long? I have a little bit of an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: "Not long at all, Melvenia. Just a few more questions, then I'll take a quick look at the growth on your arm and we can get the forms completed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like latex or certain creams?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little something for my arthritis, but that's it. And I don't use anything fancy on my skin. Just regular lotion, sometimes. I really don’t think I have any allergies. Is that okay? I sometimes forget things, you know. It's just getting old, I suppose. Would it be alright if we just skipped that part, if it's not important? I’m really trying to get this finished quickly.
DOCTOR: "Of course, Melvenia. We can certainly skip that part. It's good you haven’t had any reactions before. Now, would you mind if I just took a look at the growth on your arm?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. It's right here… . It's not very noticeable, really. But feel free to take a good look. Hopefully, it's nothing to worry about. And then we can get those forms signed, right? I’m just eager to be done with this whole thing.
DOCTOR: "Alright, Melvenia. It feels quite firm, but not particularly concerning to the touch. It doesn't appear inflamed. Do you have any history of skin cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a good question. Let me think. My mother had a mole removed, years and years ago. But I don't know if it was cancer or not. She didn't talk about it much. And my father… I don't think so. He mostly worried about his heart. Honestly, I'm not very good with family medical history. We didn't really keep track of those things back then. Can we just… get the forms signed? I feel a little silly sitting here talking about all of this. It's just a little bump, right?
DOCTOR: "Of course, Melvenia. We can definitely proceed with the form. Given the history you've provided and my examination, it appears to be a benign growth, likely a skin tag or a common mole. However, to be absolutely certain, and because you have a bit of an appointment later, I would recommend getting it biopsied. It’s a quick procedure, and will give us a definitive answer. Alternatively, if you prefer, your existing doctor who requested the forms can certainly proceed with the removal and send it for pathology."
PATIENT: Oh dear. A biopsy? That sounds… complicated. And probably expensive, right? I really just want to get it removed. I don’t have insurance, you know. Would my doctor be able to just take it off? I really don’t want to go through a lot of fuss. I’m sure it’s nothing, just a little bump. Can we just sign the forms so I can get it taken care of with him? I promise I'll go back if it starts bothering me, but right now, I think it’s just fine.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concerns, Melvenia, and I respect your wishes. Given that it’s small, doesn’t appear concerning, and you prefer to proceed with removal by your existing doctor, we can certainly complete the forms. However, I do want to be sure you understand that without a biopsy, we won’t have a definitive diagnosis. It's important to be aware of potential changes in the growth, like rapid growth, bleeding, or changes in color, and to follow up with your doctor promptly if any of those occur. To complete the forms, I’ll document my examination findings – a small, skin-colored papule on your left forearm, approximately 0.5cm in diameter, without surrounding inflammation or tenderness, and your preference for removal by your existing doctor. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Document everything, that's good. I just want to get this done, you know? And I promise, if it gets bigger or anything, I’ll go right back to the doctor. I'm just… eager to be finished. Can we sign the forms now, please? I have that appointment this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late. I really appreciate you being so understanding. It’s just a little bump, and I’m probably making a fuss over nothing. Thank you, dear.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Melvenia. We’ll get these completed right away. It’s good you’re being proactive about your health, and it’s perfectly alright to have concerns. Here you go. Please review them to ensure everything is correct. And remember, don't hesitate to contact your doctor or return if you notice any changes. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. Everything looks… fine, I suppose. I can’t read very well, you know. But I trust you. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Thank you so much for your time and your patience. You’ve been very kind. I really appreciate it. Now I can finally get this over with!
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Melvenia. I’m glad I could help. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a good day, and I hope your appointment goes smoothly.”
