DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, good to see you... or, well, to have you here. Let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Osga, is it? Yes. Right. It’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly. Just… comes and goes. It’s a nuisance, really. Makes drinking coffee… difficult.
DOCTOR: A nuisance, you say. Right. And how long is "a while"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. Months, I suppose. Maybe… six? Eight? Time gets away from you when you’re… well, when you’re my age. It's not constant, like. Some days it's barely noticeable. Others… well, others I feel like a leaf in the wind.
DOCTOR: Six to eight months. And is this shaking just in your hand, or does it affect other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Mostly the hand, yes. My right hand, specifically. Though… now that you mention it, I think I felt a little… quiver in my leg the other day. But that could have just been the cold. We had a bit of a chill. I don't rightly recall. It’s hard to say, you know? Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. No… not that I can recall. Maybe a bit tired sometimes, but that’s just… getting old, I figure. Nothing major. No pain, no dizziness, no… well, you know. Just the shaking. It’s the shaking that bothers me, mostly. Makes things… precarious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. I had some pills for my blood pressure years ago, but the doctor took me off of them. Said I didn’t need ‘em anymore. That was… oh, goodness, a long time ago now. Just a little aspirin now and then for a headache, that's it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh, dear. That’s another tricky one. I think I had a bit of a rash once after eating some shrimp, but that was years and years ago. Could have been anything, really. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things. Never had a bad reaction, so I just… eat what I want.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's have a look at your hand then. Extend your arm, please. Do you notice the shaking is worse when you’re relaxed, or when you’re trying to do something?
PATIENT: Oh, this is… awkward. Yes, alright. I… suppose it’s worse when I'm trying to do something. Like writing, or using a spoon. When I'm just… sitting, it's less noticeable. But then again, I don't do much sitting still these days. It's just a nuisance, really. Makes a man feel… less useful.
DOCTOR: Alright. It does appear you have a tremor in your right hand. It’s subtle, but it's there. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Breathe deeply for me, please. Anything unusual you’ve noticed with your breathing?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, not really. Gets a bit short sometimes, when I'm climbing stairs. But that’s just the age, I reckon. Lungs aren’t what they used to be. Used to be a good smoker, you see. Quit years ago, thankfully. Though the effects… linger, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. A history of smoking. Well. This tremor... given your age and history, it could be a number of things. Essential tremor is common. But we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a basic blood panel, including a thyroid test. We also need to check your vitamin levels.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, dear. More tests. Well, alright, if you think it’s necessary. I just want to get to the bottom of it, you know? So I can get back to… well, getting on with things. But honestly, Doctor, I don’t expect much to come of it. Just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: We’ll see. The lab results will give us a better idea. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist. They are the specialists in these sorts of things. They’ll be able to do a more thorough evaluation. Do you have any questions for me before I finish up?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh, goodness. Another doctor. Well, alright. I suppose that’s… thorough. No, not really. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I haven't got time for a lot of running around. Just want to know if it’s something serious. And if it is, what can be done about it. Is it… is it something that will get worse?
DOCTOR: It's impossible to say without further evaluation. That's why I'm referring you to the neurologist. They’ll be able to give you a more accurate prognosis and discuss treatment options. The lab results should be back in a few days. We’ll call you with the results. Here’s the form for your blood work. Please take it to the lab. And schedule an appointment with the neurologist as soon as possible. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… the shaking. It’s just… annoying. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I'll get the tests done. And schedule the appointment. Hopefully, it won’t be a long wait. I should be going. Don't want to take up any more of your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, then. Have a good day, Mr. Jezik. And don't hesitate to call if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms. .
PATIENT: .
