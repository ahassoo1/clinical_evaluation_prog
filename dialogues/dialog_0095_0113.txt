DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm… well, my wife, bless her heart, she keeps after me to come in. Says I’m going to the bathroom too much. It's… irritating, frankly. Not a big deal, really. Just old age, I suppose. Though I don’t remember exactly when it started. A while now, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good your wife is looking out for you. While it could be just age-related changes, frequent urination can sometimes indicate other things we should check. When you say "too much," can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Details? What kind of details does a man need to give about going to the bathroom? I go… more than I used to, I guess. At night, too. Waking up my wife. It’s just… a nuisance. I don’t keep a count or anything. Never have. Don’t see the point in writing down things like that. Is this going to take long? I was hoping to get back to the garden. Tomatoes need staking.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. We don’t need an exact count. Just a general sense. So, waking up at night is new?
PATIENT: Newish. It’s… happened a couple of times this summer, I think. Maybe last year too? Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Used to be able to recall everything about the farm, every single yield. Now… not so much. It’s probably just… a phase. Old men get up at night, right? My father did.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides getting up at night, are you experiencing any urgency during the day – a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: Urgency? Well, I wouldn’t say sudden. I feel like I need to go… regularly. More regularly than I used to, that is. It’s not painful, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… inconvenient. I find myself having to plan my trips to town around it, sometimes. Which is foolish, I know. A man should be able to go when he wants, not the other way around.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. No pain, just more frequent trips, even planning around it. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? It looks like… urine, Doctor. Yellow, mostly. Sometimes a bit darker if I haven’t had enough water, I suppose. I haven’t been looking at it particularly closely. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever looked at my urine closely. Is this a common thing, Doctor? Asking all these… detailed questions?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Segretto, and it's important to get a clear picture. Sometimes changes in urine color or clarity can give us clues. Okay. Now, have you noticed any difficulty starting your stream when you go to the bathroom, or a weak stream?
PATIENT: Well now you’re asking personal questions, aren’t you? No, it starts alright. Though… sometimes it’s not as… powerful as it used to be. I put that down to age too, Doctor. Everything slows down eventually. You don’t expect a tractor from the 50s to run like a new one, do you? I'm a practical man, Doctor. I know how things work.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Mr. Segretto. Just a few more questions then we can do a quick physical exam. Have you been experiencing any constipation or straining when you have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Constipation? Now what’s bowel movements got to do with my bladder? This is getting ridiculous. No, I haven’t been… irregular, if that’s what you’re asking. I eat my prunes, thank you very much. Keeps everything… flowing. Though, I suppose I haven’t been getting out to the garden as much lately. Getting old is a waste of a good body, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Last question, Mr. Segretto. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? No. Pain? As I said before, no pain. Just… annoyance. This whole thing is a waste of time, Doctor. My wife is always worrying. Fine, ask away. I'm sure you'll find nothing, but humor her, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Segretto, given your symptoms—frequent urination, getting up at night, a somewhat weak stream—it could be a number of things. Most commonly, this can be related to an enlarged prostate, which is common as men age. It’s not necessarily something to be worried about, but it’s worth checking. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and do a prostate exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… what exam? A prostate exam? Now hold on a minute. I don't like the sound of that at all. What exactly does that involve? And what good will poking around there do? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting intrusive. I came in here because my wife nagged me, not to be… examined. I think I'll just go home and drink some water.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, please sit down. I understand your discomfort. A prostate exam is a very quick and standard procedure. It allows us to feel the size and texture of your prostate gland. It's often the first step in determining the cause of urinary symptoms, and it doesn't take long at all. We can certainly skip it if you're very uncomfortable, but it would be helpful in ruling things out. If we don’t examine it, we might need to consider further testing, like a urine sample or even a referral to a urologist. I'll explain everything step-by-step, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. We can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. What do you say?
PATIENT: A urologist? Now you're talking specialists? This is getting out of hand. My wife will be thrilled. She always wants to see a specialist for every little thing. Alright, alright. But I’m warning you, Doctor. If it's uncomfortable, you stop. Immediately. And I want a clear explanation of everything you're doing before you do it. No surprises. And if it turns out to be nothing, I'm blaming you and my wife both.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. Your comfort is my priority. I promise no surprises, and we can stop at any time. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, you'll lie on your side, and I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll also be checking for any tenderness or irregularities. It will only take a couple of minutes. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable? No, it doesn’t sound acceptable. It sounds… undignified. But fine. Get it over with. Quickly. And don’t poke around too much. Just… warn me before you do anything. And try to be gentle. Honestly, at my age, a man deserves a little respect.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, abdomen sounds normal. Now, if you could just bend your knees up towards your chest… Take a deep breath... Okay, I’m just feeling your prostate now. It feels slightly enlarged, but smooth. No tenderness. Another deep breath… Alright, that’s all done. It wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: Not… enjoyable, Doctor. Let's just say that. Slightly enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious? Is it going to require… surgery? My wife will be ecstatic. She's always wanted me to have a procedure of some kind.
DOCTOR: It’s very common for the prostate to enlarge with age, Mr. Segretto. It’s called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It’s not cancer, and it’s not an infection. It’s just the gland getting bigger, which can sometimes cause the urinary symptoms you’ve been experiencing. Surgery is not always necessary. We can start with some simpler measures, like medication to help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder. We can also talk about lifestyle changes, like limiting fluids before bed and avoiding caffeine. I’d like to order a urine sample to rule out any infection and a PSA blood test, which can give us more information about your prostate. Would you be able to provide a urine sample before you leave today?
PATIENT: Medication? More tests? This is never ending. Fine. A urine sample. I suppose I can manage that. But I’m not promising I’ll be back for any more poking and prodding. And what’s this about lifestyle changes? Am I supposed to stop drinking tea? That's the only thing that gets me through the day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Segretto. The PSA test and urine sample will give us a clearer picture. As for lifestyle changes, reducing caffeine intake can help, as can limiting fluids before bedtime. Avoiding alcohol before bed might also be beneficial, and we should discuss ways to manage constipation, as that can also contribute to urinary symptoms. I’ll give you a container for the urine sample now. The lab is just down the hall. It doesn’t need to be a first-morning sample, just a mid-stream one. I’ll have the nurse give you instructions. And I’ll write a prescription for Tamsulosin, a medication that can help relax the muscles in your prostate. It may take a few weeks to see the full effects, and it can sometimes cause a little dizziness, so we'll start with a low dose. Do you have any questions about the medication or the tests?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Wonderful. Just what I need, falling over in the garden. Fine. I’ll take the medication. But if I start seeing double, I’m blaming you. And I suppose I can manage a urine sample. This whole thing is just… a lot. Can I at least get a cup of tea before I go? All this talk about limiting fluids is making me thirsty.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. Let me have the nurse bring you a cup of tea while she gets you the instructions for the urine sample. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any side effects from the medication. I'll write everything down for you, including the medication instructions and the results of your tests when they come back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you’re doing. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s enough for one day. Just… please send me a reminder about the follow-up. My memory, you know. And tell your nurse to make it a strong cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I’ll make sure the nurse sends a strong reminder, and a strong cup of tea. Take your time getting up. I’ll have the nurse bring everything to you now. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And get back to enjoying your garden!
PATIENT: .
