DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Umm... hi. Yeah. My nails. They just... look funny. Not good funny. Like, changed. I don't know what changed, exactly. Just... different. It's botherin' me, so here I am.
DOCTOR: “Changed,” you say. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What does that mean? They're not... shiny like they used to be. And kinda... thick? Not like, my thick, you know? Nail thick. And the color's weird. Not a nice pink. More... dull. Is that elaborate enough? Honestly, I don't remember what they looked like before they changed. Old people forget things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Thut. It can be frustrating when things change and it’s difficult to recall specifics. When did you first notice these changes to your nails?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Lemme think... was it before or after my cousin's birthday? She had that awful cake... no, no, that doesn't matter. Um... maybe a month ago? Give or take. Time kinda blends together, ya know? It wasn’t like overnight. Just... slowly. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: Approximately a month ago. And has anything else changed with your nails?
PATIENT: Umm... well, they feel... kinda brittle. Like they could snap if I try to, you know, do anything with 'em. Not that I do much with 'em. Just... they used to feel stronger. And sometimes... sometimes they hurt a little, right at the tips. Not bad hurt, just... annoying. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Brittle and some discomfort at the tips. Now, have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm... Oh. Well, now that you mention it... it's kinda red around a couple of 'em. Not all of 'em. Just a couple. And a little... swollen, maybe? Like bug bites, but it don’t itch. I just figured it was from washin' dishes. I use hot water, ya know. Old people like hot water.
DOCTOR: Redness and swelling around some of the nails, no itching. Do you have any known allergies, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat whatever. I don't go runnin' around sniffin' flowers or nothin'. Maybe to dust? Everyone's allergic to dust. But like, serious allergies? No. Definitely not. I don’t take no pills for it, if that makes sense. Never have.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications... Well, just my water pill. The doctor gave it to me for... somethin'. My feet swell sometimes. And... oh! My vitamin D. Gotta get my vitamin D, ya know? Old people need vitamin D. That’s about it. Just those two. I think. Maybe I have somethin' else… but I forget. See? I told ya. Old people forget.
DOCTOR: A water pill and vitamin D. Do you recall the name of the water pill, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Umm... It starts with an 'F'... I think. No, wait... 'H'? No, definitely an 'F'. Furrosemide! Yes! That's it! Furrosemide. It's a long word. I always mess it up. That's why I just say "water pill." Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: Furrosemide. Thank you for that. Now, Ms. Thut, I’m going to need to examine your nails more closely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just don’t poke 'em too hard. They're fragile, remember? And don't make a big deal outta it. It’s just nails. Not like it’s my heart or somethin'. Go ahead. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I am observing some thickening and discoloration of several nails. The color is somewhat opaque, and there's slight pitting on a few of them. As you mentioned, the surrounding skin does show some redness and mild swelling. The nail beds also appear slightly detached in a couple of areas. This could be indicative of a fungal infection, though other causes are possible. I’d like to take a small sample of the nail for testing to confirm. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fungal? Like... athlete's foot? 'Cause that sounds awful. And a sample? You mean cut it off? No! Absolutely not. I don’t wanna lose a nail over this. Are you sure you need a sample? Can’t you just… give me a cream or somethin'? I don’t like the sound of that at all. Honestly. I’m not cuttin' off no nails. It’s bad enough they’re lookin’ funny.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, the sample is a very small clipping, not the entire nail. It’s necessary for accurate diagnosis. Without it, we’re just guessing. There are several conditions that can cause changes to nails, some of which are more serious than others. A fungal infection is a common cause, and easily treatable with topical medication if that is indeed the issue. But we need to rule out other possibilities first. I understand your reluctance, but proper diagnosis is crucial. If you are absolutely opposed to the sample, I can prescribe a broad-spectrum antifungal cream, but it may not be the most effective course of action. Or, I can refer you to a dermatologist who may have alternative diagnostic methods. However, they will likely also recommend a sample. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But small, you hear me? Tiny. Like, a speck. I don't want a hole in my nail. And be gentle. And quick. I don't have all day. And honestly, if it hurts, I’m leavin’. Deal? Just get it over with. But I still think it's ridiculous. Old people shouldn’t have to deal with this kinda thing. Just give me a cream. Why does everything have to be so complicated?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. I will obtain a very small sample, and I assure you I will be as gentle as possible. It should be a quick process. I’ll prepare the necessary materials. It’s important to identify the cause of the changes, and a proper diagnosis will ensure we use the most effective treatment. Please try to relax. It will be over before you know it.
