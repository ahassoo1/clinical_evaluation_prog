DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you too. I’ve had this cough… it just won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now. And, you know, my heart… it isn’t what it used to be. That's what the other doctor said, anyway. He wanted me to come see you about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for a few weeks and some concerns about your heart. I appreciate you coming in to get things checked out. Let's start with the cough. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s mostly a dry cough, not much… well, not much coming up. It happens mostly when I lie down, especially at night. It wakes me up, and then I have to sit up for a while. Sometimes it feels like… like there’s something tickling my throat, but nothing’s there. And it doesn't seem to get better with cough drops or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dry cough, worse when lying down, waking you up at night, and not relieved by cough drops. That gives us a good starting point. Do you notice anything that makes it worse, besides lying down?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. Eating doesn't seem to bother it. Cold air? No, not particularly. Dust, maybe? I try to keep the house clean, but you know, you never really get all the dust. It just… comes and goes. Mostly it's just worse when I'm trying to sleep. It’s been a real bother, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's pretty consistent, mostly at night, and not triggered by anything specific. No fever, chills, or shortness of breath with the cough, right?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven't felt… short of breath, no. It’s just… tiring, you know? Waking up coughing all the time. And my ankles… they’ve been a little swollen lately. I didn’t know if that was connected to the cough, or… something else. The other doctor mentioned my heart again, when he noticed the swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles swelling – that is good information. And it’s smart to connect that to the heart concerns the other doctor mentioned. Let’s talk about your heart for a moment. What exactly did he say about it?
PATIENT: He said… well, he said my heart wasn’t pumping as strongly as it should. Something about it being enlarged. He gave me a water pill, to get rid of the swelling. And he told me to see you, to see if the cough was related. He said heart problems can sometimes cause a cough. I don’t remember all the big words, honestly. It was a lot to take in. He just kept saying “heart failure.” That scared me, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – "heart failure" is a scary term, but it doesn't always mean what people think. It just means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should, and there are often things we can do to manage it. Okay, so you’re on a water pill now. Has that helped with the swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Yes, the water pill… it has helped some. Not completely, but it’s definitely better. They aren’t as puffy as they were before. I take it every morning, like he said. I try to be good about it. But the cough… that hasn’t changed much, even with the pill. It’s still keeping me up at night. It feels like it’s getting worse, even.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the water pill is helping with the swelling, but the cough persists and may even be worsening. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s hard to get any rest when you’re coughing all night. I used to love gardening, but I haven’t had the energy lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, your ankles do have some swelling, as you mentioned. And when I listen to your lungs, I hear some crackles, especially at the bases. That's consistent with fluid buildup. Your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, and I can hear a murmur, which the other doctor likely noted as well. Blood pressure is 140/85, and your pulse is 82 and a bit weak. This supports the possibility of fluid overload related to heart issues contributing to your cough and shortness of breath. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to check for fluid in your lungs and an EKG to further assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. X-ray and an EKG. Whatever you need to see what's going on. I trust your judgment, Doctor. It’s just… all this feels a little overwhelming. But I want to know what’s happening, and what we can do about it. I just want to be able to sleep through the night again.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – it is a lot to take in. We'll take it one step at a time. The X-ray and EKG will give us a lot more information. While we wait for those results, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides what we've discussed?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I had high blood pressure for a long time, before this heart trouble started. They put me on medicine for that, years ago. And I had diabetes, but it’s… under control now, mostly with diet. I used to be very active, but with the coughing and the swelling, I haven’t been able to get around much. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. That was a long time ago though. Nothing else, that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, diabetes managed with diet, and gallbladder removal. Do you remember what medications you're currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have them here in my purse. Here. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… a small white pill. Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams. I think that’s all. I’ve been taking these for… oh, goodness, I don’t know, maybe ten years? Something like that. The doctor changed them a few times, over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. That's good to know. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. The doctors always ask, and I always say no. I did have a bad reaction to mosquito bites when I was a child, but that’s not a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: No, mosquito bites don't count! Okay, so no known medication allergies. Now, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My mother smoked, and it gave her terrible trouble. I always stayed away from it. And I don't drink much, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Mostly I just like to be home, tending to my plants. When I have the energy, that is. I used to be quite the gardener, you know. Roses were my favorite.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Roses are beautiful. Alright, and what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had heart trouble, like I said. She died when she was in her 70s, from it. My father was healthy, mostly. He lived to be 92, but he had diabetes towards the end. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like me. He’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s not doing so well. He lives in El Salvador. We don’t see each other much, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart trouble, high blood pressure, and diabetes. That's helpful to know. And finally, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms, anything at all that we haven’t discussed yet?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too quickly. Not very often, but it happens. And my appetite… it’s not very good lately. I used to love cooking, but now I don’t really feel like it. It’s just… hard to enjoy things when you’re feeling tired all the time. Oh, and sometimes my ankles feel… achy. Like they’re bruised, even when they’re not.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness upon standing, decreased appetite, and achy ankles. Alright, I think that covers everything for now. Let’s wait for those X-ray and EKG results, and then we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, I want you to continue taking your medications as prescribed. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness… go to the emergency room. And keep taking my pills. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just hope we can figure out what’s going on and get me feeling better soon. It’s just… hard to enjoy life when you’re feeling so tired all the time. I think I'll just wait here until the results are ready.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand completely. It’s my job to help you feel better, and we will figure this out. Let me check on the status of those tests. They shouldn’t be too much longer. In the meantime, is there anything I can get for you?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I'm alright. Just… a little anxious, I suppose. It’s just… waiting. I used to be very patient, but this is hard. I think I'll just sit quietly for a bit. Thank you again.
