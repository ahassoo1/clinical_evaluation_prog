DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... fitness check. For... referee work. Need paper say I okay. Quick, if possible? Wife… she need help at home.
DOCTOR: Right, a fitness-to-work assessment for refereeing. Understand. We can certainly do that. Just to be thorough, even for a quick check-up, I'll need to ask you a few questions, and do a brief physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Questions first, then… quick look. Faster that way, right? I not good at… standing around. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Yes, questions first is fine. No need to apologize. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No… nothing like that. Always healthy. Wife always say I work too much. She… she liked when I rest. But... not much time for rest, you know? Just normal aches, old age maybe. No doctor ever say anything bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never need. Small cuts, scrapes... from work. But nothing big. Just… fixed myself. Always.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family…? Wife… she passed last year. Cancer. Very fast. No kids. Her parents… both gone now too. Old. That’s it. Just… wife. Always wife. Sorry. Is okay to talk about this? It… hard.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand this is difficult, and you absolutely don’t need to talk about anything you’re not comfortable with. It's perfectly alright if you'd rather skip this part. However, knowing a bit about your family's health history can sometimes be helpful. But truly, it’s up to you.
PATIENT: No… okay. Her mother… had problems with heart. Old age. Doctor say… something about “blockage”. She take pills. That’s all I know. Her father… healthy. Strong man. Always work. My side… I don’t know. Never meet them. Always away at work. Sorry. Is that enough? Can we just… finish?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. We can move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Eat anything. Take anything. Never had problem. Wife… she had some. Nuts, I think. But not me. Never. Is good. Simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Never need. Maybe… pain killer sometimes. For back. From work. But just when very bad. Not… every day. Now… not take anything. Just… try to move. It help a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. That gives me a good starting point. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your reflexes. Just a standard check, nothing to worry about. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Quick. Please. Blood pressure first? That… fast, right? I have things to do. Wife… she needs… never mind. Just… quick.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood pressure first. It’ll only take a moment. Relax your arm, please. Okay, that's 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath. Like this? Is okay? Hurts a little… old work injury. Chest. But I… I work through it. Always.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. I do hear some mild crackles in your lungs, especially on the lower left side. And I can feel a slight tenderness when I press here, on your chest. This is likely related to the old work injury you mentioned. Do you experience any pain with that when you’re active?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes. When I lift heavy things. Or… when I run. Not much. I just… ignore it. Always ignore it. Wife say I should stop. But… need the money. Need to help. Is everything okay? Can we just finish? I have to go. Really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand you're busy and want to get back to your wife. However, the crackles in your lungs and the tenderness in your chest, combined with your history of ignoring pain… it does raise some concerns. I want to be thorough. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Standing. But… is everything okay? You make me worry. Wife… she worry too. Always. What… what is wrong? Just tell me. Quick, please. I not good at… waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a quick look at your reflexes. And I'm going to listen to your back, just to check your lungs again. It's possible this could be something like old pleurisy, or a lingering effect from the chest injury. But to be sure, I’d like to get a chest X-ray. It’s a quick procedure, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Money… X-ray cost money, right? Wife… she can’t afford… I can’t afford. Is… is it bad? If just old injury… just ignore it. Like always. No X-ray. Please. Just say okay. Just say I good enough for referee. That’s all I need. I have to go. Really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand your concerns about the cost, and I’ll see what we can do to work with your insurance. But ignoring this could lead to something more serious down the line. Crackles in the lungs aren’t normal, and we need to rule out things like pneumonia or fluid buildup. I'm not comfortable signing off on a fitness-to-work assessment without getting this checked out first. It’s my responsibility to ensure your health and safety. I'm recommending a chest X-ray, and I also think you should see a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – for a proper evaluation. We can discuss payment options with the hospital and see if there are any assistance programs available. I want to help you, but I can’t compromise on your health. For now, I cannot recommend you for referee work without further investigation. I’m sorry, but it's the medically responsible thing to do. .
