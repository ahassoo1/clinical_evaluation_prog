DOCTOR: Right. Zelina Ambris, 18 years old. Good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It's… my breath. It smells bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband definitely made it clear. Not that he ever had fresh breath, mind you.
DOCTOR: I see. Bad breath…halitosis, as we call it. And it’s prompted a visit today. Well, we can certainly address that. It’s good you’re taking it seriously – it can be a sign of other things, you know. Although, often it’s quite simple. Before we jump to conclusions, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, “other things”? Don’t tell me it’s something awful. Honestly, I just want it gone. I brush, okay? Sometimes. And I… I don’t really know what else I’m supposed to do. It's not like I need a lecture on hygiene. It just is.
DOCTOR: Right. No lectures, I assure you. But “sometimes” brushing isn’t exactly… optimal. It’s like maintaining a car – you can’t just wash it occasionally and expect it to run perfectly. Let’s try to be precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Look, I work highway maintenance, okay? It's not exactly a glamorous job. Dust, dirt, exhaust… I don’t have time for a perfect routine. And frankly, it’s not like I’m trying to impress anyone. It’s just… embarrassing. Do I have to explain every single detail of my life?
DOCTOR: Highway maintenance… interesting. So, exposure to environmental factors is likely a contributing element. And you say you brush… how often, specifically?
PATIENT: Fine. When I remember. Usually… every other day? Look, is this going somewhere, or are we just going to interrogate me about my dental habits? I have things to do, you know. It's not like I enjoy sitting here explaining myself.
DOCTOR: “Every other day.” Right. And do you use anything besides a toothbrush?
PATIENT: Ugh. Floss? No. Mouthwash? Sometimes, when I can find it. Look, I'm not a dentist. I just want something to make it stop smelling. It's really not that complicated. Are you going to give me a miracle cure or not?
DOCTOR: A “miracle cure” is unlikely. And frankly, your current routine – or lack thereof – is… suboptimal. We need to establish a baseline. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I don't have a fever. I'm not coughing up blood. Look, it's just bad breath, okay? It's not like I'm dying. Are you trying to find something else wrong with me? I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: I'm simply trying to gather information. Dry mouth?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. Especially when it's hot out there on the highway. Dust gets everywhere, makes you thirsty. I drink water, but… it's not like I'm carrying a gallon with me all day. Is that important? Honestly, I feel like you’re trying to trick me into admitting something.
DOCTOR: Dry mouth, exacerbated by environmental factors. Alright. And do you experience any… unusual tastes in your mouth?
PATIENT: Ugh, no! Just… the taste of dust, usually. And sometimes whatever I ate for lunch. Look, are you going to actually do something, or are we just going to keep playing twenty questions? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a quick examination. Open wide, please. I'm going to take a look at your oral cavity. And try not to be so… resistant. It makes my job more difficult.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Hmm. As suspected. Mild gingivitis, some debris on the tongue. Your oral hygiene is… less than ideal. No obvious cavities, thankfully. Now, let’s check your lymph nodes. No significant swelling. Alright. Now, I want you to say “Ah.” Lungs sound clear. Right. It appears your halitosis is likely due to poor oral hygiene and a dry mouth environment. The gingivitis is contributing, and the dry mouth provides a breeding ground for bacteria.
PATIENT: So… you’re saying I need to brush more? Great. Revolutionary. Is that it? Can I go now? This is exactly what I expected. A lecture.
DOCTOR: It’s more nuanced than simply “brushing more.” You need to brush twice daily, with fluoride toothpaste. And you absolutely need to floss. Daily. Furthermore, I recommend a tongue scraper to remove bacteria from the tongue. As for the dry mouth, increase your water intake considerably, and consider using a fluoride mouthwash. I’m writing a prescription for a fluoride mouthwash. It will help to combat the bacteria and strengthen your enamel. Do you have any allergies to fluoride?
PATIENT: Fluoride? No, I don't think so. Look, can I just get the prescription and go? This is… honestly, I don't have time for a science lesson. And I really don't want to be here any longer than I have to be. This whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the prescription. Follow the instructions carefully. And I strongly advise you to establish a regular dental check-up. See a dentist every six months. I’m also going to give you a printout outlining proper brushing and flossing techniques. And perhaps a reminder of the importance of hydration. I’m not going to waste any more of either of our time on this elementary matter. Any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Thanks. I'm leaving now. Don't bother calling. .
