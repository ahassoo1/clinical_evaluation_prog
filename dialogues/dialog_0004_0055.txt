DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about this medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been going on and on about it. Says it’ll help with… things. Frankly, I’m not entirely sure what things, but she insists I look into getting a… a certificate. It sounds rather… modern.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, yes. It is becoming more common. And your daughter is correct, a certificate is required. Before we proceed with that, though, I need to understand why you’re considering it. "Things" is a bit vague, Ms. Ranells. Could you elaborate on what symptoms or conditions you're hoping to address?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? It's the aches. Just… everything aches. I used to be quite the dancer, you know. Ballroom. But that was… decades ago. Now, getting out of a chair is a production. And the sleep. Oh, the sleep. Or lack thereof. I toss and turn, wake up feeling like I haven’t slept a wink. My husband, Harold, he snores like a… well, never mind. It doesn’t help. It just doesn’t help. I suppose that’s what my daughter meant. The aches and the… unsettled nights.
DOCTOR: Aches and difficulty sleeping. And you’ve noticed this progressively worsening over time, I presume?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely progressively. It didn’t happen overnight, Doctor. It’s been… a slow decline, really. Each year a little worse than the last. I try to keep active, you know, walk around the house, do a little gardening when the weather permits, but it’s just… harder and harder. And the pain medication the other doctor gave me? It barely touches it, and it makes me terribly… sluggish. I much prefer to feel something, even if it’s discomfort, than to feel… nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Sluggishness is a common complaint with some of the stronger analgesics. And you said another doctor prescribed this medication?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Dr. Abernathy. He retired last year, moved down to Florida, I believe. A perfectly nice man, but… he was always rather quick to prescribe things. I haven't seen a doctor regularly since he left. Harold insists I’m fine, just getting old, but… well, I’m not entirely convinced. It’s simply not living when you’re constantly aching and counting the minutes until bedtime.
DOCTOR: I see. Limited records from Dr. Abernathy's office. Alright. And just to clarify, Ms. Ranells, where specifically are you experiencing the aches?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, Doctor, truly. But mostly in my joints. My knees, my hips, my lower back… and my hands. They get terribly stiff in the mornings. Makes it difficult to do even the simplest things, like buttoning my blouse or… well, you understand. And sometimes it radiates up my arms, a dull throbbing ache. It’s not… sharp, thankfully, but it’s constant. Just a persistent annoyance. Harold says I should just accept it. Men… they never understand.
DOCTOR: Joint pain in the knees, hips, lower back, and hands, radiating up the arms. Constant, dull throbbing ache, worse in the mornings. And you've tried over-the-counter pain relievers as well?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Plenty of them. Ibuprofen, naproxen… the usual. They take the edge off, perhaps, for a short while, but it always comes back. And frankly, I’m not sure I want to be taking pills constantly. It feels… unhealthy. I prefer a more… natural approach, if possible. That's why my daughter suggested this marijuana, isn't it? A bit… unconventional, I admit, but she assures me it's quite safe. Though I must say, I find the whole process rather… complicated. All these regulations and certificates… it’s a far cry from a simple cup of chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: It is a process, yes. And it’s important to understand that medical marijuana isn't a cure-all, Ms. Ranells. It can provide symptom relief for some, but it doesn't address the underlying cause of the pain. Before we proceed, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of the extent of the joint involvement and rule out any other potential issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Of course. A physical exam sounds perfectly sensible. I wouldn’t want to go rushing into anything without knowing what we're dealing with. Though I do hope it doesn't involve too much… bending. My knees aren't what they used to be, you see. Harold will be terribly upset if I can't get up afterwards. He's always so protective. Though sometimes, I suspect it's more about him being inconvenienced than about me. But never mind. Yes, let's do the exam. Just… gently, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll take it slow and gently. Please, if at any point you feel any discomfort, let me know immediately. Alright, Ms. Ranells. Let's start with your knees. Could you please lie down on the table?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, this table is rather… cold. Harold always has the house at a perfectly comfortable temperature. He’s a man of habit, you see. Everything just so. It’s… reassuring, in a way. But back to the knees, yes. Do you want me to bend them? It might be… difficult. And please, don’t be alarmed if I make a noise or two. They do tend to… creak a bit. Old age, you know. It’s a terrible thing. Though Harold says I should be grateful for every day. He’s a good man, truly. A bit… rigid, perhaps, but good nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. I’m feeling some mild tenderness on the inside of both knees, and there's some restriction in your range of motion. You’re right, there is some crepitus – a grating sensation – when I move them. That's common with some degree of joint wear and tear. Now, let's check your hips. Could you please bend your knees and let me rotate your legs slightly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… not entirely comfortable, Doctor. It feels a bit… tight, you see? Like something is… stuck. Harold always says I need to stretch more, but frankly, I haven’t the energy. It’s exhausting just getting through the day. He does mean well, truly. He just… doesn’t understand the aches, you see? It’s not just a matter of stretching. It’s… deeper than that. I suppose I should try harder, though. For Harold’s sake. But honestly, Doctor, is this normal? Is this just… old age? It feels so… debilitating. And the thought of living like this for the rest of my life… it’s rather… depressing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. There's some restriction and discomfort with the internal rotation of both hips, and some tenderness in the muscles surrounding them. We’re seeing a pattern of limited range of motion and tenderness in several joints. Now, just a quick assessment of your hands. Could you please make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… not easy, Doctor. They're rather… stiff, you see? And sore. Especially at the base of my thumb. It makes it difficult to do even the simplest things, like opening a jar or… buttoning my blouse. Harold always says I should use those rubber grips on everything, but frankly, they’re rather unsightly. He’s a man of aesthetics, you see. Everything must be just so. But back to my hands… is this arthritis, Doctor? Is that what’s happening? My mother had it terribly. She couldn’t even hold a teacup in her later years. The thought of ending up like that… it’s rather frightening. And if this is arthritis, will this… marijuana, really help? Or is it just a false hope?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. I’m noting some swelling and tenderness at the base of your thumbs and in the joints closer to your knuckles. There's some restriction and crepitus when you move them, and I see some small bony bumps on the joints furthest away from your knuckles – those are called Heberden’s nodes. Based on my examination, it does appear you have some degree of osteoarthritis in your hands, knees and hips. Now, osteoarthritis is a progressive condition, and it's common to experience pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion as it worsens. The marijuana may offer some symptom relief, particularly with pain and inflammation, but it won’t reverse the underlying condition. It's important to have realistic expectations. Before we discuss the possibility of a certificate, I want to review your past medical history, any medications you are currently taking, and your family history. Could you tell me a bit more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I haven’t been terribly ill, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains, I suppose. I had the flu once, many years ago, and a touch of bronchitis, but nothing serious. I don’t take any medications regularly, except for a little ibuprofen now and then, when the aches get really bad. Harold is terribly particular about not taking pills, you see. He believes in natural remedies. As for family history… my mother, as I mentioned, had arthritis terribly. She ended up with gnarled hands and couldn't do a thing for herself in her later years. My father, he had high blood pressure, and a touch of diabetes, I believe. But other than that, we’re a fairly healthy family. Though I do suspect the aches are hereditary. They run in the family, you see. It's just… a fact of life. So, what do you think, Doctor? Is this marijuana worth trying? Or am I just wasting my time and money?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. Given your history of osteoarthritis, and your discomfort with long-term medication use, medical marijuana could be a reasonable option to explore. However, it’s important to understand that it’s not a cure, and its effectiveness varies from person to person. We’ll also need to consider potential side effects and interactions, though they are generally mild. Before we proceed with a certificate, I recommend we start with a trial of physical therapy. Strengthening the muscles around your joints can help to stabilize them and reduce pain. I can write you a referral to a reputable physical therapist in the area. If physical therapy doesn’t provide sufficient relief, or if you’d prefer to pursue medical marijuana as a first step, we can discuss the process of obtaining a certificate and finding a qualified dispensary. Would you like me to write you a referral for physical therapy first?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… Harold always said I should do more exercise. He’s terribly insistent about maintaining an active lifestyle. But frankly, Doctor, it sounds… exhausting. And painful. I already ache all over, the thought of deliberately making it worse… But I suppose it’s worth a try. If it can help me avoid taking more pills, and if Harold thinks it's a good idea… Yes, Doctor. Please write me a referral for physical therapy. Perhaps it will help. Though I’m not terribly optimistic. But thank you for considering my case. And thank you for listening. It’s… comforting to finally talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Ranells. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad you feel comfortable discussing this with me. I’m writing a referral to [Name of Clinic], they have a good reputation and specialize in osteoarthritis management. I’ll also include some information on exercises you can start at home, focusing on gentle range of motion and strengthening. I recommend scheduling an initial evaluation with the physical therapist as soon as possible. They’ll assess your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your patience and your understanding. I suppose I should call Harold and tell him about this. He’ll want to know. He always wants to know. Yes, I should probably call him. And then I’ll call the clinic and schedule an appointment. It sounds… daunting, but I suppose I have to start somewhere. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve given me something to think about. And perhaps… a little bit of hope.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Ranells. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, keep me updated on your progress. I wish you all the best. .
