DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it's been my stomach, mostly. Lower part, you see. It’s been hurting, and it comes and goes. Quite severe when it does come, though. It’s… difficult to explain exactly when it started, truthfully. Things just… blur these days, you know? I do know it's been happening more frequently lately.
DOCTOR: More frequently, okay. Right. And when you say severe… on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you put it when it is bad?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. A scale, you say? That's… precise. Let me see. When it’s truly awful… I suppose… eight? Perhaps even nine, on a bad day. It feels like… a twisting, a cramping… and it takes my breath away. It’s not a constant eight or nine, mind you, just when it flares up. It's hard to recall the details precisely.
DOCTOR: Eight or nine… alright. And is anything specific making it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a good question. I… honestly, I don’t know. I’ve not been able to pinpoint anything specific. Eating doesn’t seem to matter, nor does… activity. It just happens. Sometimes it seems worse after I’ve been resting, other times when I’m up and about. It's all rather confusing, to be frank. Is that… helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not particularly. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh! Bowel habits… Well, that’s… a personal question, isn’t it? I suppose… they've been a bit… irregular. Sometimes I feel quite… blocked up, other times… the opposite. But I wouldn’t say it always coincides with the pain, if that makes sense. It's difficult to connect the dots, you see. I do apologize for not being more clear.
DOCTOR: It’s fine, it’s fine. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes. Not with every episode of pain, but… when it’s particularly bad, I do get quite nauseous. And occasionally… I’ve been sick, yes. It doesn't happen often, thankfully, but it’s unpleasant when it does. It’s… a rather violent sort of sickness, I must say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood…? I… I don’t recall specifically. Now that you mention it, there was… a time, perhaps a month or so ago, when I noticed… something. It wasn’t a large amount, and it was… darker in color. But I dismissed it as… perhaps something I ate? I truly don’t know. I’m not good at remembering these things, you see. It’s… quite unsettling to think about.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, weight loss… Now that’s a good question. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, I confess. But my clothes do feel a bit looser than they used to. As for fever and chills… I haven’t taken my temperature recently, but I have felt rather fatigued lately. A sort of bone-deep weariness, you see. It's not a constant thing, but it's there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, Ms. Glymph. Lie down on the table, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and feel around a bit. It's probably just gas, but we need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I do hope it’s nothing serious. I do try to take care of myself, you see. Just… these things seem to come on without warning.
DOCTOR: Alright, lie flat. Okay… normal bowel sounds… a little tenderness here… and here. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, Doctor, there. That’s… quite tender. Right there, on my left side. It’s… a dull ache, but it sharpens when you press. It’s not excruciating, but it’s definitely… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about here?
PATIENT: Oh… That’s… a little less painful, actually. Still tender, but… not as sharp as on my left side. It’s… difficult to describe. It feels… almost like a pulling sensation. I do apologize for not being more precise, Doctor. I’m not very good at these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms – the abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, fatigue, possible weight loss, and tenderness… it could be a number of things. Diverticulitis is a possibility, especially with the left-sided pain. But we need to rule out other things. I'm going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The CT scan will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, a CT scan… That sounds… rather serious. But if it will help to determine what’s wrong… then of course. Allergies to dye…? I don’t think so. I’ve had scans before, quite a long time ago, and I don’t recall any reaction. But… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I would need to check with my daughter, perhaps. She keeps a record of my medical history.
DOCTOR: We can ask her. For now, let's proceed assuming no allergy. I'll also have the lab check for inflammation. I'm going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist. They're the specialists for these kinds of issues. We need to get this checked out thoroughly, Ms. Glymph. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it's best to be cautious.
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist… That sounds… sensible. I do appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. I’ve always found it best to err on the side of caution. And thank you for being patient with me. I do apologize for being a bit… vague at times. It's just… things aren't always clear in my mind these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab requisition and referral are printing now. Avoid heavy meals for 24 hours before the CT scan, and drink plenty of water. If you develop a fever, severe pain, or nausea and vomiting, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. No heavy meals, plenty of water… and go to the emergency room if I experience fever, severe pain, or sickness. I think I have that. Though, if you wouldn’t mind, perhaps you could write that down as well? Just to be certain? My daughter is very good at keeping track of things, you see, and it would ease my mind to have it in writing.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a simplified summary. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh! That's… wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. That will be very helpful indeed. Hmm… I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. I do appreciate your patience and kindness. I believe that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the tests done as soon as possible. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Ms. Glymph.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I will. And I appreciate your help very much. Have a good day to you as well, Doctor. And thank you again for your kindness. It means a great deal.
