DOCTOR: Alright, Reneisha, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Gorga. It’s… well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained a considerable amount, rather suddenly, and it’s quite concerning. I haven’t altered my diet or exercise routine, and yet… here we are.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight gain… and no changes to diet or exercise. Right. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, approximately two months now. It wasn’t a dramatic shift at first, perhaps a pound or two, but it’s accelerated in the last few weeks. I can recall the exact date I noticed it – June 6th, to be precise. I weighed myself then, and it was… 168 pounds. Now, it’s considerably more.
DOCTOR: June 6th… 168 to… what are you at now, roughly?
PATIENT: Just this morning, Doctor. I weighed myself before leaving home, and it was 185. It’s… unsettling. I do apologize for the exact numbers; I tend to be quite meticulous. My husband teases me about it, but I find it helps to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, 185… that is a noticeable jump in two months. Any other changes you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. I’ve been feeling… rather fatigued, actually. Not constantly, but more easily tired than usual. And perhaps a little… colder. I find myself reaching for a sweater even when the house is perfectly warm. I don’t know if that’s related, but it’s a change. My husband has noticed my skin seems… drier, as well.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, feeling colder, drier skin… Okay. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing diagnosed, to my knowledge. I’ve always been… remarkably healthy, if I may say so. I did have a bout of bronchitis when I was a child, and a rather unpleasant flu last winter, but nothing chronic. I haven’t had any surgeries, or spent any significant time in the hospital. My family… my mother had some issues with her knees, but nothing else particularly noteworthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I’ve never experienced a reaction to any medication, and I eat… well, I eat quite a varied diet. I enjoy cooking, so I experiment with different foods quite often. I haven’t noticed any sensitivities or intolerances, no. I do recall trying shellfish once, years ago, but I didn’t particularly care for the taste, so it wasn’t an allergy, simply a matter of preference.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as the sunlight is… limited in Lithuania, naturally. But that’s been discontinued for some time now, as it’s August. I truly haven't taken anything regularly for quite a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Reneisha, it sounds like we need to do a little bit of investigating to figure out what's going on. I’d like to do a basic physical exam, and maybe run some blood tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. I understand. Whatever you deem necessary, I am happy to cooperate. I would appreciate knowing what the tests are for, if you don’t mind, simply for my own understanding. Though, I trust your judgement implicitly.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll start with your height and weight, just to confirm. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and take a look at your skin. The blood tests will help us check your thyroid function, basic metabolic panel, and rule out anything obvious. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… a very thorough approach, Doctor. I appreciate that. I confess, I am a little anxious, naturally, but I feel… reassured knowing you are being so methodical. I’m ready when you are. I do hope it won't take too long, as my husband is expecting me home for dinner. He’s preparing a roast.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get started then. We’ll try to be as quick as possible. First, let’s step on the scale... just to verify the number you mentioned.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I do hope it hasn't fluctuated too much since this morning. One never knows, do one?
DOCTOR: Hmm… 186. Not a huge difference. Okay. And your height?
PATIENT: I believe it’s 155 centimeters, Doctor. I haven’t grown in… well, decades, I should think. Though, I do try to maintain good posture. My mother always said it was important.
DOCTOR: Okay, 155 centimeters. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just loosen your blouse a bit…
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, proceed. I do hope I am not being too… cumbersome. I sometimes feel a little awkward during these examinations. My apologies. I suppose it’s simply unfamiliar.
DOCTOR: Okay… heart sounds are regular, a little bit… distant, but no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally, normal breath sounds. Now, I'm just going to feel your thyroid gland… A little bit enlarged, but no nodules that I can detect right now. Okay. We'll need some bloodwork to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? That is… concerning. My mother had some trouble with her thyroid later in life, though it wasn't the same… she had difficulty swallowing, if I recall correctly. I haven’t experienced that. And the bloodwork… what specifically will it reveal? Will it show… what I should be anticipating? I apologize for my numerous questions, Doctor. I simply prefer to be informed.
DOCTOR: No, no apologies at all. It's good to be informed. The bloodwork will primarily look at your thyroid hormone levels – TSH, T4, T3. These will tell us if your thyroid is functioning properly. We'll also check a basic metabolic panel to rule out other causes for your weight gain and fatigue. The enlargement we felt could be a number of things, benign or otherwise. The blood work will help guide us to the appropriate next steps. I'll have the lab technician draw a few vials. Do you have any known issues with blood draws?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no known issues with blood draws. Though I confess, I do find them… unpleasant. But I manage. I simply… dislike needles. I haven't fainted, or anything dramatic. Just a slight aversion. And TSH, T4, T3… are those numbers that fluctuate greatly? Is there a “normal” range? And you mentioned other causes… what else could explain this sudden weight gain, apart from thyroid issues? I do apologize again for the relentless questioning; I simply wish to understand the possibilities.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Reneisha. It’s perfectly reasonable to ask questions. TSH, T4, and T3 can fluctuate, but we’ll look at the trend, not just a single number. There is a normal range, and we’ll compare your results to that. As for other causes… things like Cushing’s syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome – though less common – can contribute to weight gain. And sometimes, it’s simply a matter of fluid retention. We’ll rule out the more serious causes first. Let’s get the blood work done, and then we’ll discuss the results and formulate a plan. I’ll have the technician come in and draw the samples. It’ll just be a few minutes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your patience and thorough explanations. I do appreciate your reassurance. Fluid retention… that is… plausible, I suppose. I do find my ankles swell slightly at the end of the day. Let’s proceed with the bloodwork, then. I trust your judgment implicitly. I am ready when the technician is.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll be right back after the lab technician takes care of you. .
