DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time for pleasantries. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and my face feels… droopy on that side. It's quite obvious, really. I expect you to know what that means.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are definitely concerning symptoms, and you’re right to seek medical attention quickly. It is important to figure out what’s going on. To get a better understanding, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed these symptoms this morning?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? I haven’t the foggiest idea of the exact time. I woke up, went to get some water, and that's when I realised something was wrong. It wasn't like a gradual thing. Just… there. And it's rather alarming, if you must know. Do you really need a precise minute? I have other things to worry about.
DOCTOR: No, no, a precise minute isn’t necessary at all. Just trying to get a general timeframe. So, it was upon waking this morning that you noticed both the hearing loss and the facial drooping?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Both at the same time. I didn't wake up with a gradual loss of hearing or a slowly drooping face, if that's what you're fishing for. It was… simultaneous. Honestly, it’s quite unsettling. Are you going to actually do something, or just ask me endless questions? My time is valuable, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Stephane. I am gathering information, and it’s a crucial step in determining the best course of action. Simultaneous onset of hearing loss and facial drooping is very important information. Before we proceed with an examination, could you describe the facial drooping a bit more?
PATIENT: Ugh. It’s… the whole side of my face. It just… hangs. The corner of my mouth, my eyelid, everything. It’s not a subtle thing, Doctor. It’s obvious. And frankly, it’s rather frightening to look at. Do you need me to make faces or something? Honestly, it feels… strange. Like half my face is going to fall off. Is this serious? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for describing that. It sounds quite concerning, and I appreciate you sharing how frightening this is for you. It is serious, and we need to investigate this promptly. What I'm thinking is potentially Bell's Palsy, but it could be something else, and it's important to rule those things out. I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam now. I'll check your facial strength, reflexes, and sensation. This will help me narrow down the possibilities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Neurological exam? Fine, get on with it. But be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. And I really don’t want anyone poking around in my ear. I have a very low tolerance for that sort of thing. Just… do whatever you need to do and tell me what’s wrong. Straightforward answers, please. No medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No unnecessary poking, I promise. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll primarily be observing your facial movements and testing your strength. I’ll also ask you to follow simple commands. I’ll explain each step as I go. First, can you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: Done. Now what? It feels rather… exposed, having to close my eyes on command. Is this going to take long? And are you sure you're not going to stick anything in my ears? I repeat, no instruments near my ears.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I see. And you’re right to ask, and I reiterate – no instruments will go in your ears. I promise. I’m just checking the strength of the muscles around your eye. Now, can you try to raise your eyebrows as high as you can?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's… difficult, actually. One side doesn't seem to cooperate. It feels… strange. Is this proving your… theory? Frankly, I find this whole experience rather undignified. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Thank you. You are right to point that out. That is certainly something we need to investigate further. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that what you wanted? A grotesque parody of a smile? It feels… ridiculous. Honestly, Doctor, this is quite alarming. Are you going to tell me what’s going on, or are you going to keep making me perform these… circus tricks? I need answers. Now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Stephane. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this feels undignified. It's important to gather all the information I can to arrive at the best diagnosis. Based on what I’ve seen so far – the sudden onset of hearing loss, the facial drooping, and the asymmetry in your facial movements – the most likely diagnosis at this point is Bell’s Palsy. However, we need to rule out other, more serious causes first. Bell’s Palsy is a temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It’s often caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. While frightening, it often resolves on its own within weeks to months with appropriate treatment. But we need to confirm this with further testing. I’d like to order an MRI of the brain to rule out a stroke or tumor. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: MRI? Fine. Whatever it takes to get this sorted. Weeks to months? You expect me to walk around looking like this for weeks? Unacceptable. What kind of "treatment" are we talking about? And is it… painful? I have a very low tolerance for pain, Doctor. And frankly, I don’t have time for endless appointments. Just tell me what needs to be done, and how long it will take. I need to get back to my life. This is… inconvenient, to say the least. And if it is Bell's Palsy, can you fix it? Immediately? I have responsibilities, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. Walking around with facial weakness is certainly difficult, and I’ll do everything I can to expedite the process. An MRI will help us rule out other, more serious causes. It's a painless imaging scan that takes about 30-60 minutes. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning. For Bell’s Palsy, the primary treatment is usually a course of corticosteroids – that’s a type of medication to reduce inflammation – combined with antiviral medication. These are typically taken orally for a week or so. We'd also discuss eye drops to keep your eye moist, as the weakness can affect your ability to blink and protect your eye. While we can’t guarantee an immediate fix, early treatment with corticosteroids significantly improves the chances of a full recovery. Most people do recover completely within weeks to months, but it can take longer in some cases. Physical therapy can also help strengthen the facial muscles. I'll write you a prescription for the initial course of corticosteroids and schedule the MRI for tomorrow morning. We'll discuss the results and a more detailed treatment plan once we have them. Do you have any allergies or other medical conditions I should be aware of before prescribing the corticosteroids?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Other medical conditions… I’m a widow. Does that count? I had a rather nasty bout of influenza last winter, but that’s long past. No, nothing else. Just… get on with it. I need that prescription. And schedule the MRI. Quickly. I have a life, you know. And I really don't want to be walking around like this any longer than necessary. Let’s just… get this over with. Is there anything else you need to know? Because I’m rapidly losing patience. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is the prescription for the corticosteroids and the MRI appointment details. The MRI is scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. To summarize, we've discussed the likely diagnosis of Bell’s Palsy, the treatment plan with corticosteroids, and the need for an MRI to rule out other causes. I will also give you some information sheets on Bell’s Palsy and how to protect your eye. Please call the office immediately if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or develop any new ones. And don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for your patience, Stephane. .
