DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Obarr, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you. I’m Norval. Truth be told, I don’t really like coming to doctors, but my wife, Elsie, she insisted. I just… I get full awful quick now, even when I haven’t eaten much. It’s been botherin’ me for a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval, I understand. It’s good of Elsie to encourage you to get it checked out. Feeling full quickly, even with a small amount of food, is definitely something we should look into. When you say “a little while”, roughly how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe three, four months ago? At first, I didn’t pay it much mind, thought it was just a bit of a funny spell. But it’s happenin’ more and more often now, and it’s startin’ to worry me a bit. Especially when I try to enjoy a nice meal with Elsie.
DOCTOR: Three or four months, alright. And has it been gradually getting worse, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn’t sudden like. Just… slowly gettin' harder to eat a full plate. Used to be able to polish off a good serving of salmon and potatoes, no problem. Now… a few bites and I feel like I’ve had enough. It’s a bit of a shame, really. Elsie makes a mean salmon.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when something like that impacts enjoying meals, especially with someone you love. Besides feeling full quickly, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I’ve been a bit more tired lately. Just generally feelin’ run down, you know? Not like sick-tired, just… sluggish. And sometimes, after I eat – even just a little – my stomach feels a bit bloated. Not painful, just… full and uncomfortable. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all important information, thank you for telling me. The fatigue and bloating are definitely things we need to consider. Do you have any nausea or vomiting at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no sickness at all. Not a bit. It’s just the feelin’ full, the tiredness, and that uncomfortable bloatin’ afterward. I don't get heartburn or anything like that either. It’s… well, it's mostly just annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the lack of nausea, vomiting and heartburn. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of a bad flu when I was a boy, but nothing serious. Elsie keeps tellin’ me I should’ve gotten that prostate thing checked a while back, but I never got around to it. Other than that, I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never been under the knife. Always avoided it if I could. My father used to say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” I always figured he was right.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Let's talk about your family. Is there any history of cancer, digestive problems, or other significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had a bit of trouble with her stomach when she got older, but the doctor said it was just age. My father, he lived to be a good age, healthy as a horse, mostly. My brother, Harold… he had some heart trouble, but that was years ago. Nothing else springs to mind, really. We weren't a family that talked much about illnesses, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, goodness. Well, I’ve been married to Elsie for… oh, sixty-two years now. Best thing that ever happened to me, that was. I used to work on the docks, unloading fish, but I retired about twenty years ago. Now, I mostly just potter around the garden, read my paper, and spend time with Elsie and the grandkids. I don’t drink much anymore, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Never smoked.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Norval. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Elsie’s always sayin’ I should write these things down, but I never got around to it. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat just about anything, which is good, 'cause I like to try new things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. They get a bit creaky in the cold weather. It’s just ibuprofen, the regular kind you can buy at the drugstore. And Elsie gives me a multivitamin every day, says I need it to keep my strength up. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, just ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. Elsie always said I should listen to the doctors, so I suppose I best.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Obarr. Your vital signs are within normal limits. I did notice some tenderness when I pressed on your upper left abdomen. It's mild, but we should investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work to check your liver function, pancreas enzymes, and complete blood count. We might also consider an upper endoscopy to get a better look at your stomach and esophagus, but let’s start with the blood work first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Blood work sounds sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Upper endoscopy… that sounds a bit more serious, doesn’t it? Let’s definitely start with the blood work and see what that says. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. For now, I wouldn't make any drastic changes to your diet. Continue eating what you normally do. However, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. And avoid lying down immediately after eating, as that can sometimes worsen the feeling of fullness. I’ll also give you a requisition form for the blood work. You can take it to the lab downstairs. They’ll call us with the results in a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them to discuss the next steps. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Smaller meals, don’t lie down after eating… I can manage that. And I’ll head downstairs for the blood work right after this. Thank you for explainin’ it all so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or unintentional weight loss, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Here's the requisition form and a pamphlet about managing fullness after meals. I’ll have the nurse come in to give you a copy of your visit summary before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything wonderfully, Doctor. Thank you again for takin’ the time to listen to me and explain things so clearly. Elsie will be very pleased to hear we have a plan. I suppose I’ll go get that blood work done, then. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. You have a good day as well, and please give Elsie my best. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: .
