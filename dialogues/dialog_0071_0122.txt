DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, precisely. I am Venus Alvara. I have been noticing…small things. Things I forget. It worries me, because my blood pressure is…not good. I wish to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, quick is fine. We all have busy lives. You mentioned forgetting things… and high blood pressure. Let’s start with the memory issues. When did you first start noticing these… “small things,” as you call them?
PATIENT: Perhaps… six months ago? It began with… names. Faces, too. I would be speaking with someone I see regularly – the man at the bakery, for example – and… the name would simply vanish from my mind. It is… most upsetting. I always had a very good memory. I remember details… everything, usually. But lately… not so much. It is a recent thing, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Six months… okay. And is it just names and faces, or are you having trouble remembering other things?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not only names. Sometimes… where I put things. My keys, for instance. Or… what I was intending to cook for dinner. Small things, truly. I do not forget who my children are, Doctor. Please, understand. It is… frustrating. I write notes now. Many notes. It was never like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you’re recognizing this and writing things down. That’s a very helpful step. Let’s talk about your blood pressure for a moment. Do you know what your readings typically are?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The nurse… she checks it every time I visit. Usually… quite high. I believe she said 160 over 90, last time. Sometimes higher. I take… a white pill, once a day. I do not know the name. My husband… he managed the medications. It has been… two years since he passed. I continue to take it, as instructed.
DOCTOR: 160 over 90… that is elevated. And you’ve been on medication for two years… Do you experience any symptoms with the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Sometimes… a headache. Not severe, but… persistent. And… a ringing in my ears. It comes and goes. Also… I tire very easily. I used to walk for an hour every day. Now… perhaps fifteen minutes, and I must rest. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I do not wish to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Alvara, that is relevant. Headache, tinnitus , and fatigue… those can all be associated with high blood pressure, but also with other things. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and a neurological exam to check your reflexes and memory a little more closely. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I want to understand what is happening. A neurological exam… is that… difficult? I am a bit anxious, I confess. I only wish to be quick, as I said before. But, yes. Please proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: It’s very simple, Ms. Alvara, nothing to be anxious about. We’ll just check a few things. It won't take long at all. First, let's check your blood pressure again. Please, have a seat on the examination table. Okay… 168 over 95. Elevated, as expected. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Everything sounds clear, but there is a slight murmur. Not concerning at this point, but something we'll want to monitor.
PATIENT: Very well. A murmur… Is that… dangerous? My husband… he had a heart condition, eventually. I… I do not wish to cause you trouble. Perhaps… I should have written down everything the nurse said. I feel foolish, now. Please, continue. I wish to know what is happening. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: No, don't worry about feeling foolish. It’s perfectly normal to be a little anxious. And the murmur is quite faint, and often harmless. We’ll monitor it. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Just relax your arm for me… good. And now your legs. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today… is August second. 2025. Yes. I remember the date. I always remember the date. It is… a habit, I suppose. My husband… he worked in accounting. Dates were important. Is this… a test, Doctor? I am beginning to feel… overwhelmed. Perhaps I should have remained at home.
DOCTOR: It is a test, yes, but a very simple one. Just to get a baseline. And you are doing perfectly fine. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Very well. Please, tell me the words. I… I am a little nervous, Doctor. It is not like me to forget things. My mind… it usually works very well. Perhaps it is simply stress? I have been… alone for some time.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Remember those, and I’ll ask you to repeat them in a few moments. Take your time. Do you have any difficulties with your vision or hearing, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. I have them. My vision… it is not what it once was. I require reading glasses. And… my hearing, sometimes. It is… muffled. Especially in the left ear. But I manage. I do not want to… bother you with my ailments. Is this… a sign of something serious, Doctor? I… I wish to know.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good you’re aware of these things. And no, you’re not bothering me at all. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Only the blood pressure. And… arthritis. In my hands. It is… bothersome, but not serious. I take… a small pill for that, sometimes. My husband… he always said I was very strong. I do not like to… complain. I wish to be quick, Doctor. Is there… a simple explanation for the memory problems? Perhaps… a vitamin deficiency?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Ms. Alvara. Vitamin deficiency is certainly a possibility, and something we can check. But given your age and the pattern of memory loss, along with your elevated blood pressure, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid test, and a Vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Is that… necessary? My husband… he had many tests before he passed. I do not… I do not like tests. But… if you think it is best. Blood work… that I can manage. But a CT scan… Is it… painful? And expensive? I am… alone, you see. I do not have… much money. I just wish to understand why I forget things. Is there… a less invasive test? Perhaps a specialist? I do not wish to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. A CT scan isn't painful at all. It’s like a very quick X-ray. And you're right to ask about cost. Let’s talk about that with the billing department, and see what options are available. We can also discuss referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders – if you prefer. They might have other testing options. To start, let's focus on the blood work. It's relatively inexpensive and can give us a lot of information. We can see what those results show, and then decide if further testing – like a CT scan or a referral – is needed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes. That I can do. That is… reasonable. A specialist… perhaps later. Let us see what the blood work reveals. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor. But please… please contact me before scheduling any further tests. I need… time to consider. And to… arrange things. Thank you. I believe that is all for now, yes? I wish to return home. I am… very tired.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Alvara. We'll take things one step at a time. I'll write you a lab order for the blood work, and the nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. If anything urgent comes up, please don't hesitate to call. And yes, please call before scheduling anything further. I understand. We’ll take it slowly. You take care now, and get some rest. Here is the number for the lab, and the clinic. .
