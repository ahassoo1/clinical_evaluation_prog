DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Smetak. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… I have been… how you say… making a whistling sound when I breathe. It’s been happening for a few days now. A little scary, really.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound when you breathe, alright. That can be unsettling. And it's good you came in to get it checked out. Now, when did you first notice this whistling, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe four or five days ago? I was walking in the garden, and suddenly… whoosh… there it was. Not very loud at first, but it has gotten a bit worse since then. I did not think much of it at the time, but then it happened again when I was making dinner.
DOCTOR: Four or five days ago… alright. And has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. When I am resting, it is usually okay. But if I walk, or… or even when I get a little excited, it starts again. It feels… tighter in my chest when it happens. I do not know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mrs. Kilton. Tightness in the chest along with the whistling… that's helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have been a little… tired, maybe? Not very tired, just… more tired than usual. And sometimes, a little bit of coughing. Not a bad cough, just a small one. But it has been happening more when the whistling starts. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, thank you for telling me. The fatigue and the cough – those things can often go hand-in-hand with what's going on. Now, is the cough producing any mucus or phlegm?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. It is… clear, mostly. Not much of it, but it is there. It is not colorful, if you know what I mean. Just… watery. And it happens more at night, I think. When I lie down.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear mucus, more at night… That's helpful. Now, Mrs. Kilton, do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. My parents… they were healthy people. I was always a very active girl, played lots of sports. Never had trouble breathing before. I do not smoke, and I have never smoked. My husband… he smoked, but I always told him to do it outside. Is it possible it’s something I caught? Like a cold?
DOCTOR: No history of lung problems… that’s good to know. And no smoking history, which is excellent. It could be related to a cold, yes. Or perhaps a mild respiratory infection. It's also possible it's something else. To get a better understanding, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. I trust your judgment. Please, do what you need to do. I would like to know what is causing this, and I want to feel better. It is… a little worrying, you see. My grandson is coming to visit next week, and I want to be able to play with him.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Kilton. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And it’s wonderful that you’re looking forward to your grandson’s visit - that's a great motivation. Alright, if you could just sit back on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. It might feel a little cool on your skin. Just breathe normally. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, Mrs. Kilton, which would explain the whistling sound. It's not severe, but it is definitely present. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good. I also notice a slightly increased respiratory rate. Let me check your chest for any tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you for telling me. It is good to know what is happening. A little tenderness… I did feel a small ache in my chest this morning, but I thought it was just from sleeping in a funny position. Do you think it is serious?
DOCTOR: There's a bit of tenderness on the left side, yes. It doesn't seem to be causing you significant pain, but we need to consider it. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m hearing and feeling, it could be a few things. It could be bronchitis, or even a mild case of pneumonia. It's also possible it's asthma that's developed later in life, though that's less common. To be sure, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help you to know what is happening, then I am happy to have one. I want to be sure, you see. Is it a very… dangerous procedure? I have heard stories…
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly safe, Mrs. Kilton. An X-ray uses very low doses of radiation, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh any risk. It’s a quick and painless procedure – you’ll just stand or sit in front of the machine for a few moments while the technician takes the pictures. I'll write the order for the X-ray now. The technician will call you when they’re ready. After we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It’s a very common medication, and it should provide some relief. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator… yes, that sounds good too. If it will help me to breathe easier, then please. I do feel a little… anxious, you see. The whistling sound… it makes me nervous. I appreciate you listening to me, Doctor. You are very kind. What do I do with the inhaler? And how long will it take to get the X-ray results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're experiencing breathing difficulties. That's what I'm here for. The inhaler is very simple to use. You take two puffs as needed when you feel short of breath or wheezing. I’ll have the nurse show you how to use it properly before you leave. The X-ray results usually come back within a few hours. I’ll review them as soon as they’re available and call you with the findings. If anything urgent comes up, we’ll contact you immediately. In the meantime, try to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. I will rest and drink lots of fluids. And I will use the inhaler if I need it. Thank you so much for your help. I feel… a little better already, just knowing what is happening.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mrs. Kilton. I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the inhaler instructions with you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, you’ll be back to playing with your grandson in no time. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
