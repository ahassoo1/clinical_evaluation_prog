DOCTOR: Alright, uh, good morning. Sharifa, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Sharifa Firestone. And good morning to you. Honestly, I was hoping for someone… more put-together. No offense, but this office isn’t exactly what I expected.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, we get by. Look, I'm Dr. Gorga. Twenty-five years, seen it all, mostly. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs. They just… gave out. After a really bad cold, you see. It’s quite inconvenient, frankly. I’m a tour guide, so… walking is rather important to my livelihood. And it was sudden. Perfectly fine one minute, struggling to stand the next. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs giving out after a cold… right. Sudden onset, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, sudden. Not gradual, not a slow weakening. One moment I was attempting to navigate the cobblestone streets – honestly, the city needs to do something about those streets – and the next, I needed assistance. It wasn't a nice experience, I assure you. And it’s both legs, which is the concerning part. It’s not like I tripped or anything. It just… went.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Both legs simultaneously… after a cold. Any fever with the cold?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a bit of a fever. Nothing dreadful, you understand. Just that achy, shivery feeling. I took some over-the-counter medicine, and it came down. But it wasn’t a high fever. More… noticeable than dangerous, if that makes sense. I don’t usually bother with the doctor for a simple cold, you know? It's usually just rest and fluids. This leg business is entirely new.
DOCTOR: Alright, fever… low-grade. And the leg weakness, is it constant now, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… variable, I suppose. It’s definitely better than it was immediately after the cold. But it’s not… normal. I still feel unsteady on them, like they might buckle at any moment. I've been mostly resting, but even getting up to go to the kitchen is a bit of a trial. I wouldn’t say it’s gone away, just… diminished. And that’s… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. A bit of tingling in my toes, mostly. It’s not constant, and it’s not terribly unpleasant, but it is there. I hadn’t really connected it to the legs, to be honest. I just thought it was… circulation. I do a lot of walking, you see. Perhaps I was standing for too long before the cold. It's not like I thought it was something serious. But you're asking, so… yes, tingling. It's more… annoying than painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tingling... Okay. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Really? Now? I suppose it’s necessary. But honestly, I’m rather unsteady. Perhaps a chair nearby would be wise. I don’t want to make a mess of your office. Do be careful, alright? I'm not as reliable as I usually am.
DOCTOR: Careful, yes. Just stand here for a moment. Okay, can you try to stand on your toes, and then on your heels?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… difficult. It feels very precarious. Even worse on the heels! Honestly, Doctor, this is alarming. I feel like I’m going to fall. I haven't felt this weak in years. Perhaps I should have called someone. Is this what you wanted to see?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, easy now. Don't push yourself. That's enough. Alright. Strength is… diminished, as you said. Some difficulty with balance. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your legs.
PATIENT: Oh! That's… startling. I don’t particularly enjoy being tapped. Is that normal? It feels… odd. Not painful, exactly, but… unexpected. And please, don't sneak up on me like that. I'm not a child. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather unsettling. What are you looking for, exactly? Is it bad? Don’t tell me it's something dreadful, alright? I have a tour scheduled next week. A very important tour.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are… a little diminished as well. Not completely absent, but not as brisk as they should be. It's difficult to say definitively at this point. Given the cold, the weakness, the tingling, and the diminished reflexes, it could be something called Guillain-Barré syndrome. It’s… an autoimmune condition, sometimes triggered by infection. But we need more information before jumping to any conclusions. We’re going to need some blood tests, and I’d like to order an MRI of your spine to rule out any other causes.
PATIENT: Guillain… what? Auto…immune? Is that… serious? Like, hospital serious? I haven’t been sick like this in decades. A tour? You mentioned a hospital! I have responsibilities, Doctor! I can't just… disappear into a hospital. What does this mean? And an MRI? All this… for a simple cold? I'm starting to think I should have just rested more. Tell me straight, Doctor. Is this something I need to be very worried about? And will I be able to walk again?
DOCTOR: Alright, Sharifa, please, try to stay calm. It can be serious, yes, but it’s also treatable, especially if we catch it early. The MRI and blood tests will help us determine the severity and rule out other possibilities. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need to be hospitalized, but we need to know what we’re dealing with. The possibility of needing hospitalization is there, yes, but many people recover fully with treatment. As for walking again, that's difficult to say definitively, but with prompt treatment, the chances of recovery are very good. We'll need to get those tests done first. I’m going to write you a referral to a neurologist. They’re the specialists in this. Can you get to the lab today?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh, dear. This is… escalating rapidly. I suppose I can get to the lab. But I'll need very specific directions. And I expect a detailed explanation of what these tests are, alright? I don't like being kept in the dark. And I expect you to follow up with me, Doctor. Promptly. I have a life to run, and I can't be waiting around for indefinite test results. Write down the directions and the neurologist’s name. And tell me, honestly, what's the worst that could happen? I need to know. Don’t sugarcoat it, alright? I can handle the truth. I think. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the directions to the lab, and the neurologist’s name and number – Dr. Ramirez. As for the worst-case scenario… if it is Guillain-Barré, and it’s left untreated, it can lead to paralysis, including the muscles that control breathing. That’s why it’s crucial we get these tests done quickly. But again, most people recover fully with treatment. It's important to remember that. I'll have the lab results sent to Dr. Ramirez, and she’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I really need to see to my other patients now. Do you have any other questions for me right now, or shall we consider this concluded?
