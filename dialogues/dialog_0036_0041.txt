DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It makes things… difficult. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Astores. “Little by little” is a very helpful way to describe it. Can you tell me more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It started in my legs, I think. Just a little bit harder to walk sometimes, you know? Like they were… heavy. Now, it’s in my arms too. Not so bad yet, but I can feel it. Hard to lift things, even simple things sometimes. And I get tired… very tired. It’s just… wearing me down, slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began in your legs with a feeling of heaviness and has gradually spread to your arms, making lifting things difficult, and you're experiencing increasing fatigue. When did you first notice this weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… last year, I believe. Around… maybe June? It was after the church picnic, actually. I helped carry some things, and my legs felt a bit sore for a few days. I didn't think much of it then, just old age creeping in. But it didn't really go away completely, you see? It just stayed… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around June of last year after the church picnic. And you initially attributed it to soreness from helping carry things. Has the weakness been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are better than others. Like today, I walked in okay. But yesterday… yesterday was a bad day. I had to sit down a lot just to catch my breath. It’s hard to explain. It feels like… a wave sometimes. It washes over me, and then it goes away a little. But it always comes back.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful description – “like a wave.” So, it fluctuates. Are there any particular activities that seem to make it worse, or anything that makes it feel better?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Being hot makes it much worse. Even just a warm day… I get very tired, and the weakness feels stronger. Cool air helps a little. And resting, of course. That’s the best thing. But I can't always rest, you know? My wife needs help around the house. And the grandchildren… they want to play.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like heat exacerbates the symptoms, and rest provides some relief. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness and fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, now that you mention it, my vision has been a bit blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but it comes and goes, like the weakness. And… my balance isn’t so good anymore. I stumbled a couple of times. Nothing serious, but I have to hold onto things more often. I didn't know if that was just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blurry vision and some balance issues have also been present. These symptoms coming and going alongside the weakness is important information. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had a problem with my blood pressure a long time ago, but they got it under control with medicine. And I have some arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. Other than that… not much. Oh, wait! The doctor told me… a few years back… something about my nerves. Multiple… something? I can’t quite remember the name. It was a long time ago, and I don't remember much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis. And you recall a diagnosis related to your nerves, possibly “multiple…” – do you remember anything else about that diagnosis, perhaps what the doctor said it affected, or any treatment you received?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I truly don't. I remember going to the specialist… lots of tests… but the name… it escapes me. And what it affected… I think he said something about messages from my brain not getting through properly? But it was so long ago. I was mostly told to come back if things got worse. I just… put it out of my mind. I didn't want to worry my wife.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Astores. It's common to forget details over time, and it’s perfectly reasonable to focus on the present. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Just a few nights in the hospital when I was a young man with a bad case of the flu, but nothing serious. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, until… well, until now. My wife always said I was a tough old Samoan!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Astores. And being tough can certainly help! Now, can you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had some trouble walking when she got older, I remember that. She said her legs felt weak, just like me. And my brother… he had some problems with his eyesight, got worse over time. But other than that… I don't really know much about my family’s medical history. We didn't talk about it much when I was growing up. It wasn’t something we did.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of walking difficulties in your mother and eyesight problems in your brother. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take the medicine for my blood pressure, like I said. And I take something for the arthritis in my hands when they’re really bothering me. It’s just… a cream, you rub it on. And sometimes I take something for sleeping, if I can't get to sleep. But that’s just when I really need it. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Mr. Astores. Could you tell me the names of those medications, if you happen to know them?
PATIENT: Let me see… the blood pressure one is… Amlodipine. That's right. And the arthritis cream… Voltaren. It comes in a tube. And the sleeping pill… oh dear… I think it’s called… Trazodone? Something like that. My wife is the one who keeps track of all these things, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine for blood pressure, Voltaren cream for arthritis, and Trazodone for sleep. Thank you for that information. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks when she gets new medicine for me, just to be safe. She’s very careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And a careful wife is a wonderful thing! Okay, Mr. Astores, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: I will, absolutely. I'll be gentle. Okay, Mr. Astores, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/85. Your pulse is 72, and your temperature is normal. Now, let's check your reflexes… . Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn't necessarily cause for alarm at your age, but it's something we'll note. Now, I'd like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. . And now, can you push against my hands with your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I’m trying. It's… harder than it used to be, you're right. I can feel the weakness in my legs, especially when I push. It feels like… pushing through water, almost.
DOCTOR: I see. That's helpful to know, Mr. Astores. Now, can you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. But… be careful, please. I’m a little wobbly. It feels like my legs might give out.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. You do appear a bit unsteady. Now, let’s try a quick balance test. Can you close your eyes for a moment and see if you can maintain your balance?
PATIENT: Oh dear… No, Doctor. I can’t. I’m too unsteady. I feel like I’m going to fall. It’s very… disorienting. I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's alright, Mr. Astores. Please sit. That's very helpful information. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur, which is common at your age and not necessarily cause for concern. Your lungs sound clear. Okay, Mr. Astores, thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam – the fluctuating weakness, the diminished reflexes, the difficulty with balance, and the slightly elevated blood pressure – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. The fact that your symptoms began after an illness, and your recall of a past neurological diagnosis, is particularly relevant. Given your age and the constellation of symptoms, it could be related to a condition affecting your nerves or muscles, potentially peripheral neuropathy. It’s also important to rule out other possibilities, such as vitamin deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function tests, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I also think it would be helpful to get an electromyography, or EMG, which is a test that measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. Finally, an MRI of your brain and spinal cord could help us rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor… that sounds… a lot. All those tests… But if it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… explain everything to me as we go, please? I don’t understand all those fancy words. And… is it going to be painful?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Astores. I completely understand your concerns, and I promise to explain everything to you every step of the way, in plain language. There’s no need to worry about the medical terms – we'll take it one step at a time. As for pain, the blood tests are just a simple prick of the finger, like getting your blood pressure checked. The EMG involves inserting small needles into your muscles, which can be a little uncomfortable, but it's usually not very painful. Most people describe it as a mild stinging sensation. And the MRI is completely painless – you just lie in a scanner while it takes pictures. We’ll start with the blood tests. I’ll write you a requisition that you can take to the lab. They’ll draw a sample and send the results to me. Once I have those results, we'll schedule the EMG. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Lei, who is a specialist in nerve and muscle disorders. They’ll be able to interpret the EMG results and help us determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, it’s important to continue taking your medications as prescribed. And try to avoid any activities that worsen your symptoms. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as increased weakness or difficulty breathing, please come to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. A neurologist… Dr. Lei… I’ll remember that. And the tests… I’ll get the blood tests done as soon as possible. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time to figure out what’s going on. It’s… a relief to know that you’re taking it seriously. Just one thing… how long will it take to get the results of the blood tests? And… should I call you if I have questions between now and then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could help. It’s important to me that you feel heard and understood. The blood test results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. The lab will let me know when they are ready, and I’ll contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. And yes, absolutely, please call my office anytime if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent and can answer many questions, or if it’s something more urgent, she’ll get a message to me. The number is 555-1234. Don’t hesitate to call, even if it seems like a small thing. Here are the requisitions for the blood tests and the referral to Dr. Lei. I wish you all the best, and I’ll see you soon. Do you need help getting up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I can manage. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astores. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day. .
