DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Murtic. Um, it's… my stomach, I guess. It's been a bit rough lately. Like, a lot of… well, you know. Diarrhea. It just hasn't stopped for a while now. I can't really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a long time, though.
DOCTOR: "A long time," alright. And when you say “a lot,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific… Okay. Like, more than normal. I usually… I don’t know, go once a day maybe? Now it’s like… four or five times. Sometimes more. It's just really disruptive, you know? And… kind of embarrassing. I’m trying to think if anything changed around the time it started, but honestly, things are a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Four to five times a day… for how long, approximately?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the hard part! I wish I could tell you. Maybe… a month? Two months? It feels like it's been that long. I really don’t keep track of those things, sorry. My husband usually handles… stuff like that. He's at work right now, though.
DOCTOR: A month or two of frequent diarrhea… alright. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… um. I don’t think so. I haven’t really… looked closely, to be honest. I know that sounds bad, but it's just… unpleasant. I try not to focus on it too much. Is that something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, you should be observing your stool. It’s important. Has there been any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting associated with this?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay, I’ll try to… pay attention next time. Sorry. Let me see… No fever, I don't think. A little bit of stomach pain sometimes, but not really bad. More like cramping, I guess. And… yeah, a little bit of nausea. Not throwing up, just feeling kind of queasy sometimes. It’s usually when I’m really worried about… well, having to rush to the bathroom. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Frequent diarrhea for a month or two, associated with cramping and some nausea… Have you experienced any weight loss during this time?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really been weighing myself lately, to be honest. Things have been… hectic. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But I haven’t actually stepped on a scale. I usually eat okay, though. Not a huge appetite, but nothing major. My husband does most of the cooking, so it’s usually pretty healthy stuff. I really wish I had better answers for you. It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then we’ll talk about some possible tests. Do you mind if I listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. That's fine. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I just… hope it’s nothing too serious. This is really unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back on the table, please. I'm not detecting any major distention. There is some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. No rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are… hyperactive. No guarding. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveled? Um… No, not really. Just… to visit my sister in Birmingham a few weeks ago? But that wasn’t international or anything. Just a couple of hours drive. We didn’t eat anything weird, I don’t think. It was just a normal weekend visit. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Birmingham a few weeks ago… Alright. And what about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet… Well, like I said, my husband does most of the cooking. It's usually pretty standard stuff. Lots of rice, chicken, vegetables, lentils. We eat a lot of Pakistani food, obviously. Not a ton of dairy. I sometimes have yogurt with breakfast. I try to avoid really spicy stuff because it… you know… doesn’t agree with my stomach. But other than that, I don’t have any allergies or anything. I don’t drink a lot of caffeine or alcohol. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me – frequent diarrhea for approximately one to two months, mild abdominal cramping, some nausea, no fever, and no recent international travel – it could be a number of things. It's unlikely to be something serious, but we need to rule a few things out. I'm going to order a stool sample analysis to check for any infections or parasites. We'll also do a blood test to check your electrolytes and rule out any inflammation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That sounds… thorough. Stool sample… Okay, I can do that. And a blood test, yeah. Um… will the blood test show if it's something… like, with my stomach? I’ve heard things about IBD… is that what you’re checking for? I don't even really remember my medical history that well. My husband always handles that stuff. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: IBD – inflammatory bowel disease – is one possibility, yes. But let’s not jump to conclusions. The blood test will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation. It’s a standard procedure. I’ll also order a Celiac panel, just to be thorough, given your symptoms. It is quite common. I'm ruling things out, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Celiac… I think my sister had that, maybe? So, you're just trying to see what's going on. That makes sense. Okay, I understand. So, what do I need to do about the stool sample? And when will I get the results back? I have a doctor's appointment next month anyway, but should I schedule something sooner if something's wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the instructions for collecting the stool sample. It’s quite straightforward, but follow them exactly. The lab results typically take about five to seven business days. If you experience any worsening symptoms – high fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, dehydration – go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll discuss the results at your next appointment, or sooner if anything concerning arises. I will have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, regardless of the results. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Oh… okay, two weeks. That sounds… good. I think I understand the instructions. No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything pretty clearly. Thank you, Dr. Murtic. I just… hope it's not anything too serious. It's just been so uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Try to stay hydrated, and follow the instructions carefully. Good day.
