DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. It’s about my foot. Been bothering me something awful, it has. A sore, really. A nasty one. Don't expect much help from this old body, mind you. It's seen better days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to have it checked out, Ms. Cannington. Even seasoned bodies deserve care. Can you tell me more about this sore on your foot?
PATIENT: Well, it started small, you see. Just a little red spot, hardly worth mentioning. Thought it was a bug bite, maybe. But it just…didn’t go away. Now it’s…well, it’s a hole, practically. And it hurts. Especially when I try to walk. Though walking isn’t what it used to be, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, a red spot that didn’t heal and has now become a sore, causing pain with walking. About how long ago did this red spot first appear?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Seems like… July, maybe? Around the time of the church picnic, I reckon. Yes, definitely before old Man Hemmings passed. He was a good man, Hemmings. Always brought the best coconut cream pie. But the sore… July, it must be. At least a month now. Maybe longer. Time gets away from you when you're… well, here.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. Thank you for that detail. And I’m sorry to hear about Mr. Hemmings. Now, focusing on the sore, can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Honestly, it’s…unpleasant. It’s not neat, if you know what I mean. Jagged edges. Red around the outside, though that’s faded some. And it’s…deep. Not just a surface scratch, mind you. I can see… well, I don't like looking at it. It's weeping, too. A little bit, anyway. Always seems damp. It's quite bothersome, really. And it smells. Not good.
DOCTOR: I see. That does sound quite uncomfortable, Ms. Cannington. Besides the pain and the discomfort, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… my leg feels a little warm sometimes. Not feverish, exactly, but warmer than it should be, I suppose. And it’s…tingly. Like pins and needles, mostly in my foot and lower leg. It comes and goes. Mostly when I’m trying to sleep. And I've been feeling awfully tired lately. But what old woman isn’t tired, eh?
DOCTOR: That’s good information to have, Ms. Cannington. The warmth, tingling, and fatigue are all things we should consider. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your foot or leg?
PATIENT: Swelling… yes, actually. Now that you mention it. My slipper feels a bit tighter than usual. And my ankle… it’s a little puffy, I reckon. Not enormous, mind you. But definitely not how it used to be. I thought it was just my imagination, or maybe from sitting too long. But yes, some swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. Thank you for telling me all of this. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? Well, the doctor told me years ago I had the… the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that's it. Been managing it, mostly. Though I haven’t been as good about checking it lately. And my blood pressure is a bit high, too. Always has been. And I had a bit of trouble with my kidneys, a long time back, but that seems to be alright now. Just the usual things for an old woman, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes, hypertension, and past kidney problems. Are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see... I take a little white pill for my blood pressure. Twice a day, every day. And sometimes, when my blood sugar gets too high, I take another one, a pink one. But I haven’t needed that one much lately. Honestly, I forget which ones are for what half the time. My daughter helps me keep track, mostly. Though she doesn't visit as often as I'd like.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill for blood pressure and a pink pill for blood sugar. Are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like food or insects?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmph. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Always have. Though I don’t care for beets. They taste like dirt. As for medications, I've never had a reaction, not that I recall. Though that one time, years ago, the doctor gave me a shot, and my arm was sore for a week, but that could have just been a bad nurse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… well, let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And I had a hysterectomy, goodness, probably fifty years ago. And then, when I broke my hip a few years back, they had to put in a… a new joint, I think they called it. That was a nasty ordeal.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy, hysterectomy, and hip replacement. Now, is there a history of diabetes, heart disease, or any other significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. My mother had the sugar sickness, just like me. And her brother, he had a bad heart. Passed away young, he did. My father, he was healthy as an ox, though. Never sick a day in his life. But my sister, she had trouble with her kidneys, much like I did, years ago. Though I don't know if it was the same kind of trouble. Families…they all have their problems, don’t they?
DOCTOR: They certainly do, Ms. Cannington. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Hmph. Substances? Goodness no! I'm a church-going woman. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. And smoking? Never! My mother always said it was a foolish habit. And I haven’t got time for foolish habits. Though I do enjoy a nice cup of tea in the afternoons. Does tea count as a substance?
DOCTOR: Tea doesn't count, Ms. Cannington. That sounds lovely. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your living situation?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone in my house. Been there since I got married. It's getting a bit much to keep up with, truth be told. The yard’s a mess, and dusting is a chore. But I manage. I have a neighbor, old Mr. Hemmings’ daughter, she checks in on me a few times a week. Nice girl, but she's busy with her own family. And, as I said, my daughter visits when she can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you live alone with some support from your neighbor and daughter. That's good to know. Now, Ms. Cannington, I’d like to take a look at your foot, if that’s alright with you. Just so I can get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can you please remove your slipper and socks?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. It’s not a pretty sight, mind you. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. It's been a long time since anyone's looked at my feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. I see significant swelling and redness in your foot, particularly around the ankle. The ulcer is quite deep, and I do note some drainage with a noticeable odor. Your pulses are present, though slightly diminished on the affected foot, and the temperature is elevated compared to your other foot. I’m also noting some tenderness when I palpate around the ankle.
PATIENT: Hmph. What did you expect? It hurts, doctor. And the smell...I try to keep it clean, but it’s difficult. What does it mean? Is it serious? Don't tell me it's going to have to be…amputated. My sister lost a leg to diabetes, you know. A dreadful thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Cannington, and it’s perfectly valid. It's important we investigate this thoroughly. Based on my examination, and considering your history of diabetes, this appears to be a diabetic foot ulcer. The diminished pulses are concerning, as it indicates reduced blood flow to your foot, which can hinder healing. Right now, I'm not saying amputation is necessary. However, we need to take this very seriously to prevent complications. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and to rule out any infection. I'd also like to get an X-ray of your foot to assess the bone structure. In the meantime, it’s vital we keep the wound clean and protected. Do you have anyone who can assist you with wound care at home?
PATIENT: Hmph. So it is serious. I knew it. As for help…my daughter, sometimes. But she’s busy, as I said. And honestly, she's squeamish. Doesn't like getting her hands dirty. I mostly do it myself. Though it’s getting harder. And, well, I can’t see very well anymore. What exactly needs to be done? And how long will all these…tests…take? I don’t have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. It is serious, but manageable with proper care. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine the best course of treatment. The X-ray will allow us to see if there's any bone infection or structural damage. Those shouldn’t take long—perhaps an hour or so to complete. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. I'll also give you a special dressing to keep the wound clean and moist, which is important for healing. However, given the diminished pulses and your history, I’m also going to refer you to a vascular surgeon. They specialize in blood flow and can assess if you might benefit from further intervention to improve circulation to your foot. We also need to discuss strict blood sugar control. If we can get that under control, we can significantly improve your chances of healing. I'll have my nurse schedule the blood tests and X-ray for you before you leave. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Hmph. Vascular surgeon… that sounds… ominous. Strict blood sugar control? Easier said than done, doctor. I like my sweets. And I don’t want anyone poking around in my veins if I can help it. Is this…is this going to be expensive? Medicare doesn’t cover everything, you know. And I’m already struggling to pay the bills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cannington. It’s perfectly valid to be worried about costs. Medicare should cover the blood tests and X-ray, and we’ll verify that before proceeding. As for the vascular surgeon, the consultation will also likely be covered. We’ll double-check your coverage before scheduling that as well. The vascular surgeon won't necessarily have to “poke around in your veins” right away. The initial consultation is simply to assess your blood flow and discuss potential options. They may recommend a non-invasive test, like an ultrasound, before considering any procedures. The goal isn't to restrict your sweets entirely, but to help you manage your blood sugar levels through diet and potentially medication. We can work with you to find a plan that's realistic and sustainable. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my nurse, [Nurse’s Name], if you have any questions about costs or coverage. She’s very knowledgeable and can help you navigate the process. Do you feel comfortable with this plan for now?
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. As long as nobody starts poking around in my veins immediately. And as long as Medicare covers it. I still don't like the sound of this vascular surgeon, but I suppose it can't hurt to get a second opinion. Tell [Nurse’s Name] to call me tomorrow, if she can. And don’t expect me to be cheerful about this whole thing, doctor. It’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cannington. I understand it’s a lot to process, and you’re not obligated to be cheerful. I'll make sure [Nurse’s Name] calls you tomorrow to schedule the tests and answer any further questions you may have. We’ll take this one step at a time, and I’ll do my best to support you throughout the process. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all for now. Just…try to keep it simple, doctor. And don’t expect miracles. This old body is wearing out, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Cannington. We'll focus on managing your condition and improving your quality of life. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I'll be here to support you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your nurse calls. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and have a good day.
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. Good day. And don’t expect me to be optimistic. .
