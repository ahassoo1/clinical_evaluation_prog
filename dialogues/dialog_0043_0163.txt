DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure indeed. Well, it’s rather a…peculiar matter, I suppose. I’ve been dabbling – and I use that word deliberately – with some rather…extreme dietary approaches. I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I continued. I'm Jarvis Vantine, by the way. Though I suspect you already know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Vantine, I do. Thank you for confirming. And thank you for being so forthcoming. It's always best to be cautious when making significant changes to one's diet. When you say “extreme dietary approaches,” could you elaborate a bit on what that entails?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I've always been rather…experimental, you see. In my line of work – special effects, mostly animation, though I’ve done a fair bit of practical work over the years – one requires a certain…dedication to the unusual. Anyway, I recently attempted a rather strict juice cleanse – three days, nothing but various fruit and vegetable concoctions. Utterly exhausting, I must say. And before that, a…protein-only diet. Just meat, Doctor. Three times a day. For nearly a week. It wasn't terribly pleasant, and my digestive system…well, let's just say it wasn’t pleased. I understand these things are…popular, but I’m beginning to suspect they aren’t terribly sensible.
DOCTOR: I see. A juice cleanse for three days, followed by a protein-only diet for nearly a week. That is a fairly significant shift from a normal eating pattern. And you're right to question the sensibility of such approaches, Mr. Vantine. They can often do more harm than good. Could you describe any specific symptoms you experienced during or after either of those diets?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms, yes. Quite a few, actually. During the juice cleanse, I felt…weak. Terribly weak. And rather irritable, I must confess. My energy levels plummeted, and concentrating on my work was…challenging. Headaches, too. Mild, but persistent. The protein diet was…different. Initially, it felt rather…robust, if you understand me. A certain…strength. But that quickly gave way to…well, let's just say my system struggled. Constipation, for one. And a peculiar…metallic taste in my mouth. And, frankly, the monotony was dreadful. One can only consume so much steak before it loses its appeal, Doctor. It also rather disrupted my sleep. I found myself waking frequently, feeling…unsettled. Though I suspect the lack of carbohydrates had something to do with that.
DOCTOR: Weakness, irritability, headaches during the cleanse, and then constipation, a metallic taste, disrupted sleep with the protein diet… That’s quite a list, Mr. Vantine, and certainly points to some physiological stress. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of – diabetes, kidney problems, heart issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve always been rather…fortunate in that regard. My general health has been…robust, for a man of my age, at least. I do take a daily multivitamin, of course. And a fish oil supplement. Old age, you see. One must try to counteract the inevitable. My blood pressure is generally good, according to my annual check-ups. And I’ve never been diagnosed with anything…serious. Though my eyesight isn’t what it once was. Necessary for the animation, you see. Staring at screens for hours on end takes its toll. But beyond that…no. I’m relatively…unencumbered, medically speaking. Though my divorce was rather…taxing, if you’ll allow a little levity. But I don’t believe that’s relevant to my dietary habits.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Vantine, and I'm glad to hear you've generally been healthy. The divorce is, indeed, likely unrelated. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the multivitamin and fish oil?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor, none at all. Strictly the multivitamin and fish oil, as I mentioned. I’ve always been rather…resistant to pharmaceuticals, if you understand me. Preferring to let nature take its course, where possible. My late wife, bless her soul, was a great believer in herbal remedies, and I've…inherited some of her inclinations. Though I haven't ventured into anything too…radical, I assure you. Just the basics, really. A little chamomile tea for sleep, occasionally. And a bit of ginger for digestion. But nothing prescribed by a doctor, certainly not. I’m a fairly…straightforward case, I believe. No allergies either, thankfully. I can tolerate most things, which is…convenient, given my profession. One encounters a great deal of…dust and peculiar substances, you see.
DOCTOR: Very good. No medications, no allergies, just the multivitamin, fish oil, chamomile, and ginger. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we proceed, could you briefly describe a typical day of eating for you before you started these experiments?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A typical day…well, I’ve always been rather…regular in my habits, you see. Breakfast was invariably toast, usually with marmalade, and a cup of Earl Grey tea. Nothing extravagant. Midday, a sandwich, perhaps a ham and cheese, or a bit of chicken salad. And a piece of fruit, usually an apple. I’m rather fond of apples. Dinner was…variable. Often a roast, if I had the time. Or a shepherd’s pie. Or perhaps fish and chips. I do enjoy a good fish and chip supper. I'd usually have a glass of wine with dinner, a modest glass, nothing excessive. And a small piece of chocolate afterwards. A dark chocolate, preferably. I’m a creature of habit, you see. And I'm quite…content with my routine. Which is why these recent…deviations have been so…disruptive. I simply wanted to try something new, something…vigorous. But I suspect I’ve rather overdone it.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a perfectly reasonable and balanced diet, Mr. Vantine. It’s no surprise these restrictive approaches have been disruptive. Based on what you’ve told me – the weakness, irritability, constipation, metallic taste, sleep disturbance – and considering your age, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some basic blood work. Just to get a baseline and rule out any underlying deficiencies or imbalances. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I have no objections whatsoever. I’ve always believed in…due diligence. And a thorough examination is precisely what’s required, I suspect. I trust your judgement implicitly. I’m rather relieved, actually, to be discussing this with a professional. I was beginning to feel rather…foolish, to be honest. I’ve always been rather independent, you see. Perhaps too independent. So, yes, please proceed with the examination and blood work. Lead the way, Doctor. I’m entirely at your disposal.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Very good. Let's start with your vital signs. If you could step onto the scale for me, please. And then we'll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and we’ll briefly examine your abdomen. While you're on the scale, could you tell me your approximate height?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Height is approximately six feet, give or take an inch. I haven't been officially measured in…decades, I suspect. One tends to shrink with age, you know. But six feet is a fair approximation. I was always rather tall as a boy. A bit of a gangly lad, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Your weight is 148 pounds, and you confirm a height of six feet. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 76, regular and strong. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Lungs are clear bilaterally, good air entry. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Slightly diminished bowel sounds, which is consistent with the constipation you mentioned. Everything seems within normal limits, but the blood work will give us a more detailed picture. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We'll also check your vitamin D and B12 levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Comprehensive, as one would expect. Yes, proceed with those tests. Vitamin D and B12 seem particularly…sensible, given my recent…dietary adventures. I suspect my system is rather depleted. A thorough investigation is precisely what’s required. I’m grateful for your diligence. So, what happens next? Do I need to fast beforehand, or…is there anything I should be aware of? I’m rather used to following instructions, you see. Though I confess I'm a bit rusty. It's been some time since I've subjected myself to…medical scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No, you do not need to fast for these tests. You can eat and drink as normal. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw the blood samples. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend gradually reintroducing a balanced diet – lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid any extreme diets or restrictive eating patterns. Also, ensure you're adequately hydrated. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. If your symptoms persist, or worsen, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Are there any questions I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything rather admirably. Reintroduce a balanced diet, stay hydrated… sensible advice, indeed. I’m entirely in agreement. And I shall certainly contact the clinic should my symptoms…reassert themselves. I appreciate your thoroughness and your…patience with my rather…eccentric habits. I feel considerably reassured. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. I anticipate hearing from you soon regarding the test results. Is there anything I need to do before I leave? Paperwork, perhaps? Or…a co-pay? I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It's my pleasure. And no, no paperwork today. The co-pay is $50. The receptionist will take care of that on your way out. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns whatsoever. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Vantine. And try to avoid any further…dietary experiments for now.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to restrain myself. A balanced diet, hydration, and…no more adventures. It's a promise. Thank you again, Doctor Kalinski. And to you as well. A good day indeed.
