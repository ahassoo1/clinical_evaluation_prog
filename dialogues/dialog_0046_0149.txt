DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, dear. Dr. Glowka, is it? Well, let me tell you, it's about this…fuss. Everyone's making such a fuss. Honestly, I don't see what the problem is. They keep wanting me to…do things. Things I don’t need done. It's just…unnecessary. I've lived a long life, you know. A very long life.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed and perhaps frustrated with some recommendations others have made. It's perfectly reasonable to question things and want to understand what’s going on, especially when you’ve lived a long and full life. Could you tell me a little more about what specifically is causing the “fuss”?
PATIENT: Oh, it's my feet, naturally. Everyone's going on about my feet. My grandson, bless his heart, he worries so. He keeps saying I need…procedures. And the hospital, they called, wanting me to come in for…tests. Tests! As if I haven’t had enough tests in my eighty-three years. They say something about circulation, and…something else. Honestly, it all blurs together. I walk just fine, mostly. A little slower, maybe. What’s the big deal? It's not like I'm running marathons.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like the concern is primarily with your feet and some potential issues with your circulation, as mentioned by your grandson and the hospital. You feel you're functioning reasonably well, despite some slowing down, and you're hesitant about undergoing further testing or procedures. That’s very helpful to know. Just to clarify, when you say you “walk just fine mostly,” are you experiencing any pain, numbness, tingling, or swelling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes they ache, you know? Especially at the end of the day. And they do get a little…puffy. I blame the heat, mostly. This summer's been dreadful. And the swelling…it's mostly in my ankles, I think. Not terribly bothersome, really. I just elevate them when I sit. My mama always said elevating your feet was good for everything. But pain…yes, a little bit. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. Honestly, old age aches all over. It's what happens when you live this long. I don't know what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing some dull aching pain and swelling, primarily in your ankles, which seems to worsen at the end of the day. And you've found some relief by elevating your feet. That's good to know you've already been taking steps to manage it. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, and to rule out anything serious, I'd like to do a brief physical exam of your feet and legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, an exam? Honestly, I’m not fond of poking and prodding. I've had enough of that in my lifetime, thank you very much. Is it really necessary? I told you, I walk just fine! What exactly are you looking for, dear? I'm not one for unnecessary fuss, you know. I’d rather just have a nice cup of tea and a chat, if you don’t mind. Is there anything wrong wrong, or are you just going through the motions?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Gunasekara, and I certainly don’t want to cause any discomfort or unnecessary fuss. The exam would involve a quick check of your pulses in your feet and legs, looking at your skin for any changes in color or temperature, and a brief assessment of your range of motion and sensation. The reason I'd like to do this is to evaluate the circulation in your legs and feet, which the hospital mentioned, and to rule out any potential problems that could be causing your pain and swelling. It will help me determine if further investigation is needed, or if your current approach of elevation is sufficient. It's a quick process, and I’ll explain everything as I go. I assure you, I’m not just going through the motions. My goal is to ensure you’re comfortable and healthy, and to address your concerns effectively. Would you be willing to let me proceed with a brief exam, just to get a clearer picture?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But don’t go poking around too much! And explain everything, you hear? I don’t like surprises. And be gentle, dear. My skin is rather thin these days. Honestly, I don't know why everyone's making such a commotion about my feet. I’ve walked on them for eighty-three years! But…go ahead, I suppose. Just…be quick about it. And tell me what you’re doing, every step of the way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible, and I'll explain each step as I go. First, I’m going to check your pulses in your feet. This tells me how well the blood is flowing through your arteries. I’ll start with the dorsalis pedis pulse, which is on the top of your foot here… …and then I’ll check the posterior tibial pulse, which is behind your ankle. I’m feeling for a strong, steady beat. Okay, your pulses are present, but they are a bit diminished, meaning they are weaker than I’d expect. That’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Next, I'm going to look at your skin for any changes in color, temperature, or texture. I notice some mild discoloration and some slight swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. I don’t see any open wounds or sores, which is good. Finally, I’ll check your range of motion and sensation. Can you gently wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Wiggling my toes… There. Is that good enough? Honestly, they're a little stiff. I don't move them around as much as I used to. What did you find? Are my feet terribly bad? I knew I should have worn different shoes. Though, honestly, I can't remember which shoes I wore. It's all a blur these days. Are you going to send me to a specialist? Because I don't want to go to a specialist. Specialists always want to do unnecessary things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Gunasekara, you did very well. Your toes do have a limited range of motion, which is not unexpected given your age and activity level. And I noticed some decreased sensation in your feet, which is something we need to consider. Based on my examination, it appears you have some signs of peripheral artery disease , which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your legs and feet. The diminished pulses, discoloration, swelling, decreased sensation, and limited range of motion are all consistent with this. Now, before you worry, PAD is very common, especially in people with your age and medical history. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need drastic intervention right away. However, it is important to manage it to prevent it from getting worse. I’m not saying we need to send you to a specialist immediately. But I do think further testing is warranted to get a clearer picture of the severity of the PAD and to rule out any other underlying conditions. I would like to order a simple, non-invasive test called an ankle-brachial index . It compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms and can help us assess the blood flow in your legs. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Another test? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a science experiment! Ankle-brachial…whatever-it-is. What exactly does it involve? And what if it shows something terrible? I don't want to know if something terrible is wrong. I’ve lived a good life, you know. A very good life. I don't need any unpleasant surprises at this stage. Will it be painful? Because I don’t tolerate pain very well these days. Honestly, I just want to go home and have a nice cup of tea. Is there anything else you need to poke and prod at? Because I’m really not feeling up to it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed by tests, and I want to assure you I wouldn’t recommend anything if I didn’t think it was important. The ankle-brachial index, or ABI, is a very simple and painless test. It involves using a blood pressure cuff to measure the blood pressure in your arms and ankles. The technician will simply wrap the cuffs around your limbs and take a few readings. It takes about 15-20 minutes, and there’s no discomfort involved. As for what it might show, it will help us determine the extent of the blood flow issues in your legs. If it shows significant narrowing, we can discuss options for management, which may include lifestyle changes, medication, or, in some cases, referral to a vascular specialist. But again, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. I want to emphasize that the goal isn't to scare you or overwhelm you. It's to get a clearer picture of what's going on so we can provide you with the best possible care. If the ABI is normal, then we can rule out PAD and focus on other potential causes for your symptoms. Would you be willing to try the ABI test?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But only because you explained it so nicely. And if it’s really painless, I suppose I can endure it. But I want you to promise me, Dr. Glowka, no surprises. And no sending me to a specialist unless absolutely necessary. I just want to go home and enjoy my tea. And if it takes more than 20 minutes, I'm leaving. Do you understand? Twenty minutes, and then I'm going home. And explain everything afterwards, clearly and slowly. I don’t want to be confused. Honestly, I just want this whole thing to be over with. Are we done talking now? Because my feet are starting to ache again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Gunasekara. I promise, no surprises, and I will only recommend a specialist if absolutely necessary. And yes, the test should take no longer than 20 minutes. I’ll make a note of that in your chart. I will explain everything afterwards, clearly and slowly, and I’ll answer any questions you have. And yes, we are done talking for now. I will have the technician come in to perform the ABI test, and then we can discuss the results afterwards. Thank you for being so open and honest with me, Ms. Gunasekara. I appreciate your trust. Now, let’s get this test done so you can go home and enjoy your tea.
