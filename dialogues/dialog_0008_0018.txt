DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be perfectly honest. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, I think. It’s been… a while now, and I thought it best to have someone take a look. I don’t really recall when it started, precisely. Just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “Going to the bathroom quite a lot” – can you tell me a little more specifically what that means?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… well, I find myself needing to go… several times during the night. Used to be, I’d sleep through, perhaps one trip, maximum. Now… three, sometimes four. And during the day, every couple of hours, it seems. It’s… disruptive. Not painful, thankfully, just… frequent. And a fair amount each time, if you understand me. I don't keep precise records, you see. It’s all rather vague, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency, both day and night – that's helpful. And no pain, which is good. When you go, do you feel like you're completely emptying your bladder, or do you feel like you still have to go shortly after?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I… believe I do empty it, yes. Though, perhaps not completely. There's a lingering sensation, sometimes, that there's just a little bit left. It doesn't necessitate an immediate return trip, but… it's there. It’s difficult to explain. It’s not a strong urge, just… awareness. I do find myself going back a little sooner than I used to, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… Let me see… I don’t think so. It looks normal, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little lighter in color than it used to be, but I wouldn’t swear to it. I’m not one for close inspection, you understand. I haven’t noticed any blood, or anything unusual like that. Just… normal looking urine, I suppose. Though, it is more of it, naturally, given the frequency.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this – any thirst, fatigue, swelling in your legs or feet, or perhaps any difficulty with erections?
PATIENT: Goodness. That's… a rather comprehensive inquiry, Doctor. Let me think. Thirst… yes, I suppose I am a bit thirstier than usual. I’ve been drinking more water, certainly. Fatigue… well, I am getting on in years, so a bit of tiredness is to be expected. But perhaps a little more than usual. Swelling… no, I don’t think so. My shoes fit as well as ever. And… the other question… well, that’s… becoming less frequent, shall we say. Yes, that’s a fair assessment. It’s… a natural consequence of age, I presume. I apologize for the bluntness.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being open with me, Mr. Verbos. Just to clarify, so I have a good picture – increased frequency, especially at night, feeling like you don't fully empty your bladder, increased thirst, and some fatigue, along with some erectile dysfunction. No pain, no blood in the urine, no swelling. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Medical conditions… That's… a difficult question. I've seen various doctors over the years, of course, but I don’t have a clear recollection of any diagnosed conditions. I believe my general practitioner mentioned my cholesterol being slightly elevated at one point, but I wasn’t put on any medication for it. And… my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I may be forgetting something crucial. I’m on no regular medication currently. I've always considered myself a reasonably healthy man, despite my advancing years. I’m not sure that helps much, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diagnosed conditions, elevated cholesterol mentioned previously, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I’ve taken various antibiotics over the years, for minor infections, and I don’t recall any adverse effects. No known allergies to food, either. I’m not particularly sensitive, you see. I’ve always been able to eat… well, most things, without issue. I suppose that’s a positive, isn’t it? But again, my memory… I cannot guarantee absolute certainty.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that’s a difficult one. My parents are both deceased, unfortunately. My father… he lived to a good age, I believe, in his eighties. I believe he had some heart trouble towards the end, but I don’t recall the specifics. My mother… she passed away much younger, from… I believe it was some form of cancer. But I was rather young at the time, and I wasn’t privy to the details of her illness. As for siblings… I have one sister, but we haven’t spoken in many years. I’m afraid I’m not much help in that regard. I wasn't particularly close to either of them, and my recollections are rather… hazy. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m recently retired. I used to be an environmental engineer, working mostly from an office, but also occasional site visits. Now, I spend my time… rather quietly, to be honest. I enjoy reading, mostly historical novels. I do a bit of gardening, though my back doesn’t allow for as much as I’d like. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol socially – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on occasion. I wouldn't say I exercise regularly, but I do take a walk most days, weather permitting. I live alone, in a small cottage in the countryside. It’s a peaceful existence, if a bit… solitary. I try to maintain a healthy diet, but I do enjoy a good pastry now and then. Nothing too strenuous, you understand. It’s a… comfortable routine.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Verbos. That gives me a good picture. So, increased frequency, nocturia, sense of incomplete emptying, increased thirst, some fatigue, erectile dysfunction, no known allergies, elevated cholesterol previously mentioned, family history of heart disease and cancer, recently retired, quiet lifestyle, no smoking, occasional alcohol, walks most days. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll do a quick abdominal exam. Then, I'd like to check a urine sample to rule out infection or other issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly. I’m… used to doctors poking and prodding, you see. It’s all part of the process, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, in and out. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. It’s just to feel for any tenderness or masses. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain there. It’s… a little tender, perhaps, around the lower abdomen, but I wouldn’t describe it as painful. More of a… discomfort. I sometimes experience a bit of bloating, to be honest, but I assumed that was just… indigestion. I haven’t given it much thought, to be perfectly honest. Perhaps a little there, yes. Just… a slight sensitivity. But nothing too concerning, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay. And I’m also going to do a quick digital rectal exam, just to check the prostate. It’s a standard part of the exam for men your age. It can help us rule out any issues with the prostate gland. It may be a bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes. I… see. Well, if you feel it’s necessary, Doctor, please proceed. I understand the importance of a thorough examination. It’s… not my favourite part, naturally, but I’ll try to remain composed. Just… be gentle, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verbos. I’m checking now… The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. Alright. Now, I’d like to get a urine sample. I’ll leave you a cup and instructions. Please collect a midstream clean catch – that means start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream, and finish urinating. That will help avoid contamination. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. A midstream clean catch... yes, I recall instructions from previous examinations. I’ll do my best to follow them carefully. It's just… a bit of a logistical challenge, given the circumstances, perhaps. But I'll manage. Do you require anything further from me at this stage?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all for the physical exam for now. I’m going to leave you to collect the sample. I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all. Once you’ve collected it, just let me know and I’ll come back in to take a look.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I'll… call out when I’m ready. This is… not an ideal situation, naturally. But I trust your expertise implicitly. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos, did you manage to collect the sample?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I did. It was… a bit of a challenge, to be perfectly honest, given the… urgency. But I believe I followed the instructions correctly. Here you are. I do apologize if it’s not entirely pristine; it was a bit of a rushed effort.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. Alright. I'm going to run a quick dipstick test to check for infection, blood, and glucose levels. It will just take a few minutes. While we're waiting, I want to discuss some possibilities. Given your symptoms - increased frequency, nocturia, incomplete emptying, elevated thirst, and the slightly enlarged prostate – a few things could be going on. It could be benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is a common condition in men your age – the prostate gland simply enlarges with age, which can obstruct the flow of urine. It could also be an overactive bladder, or possibly a urinary tract infection, although you don't have any signs of fever or pain. The dipstick will help us narrow down the possibilities.
PATIENT: Benign prostatic hyperplasia… yes, I’ve heard of that. It seems… inevitable, doesn’t it? Given my age. I suppose I was hoping it wasn’t something too serious. An overactive bladder… that doesn’t sound particularly pleasant either. And a urinary tract infection… well, at least that’s treatable, I presume. I must admit, I am rather anxious to know what the results of the dipstick reveal. It’s… unsettling, this uncertainty. Do you have any initial thoughts, Doctor, based on your examination so far?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. The dipstick test is negative for infection and blood, which is good. However, it does show a slightly elevated glucose level. This is a bit concerning, as it could indicate diabetes. I know you haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes before, but sometimes it can develop gradually, without obvious symptoms. Given your increased thirst and frequency, elevated glucose level, this is something we need to investigate further. I want to order a comprehensive blood panel to check your glucose levels, kidney function, and prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which is a marker for prostate cancer. I'll also order a post-void residual volume test, to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. And finally, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and develop a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Goodness. That’s… rather alarming. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose it explains the thirst, at least. And the frequent urination… yes, that makes sense. A comprehensive blood panel… very well. And the prostate test… yes, that’s prudent, I suppose. It seems I have rather more to worry about than just my prostate. A follow-up appointment in one week… yes, that sounds sensible. Please, proceed with all the tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… hope it’s not too serious. It’s… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verbos. I understand your concern. It’s always unsettling to receive unexpected news, but it’s important to remember that we’re just gathering information at this point. We'll get a clearer picture once we have the results of the blood tests and the post-void residual volume test. Here are the requisition forms for the blood tests. You can take these to the lab at [Lab Name and Address]. For the post-void residual volume test, the nurse will schedule an appointment for you before you leave today. She will explain the procedure. It just involves urinating, and then we use an ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. In the meantime, I recommend you try to drink plenty of water, but avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can worsen your symptoms. And try to limit your fluid intake in the evening to reduce the frequency of nighttime urination. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Plenty of water… limit fluids in the evening… yes, that seems sensible. I can certainly manage that. The nurse will schedule the post-void test… good. I appreciate that. And the blood tests… I suppose I’ll need to find the lab. One question, Doctor… what, realistically, are the potential outcomes here? If it is diabetes… what does that entail? What sort of treatment would be involved? I’m trying to prepare myself, you see. It’s better to be informed, I suppose, than to be caught unawares. I apologize for asking such a blunt question.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verbos. That’s a very reasonable question, and it’s good you’re asking. If it is diabetes, the treatment will depend on the type and severity. Most likely, it would involve lifestyle changes – a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management. Depending on your glucose levels, you might also need medication – oral medications or, in some cases, insulin injections. We’ll monitor your glucose levels closely and adjust the treatment accordingly. We will also screen for any complications of diabetes, such as nerve damage, kidney problems, or eye problems, and treat them as needed. It’s important to remember that diabetes is a manageable condition, and with proper treatment, you can live a long and healthy life. We will discuss all of this in detail once we have the results of the blood tests. Don’t jump to conclusions or worry unnecessarily. We’ll take things one step at a time. In the meantime, I’m going to write a note for the nurse to provide you with some information on diabetes and healthy eating. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Manageable… that’s good to hear. A long and healthy life… yes, that’s what I’m hoping for. Information on diabetes… yes, that would be very helpful. No, Doctor, I believe that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve put my mind at ease, to some extent. I appreciate your patience and your thoroughness. I’ll go and find the nurse, then. And I’ll schedule the blood tests. Thank you again, Doctor Cumper. I’ll see you in a week. .
