DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Sham, yes? Hmm. Well, it’s… new place. Just moved here, you see. Need to find a doctor. That’s all, really. Medicare said I should come. Social thing, I think. Don't really need anything, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So, Medicare sometimes requires a wellness check when establishing care with a new physician. That’s perfectly normal. Just a general overview to get a baseline of your health. Though… it's good to rule things out, even if you feel fine. Do you have any specific concerns at all?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I feel… okay. Old, but okay. What kind of overview? Is this going to take long? I have things to do, you know. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be too long, Mr. Szmyd. Mostly just going over your medical history, some basic questions, and a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate… things like that. We’ll also go over any medications you’re currently taking, and any allergies you may have. Do you recall any significant past medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems… hmm. Let me think. Old age is one. Seriously though… I had my tonsils out when I was little. A very long time ago. And… I think I broke my arm once, falling off a… something. A ladder, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don't remember details. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I have to. Mostly just… aches and pains. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsils removed, possible arm fracture in the past. That's helpful. And you mentioned aches and pains… where are you experiencing those, specifically?
PATIENT: Everywhere! Back, mostly. And my knees. Always my knees. It's the weather, I think. Gets cold, they ache. Gets warm, they ache less. It’s… normal, yes? Everyone has aches and pains when they get old. I used to be very active, you know. Makeup is hard work. Standing all day. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, aches and pains, primarily in your back and knees, worsening with weather. You mentioned makeup... are you currently working?
PATIENT: Working? Not like I used to. Just little jobs now and then. Weddings, mostly. Friends of friends. It's not… steady. I did theater for years, very good theater. But that's… gone now. Too much trouble, too many young people. They don't respect the craft anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, occasional work, some history of theater. And you said your knees bother you… do you have any difficulty walking, or climbing stairs?
PATIENT: Difficulty? I walk. I climb stairs. Slowly, sometimes. It’s not… a big problem. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like everything else these days. I used to be able to run. Run everywhere! Now… Now I take my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just some discomfort with walking and stairs. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle with the knees. Old knees. They've seen things, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick listen to your heart and lungs… deep breath in… and out… good. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 90. Not terribly high, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, let’s take a look at your knees… can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oof. That's… that’s not comfortable. Feels like gravel, you know? Inside. Like… old gravel.
DOCTOR: Alright. I do feel some crepitus, and there is some tenderness when I press here. This suggests some wear and tear in the joint. It’s common with age and activity. Can you tell me about any swelling or locking in the knees?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Not really. Sometimes they feel… thick, maybe. After I've been standing a long time. Locking? No, they don’t lock. Just… ache. Always ache. They used to be strong. I could dance for hours.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant swelling or locking. Your ankles seem to have good range of motion. Let's quickly check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, which is normal for your age. Now, just a few questions about your medications and allergies… are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… nothing regularly. The doctor gave me something for my… the aches, a few years ago. But it didn’t help much, so I stopped taking it. I have some… cream, for the skin. Old age, you know? Skin gets dry.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Cream for dry skin. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Everything gives me allergies, probably. No, seriously… I think I’m allergic to dust. And… maybe cats. I sneeze a lot around cats. That’s about it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Allergies to dust and possibly cats. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re dealing with typical age-related wear and tear, particularly in your knees. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but we can monitor that. I recommend some gentle exercise to keep your joints moving, and we can discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options for the aches and pains. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Exercise? I’m too old for exercise. Over-the-counter… pain relief? Like what? Those pills make me sleepy. I just want to… be comfortable, you know? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Szmyd. There are several options we can explore. For the pain, there are creams and gels you can apply directly to your knees. They often have fewer side effects than pills. We can also discuss some gentle stretching exercises, like range-of-motion exercises, that can help keep your joints flexible. As for your blood pressure, we should monitor it at home, and I can provide you with some lifestyle recommendations to help lower it. Would you like me to write down some information about these options?
PATIENT: Lifestyle recommendations… that sounds like a lot of work. But… alright. Write down the creams, maybe. And the stretching. But no running. Definitely no running. And make sure it's easy to read. My eyesight isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. Here you are. This handout details some over-the-counter topical creams for knee pain, as well as some gentle stretching exercises. The font size is larger, as you requested. We should also schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to check your blood pressure and see how you’re doing with the creams and stretches. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmm. Very small print still, but… better. A month? Alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take all day. I have… things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. The appointment will be fairly brief, just a quick check-up. I'll have the receptionist schedule you for a month from today. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For not telling me I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. And you’re not falling apart. Just a little wear and tear, which is perfectly normal. The receptionist will be right with you to schedule your follow-up. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: .
