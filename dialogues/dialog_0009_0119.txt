DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. But it's... a problem. A rather delicate problem. I don’t usually bother doctors with... these things, but it's been going on for a few days now and I thought it best to get it checked.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many things can be a bit embarrassing to discuss, and that's perfectly alright. You've come to the right place, and I assure you, I've heard it all before. There's no need to feel shy. Could you tell me a little more about what's been going on for the past few days?
PATIENT: It's... discharge. From... well, you know. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s... there. And it’s not a normal color, if you understand what I mean. It’s yellowish, and sometimes there’s a… a bit of an odor. Honestly, it’s quite distressing. I haven’t been… with anyone, mind you. I haven’t had relations in… well, a very long time. So, I really don’t understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Yellowish discharge with an odor, and you haven’t had any sexual activity recently. That helps to narrow things down. It's good you're paying attention to changes. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me when you first noticed this discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. It was... around last Thursday, I believe. Yes, Thursday. I was getting dressed and noticed… something wasn’t quite right. I thought it might be just a bit of… irritation, at first. But it hasn’t gone away. And now it's... more noticeable. It's just... unseemly, doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around last Thursday. And it’s been consistent since then, or has it gotten worse over the past few days?
PATIENT: Well, it hasn't gotten better, that's for certain. I’d say it’s… slightly more frequent now. And the smell... it’s a bit stronger, perhaps. Though I'm trying not to dwell on it, naturally. One doesn't want to be… preoccupied. It’s very unsettling, doctor. I’ve always been very… particular about my hygiene, you see.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like it’s causing you a good deal of worry, and it's good you’re being proactive about it. Now, aside from the discharge and the odor, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… no. No burning. No itching. No… discomfort, really. Just… the discharge. And the smell, of course. And a general feeling of… unease. It's just… not right. I haven't felt feverish, or anything like that. Honestly, I've been trying to ignore it, hoping it would simply… resolve itself. But it hasn't, and frankly, I'm starting to get rather agitated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no burning, itching, or fever. Just the discharge and odor, and a feeling of unease. That’s helpful to know. Have you experienced anything like this before, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I have never experienced anything like this in my life! I've always been… very careful. Very clean. And this… this is simply… dreadful. I haven’t the slightest idea what could have caused this. It's quite upsetting, really. It's not as if I've been… gallivanting about. I keep a very respectable household, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick. It’s good to know you haven’t experienced this before. It's important to investigate, and often, these things have a simple explanation. Now, to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must we? I suppose so. Well, I had my gallbladder removed, oh, twenty years ago now. And I have… arthritis, in my hands. It flares up sometimes. Otherwise, I've always been quite healthy. I take a multivitamin, and I try to eat a balanced diet. I’ve never been one for… excessive indulgence. And I'm on Medicare, of course. Is that what you need to know? Do you require a list of all my medications? It’s a rather long list, I'm afraid. All those supplements...
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Gallbladder removal twenty years ago and arthritis. And a multivitamin and other supplements. No need for a full medication list just yet, we can get to that if needed. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections or other vaginal infections in the past?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Are you implying something, doctor? I assure you, I have lived a very chaste life! The very suggestion is… outrageous! I have never had a sexually transmitted infection! Nor have I ever experienced a… a vaginal infection of any kind! This is quite… impertinent, if I may say so. I’ve always been extremely careful and… and respectful. Really, I don't appreciate this line of questioning at all.
DOCTOR: Oh, my apologies, Ms. Wartick. I did not intend to offend you in any way. I apologize if my question was insensitive. It’s simply a standard part of the evaluation process, to rule out all possibilities. I understand and respect your feelings entirely. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Well... I suppose I can forgive your... impertinence. It’s just... I find this whole situation rather distressing, you see. As for allergies... I am slightly allergic to penicillin. I get a rash. A rather unpleasant rash, actually. And I'm a little sensitive to shellfish. It gives me indigestion. But other than that, no. I’m generally quite robust. Though I do get a bit of hay fever in the spring. Is that relevant? Honestly, I don't see how any of this pertains to the… discharge. It's simply… baffling. And rather unpleasant, I must add.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin and shellfish. And hay fever. Thank you for letting me know. Now, Ms. Wartick, I think it would be best if I performed a quick physical exam. This will help me to better understand what might be causing the discharge. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. But please be gentle. And… discreet. This is all very… humiliating, you see. I do hope you’ve washed your hands thoroughly. And… must you examine… everything? Really, I find the whole prospect rather… undignified. But if it’s necessary… I suppose I have no choice. Just… please be quick about it. And be careful!
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I completely understand your concerns, and I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. I will wash my hands thoroughly, and we will only examine what is necessary to get a clear understanding of the situation. I'll explain everything as I go along. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'll start by taking a look at the external area, and then I'll need to do a gentle pelvic exam. I will use a speculum, but I will warm it first to make it more comfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… speculum? Honestly! Must you? It sounds… dreadful. I suppose so. But please be quick! And be gentle, as you promised. This is all very… unnerving. I’ve never had one of those before. Really, I find the whole thing rather… barbaric. And please, don’t say anything. I simply don’t want to hear it. Just… get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will explain as little as possible, as you wish. I’ll warm the speculum first. Okay, Ms. Wartick, I'm just taking a look now… I notice some yellowish discharge, as you described. The vaginal walls appear slightly inflamed, but there are no obvious sores or lesions. The cervix looks normal, but I’m going to take a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for analysis. This will help us determine the cause of the inflammation. That's all for now, Ms. Wartick. It's just a routine procedure, and it didn't take long, did it?
PATIENT: Honestly! It's… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. And cold! I just want it to be over. Inflamed? What does that mean? Is it serious? Am I… ill? And a sample? What will you do with it? Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite faint. I really wish I hadn't come. This is all very… distressing. Will I need… medication? And will anyone… know? Honestly, I'm terribly embarrassed.
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious after an examination like this. Inflammation simply means there’s some irritation or infection present. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. The sample will be sent to the lab, and they’ll analyze it to determine the cause of the inflammation. It could be a number of things – a common vaginal infection, a yeast infection, or something else. Once we have the results, we can determine the best course of treatment. No one will know, Ms. Wartick. Everything is confidential. And whether you need medication depends on the results of the lab analysis. We'll discuss all your options thoroughly once we have them. You’re not feeling faint, are you?
PATIENT: Well, it's all very unsettling, doctor. I just don't like the sound of "inflammation." It sounds… dreadful. And I certainly don't want to be taking any… medication, if I can avoid it. I have a sensitive stomach, you see. No, I suppose not faint. Just… agitated. And embarrassed. Honestly, I’ve always been very careful. Very clean. This is all very… out of character. How long will the results take? And what if it’s… something serious? Will I need… hospitalization? Oh dear. This is all terribly frightening. I really wish I hadn’t come.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel frightened, Ms. Wartick. But let’s try to remain calm until we have the lab results. Most vaginal infections are easily treated with medication, and hospitalization is rarely necessary. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding douching, using scented soaps or feminine hygiene products, and wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Cotton underwear… Yes, I suppose I can manage that. Though it’s not terribly fashionable, is it? Well… if it is an infection… can I… give it to anyone? My gardener comes twice a week, you see. And I have a bridge club meeting on Friday. Oh dear. This is all terribly awkward. And what if it… recurs? Will I have to keep coming back here? Honestly, the thought of another examination… it's quite distressing. And will it… affect anything? I do hope not.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Wartick. Let’s address them one by one. Most common vaginal infections are not sexually transmitted, so you wouldn’t need to worry about giving it to your gardener. And the risk of transmission at a bridge club meeting is extremely low. As for recurrence, it depends on the cause of the infection. If it's a simple yeast infection, it's less likely to recur than some other types of infections. We'll discuss preventative measures once we have the results. And as for future examinations, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I promise to make you as comfortable as possible. Right now, let's focus on getting the results and taking things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Well… no. I suppose not. Though I’m still rather apprehensive, naturally. And embarrassed. Honestly, I've never been so… flustered in my life. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results. And be gentle. And discreet. That’s all I ask. Honestly, I do hope this is all over soon. It's all very… upsetting. Thank you, doctor. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I must go and compose myself. It's been… quite an ordeal.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I understand. I will call you as soon as the results are available. And I promise to be as gentle and discreet as possible. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Ms. Wartick. And please, try not to worry too much.
