DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My daughter scheduled this appointment, you see. She gets terribly worried about… things. Something about my eyes and ears, I believe. It's all rather inconvenient, if you must know. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common for family members to encourage check-ups, even if we're feeling alright. No problem at all, we’ll take our time. So, your daughter mentioned something about your eyes and ears. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… I suppose things are a bit… fuzzy. And sounds seem… distant. But honestly, Doctor, at my age, things are bound to go a little. It's probably nothing. I haven't paid it much mind, to be perfectly frank. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's good you're being honest with me. Even small changes can be worth looking into. It's better to be safe. We'll try to be as efficient as possible, and I'll keep the luncheon in mind. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the fuzziness in your vision?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, describing it is rather… tedious. It’s just… not as sharp as it used to be. Like looking through a dirty window, perhaps? Though I assure you, I keep a very clean house. It’s difficult to explain, and frankly, I’m not one for dwelling on unpleasant sensations. Is there a quick test we can do? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Like looking through a dirty window" is a very helpful description, actually. We can absolutely do a quick vision test. It won’t take long – just reading some letters on a chart. And then we can do a brief hearing check as well. Before we do that, just a couple of quick questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness?
PATIENT: Ringing? No, not particularly. Though… now that you mention it, there was a faint… hum, I suppose, a few days ago. But it was gone as quickly as it came. And dizziness… well, I do get a bit lightheaded sometimes, but that's just my age, isn't it? I've always been rather… delicate. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. Are we nearly done?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. The hum and occasional lightheadedness are good things to mention. It's good we're talking about these things, even if they seem minor. Just to be thorough, have you had any recent falls, or any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Falls? Heavens, no! I would never fall. I’m a very careful woman. Though… last month, I did stumble slightly on the rug. But that was the rug’s fault, not mine. It needs to be secured, my daughter says. She fusses over everything, really. I maintain a very tidy home, as I’ve mentioned. Are we still questioning me? I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Julie. You certainly sound like a very careful and tidy person. We’re just gathering some information to get a complete picture. It's good that your daughter is looking out for you. Just one last quick question before we move on to a brief physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your overall energy levels or mood recently?
PATIENT: Mood? Honestly, Doctor, at my age, one doesn't have moods. One is simply… resigned. And energy? Well, I tire easily, naturally. All this questioning is rather draining, if you must know. I find it all rather… intrusive. Are you absolutely certain this examination is necessary? I have a luncheon with the ladies, and I wouldn't want to miss it. I’m the guest of honor, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. It sounds like you’re feeling understandably tired and perhaps a bit overwhelmed. We’ll keep things as brief as possible. The reason your daughter brought you in is because even small changes can sometimes indicate something that’s easily addressed. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to check your ears, eyes, and balance. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be gentle. And do hurry. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. And I simply must be on time. This is terribly inconvenient. But I suppose… I suppose I’ll cooperate. Just… don’t poke me too much. And do explain what you’re doing as you go along. I dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I’ll explain everything as I go along, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears with this instrument. It won’t hurt at all. I’m just checking for any wax buildup or signs of infection. Just relax and breathe normally. Hmm… a little bit of wax buildup, but nothing concerning. Now, I’ll just do the same thing on the other side. Okay, a similar amount of wax on this side. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. I’m just going to ask you to read some letters on a chart.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, that’s rather… unpleasant. I told my daughter I didn’t like doctors. Always poking and prodding. And wax? I assure you, I keep a very clean head. This is simply ridiculous. Hurry up and get it over with. I have a luncheon to attend, you know. And please, explain what you're doing with that chart. I don't want to be caught unawares.
DOCTOR: I apologize for any discomfort, Ms. Julie. I understand it’s not the most pleasant experience. Now, let’s move on to the eye chart. I’m just going to ask you to read the smallest line of letters you can see. It will help me assess your vision. Can you read this line for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the print is terribly small. And the lighting in here is quite unflattering, you know. Let me see… is it… E? Yes, definitely E. And… F? Perhaps. Though it's all rather blurry. I really should have brought my reading glasses. This is a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Julie. It’s good you’re telling me it’s blurry. Let’s try reading the next line, if you can. We can adjust the chart as needed. Just take your time. If you can only make out a few letters, that’s fine. I just want to get a sense of your vision.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is utterly ridiculous. I can barely make out anything. Is it… P? No, perhaps it's R. Oh dear, I can't tell. This is most distressing. My eyes are perfectly fine, I assure you. I simply need a stronger cup of tea. Are we nearly finished yet? I have a reputation to uphold, you know. And the ladies will be expecting me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. It seems your vision is somewhat diminished. That's not unusual at your age, and it's something we can certainly address. Now, let's just quickly check your balance. Could you please stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I told you I'm delicate. Standing for long periods is simply out of the question. But very well, I'll cooperate. Just… don’t expect miracles. I’m not as spry as I used to be. And please, be careful. I don't want to fall. This is most inconvenient. What exactly are you looking for?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Julie. I’ll be right here to support you. I'm just going to ask you to stand with your feet together, and close your eyes. Just for a few seconds, if you can. I’m checking to see if you have any difficulty maintaining your balance. Just let me know if you feel unsteady, okay?
PATIENT: Oh dear! Oh my! I am unsteady! I knew it! I told my daughter I'm delicate! This is dreadful! I'm going to fall! Doctor, please catch me! This is simply appalling! I need to sit down immediately! This is most inconvenient! What did I tell you? This is precisely why I dislike doctors! They always poke and prod and make me feel unsteady! I want to go home! Now!
DOCTOR: There you are, Ms. Julie. That’s alright, it’s perfectly normal to feel a little unsteady. It's good we checked. It seems you do have some difficulty with your balance. Okay, Ms. Julie, I think I have enough information now. It seems you have some decreased vision and some difficulty with your balance. It's likely this is due to age-related changes, but it's important to rule out other potential causes. I recommend a more thorough evaluation with an ophthalmologist for your vision, and possibly a physical therapist to assess your balance. Would you be open to those referrals?
PATIENT: Referrals? More doctors? Oh, honestly! This is simply dreadful! I’ve already seen one doctor, and it’s been utterly exhausting! I do not want to see more doctors! It’s too much trouble! And the ladies will be wondering where I am! I suppose… I suppose I can consider it. But I make no promises! And I want a full explanation of what this involves. And it must be quick! And it must not interfere with my luncheon schedule! This is most inconvenient! I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I completely understand your reluctance. We can take things at your pace. I can provide you with referrals to a highly-rated ophthalmologist and a physical therapist in the area. The ophthalmologist will do a comprehensive eye exam to determine the cause of your vision changes and recommend appropriate treatment, such as glasses or medication. The physical therapist will assess your balance and strength and develop a customized exercise program to help improve your stability. Here are the referrals. I’ve included their contact information and a brief description of their services. You can schedule appointments at your convenience. I also recommend avoiding driving until you’ve had your vision checked, just to be safe. And if you experience any falls or dizziness, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: More appointments… honestly! This is simply dreadful. And avoiding driving? That’s… unacceptable! How am I supposed to get to my luncheon? And see my friends? I suppose… I suppose I’ll look into it. But I make no promises. And I expect a full explanation of any costs involved. And I want to be sure they can accommodate my schedule. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… get me out of here. I’m exhausted. And I’m late for my luncheon. This has been most inconvenient. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I understand. I’ll have the nurse walk you to the exit. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. I hope you enjoy your luncheon. Have a good day, Ms. Julie. .
