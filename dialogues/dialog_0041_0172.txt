DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s a social visit, really. My husband and I just moved here, and someone said I needed to…register, I suppose? With a doctor. Medicare insisted. Honestly, I don't recall the specifics. Is that alright? I haven’t a clue why they need to know everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Candice. That’s perfectly alright. It's very common after a move, Medicare wants to make sure you have a local doctor established. It’s mostly just paperwork and getting a general idea of your health history. Don't worry, we won't pry. I see here you recently moved…rural location, correct?
PATIENT: Rural? Well, it's country, dear. Not quite the same thing. And yes, we did. From… oh, bother. Somewhere with trees. A very nice place. It's all rather unimportant, isn’t it? As long as I have my husband and a comfortable chair, I’m perfectly content. Do you need to know where, specifically? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: You're right to prioritize what matters. No, it's not essential to know the exact location. Just trying to get a complete picture. Okay. Let's start with something simple. Have you been feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: Healthy enough. At my age, “healthy” is a relative term, you know. A few aches and pains, naturally. What do you expect? I’m not a spring chicken. Everything works… adequately. I suppose. Is there a point to all these questions, or are we simply making conversation? I have a bridge club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Candice. You're right, at 79, "healthy" has a different meaning. We just want to make sure nothing major is going on, and to establish a baseline for future care. It is a little like a check-up, getting a feel for things. Are those aches and pains new, or have they been around for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, ages. Honestly, I couldn’t tell you when they started. Probably around the time I turned… a sensible age. They come and go. Mostly go, thankfully. I take a little something for them when they’re bothersome. A pink pill, I believe. Or maybe it's blue. It all runs together after a while. Really, I’m not one for dwelling on these things. A little discomfort is the price one pays for a long life. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. It sounds like you’ve been managing things well on your own. Just to clarify, you mentioned a pink or blue pill for pain…do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious, no! Do I look like I keep a pharmaceutical catalog in my head? I get it from the pharmacy. The nice young man there knows what I need. I simply tell him it hurts, and he provides a solution. Honestly, I find all this insistence on details rather… unnecessary. Is there a quicker way to finish this visit? I really mustn't be late for bridge.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to feel that way, Candice. I apologize for pressing for details. It’s just routine, trying to get a complete picture. We can certainly speed things up. Let's skip the medications for now. Do you have any known allergies to anything – foods, medications, insect stings?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I've noticed. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t care for beets, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. And I swat at mosquitoes, like everyone else. Really, I'm quite resilient. I’ve lived a long life without coddling myself. I’m starting to feel rather foolish answering these questions. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: No foolishness at all, Candice. You've been very patient. It sounds like you're generally quite healthy and independent, which is wonderful. Just a few more quick questions. Have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh dear. Let me think. There was something… a long time ago. When I was much younger. It was… in the hospital, of course. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. Something about my… insides. No, no, I shouldn’t dwell on it. It’s all very hazy. Honestly, it was decades ago. Does it truly matter? I've recovered perfectly, if that’s any consolation. And I'd rather not discuss unpleasant memories. Can we please wrap this up? My husband will be wondering where I am. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. We can absolutely wrap things up. It sounds like you had a surgery some time ago and recovered well. That's all we need to know for now. Let's just do a quick physical exam—blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs—just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
