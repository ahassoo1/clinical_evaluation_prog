DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling… unsteady, I suppose. Like I might fall over. It’s been happening on and off, and it’s rather worrying. I don’t… recall exactly when it started, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that’s perfectly alright. It is good you came in to get it checked out. Feeling unsteady is definitely something we want to understand. “On and off” is helpful, but could you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… That is the trouble, isn’t it? It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific. Sometimes it’s when I’m just walking, other times… well, I was working, of course, and it happened then, too. Though, that work is quite physical. Rotary drilling… it keeps one busy. I truly can’t pinpoint a pattern, I’m afraid. It just… comes and goes. Is that… helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No, Lilyanna, don't apologize at all. That is helpful to know – or rather, to know that there isn't a clear trigger. It makes it a little trickier, but we'll figure it out. You mentioned rotary drilling - how long have you been doing that type of work?
PATIENT: Oh, a good while now. Approximately… seven years, I believe. It’s demanding, certainly, but I’m accustomed to it. It was… my husband’s profession as well. He… he taught me. It’s difficult to speak of, but I manage. I suppose it’s a little more physical than most jobs, as I said. A lot of standing, a lot of… balance, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilyanna. That sounds like very physically demanding work. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband. Seven years is a significant amount of time, and it’s good you're continuing something you both shared. Okay, let's try to describe these episodes a little more closely. When you feel unsteady, is it more like dizziness – a spinning sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, um… spinning? Not… necessarily. It’s not like the room is whirling, if that makes sense. It’s more… a loss of balance. Like my feet aren’t quite… under me. A wobbliness, perhaps? It's difficult to describe. And sometimes it's just a feeling of being weak, like I might… give way. It comes in different flavors, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a loss of balance, a wobbliness, a feeling of weakness” – that's very helpful, Lilyanna. It sounds like it’s not a typical spinning dizziness. Do these episodes last for a long time, or are they brief?
PATIENT: Brief, mostly. Usually just a few moments, perhaps a minute at most. Though, there was… one instance, a few weeks ago, where it lasted a bit longer. Perhaps five or ten minutes? It was rather frightening, I must admit. I had to sit down immediately. But generally, they come and go quite quickly. It’s the unpredictability that worries me most, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Unpredictability is concerning. Okay, so brief episodes, lasting seconds to maybe ten minutes on occasion. Have you noticed anything that seems to make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t specifically noticed anything. Standing for long periods, perhaps? It happens at work quite often, as I said. But it also happens when I’m… just resting, sometimes. I suppose… exertion makes it more likely, but it doesn’t necessarily cause it. I’ve been trying to pay attention, but it’s… elusive, you see? It just happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, standing for long periods may be a factor, but not a consistent trigger. Elusive is a good way to put it. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms with these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… nauseous, perhaps? Not full-blown sickness, just a queasiness. And… occasionally, a slight headache beforehand. But those aren't always present, mind you. It's rarely all the symptoms at once. It’s… a bit of a mixed bag, honestly. I apologize for being so… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Lilyanna. You're describing exactly what’s happening, and that’s the most important thing. Nausea and occasional headache beforehand are good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your general health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… no, not that I am aware of. I haven't been to a doctor in quite some time, truthfully. My husband always handled those things. And… after he passed… it simply didn’t seem important. I take a multivitamin, if that counts for anything. I try to eat well, sleep reasonably, but… life has been rather disruptive, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely alright. Losing a partner can make it difficult to prioritize self-care. No, a multivitamin doesn’t count as a medical condition. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, nothing of that nature. Never any surgeries, never any serious hospital stays. I’ve been… quite fortunate, in that regard. A few minor illnesses, colds and such, but nothing requiring anything more than rest and… perhaps some tea. I pride myself on being reasonably robust, generally. Though, this… unsteadiness is rather concerning, precisely because it’s so unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Good. And are you currently taking any medications besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just the multivitamin. I… I’m not one for taking pills, unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to let my body… manage on its own, if that makes sense. Though, I suppose this unsteadiness is indicating that it needs a little assistance at the moment. It’s just… a bit unnerving.
DOCTOR: It does sound unnerving, and you’re right to get it checked out. Alright, Lilyanna, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. Never any reactions to medications, never any issues with food. I… I’ve always been able to eat whatever was put in front of me, thankfully. And I haven’t encountered anything in my environment that causes a reaction, to my knowledge. I suppose I’m reasonably… bland, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do either of your parents or any close relatives have a history of dizziness, balance problems, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… difficult to recall, truthfully. My parents passed away when I was quite young. And I… I wasn’t particularly close to my extended family. I believe my mother may have mentioned some… vague complaints of dizziness in her later years, but it wasn't anything serious, as far as I recall. Nothing diagnosed, nothing treated. Just… occasional complaints. I truly don't know enough to say with any certainty.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear family history of balance problems. That’s alright. Now, I’m going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don't partake in recreational drugs. I… I find those things rather… detrimental, to be honest. I prefer a good night's sleep and a clear head.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, before we move on, let's just quickly confirm your height and weight. The nurse already took these, but just for my records… you are 193 centimeters and 150 pounds, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That is correct. 193 centimeters, and 150 pounds, as the nurse recorded. It feels rather… unusual to state it aloud, to be honest. I'm quite tall, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright, Lilyanna, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and do a neurological exam to assess your balance, coordination, and reflexes. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds… perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I… I trust your judgment, and I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. I'm hoping to find some answers, and I'm willing to cooperate in any way that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor and your arms relaxed at your sides?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 120 over 80, which is normal. Your heart sounds are regular and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I can do that. Please, proceed. I am following your finger.
DOCTOR: Good. Now I'm going to check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly and stand with your feet together, arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I am standing now, Doctor. Arms at my sides, feet together.
DOCTOR: Okay, now please close your eyes. Just try to maintain your balance as best you can.
PATIENT: Um… I… I don’t feel very steady, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Please sit down. That’s what I suspected. You exhibited some instability with your eyes closed. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'm going to lightly tap on your knees with this reflex hammer. This is normal and won’t hurt. Your reflexes are normal. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is normal, your heart and lungs sound clear, your neurological function is largely intact, but you exhibited some instability with your eyes closed, suggesting a possible balance issue. Based on this initial exam, I suspect this could be related to a few things. It could be a mild inner ear problem, a problem with your proprioception – that’s your sense of body position – or it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I’d like to refer you to an audiologist for a hearing and balance assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. Blood tests and an audiologist… I am happy to pursue whatever steps are necessary to determine the cause of this. I… I appreciate your thoroughness. Answering the question about causing this, I am more than happy to do so, for sure.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I'll have the nurse draw some blood from you before you leave. The tests will check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other common causes of balance issues. And I'll write a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-recommended audiologist in the city. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that could increase your risk of falling. If you experience any sudden or severe dizziness, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as headache, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, sir. I do not… believe so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel… reassured knowing that we’re taking steps to investigate this. Avoiding strenuous activity and being aware of new symptoms… those are sensible precautions. Thank you, Doctor Tosca. For your time, and for your… concern. It’s much appreciated. It is a relief to have this process underway, honestly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Here's a copy of the blood test requisition form and the referral to Dr. Reed. If you have any questions or concerns after the tests or your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you need a work note for any time off?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, please. A work note would be… extremely helpful. I’m not sure how long I’ll need off, but it’s best to have something on hand. Rotary drilling requires a certain… alertness, and I wouldn’t want to risk an accident.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This note excuses you from work for up to one week, pending the results of your tests and your appointment with the audiologist. It states that you are experiencing balance issues and may require further evaluation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: No, sir. That is… quite sufficient. Everything is handled wonderfully. I believe I have everything I need. Thank you again, Doctor Tosca. I appreciate your time and your… kindness. Perhaps… I will see you again soon, after the tests. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
