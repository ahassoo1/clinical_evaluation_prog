DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Don’t bother with the “nice to meet you” part, we’re just getting this over with, aren’t we? It’s my…well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like tar. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. That’s what the young man at the pharmacy said it could be, so here I am. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I understand, Dawnetta. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, even if you’re not overly concerned right now. Black, tarry stools can be a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract, and it’s important to figure out what’s causing it. You mentioned the pain pills for your arthritis – are those a narcotic pain reliever, like codeine or morphine?
PATIENT: Oh, bleeding, is it? Now you’re scaring me a little. I just want to get back to my garden, you know? And yes, they… they have codeine in them, I think. The little white ones. My husband, Earl, handles the refills, I mostly just take them. He’s good with all that doctor stuff. Honestly, I don't pay attention to the names, just that they keep the pain away. Is this going to take long? I have tomatoes that need staking.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. It’s helpful to know. Codeine can cause constipation, and sometimes that can lead to changes in stool color, but we need to rule out other causes first, just to be safe. We’ll do a quick exam and I’ll ask a few more questions. It shouldn’t take too long, and we’ll get you back to your tomatoes as soon as we can. First, let’s talk a little bit about the stool itself. How often are you seeing this black stool?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not every time, mind you. It's been… maybe three times now, in the last month or so? It's mostly normal, you know, brown and… regular. But then, boom, black. And it smells… different. Hard to explain. Not worse, just… different. And it's always after I've taken the pills for a few days straight. Earl says I worry too much. He thinks it's just my imagination. Men. They never understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, three times in the last month, and it seems to correlate with taking the pain pills for a few days. And you've noticed a change in the smell as well. That’s good observation, thank you. Now, besides the change in stool, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? My arthritis, of course. That's always a symptom. But you mean… with this stool business? Let me think. No… no blood, not that I've seen. No stomach pain, really. A little bit of tiredness, maybe. But I'm 73, I'm supposed to be tired! And…oh, sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But that happens all the time. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, no visible blood in the stool, no stomach pain, tiredness, and dizziness when standing up quickly. Yes, the dizziness is something we should definitely note. That could be related to a few things, including potential low blood pressure or anemia. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis is enough, honestly. But… Earl had that high blood pressure, so I get checked every year or so. And I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be 30 years ago now. Nothing else, really. I've been lucky. Mostly just aches and pains and the occasional black stool to worry about. Honestly, I don't understand why I even bother coming to the doctor.
DOCTOR: It's good you've been generally healthy, and it's helpful to know about the high blood pressure and gallbladder removal. It's always best to rule things out, even if we suspect a simple explanation. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the pain pills?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Earl keeps track of all that. I take a little pill for my water retention, something blue. And… a vitamin D, the doctor told me to take it for my bones. And… that’s it, I think. He gives me a little baggie every month with all my pills. I just take them. I don't pay attention to the names. He'd be furious if I messed it up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for water retention, vitamin D, and the pain pills. That gives us a good start. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a bit of a rash sometimes when I eat strawberries, but that's it. Never had a problem with any pills, thankfully. Earl always checks before I take anything new. He's very careful, bless his heart. He worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Good, no known medication allergies. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, go ahead. Get it over with. I suppose. I’d rather be staking my tomatoes, but if you must poke and prod… just be gentle, alright? My skin is a bit thin these days. And don't take too long, will you?
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. No masses noted. I'm not feeling any obvious abnormalities in your abdomen, but we still need to investigate the cause of the black stool. I'd like to order a stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count to check for anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. But… alright, fine. If you think it’s necessary. Just tell Earl where to take it, will you? He handles all this medical nonsense. I just want to go home and get back to my garden. And please, no more poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. We'll keep it as simple as possible. I'll give you a requisition form for the stool test, and instructions on how to collect the sample. You can take it to the lab at [Name of Lab], which is located at [Address of Lab]. And I’ll order the complete blood count, which can be done here at the clinic with a simple blood draw. While we're waiting for the test results, I recommend continuing your pain medication as prescribed, but if you notice the black stool becoming more frequent or if you experience any other symptoms, such as weakness, dizziness, or shortness of breath, please contact us immediately. Also, let's discuss some dietary changes, increasing your fiber intake can help with constipation. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dietary changes? Oh, goodness, don't get me started on dietary changes. Earl is always trying to get me to eat more bran. It tastes like sawdust! Honestly, I just want to know when I can go home. And… will these tests take long? I have tomatoes that are practically begging to be staked. And… is it serious? Don't tell me it's something terrible. I'm too old to deal with terrible things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dawnetta. Let's address your questions one by one. The tests should be processed within a few days, and we'll contact you as soon as we have the results. I can also arrange for you to receive the results online through our patient portal if you'd prefer. As for whether it's serious, it’s too early to say definitively. Black stool can be caused by a number of things, and it’s not always something terrible. It could be a side effect of the pain medication, or it could be something else that we need to investigate further. That's why we're doing the tests – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll start with the simplest explanations first, and we'll work our way through the possibilities. I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and get you back to enjoying your garden as soon as possible. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. And I'll write down the lab information and instructions for the stool test for Earl. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just... get me the paperwork, so I can go home. And please, tell Earl to handle everything. He's good with all this. I just want my tomatoes. And I want to go home. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Dawnetta. That's perfectly reasonable. Here's the paperwork for Earl, and the instructions for the stool sample. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the test results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Thank you for coming in today. And please, enjoy your tomatoes. .
