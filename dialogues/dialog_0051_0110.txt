DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to meet me as well. My name is Nicoletta McNabb, but everyone calls me Nicoletta. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping you can help me feel…brighter again. I feel a bit…stuck, you see? Like I need a little jumpstart, a reset, to get my health back on track. I’m 87 years young, and things just aren't working quite as well as they used to.
DOCTOR: “Stuck” and needing a “jumpstart”… I understand. It’s very common to feel that way as we get older, Nicoletta. Thank you for sharing that with me. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me more about what specifically feels “stuck”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? It’s not one thing, really. My energy isn’t what it used to be, of course. I get tired just doing little things around the house. And my memory…well, it’s not as sharp as it once was. I forget names sometimes, or where I put my glasses—even though they’re usually on my head! It’s just…a general feeling of not being myself, I suppose. I used to be so active, always volunteering, always busy. Now…I mostly just sit.
DOCTOR: That sounds frustrating, Nicoletta. It’s good you’re recognizing these changes and seeking help. So, decreased energy and some memory concerns…and a feeling of not being yourself. Let's try to break this down a bit. When did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It didn’t happen all at once, you see. It’s been…gradual. Maybe about a year ago, I started feeling more tired than usual. And the memory…oh, that's been creeping up for maybe six months or so. It started with little things – forgetting appointments, misplacing items. Now, it’s…more frequent. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, though. Time just…slips away, doesn’t it? I do remember my dear husband passing a little over two years ago, and I wonder if that might have something to do with it, too. It was a big change.
DOCTOR: It absolutely could, Nicoletta. Grief can have a significant impact on both physical and mental wellbeing. It's very common to experience changes like fatigue and memory difficulties after a loss. Now, besides the fatigue and memory concerns, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well…let me think. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t really crave anything anymore, you know? I eat because I know I should, not because I enjoy it. And my sleep…it’s a bit patchy. I wake up several times a night, and sometimes I just lie awake for long periods. Nothing painful, thankfully. Just…restless. And sometimes, I feel a little…down. Not deeply sad, but just…not my usual cheerful self. I suppose that’s it, really. Nothing dramatic, just…little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, disrupted sleep, and a generally lower mood alongside the fatigue and memory concerns. Thank you for sharing all of that, Nicoletta. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, and I’ve been taking medication for that ever since. My regular doctor—Dr. Reyes—monitors that closely. And I had a hip replacement about ten years ago; that went very well, and I don’t have any problems with it now. Other than that…not much. No major surgeries or illnesses. I do take a daily vitamin, just to be on the safe side. My mother lived to be 95, so I suppose good genes are on my side!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nicoletta – a history of good health and a relatively stable medical background. High blood pressure managed by Dr. Reyes, a successful hip replacement, and daily vitamins. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. Let me think…Dr. Reyes changes them from time to time, you see. I believe it’s…a small white pill. I’m terribly bad with names, especially medication names! I usually just leave it to my daughter, Maria, to handle all of that. She’s very organized. I’m afraid I can’t be much help with the specific name, but I assure you, I take it religiously every morning. Would it be alright if we checked my medication list at Dr. Reyes’ office? I’m certain they have it on file.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nicoletta. That’s a perfectly reasonable approach. We can certainly access your records from Dr. Reyes’ office. It’s always best to be thorough. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don’t. No allergies at all, as far as I know. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution! I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve never had a problem. So, no allergies to report, thankfully. That’s one thing I don’t have to worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Nicoletta. No known allergies. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle…Well, as I said before, I used to be very active. I volunteered at the local school, helping the children with their reading. And I loved to garden; I had a beautiful flower garden. But since my husband passed…I haven’t been doing as much. I mostly stay home now. I enjoy reading—when I can remember what I’ve read!—and watching television. I don’t get out much, except for church on Sundays. And I live alone, you see. My daughter, Maria, lives nearby, and she visits often, which is a blessing. But mostly, it's just me. I try to eat healthy, but it's not always easy when you're on your own.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nicoletta. It sounds like you've experienced some significant changes in recent years. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so that's probably a good idea. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Your blood pressure is 148/82. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, with a normal rate and rhythm. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackling. Now, let’s take a look at your ears. Your ears look clear, no signs of infection. And finally, let's just open your mouth wide and say "Ah." Your throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Everything seems within normal limits for now.
PATIENT: That wasn’t bad at all, Doctor. You were very gentle. I appreciate you explaining everything as you went along. So, everything seems alright? Apart from the blood pressure, of course. Is that something we need to worry about? My doctor—Dr. Reyes—usually adjusts my medication if it gets too high, doesn’t she?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything seems within normal limits for now, Nicoletta. The blood pressure is slightly elevated, but as you said, Dr. Reyes is very good at managing that. We can certainly send a message to her office with today’s reading, and she can review your medication. Now, given your fatigue, memory concerns, and lower mood, I’d like to order some blood tests just to rule out any underlying causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps to find out what’s going on, I’m happy to have any tests you think are necessary. Vitamin deficiencies…that sounds plausible. I haven't been eating as well as I used to, I must admit. I’ll do anything to feel a bit more like myself again. So, yes, please, go ahead and order the tests. When will I be able to get those done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write an order for a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, vitamin B12 and vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. You can have those done at the lab just down the hall – they’re open until 5:00 PM today. It usually takes about 2-3 business days for the results to come back. Once we have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to help you feel better. In the meantime, I recommend trying to stay as active as possible, even if it’s just a short walk each day. And make sure you’re getting enough sunlight and eating a balanced diet. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds very manageable, Doctor. A short walk each day…I think I can manage that. And I do enjoy sitting in the sun, when the weather allows. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything so clearly. Thank you. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure out what’s going on. I appreciate your help very much. I’ll go down to the lab now and get those tests done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicoletta. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take your time getting those tests done. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. I’m sure everything will be alright. Bye bye to you as well.
