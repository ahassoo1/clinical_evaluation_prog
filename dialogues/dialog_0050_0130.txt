DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, um… it’s my family. Lots of… problems. My mother, she had… something with her heart. And my brother, he… well, he had cancer. I don't want the same thing to happen to me, you know? I just want to be sure I’m okay. I'm getting older, and it makes you think.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It's perfectly natural to be mindful of your health, especially with a family history of serious illness. We will certainly address those concerns today. To begin, could you tell me a bit more about your mother's heart condition?
PATIENT: Um… she was always tired. And her legs… they would swell up. The doctor said it was something with… the pump? The heart pump. She had to take pills, lots of them. And then… she just got weaker. It happened maybe… ten years ago? I was still living back home then, taking care of things. It was… not good.
DOCTOR: So, your mother experienced fatigue and swelling in her legs, ultimately leading to a decline in her health approximately ten years ago, and was treated for a cardiac condition. Do you recall the specific name of the condition, if one was ever provided?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Doctors talked a lot of things back then. I was just… worried. They just said her heart was… not strong enough. I don't remember any big words. I was just trying to help. She wasn't very good at remembering things either, so it was hard to follow.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s understandable, medical terminology can be quite complex and stressful to process in a difficult situation. And you mentioned your brother had cancer. What type of cancer did he have, and when was he diagnosed?
PATIENT: He had… lung cancer. He smoked for a long, long time. They found it… maybe five years ago? He went through… treatments. Lots of time in the hospital. It… it didn’t go very well. He passed away about… two years ago. It was fast.
DOCTOR: Lung cancer, diagnosed five years ago, unfortunately with a poor outcome. Two years ago, he passed away. I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Schwer. Given your family history of both cardiac issues and cancer, it’s prudent for us to be thorough in assessing your own health. Let’s start with a review of your own medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions yourself?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had… the flu a few times. And a bad back once. But nothing… serious. I’ve always felt pretty good, you know? I try to eat okay. Mostly. And I walk a bit. Not much these days, the knees aren't what they used to be, but I try. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. Maybe five years? For a checkup.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that's a good starting point. And you mentioned some knee discomfort. Aside from that and the back issue, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms – anything at all that's concerning you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes I get a little… breathless. Just when I walk up hills, or… after I do a lot. It goes away pretty quick. And… well, I’ve been more tired lately, but… I’m older, right? So maybe that's just getting old. Hard to say. Sometimes I just feel… a little off. Not sick, just… not myself.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness with exertion, increased fatigue, and a general feeling of being “not yourself.” We will certainly investigate those symptoms further. Now, to get a clearer picture, let’s do a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… want to know I’m okay. My daughter… she worries a lot too. So if you could just… check everything, that would be good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, have a seat on the examination table. I will begin with listening to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe normally. I'm hearing a slight murmur. It's not particularly loud, but it's present. I will also listen to your lung sounds. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, although your breathing is somewhat shallow. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated. Reflexes are normal. Gait is stable, but slightly slow. Alright, Mr. Schwer. Heart murmur detected, slightly elevated blood pressure, and shallow breathing. Overall, your neurological function appears intact. To get a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend a few blood tests – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. I would also like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… like a lot. But if you think it’s necessary. Blood tests… I don’t like needles. And an X-ray… is that safe? I heard things about… radiation. But if you say it's okay… okay. Just… tell me what everything means later, okay? And if anything is… bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. You are right to ask questions. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health, including your blood cell count, kidney function, and liver function. We’ll only be drawing a small amount of blood, and the discomfort is minimal. As for the chest X-ray, the amount of radiation is very low – significantly less than what you are exposed to naturally from background radiation over several months. It's a valuable tool for evaluating your lungs and heart. We’ll take everything one step at a time. I will explain all the results to you in detail as soon as they are available, and we’ll discuss any necessary next steps. The nurse will draw your blood now. After that, we’ll head over to the X-ray department. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time… yes. That sounds better. Just… tell the nurse I don’t like needles, okay? And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining things. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. I will let the nurse know. We’re here to help. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and then guide you to the X-ray department. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
PATIENT: .
