DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Soodeen. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been going to the bathroom… quite a lot lately. More than usual, I suppose. It’s just… frequent.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these things with me, Ms. MacVittie. Many patients experience changes in their bowel habits. Could you tell me a little more about this frequency?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. It’s not… a sudden change, exactly. It’s been building up for a few weeks, maybe a month? It’s difficult to say precisely. I just… find myself needing to go more often throughout the day. And sometimes… even during the night. It’s… disruptive, certainly. I don’t really keep track of how many times, if that makes sense. It just feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual onset over a month is helpful to know. And you mentioned disruptive – is this impacting your daily activities, Ms. MacVittie?
PATIENT: Yes, it is, actually. I work as a concierge, so I’m on my feet quite a bit. And… well, you have to be available, you know? It makes it… difficult to plan things. I've had to cancel a few appointments, and I worry about being far from a restroom when I’m at work. It's... stressful. I'm divorced, and I don't really have anyone to rely on to cover for me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. MacVittie. That sounds quite challenging, especially with the demands of your job. To help me understand the situation better, can you describe what the bowel movements themselves are like?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Well, they're… normal, I think. Regular in consistency, at least. Not diarrhea, not constipation… just… frequent. Sometimes there's a little discomfort afterwards, a sort of… empty feeling, but it's not painful. I haven’t noticed any blood or anything like that, if that’s what you were going to ask. It's hard to explain… just a lot of going.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, thank you. And no blood is good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently, Ms. MacVittie?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I haven’t made any big changes. I drink a lot of water, always have. I eat… a bit of everything, honestly. I try to be healthy, but I also enjoy the occasional treat. I haven't been eating anything unusual, as far as I can recall. I did have a few extra coffees last week, because of a particularly busy shift, but I've cut back on those now. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Extra coffee could contribute, as caffeine is a stimulant. However, given the gradual onset and persistence of the issue, we should explore other possibilities. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain, bloating, or gas alongside the frequent bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bloating… sometimes, yes. A little bit, especially after I eat. Not severe, just… uncomfortable. And gas, occasionally. I suppose I wouldn't say it's constant, but it's there. As for abdominal pain… not really pain, exactly. Just a sort of… pressure, maybe? A dull ache, occasionally, but it comes and goes. It's not debilitating, if that makes sense. I’ve just been… feeling generally unsettled, I suppose. It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, Ms. MacVittie, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, but that’s about it. I've never been diagnosed with anything serious, if that's what you mean. I had a rather difficult divorce a few years ago, and I've been dealing with the stress of that, but… is that considered a medical condition? I haven't been to a doctor much in the last few years, honestly. Just routine check-ups, mostly.
DOCTOR: No, stress alone isn't a medical condition, but it can certainly contribute to physical symptoms. And routine check-ups are good. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven't had any surgeries, no. I… I really haven't been sick much. I try to stay healthy. I do yoga when I can, and I eat a reasonably balanced diet. I just… this is so frustrating. I feel like I should be able to control this.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating when your body isn’t cooperating. Alright, Ms. MacVittie, and are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather… he had something with his stomach, I think. An ulcer, maybe? I’m not entirely sure. My family isn't very forthcoming with medical details, if that makes sense. It’s not really something we discuss openly. I know my aunt has diabetes, but… that's about all I can remember, honestly. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. MacVittie. Family history can be difficult to track. And it's perfectly fine if you don’t have all the details. One last question for now: do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. I don't have any food allergies either. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. Although… I do get a bit of a headache sometimes after having red wine, but I don’t think that’s an allergy, exactly. Just a sensitivity, perhaps. Is there anything else you need to know? I’m starting to feel a bit silly listing everything I don’t have.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Ms. MacVittie. It’s important to rule things out as well as rule things in. Alright, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing a change in bowel habits, with increased frequency, some bloating, and occasional pressure. Given the gradual onset and lack of alarm symptoms like blood in the stool, a serious underlying condition is less likely, but we still need to investigate. I’d like to do a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a gentle palpation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. A physical exam is fine. I suppose it's better to be thorough. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. I’ve been feeling rather anxious about this, and it’s reassuring to know you’re taking it seriously. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently press on your belly to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your bowel sounds are within normal limits – I’m hearing activity, which is good. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. I’ll start gently, and you can tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’m not feeling any significant tenderness or masses. Your abdomen is soft. It doesn’t seem to be acutely inflamed. Based on the exam, there's no immediate cause for alarm. However, to get a clearer picture, I recommend some basic blood work – a complete blood count to rule out anemia, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your electrolytes and kidney function. I’d also like to collect a stool sample to check for infection or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and a stool sample, alright. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. What’s involved with the stool sample, exactly? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I don’t want to do anything wrong. And will you explain the results to me when they come back? I'm not very good with medical jargon, as I mentioned before. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No questions are silly at all, Ms. MacVittie, and I’m happy to explain everything in plain language. The stool sample is quite simple. I’ll give you a collection container and instructions. You’ll just collect a small amount of stool after your next bowel movement. It’s important not to contaminate the sample with water, so follow the instructions carefully. The lab will analyze it for any signs of infection, inflammation, or blood. As for the results, absolutely. I’ll explain them to you in detail when they come back, and we’ll discuss a plan of action. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated and maintaining a reasonably balanced diet. If your symptoms worsen significantly – for example, if you develop severe abdominal pain, fever, or blood in your stool – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all quite clear, thank you. Staying hydrated, balanced diet… I can manage that. And I’ll be sure to contact the office if anything changes. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about it, if I’m honest. I appreciate your patience and kindness, Doctor. I'll go and collect the sample container and instructions when I'm ready.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The nurse will give you the container and instructions. I look forward to seeing you when your results are back. Have a good day.
