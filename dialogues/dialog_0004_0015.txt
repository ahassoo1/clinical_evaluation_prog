DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… my sinuses, I think. They feel… not good. It’s been a little while now. I… I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Just… a pressure, you know? In my face.
DOCTOR: “A little while” isn’t terribly helpful, Ms. Boham, but we’ll try to pinpoint it. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, I am sorry. It is hard for me to remember things, Doctor. Maybe… after the rainy season? We had a lot of rain. It… it might have been then. I work outside, you see. With the… the drills. Oil work. Maybe the wet and cold?
DOCTOR: Oil work. Right. And this pressure… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days it is worse. And… and when I bend over, it feels… full. Like something is blocking it, you know? Not painful, mostly just… uncomfortable. And sometimes my head hurts a little bit with it. But not always.
DOCTOR: “Fullness” and intermittent headaches… Do you have any nasal discharge?
PATIENT: Um… yes. Sometimes. It’s… clear, I think? Or maybe a little bit yellow sometimes. Not much, though. I wipe my nose and… and that’s it, usually. I don’t… I don't get a lot. Is that… bad? I am sorry, Doctor, I don’t know what is normal.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Boham. We'll figure it out. Clear or yellowish discharge…any fever or chills accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I know of. I… I don’t check my temperature. And no chills. Just… tired sometimes. But I always feel a little bit tired, from the work. It’s hard work, you know? With the drills. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, tiredness you attribute to your occupation… Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes my teeth hurt, on this side… <gestures vaguely to her right cheek> …where my sinus feels bad. But maybe that's just old teeth? I don't go to the dentist very often. It's… expensive. And I don't really… like going. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Tooth pain can be related. And it's pertinent that you do not seek regular dental care. Any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… maybe a little bit? Things don’t smell as strong, I think. But I haven't paid much attention, to be honest. I mostly smell… oil and dirt from the work. It’s hard to tell, you know? Everything smells like that. <shrugs> I don't know if that is normal either.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination, Ms. Boham. I’ll need to listen to your lungs, look in your nose and throat, and palpate your sinuses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you need. I want to feel better. I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded too much, if that's okay? I get a little nervous. But… yes. You can look.
DOCTOR: Understandable. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I’ll listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. <Listens intently with the stethoscope, then repeats a few times> Lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your nose. <Uses a nasal speculum to examine nostrils> Your nasal passages are slightly congested, some clear mucus present. <Palpates Ms. Boham’s sinuses, pressing gently on her forehead and cheeks> Tenderness to palpation over the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. No cervical lymphadenopathy. <Removes the speculum and sits back, typing on the computer again> Okay. Based on the information you've provided and my examination, it appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with sinusitis, likely acute. We will need to rule out other possibilities, though.
PATIENT: Sinusitis… that sounds… bad. What does that mean, exactly? And what about the other… possibilities? I don’t want to need… complicated things, Doctor. I just want it to go away. Is there something I can take? Like a… a pill?
DOCTOR: “Complicated things” is a rather vague concern, Ms. Boham. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses, often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. In your case, it appears to be acute, meaning it came on relatively recently. It's not inherently dangerous, but it can be quite uncomfortable. As for “something you can take,” a pill is possible, but we need to determine the underlying cause. Given the duration of your symptoms and the lack of fever, we can try a conservative approach initially. I’m going to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection. It is also prudent to consider a CT scan of the sinuses to assess for any anatomical abnormalities or complications. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… I don’t think so. I've never really… taken much medication. Just… pain pills sometimes, when my back hurts from work. And those were okay, I think. I don't remember a rash or anything. But I don't know what was in them. Is a CT scan… expensive? I don’t have much money, Doctor. I just… work. That’s all I do.
DOCTOR: A CT scan is rather expensive, Ms. Boham. Unfortunately, without one, it is difficult to definitively determine the cause and severity of your sinusitis. We can proceed without it, but it increases the risk of misdiagnosis and potential complications. As for proceeding without it, I would prescribe a course of antibiotics and recommend saline nasal rinses. However, I strongly advise against self-treating. You must follow the dosage instructions precisely. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve within that timeframe, we will need to consider a CT scan. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I understand. Antibiotics and… and rinsing my nose. One week. No… no CT scan right now. Follow the instructions. I will try. It is… a lot to remember, but I will try very hard. What… what kind of antibiotics? And how do I… rinse my nose? Is there a special way to do it? I don’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: I’m prescribing Amoxicillin, 500mg, three times a day for ten days. The prescription is at the front desk. As for nasal rinses, this care sheet provides detailed instructions. It involves using a saline solution to flush out your nasal passages. It’s best to use distilled or sterilized water, not tap water, to avoid introducing bacteria. <Hands over the papers> It's crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better. This prevents antibiotic resistance. Do you have any questions about the medication or the nasal rinses?
PATIENT: Okay… Amoxicillin. Three times a day. Ten days. I will try to remember. <takes the papers, examining them carefully> Saline… rinsing. Distilled water. No tap water. <nods slowly> I think I understand. <pauses> What if I… forget to take the pill? Or… what if I get confused about the water? Is there someone I can call? I don't have… family nearby. Just my husband, and he works too. He is not very good at… remembering things either.
DOCTOR: The responsibility for medication adherence rests with you, Ms. Boham. If you anticipate difficulty remembering, I recommend setting alarms on your phone or using a pill organizer. The clinic number is on this sheet. You can call during office hours if you have questions about the medication. However, we are not equipped to provide continuous reminders. <pauses> Do you have any other concerns, or shall we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that is all. I will… try my best. Setting alarms. Pill organizer. I will remember the number. Thank you. <stands up slowly> Thank you for… trying to help me. I… I hope it works. <starts to shuffle towards the door> Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Boham. Follow the instructions carefully, and I’ll see you in one week. .
