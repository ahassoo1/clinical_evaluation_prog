DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, well, it’s… it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’, see? Not a pretty sight, I gotta tell ya. Happened a couple times now. Figured I should probably get it checked out, even though I don't usually bother with doctors. They never really do much anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It certainly sounds concerning to experience bleeding, and you are right to seek it checked out. I assure you, we will do our best to determine the cause and get you feeling better. Could you tell me a bit more about this bleeding?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don’t need a lecture about “seeking help.” I’m here, aren’t I? It's… dark, mostly. Like, when I use the bathroom. And there's… well, you know. A bit of blood. Not a waterfall, but enough to make a mess. Happens after… well, after I eat sometimes. Doesn’t happen every time, though. And it's not like, bright red, it’s… darker. Like coffee grounds, almost. Does that make sense? I don’t know what you wanna know, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz, that makes perfect sense. The dark, coffee-ground appearance is quite helpful information, thank you for sharing that. It suggests the blood may have been digested, which can point to a source higher up in the digestive tract. You mentioned it happens after eating, but not every time. Can you recall what you’ve eaten before the episodes?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you want a food diary? Seriously? Look, I eat… food. Normal stuff. Meat, mostly. Rice. Sometimes vegetables, if my daughter makes me. It's not like I’m eatin’ anything weird. I had some lamb the last time it happened, I think. And before that… honestly, I don’t remember. I ate a burger a couple days ago. I just… eat. It’s not like I’m payin' attention to what causes it, I just notice it after it happens. And frankly, it's disgusting. Why does it even matter what I ate? It's my stomach, it should just work, shouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask why it matters, Mr. Gentz. Certain foods can irritate the digestive system and potentially contribute to bleeding, so it’s helpful to consider, though it’s not always the cause. And you’re also right – your stomach should just work. We’re trying to figure out why it isn’t, and gathering information is a key part of that. Let’s put the food aside for a moment, if it’s frustrating. You mentioned it happens after eating sometimes. Roughly how often would you say this has occurred in the past month?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not… constant, that’s for sure. Maybe… three times? Four? In the last month. It was definitely twice in the last couple of weeks. And the last time was… probably Saturday, I think. Yeah, Saturday. I had that lamb, and then… noticed it later. I just… felt weak afterwards, you know? Not like I was gonna faint, but just… tired. I figured it was just the food, honestly. Old meat or somethin’. I don’t usually make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gentz. That’s helpful. The weakness you experienced is also important information. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Look, doc, I’m fifty-one years old. I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises, a broken arm when I was a kid, but nothin’ serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, no… fancy stuff. Widowed, if that counts. My wife… she took care of all that doctor business. I don’t really… go. Like I said, I don't bother with it much. Never saw the point. Just let things… be. Unless they're really bad, and this... this isn't that bad, honestly. A little blood, a little tired. People get worse things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It sounds like you’ve managed well on your own for a long time. While you’ve been fortunate to avoid serious illness, it's still important to investigate anything concerning. And experiencing bleeding, even if it doesn’t feel severe, warrants a closer look. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I eat everything. Used to live off street food back home, you know? Gotta build up a tolerance. Never had a problem with anythin’. No reactions, no hives, nothin'. Just… a strong stomach, I guess. Look, doc, are you gonna poke around in there or what? I’m not a fan of… procedures. Just tell me if I need to worry or not. I got things to do, you know? This is wastin’ my time. And frankly, it’s kinda insulting you’re askin' me about allergies like I'm a child.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive or condescending, Mr. Gentz. It's my duty to gather a complete history to ensure I provide you with the best possible care, and understand your comfort level. We may need to do a physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and potentially a rectal exam, to help determine the source of the bleeding. However, we can discuss it first and proceed at your pace. Before we do that, could you tell me if you take any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: . Look, I'm not stickin' around for a poke and prod. I told you, I don't take nothin'. Never have. I'll just deal with it, like I always do. Don't need a fancy doctor tellin' me what to do. You're wastin' my time. I'm leavin'. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, please, allow me to provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist who can further evaluate your condition. It is important to determine the cause of the bleeding, and self-treating could potentially be harmful. I understand your reluctance, but your health is my primary concern. Here is the referral information and contact number. Please consider scheduling an appointment. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as significant bleeding, weakness, or dizziness – please seek immediate medical attention at the nearest emergency room. .
