DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin' the fella down at the… the beauty place wants. Says he needs a doctor to say it's okay. A cosmetic… procedure, that's what he called it. Don’t ask me what it is, I just wanna get it done and be on my way.
DOCTOR: A “permission slip,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That's what he called it. Look, I ain't a medical man, alright? I fix towers. Radio stuff. Cell phone things. He said somethin' about… checkin' my health 'fore he does… well, before he does the thing. It’s a waste of my time, honestly. Just tell him yes and let me go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I can’t simply tell someone it’s “okay” to undergo a procedure without knowing what that procedure is, or why you need it. And it's certainly not a waste of your time to ensure your health is considered. It’s my professional responsibility – and frankly, it’s your health we’re talking about. Now, can you tell me what this "thing" is?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't know! The fella… he's got a fancy place. All mirrors and smells nice. He said it’ll… tighten things up. Make me look younger. That's all I know! I just figured a doctor's note was all he needed. You askin' a lot of questions. Is this gonna take long? I got appointments. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: "Tighten things up"...right. Well, that's… not particularly helpful, Mr. Honcoop. And frankly, it sounds like you're considering a cosmetic procedure without fully understanding what it entails. You see, "tightening things up" could be anything from a facial massage to… well, something far more invasive. Do you know the name of the business?
PATIENT: Business? Hmm… let me think. It was… somethin' fancy. Real… European-soundin'. Ugh, this is botherin' me now. I don't recall the name. It was on… Elm Street, I think. Near the bakery. They had a big sign… gold lettering, maybe? Honestly, Doctor, I just saw the ad, went in, and he started talkin' about liftin' and tuckin' and all sorts of things. I just wanted a quick fix, not a… a quiz!
DOCTOR: Let me see… Elm Street, European-sounding name… Ah. “Belleza Esthetics.” Right?
PATIENT: Belleza… yeah, that sounds right! Belleza Esthetics. That's the place. See? I told you I remembered. Now, can we just get this over with? I really don't have time for this. I got a tower in West Oakland that’s givin’ me trouble. Important work, Doctor. Not… face liftin'.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, according to my records, you haven’t had a physical exam in over ten years. And your weight is… significantly below what it should be for your height. Have you been feeling unwell?
PATIENT: Unwell? No! I feel fine. Always been a small fella. Always been quick on my feet. Used to play basketball, you know. Before… well, before things got complicated. Look, Doctor, I don't need a lecture on my health. I need a piece of paper, and I need it now. This ain't about basketball or weighin’ nothin’. It’s about lookin' presentable. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I cannot in good conscience sign off on a cosmetic procedure without a proper assessment. “Looking presentable” doesn’t override basic medical safety. I need to know your medical history, what medications you’re taking, and what you’re hoping to achieve with this procedure. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I used to get itchy around cats, but I haven't seen a cat in years. Besides that… no, not really. I eat whatever's in front of me. I don’t fuss with fancy food. Now, look, are we doin' this or what? I got places to be. Important places! This whole thing is a waste of my time and money. I'm payin’ for this, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I see here you have no primary care physician listed. And you haven't had a tetanus booster in over a decade. Cosmetic procedures, even minor ones, carry risks of infection. I strongly recommend we start with a complete physical exam and blood work to ensure you’re healthy enough to proceed. This isn’t about fussing, it’s about responsible care. Now, do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications? No! Never been one for pills. Always been a healthy fella. I take… sometimes I take somethin’ for my back. When it’s achin’. But it’s just… somethin’ the fella at the hardware store recommended. Doesn't have a fancy name or nothin’. It’s just… a rub. Like liniment. Is that what you mean? This is gettin’ ridiculous, Doctor. I swear, I’m wastin’ a perfectly good afternoon. .
DOCTOR: “Something the fella at the hardware store recommended”?
