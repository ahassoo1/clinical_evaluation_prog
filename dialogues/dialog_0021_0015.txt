DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Mikeisha. I’m Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Havird. It is nice to meet you. Um… my nose. It feels… not good. Like, stuffy. For a little while now, I think. It's hard to say exactly how long. It just… is.
DOCTOR: “Not good,” alright. And you said “a little while now”?
PATIENT: Yes. Not long, long time. Maybe… a month? Or more? Everything feels… fuzzy. I work a lot, you see. With the drills. Oil work. It keeps my mind busy. It's hard to remember things that aren't work, sometimes. It’s just… pressure, mostly. And a little bit of pain, now and then.
DOCTOR: Oil work, hmm. That can be demanding. Pressure, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like… behind my eyes, and in my cheeks. Not a bad pain, usually. Just… there. It gets worse when I bend over, I think. And… I sometimes feel a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… whooshy. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: “Whooshy,” alright. And the dizziness… does anything specific seem to trigger it, besides bending over?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don't think. Sometimes when I stand up too fast, maybe? But it doesn't happen every time. It’s… difficult to say. I've been trying to drink more water, my husband says that helps, but it hasn’t really made a big difference. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in… my eyes? Let me think… Not that I’ve noticed. I wear glasses, you see. For a long time now. Everything looks… blurry without them. But it's always been that way. I don’t think it’s worse, if that makes sense. I go to the eye doctor when I need new ones. But I haven’t been in a while, I guess. Maybe a year? Or two?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any fever, chills, or cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And no cough. Just… this nose. And the pressure. It's not like a cold, I don’t think. It doesn't feel like I'm getting sick, if that makes sense? Just… uncomfortable. It’s been going on so long, I just wanted to… see what you thought. My husband said I should come.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, let's have a look at your nose and sinuses. Do you mind if I do a quick examination?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Please do. I trust your judgment. I hope it’s nothing serious. It just… makes it hard to concentrate at work sometimes. And my husband… well, he worries.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up here for me. I’m going to listen to your sinuses, then take a look inside your nose. It might be a little uncomfortable, just a quick peek. Okay, I’m listening to your sinuses now… and percussion. Hmm. A little tenderness on the frontal sinuses. And… Okay, a bit of swelling in the nasal passages, but no obvious signs of infection. Your nasal mucosa is a little inflamed. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh dear. I… I don't think so. I mean, I haven't ever been told I have allergies. We live in the country, you see, and I’ve never had any… terrible reactions to anything. I like flowers, my husband grows them. But… I don't know. I’ve never really paid attention. Could this be allergies? It doesn't feel like sneezing or itching, though. It just… hurts.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It could be allergies, even without the typical sneezing. Sometimes they present differently. But we can't rule other things out. Have you had any recent head injuries or changes in your facial structure?
PATIENT: Head injuries…? Oh goodness, no. Not that I recall. I work with the drills, but we have very good safety training. And… no changes to my face. I mean, I've gotten older, of course. But nothing… different. My husband would notice, he tells me when I need a haircut! He’s very observant, that man. Is that a bad sign, Doctor? That I can’t remember things?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a bad sign, Mikeisha. It’s common to have difficulty recalling minor details, especially with a demanding job. But let’s focus on the nose. Do you happen to know if anyone in your family has a history of sinus problems or nasal polyps?
PATIENT: Sinus problems…? I… I don't know. My family is… far away. In El Salvador. We don't talk very often. It's expensive, you see. And I haven't seen them in many years. I don't know about their health. My husband's family, they're all very healthy. Or they seem to be. He’s very good at remembering things like that. He says his mother had… something with her ears, maybe? But not her nose. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. It’s just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your symptoms, the lack of fever, and the fact that it's been going on for a while… it's likely a case of chronic sinusitis. It could be related to inflammation or even a mild infection. I recommend a trial of a nasal saline rinse twice daily and an over-the-counter decongestant. If that doesn't provide relief within two weeks, we'll need to consider other options, like a CT scan to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Nasal… what did you call it? Rinse? And… a pill? I… I can try that. Twice a day… I can do that. I'm not good with remembering to take pills, but I can put a note on the refrigerator. My husband can help. A scan…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it a bad sign if I have to have a scan? I hope it won't be too expensive. We don't have… insurance, you see. Is the pill expensive?
DOCTOR: A nasal saline rinse is just saltwater, Mikeisha. It helps to clear out your nasal passages. And the decongestant, it's just to reduce the swelling. A CT scan isn’t necessarily serious, it’s just a way to get a better look inside. We wouldn’t do it unless absolutely necessary. As for cost, let’s cross that bridge when we come to it. We can discuss options for affordable imaging if it becomes needed. The decongestant is relatively inexpensive, a few dollars. I’ll write you a prescription just in case, but you can also find over-the-counter options. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Saltwater… okay. That sounds… better. And a few dollars… yes, that I can manage. My husband will be relieved to hear it's not too serious. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I will try the saltwater and… the pill, if it doesn't get better. And I'll put a note on the refrigerator. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or avoiding?
DOCTOR: Avoid exposure to irritants like smoke or strong chemicals if possible. And stay well-hydrated. If you develop a fever, severe headache, or facial pain, see me immediately. Otherwise, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're doing. Here’s the prescription, and a handout on nasal saline rinses. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Havird. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. It’s… it’s hard to remember things, sometimes. But I will try my best to follow your instructions. And thank you for not… thinking I was silly. I think… I think that’s all. I will see you in two weeks. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. Don’t worry about remembering everything. Just do your best. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and I'll see you in two weeks.
