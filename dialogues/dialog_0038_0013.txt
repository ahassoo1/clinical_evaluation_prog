DOCTOR: Good morning, Dondre. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I just… can’t get it all out when I need to go. It's been happening for a little while now, maybe a couple weeks. Not every time, but often enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with emptying your bladder completely, happening on and off for a couple of weeks now. That is something we should look into. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Not every time, like I said. Some days it's fine, completely normal. But other days… I have to strain, and even then, it feels like there’s still some left in there. It’s uncomfortable, you know? And I have to go back again pretty soon after. It's not painful, not really, just… frustrating and a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, frustrating and worrying – I get that. No pain, which is good. So, it's intermittent – some days normal, some days incomplete emptying, straining, and needing to go back relatively soon. When you say “soon,” about how long after emptying do you find you need to go again?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It could be… an hour, maybe two hours. Sometimes a little longer, but not much. Usually not more than three. And it’s not like a strong urge right away, more like… a feeling I still haven't gotten everything out, you know? I try to wait, but then I worry if I should go again. It's a bit of a cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so within a few hours you're feeling like you haven't fully emptied, and that's prompting you to go back. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream itself – is it weaker than usual, or does it start and stop?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I hadn't really paid attention to that, to be honest. I guess… maybe a little weaker. Not a big change, but… I do have to push a little more than I used to to get it going. It doesn’t really start and stop, no. Just… takes a little effort. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's important information, thank you for telling me. A weaker stream and needing to push to start can give us clues. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no, no pain in my belly. Just the… the feeling of not being empty, and having to push a little when I go. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a bladder infection or anything. Just… uncomfortable. I had a bit of a cough a few weeks back, but that's gone now. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Dondre. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with pills. I stopped taking those pills maybe… five years ago now. Other than that… not really. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. My wife, God rest her soul, she was the one with the problems, not me. I do get Medicare now, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so controlled high blood pressure in the past, now off medication. That's good to know. And you're currently covered by Medicare. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a few days once when I broke my arm falling off a ladder, helping with the roof. Other than that… no. No other surgeries, no other hospital stays. It's been a pretty simple life, all in all.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a hospital stay for a broken arm. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like prostate problems, kidney disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My father… he had some trouble with his heart, I think. But he didn't go to the doctor much. My mother, she was healthy as a horse. My wife's side of the family… I don’t know them well enough to say. She didn't talk much about her family, if I'm honest. I don't recall anyone specifically having problems with their… water, like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart problems in your father, but not much known beyond that. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Not even a puff. My wife… she tried it once when she was young, but didn't like it. I always said it was a waste of money, and bad for your health. I drink a little sometimes, a beer with dinner maybe, but not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking history, and minimal alcohol use. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I can take most pills without any trouble. My wife… she was allergic to bee stings, but I'm not. I don’t think I've ever had a reaction to anything. Is that all the questions, Doctor? It feels like a lot of questions!
DOCTOR: That is a lot of questions, you're right. Thank you for being so patient and thorough. Okay, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. It will just involve checking your abdomen and a brief neurological exam. We will also check your prostate. Is that okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Yes, I suppose so. Checking my… prostate? Is that really necessary? I… I’ve never had that done before. It just sounds… a little uncomfortable. What are you looking for exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dondre. It is a sensitive exam, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. Checking your prostate is important in your case, given your symptoms. It allows me to feel for any enlargement or irregularities that could be contributing to the difficulty with emptying your bladder. It is a standard part of evaluating these types of concerns, and it helps rule out other potential causes. We can take it very slowly and stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail before we proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it to me. I… I’d feel better knowing what to expect. I just don’t like surprises, you know? And… how long will it take? And will it hurt? My wife always did these things for me… I never had to ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about this. The exam involves a brief digital rectal exam. You'll lie on your side, and I will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This allows me to feel the size and shape of your prostate. It shouldn’t be painful, though you may feel some pressure or a brief urge to urinate. It typically takes just a few seconds – maybe 10-15 seconds at most. I will explain everything as I go, and we can stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. It's important to remember this is a quick assessment to gather information, and it's a valuable step in understanding what's going on. We can also discuss any concerns you have after the exam, and decide on further steps. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Ten to fifteen seconds… okay. And you’ll explain everything as you go… and I can stop you if it hurts? Yes, that… that does sound a little better. It's just… embarrassing, you know? But I suppose if it's important… all right. Let's… let's get it over with. But please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll take it at your pace. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. We can start whenever you’re ready. Just let me know if you're uncomfortable at any point, and we'll stop immediately. We’re just going to take a quick look, and then we’ll talk about what we find. Remember, I'm here to help you, and we’ll work through this together.
