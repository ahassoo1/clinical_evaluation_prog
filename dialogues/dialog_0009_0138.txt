DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Petrimoulx, is it? Yes, lovely to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… Well, it's a bit hard to explain, honestly. It’s mostly… a worry, I suppose. My daughter, bless her heart, she was the one who made the appointment. She's concerned about some things that happened with my husband, and… well, it made her think of me, too. It’s about weakness, sometimes, on one side, and terrible headaches… runs in the family, you see. Though, I can't quite put my finger on when exactly it started happening to me… or how often. It’s just… been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Alayne. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you, and it’s perfectly alright that it’s hard to explain. It sounds like you’re experiencing some weakness, potentially on one side, and headaches, and there’s a family history we should explore. Let's try to piece things together. When you say weakness, can you describe where on your body you feel it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my daughter is a good girl. Very attentive. Weakness… let me think. It’s usually… on my right side, I believe. My right arm and leg feel… heavy, sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It comes and goes. And it's not like I can’t use them, it’s just… harder. Like trying to lift something really heavy, even when it isn’t. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Alayne. It’s helpful to know it's on your right side and that it feels like increased effort, even when the weight isn’t significant. And the fact that it comes and goes is important. Now, you mentioned headaches. Can you tell me more about those?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… they’re awful, when they come. They’re… throbbing, mostly, on the side of my head. Sometimes it's one side, sometimes the other, but usually the right. And they can last for hours, sometimes a whole day. Bright lights bother me when I have one, and I just want to lie down in a dark room. My mother used to get them too, terrible ones. She called them migraines, but I don’t really know… I just know they hurt! It's been a long time since I had a really bad one, though. A few months, maybe? It’s all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alayne. That’s very helpful. Throbbing headaches, sometimes one-sided, sensitivity to light, and a family history of migraines… those are all important pieces of the puzzle. And you’re right to mention the “fuzzy” part – it’s perfectly normal for recall to be less clear over time. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my medical history… well, I’ve lived a long life, you know? I don’t go to the doctor much, unless I absolutely have to. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years? And I had a bad bout of pneumonia once, but that was a long time ago too. Mostly, I’ve been pretty healthy, I think. I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small pill, but that’s about it. My husband, bless his heart, he had some heart trouble, but he’s been gone five years now… I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alayne. That gives me a good starting point. Gallbladder removal and a history of pneumonia, and you currently take medication for blood pressure. Do you recall the name of that medication, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… the name… now that’s a tricky one. I have a little bottle at home, a white one, I think. I just take one every morning. My daughter usually refills it for me. I think it starts with an “A”? Am-… Am-lod-… something. Amlodipine? Is that right? It sounds right, but I’m not very good with names, you see.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is correct, Alayne! That's very good, actually. And don't worry about remembering names, that's perfectly understandable. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think I have any serious allergies. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that's just a mild irritation. And I used to get a rash from poison ivy when I was a little girl, but I haven’t seen any of that in years. Nothing that requires a special shot or anything, if that’s what you mean. Mostly, I just try to avoid things that might bother me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alayne. So, mild itchiness with cats and a childhood history of poison ivy, but no significant, life-threatening allergies. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my social history… well, what does that mean exactly? I’ve been married for… oh, goodness, sixty years! My husband, bless his heart, we didn’t have any children. We mostly kept to ourselves, you see. We used to go dancing sometimes, when we were younger, and we loved to cook. I still live in the same house we bought when we were first married. I don’t really go out much anymore, just to the grocery store and church, mostly. I used to be very active in the church, but it’s harder to get around these days. And I don't smoke, never have, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alayne. That gives me a lovely picture. Sixty years of marriage, a quiet life with your husband, involvement in the church, and no smoking or excessive drinking. Now, one last question before we do a quick exam. Has anything changed in your life recently that might be contributing to these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… recently? Hmm. Well, my daughter has been worrying about me more, I suppose. She keeps asking if I’m alright, and if I need anything. That's nice, of course, but it makes me feel a little… anxious, sometimes. And I did fall a few months ago, in the garden. It wasn’t a bad fall, just a little bruise, but it did scare me. Other than that… not really. Everything’s been pretty much the same. Just getting older, I suppose. It's hard to keep track of everything these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alayne. Your daughter's concern and the recent fall are both good things to know. Okay, with your permission, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. I will be very gentle. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your anxiety and recent concerns. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, with good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological assessment. This just involves checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll test the strength in your arms and legs. Can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can wiggle my toes. It's a little hard to get them going sometimes, you see. But yes, I can do it. And yes, I understand about the reflexes and strength. I'll try my best to follow your finger, Doctor. My eyes aren't what they used to be either, so please be patient with me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alayne. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn't uncommon at your age. Your strength is slightly reduced on your right side, as you described, but it’s not significantly weak. Coordination is good overall. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The headaches, weakness on one side, and family history raise some concern for a possible transient ischemic attack, or TIA – sometimes called a mini-stroke. While it could be something else, we need to rule this out. I also want to investigate the possibility of migraine headaches. To do that, I’d like to order a few tests. I’d like to get a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a CT scan of your brain to rule out any stroke or other abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a CT scan? That sounds… serious. A stroke? I’m not sure I understand… Is that what you think is happening? I never thought… I suppose if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, I'll do whatever tests you think are best. I just… I don't want anything serious. My daughter would be so worried.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel worried, Alayne, and I appreciate you sharing those feelings. A CT scan will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of action. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have a stroke, but it's important to rule one out given your symptoms and family history. We're being proactive here, and gathering information to ensure your health and well-being. The tests will help us identify the cause of your headaches and weakness. I'll order the tests now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. The CT scan can be scheduled for later today or tomorrow, whichever is more convenient for you. Do you have any questions about the tests or the process?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it's best. Later today would be fine, I suppose. The sooner it's done, the better. Just… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I don't like being in hospitals… or doctors’ offices, if I’m being honest. It reminds me of my husband, bless his heart… he wasn’t very well towards the end.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Alayne, and I’ll do everything I can to make the process as comfortable as possible. The CT scan is painless. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It's a bit noisy, but it doesn't hurt. The whole process usually takes about 15-20 minutes. We’ll have a technician assist you and explain everything step-by-step. You won’t be alone, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, and I understand how these places can bring back difficult memories. We’ll be as gentle and supportive as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to write up a brief note for your primary care physician, summarizing our conversation and the tests I’m ordering. I’ll also give you some instructions about what to do if your symptoms worsen before your CT scan. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That sounds… better, knowing it doesn’t hurt. And thank you for being so understanding, Doctor. It's just… a lot to take in. Yes, a note to my doctor would be good. And instructions… yes, please. I don't want to end up in the hospital, if I can avoid it. My daughter would worry herself sick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. We’ll take things one step at a time. Here’s the note for your doctor, and this sheet outlines the warning signs to watch out for. If you experience any sudden severe headache, weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results of the CT scan once they’re available. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening, and for being so kind. I appreciate it more than you know. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse now, then. And try not to worry too much. Though, that's easier said than done, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alayne. It was my pleasure. Remember, I'm here to support you, and we'll get through this together. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions before your appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Try to relax, and take deep breaths. I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
