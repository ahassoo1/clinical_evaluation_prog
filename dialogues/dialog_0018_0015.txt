DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my… sinuses? They are… bothering me. It’s been… a little while, I think. Not so bad I had to come right away, but… it doesn't go away.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sinus issues can certainly be persistent and bothersome. “A little while” is a bit vague, Ms. Boham, and that’s alright. Could you try to recall approximately how long you’ve been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. Maybe… two months? Or three? It is hard to say. Things are… busy. Work is busy. It feels like a long time, but… not very long. Sorry. I don't remember dates very well.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. It’s common to lose track, especially with a busy schedule. Two to three months is helpful information. And don’t apologize – your comfort and describing your experience are what's important. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the symptoms themselves?
PATIENT: Um… it feels… full? Like… pressure. Behind my eyes, and… in my cheeks. Sometimes… a little headache. Not a bad headache, just… there. And… I think… maybe my nose is stuffy? It is hard to breathe sometimes, but not always. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Boham. Pressure behind the eyes and in the cheeks, a mild headache, and nasal congestion – that all aligns with sinus issues. Is the congestion on both sides of your nose, or is it worse on one side?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… both sides? Maybe a little more on this side. But not much more. It feels… even, mostly. Sometimes it switches though. It is… confusing. I don't pay close attention, I guess. I just… feel bad.
DOCTOR: That’s quite common – it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what’s going on when you’re just trying to feel better. So, congestion that fluctuates between both nostrils, primarily pressure and a mild headache. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Let me see… No… not really. No fever, I don't think. No bad cough. No sore throat. Just… tired. But I am always tired. From work. I don't know if that counts. No… I don't think so. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, cough, or sore throat, just general fatigue. And you mentioned the fatigue is likely related to work, which is understandable. Now, have you tried anything to alleviate these symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes I take… those pills? For… allergies? My husband buys them. They help a little, maybe. But not much. And… I try to drink water. A lot of water. That’s what my mama always says. But it doesn't really help either, not for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve tried over-the-counter allergy medication and increased water intake. Do you recall the name of the allergy medication your husband purchases?
PATIENT: Oh… that is hard. It is… a blue box? And… there are little… pills? I am sorry. I don’t remember the name. My husband does the shopping. He knows what to buy. I just… take them. I'm very bad with names.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. It’s common to not remember medication names. A blue box with little pills is helpful information; we can often identify it from that description. Now, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No… not that I know of. I have never been… sick, really. Just… tired. I work very hard. My husband says I need to rest more. He worries. I don't go to the doctor often. Only when something… really bothers me. I don't think I have… anything bad. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known chronic medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. And no… hospital. Not ever. I had… a baby, of course. But that was… a long time ago. And it was… okay. Everything was okay. But not a hospital stay, not for anything else. Just the baby.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations aside from childbirth. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat everything. My mama made me try everything when I was little. And… I don't have… flowers, or anything? I don’t know. I haven't ever… reacted to anything. Not that I remember. No allergies, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the allergy pills you mentioned?
PATIENT: No. Just… those pills when my sinuses bother me. And sometimes… a little something for my head, if it hurts very bad. But not often. It is… a white pill. Small. But I don't take it very often. My husband says it is not good for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so allergy medication as needed and a small white pill for headaches occasionally. Do you recall the name of the white headache pill?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I really don’t know. It comes in a… little bottle? It is… round? And white. My husband buys it at the… the store. The one near the… the park? I am sorry, Doctor. I am very bad with names. I just… take the pill when my head hurts. I don’t remember what it is called.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. It’s understandable to not remember medication names, and it’s helpful that you can describe the packaging. We can often identify it from that description. Now, before we proceed, may I ask about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Um… my mama… she was healthy. Very strong. She lived a long time. My papa… he worked hard. He had… a little cough, sometimes. But he was okay too. And… my brother… he has… a little bit of everything, I think. But nothing serious. Not that I know of. We don’t… talk about those things much. It is not something we do.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Oh, no. Never. I don't smoke. I don't drink. And… no. Definitely not. I work very hard. I don't have time for those things. It is not good for you, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear. Now, Ms. Boham, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Boham. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to check your ears and throat. Your ears look normal, and your throat is a little red, but there’s no sign of infection. Finally, I’m going to gently palpate your sinuses to check for tenderness. I do detect some tenderness over your frontal and maxillary sinuses. Your nasal passages are slightly congested as well.
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That is… sore. It is… a little sore, sometimes. But not… bad. It feels… full. Like… pressure. Like you said. Is it… bad? Am I very sick?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Boham, you are not very sick. Based on your symptoms and the physical examination, it appears you are experiencing sinusitis, likely a viral infection. The tenderness in your sinuses and congestion support that diagnosis. It is not uncommon, especially given the time of year. The mild redness in your throat could be a result of postnasal drip from the sinus inflammation. Now, while a viral infection typically resolves on its own, we can take steps to alleviate your symptoms and prevent complications. I recommend over-the-counter decongestants, saline nasal rinses, and plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the discomfort as well. Would you like me to recommend a specific decongestant or saline rinse?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. I don't know… which ones are good. I just… get confused. And… what is… saline rinse? Is that… something I drink?
DOCTOR: Certainly. A saline rinse is a solution of saltwater that you use to flush out your nasal passages. It helps to clear congestion and relieve inflammation. It’s not something you drink; you use a neti pot or a squeeze bottle to irrigate your nose. You can find both at most pharmacies. I recommend a pre-mixed saline rinse packet to make it easier. As for decongestants, I recommend pseudoephedrine, but you'll need to ask the pharmacist for it as it's kept behind the counter. It's very effective at relieving nasal congestion. Just be aware that it can raise your blood pressure, so if you have any heart conditions, we’ll need to discuss other options. Do you have any questions about these recommendations so far?
PATIENT: Pseudo… what? And… irrigate? That sounds… complicated. I don't think I can… remember all of that. And… what if I get water in my ears? Maybe… it is better just to… wait and see? If it doesn’t get worse? I am very bad at remembering things. And… I don't want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Boham. It can be overwhelming to remember everything, and it's perfectly alright to be cautious. Pseudoephedrine is just the name of a common decongestant – don't worry about memorizing it. You can simply ask the pharmacist for a decongestant for nasal congestion, and they can guide you. As for the saline rinse, it's not as complicated as it sounds. There are many helpful videos online demonstrating how to use a neti pot or squeeze bottle. And to avoid getting water in your ears, it’s important to tilt your head to the side and breathe through your mouth during the rinse. However, if you’re uncomfortable with these options, we can start with just over-the-counter pain relievers and increased fluids, and see if your symptoms improve on their own. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in your treatment plan. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can explore other options. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… better. Just the… pain relievers and… drink more water. And… if it gets worse, I will come back. That I can remember. Thank you, Doctor. You are… very kind. And… patient. I think… that is all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. I’m glad we could find a plan that works for you. Remember to rest and take it easy. I’ll document our discussion in your chart and provide you with a summary of our recommendations. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… everything. Thank you again for your help. I will… see you if it doesn't get better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get well soon, and have a good day.
