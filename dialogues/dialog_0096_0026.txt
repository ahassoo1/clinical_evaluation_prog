DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker, welcome. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, well. It’s… tiredness, mostly. A dreadful tiredness. Comes and goes, you see. Not like being a bit sleepy. It just… takes it out of you. I don't rightly recall when it started, to be honest. My husband, he keeps saying it’s been a while, but he exaggerates everything.
DOCTOR: Hm. Tiredness, you say. And it’s not just a simple sleepiness, it’s… draining. Right. And you said you’re not sure when it began?
PATIENT: No, not a simple sleepiness. It’s… like all the strength just… leaves me. And no, I really don’t recall exactly when. Probably after we… well, after we moved this last time. Though, honestly, all these places blur together after a while, don’t they? He likes to move. Always has. Says it keeps him young.
DOCTOR: Right. Moving can certainly be disruptive. And it’s good to know your husband is… active. Now, can you describe this tiredness a bit more?
PATIENT: Disruptive is a kind word for it, I assure you. It's chaos, mostly. As for the tiredness… it's not just feeling sleepy, like I said. It's… my arms feel heavy. My legs feel weak. I get winded just… walking to the kitchen. Things that I used to do without a thought. It's… frustrating. And embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy limbs, getting winded easily… and it’s impacting your daily activities. That is concerning. Now, has this tiredness been constant, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Definitely. Some days I feel… well, not good, mind you, but I can manage. Other days… I just have to lie down. And it’s not like a regular nap, either. I'm just… wiped out. It could be a day, it could be two. Hard to say. My husband says it's just "old age", but he wouldn't know a good day from a bad one.
DOCTOR: Right. It fluctuates. And I understand your husband isn’t the most…observant. We'll figure out what's going on, Mrs. Oitker. Now, besides the tiredness and weakness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Well, my muscles ache, sometimes. Not all the time, but when I’ve been… attempting to do something. Like gardening, before this tiredness got so bad. And I've been a bit clumsy lately, dropping things. Though, that could just be my hands. They're not what they used to be. Always were a bit shaky, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches and some clumsiness… alright. Has anything in particular made these symptoms worse?
PATIENT: Oh, anything strenuous, definitely. Lifting things, even just a heavy bag of groceries. And being on my feet for too long. Though, these days, anything seems to make it worse. I used to be able to work all day, diving, and not think twice about it. Now… well, now I barely have the energy to make a cup of tea. It’s quite humiliating, really.
DOCTOR: I see. A significant change from your previous activity level. Now, have you experienced any fever, weight loss, changes in your appetite, or any other symptoms alongside this tiredness and weakness?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I recall. I don't think so. Appetite… it comes and goes, like everything else. Sometimes I’m ravenous, sometimes I haven't much interest in food. Weight loss… well, I haven’t been weighing myself. My husband does the shopping, so I couldn’t say. He gets whatever he thinks is sensible. Probably lost a bit, now that I think about it. Not much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a bit of a jumble, honestly. I’ve had… aches and pains, naturally, at my age. Arthritis, I think they said, years ago. And a bit of trouble with my heart, a long time back. Nothing serious, they said. Just… a flutter now and then. And I've had all my shots, of course. My husband makes sure of that.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, some history of heart flutter… and up-to-date vaccinations. Do you know what type of arthritis you were diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I just remember the doctor saying something about “wear and tear.” It's in my hands mostly, and my knees. They gave me some pills, a long time ago. Didn't seem to do much, so I stopped taking them. My husband said they weren't necessary. He likes natural remedies, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And this history of heart flutter... did you ever have any tests done for that?
PATIENT: Oh, they hooked me up to a machine, years and years ago. Lots of stickers and wires. Said it was just a bit irregular. Nothing to worry about, they said. They told me to cut back on caffeine, which I did. Though, my husband still brings me tea. Earl Grey, strong. He wouldn't hear of me giving it up.
DOCTOR: Right. Irregular heartbeat, advised to reduce caffeine. Now, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days after… well, after I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs, clumsy as I always was. Nothing major, really. Both a long time ago. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired, like me. And my father had trouble with his joints, like arthritis. But it was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much. They were… practical people. Didn't dwell on illness.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband gives me whatever he thinks is best. Though, I did have a bit of a rash once, after using a new soap. But it went away on its own. He said it was just my sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… my husband gives me a vitamin pill every morning. Something with… B vitamins, I think. And sometimes he gives me a herbal tea, for my nerves. Said it helps me relax. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. He handles all the medications.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, Mrs. Oitker. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. Just… try not to poke around too much. My joints aren’t what they used to be, you see. And please be gentle with my arms. They're rather weak these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker. I've completed the exam. As I suspected, your muscle strength and range of motion are reduced, and your heart rhythm is a little irregular. I'm going to order some blood work to check for anemia, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies, and I’d also like to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm more thoroughly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Blood work and… an EKG? Is it serious? I just want to feel like myself again. And please, don't tell my husband too much. He'll fuss over me endlessly if he thinks it's something serious. He means well, but… it's exhausting.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Mrs. Oitker. These tests will just help us figure out what's causing your tiredness and weakness. It's a process of elimination. As for your husband, I understand. I will be mindful of sharing only what's necessary. We'll start with the blood work and EKG. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and set up the EKG appointment for you. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I suppose. Just… will it hurt? The blood work, and that… EKG thing? And how long will it take to get the results? I'd like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. This tiredness is… draining, as I've said. It's hard to enjoy anything when you feel like this.
DOCTOR: The blood work is just a quick prick of the needle, Mrs. Oitker. It shouldn't hurt much at all. The EKG is completely painless. They’ll just place some stickers on your chest to record your heart’s activity. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for the lab to process everything. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and don’t overexert yourself. We’ll figure this out, together. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Just… please be gentle with my arms when you draw the blood. And thank you… for listening. It's nice to finally feel like someone is taking me seriously. My husband… well, he just says it's old age.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Oitker. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns at any time. We'll take good care of you. .
