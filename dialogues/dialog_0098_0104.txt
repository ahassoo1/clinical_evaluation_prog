DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have much time for this. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore throat. I understand you’re pressed for time, and I'll do my best to be efficient. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? It hurts when I swallow. And talk. Which is why I’m… not thrilled to be here, truthfully. It’s just a sore throat, Doctor. People get them. I don’t need a whole investigation. Is there a quick fix for this?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. You’re right, many sore throats are minor. But just to be sure, I like to ask a few questions to rule out anything more serious. When did it start hurting, roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. A few days ago, like I said. Maybe… Tuesday? Or was it Wednesday? It all blends together, you know? I just want it gone. I have things to do. Important things. Not time to sit around recalling dates.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, a general timeframe is helpful. And I appreciate you coming in despite being busy. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I feel… tired, probably. Everyone's tired these days. And maybe a little… achy. But that's probably just from work. Long hours, you know? It’s just a sore throat, Doctor. Are we getting anywhere with this or not?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some aches. And no fever, chills, cough, runny nose, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No cough. Definitely no runny nose. Look, I don't get sick often. I work hard, I keep myself to myself. It's probably just… something I caught at work. The air isn't always clean, you know? Can we just get a prescription or something? I really need to be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just take a quick look at your throat, and I’ll feel your lymph nodes, just to be thorough. It will only take a moment. Could you open your mouth wide for me, please?
PATIENT: Must you? It's… unpleasant. Honestly, I don't see the point. It's just a sore throat. But fine. Get it over with quickly, please. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay… Your throat is a little red, and I do feel some mild swelling in your lymph nodes. Not significantly enlarged, but present. It doesn't appear to be anything alarming, but with the swelling, I’d like to rule out strep throat just to be safe. Would you mind if we do a quick strep test?
PATIENT: Strep? Honestly. I told you, it’s just a sore throat. A quick test? What does that even involve? And how long will that take? I really don’t have time for this… I suppose if it’s quick… but I’m warning you, if it delays me, I’m not happy. Just get it done. And be careful with those things, alright? I don’t like things poked at.
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick swab, Tammie, just inside your mouth. Shouldn’t take more than a few seconds. And it’s a standard procedure, very safe. I’ll let you know the results as soon as they're available. It usually takes about 5-10 minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to step out to check on a few things, but the nurse will be right back in to monitor you.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. The faster this is over, the better. Don't bother explaining anything to me. I'm sure I wouldn't understand it anyway. Just do it, and let me know the result. And try not to take too long. I have things to do. .
