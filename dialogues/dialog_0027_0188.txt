DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Criston. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It's... my pee. It's orange. I don't know why. It started maybe two days ago. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That can be concerning, though often it's something simple. Two days ago you said?
PATIENT: Yes, two days. Maybe a little more. I drink a lot of water, usually. But it's still orange. Not dark orange, but… you know, orange. Like… juice, a little. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. Juice-colored, okay. And you said you generally drink a good amount of water. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. It feels normal, when I go to the bathroom. Just… the color is different. My wife, she says maybe I need to see a doctor. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: It's good she's looking out for you. No pain is good. Have you noticed any changes in how often you're going to the bathroom, or the amount of urine you're producing?
PATIENT: No, I think it's the same. Same times, same... everything. I didn't really pay attention, before the color. My wife is always telling me to pay attention to these things. She’s a nurse, so… she knows more than me.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. A nurse’s intuition is often spot on. Okay. And have you been taking any new medications, vitamins, or supplements recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I take a little something for my back, sometimes. Just when it hurts. But I didn’t take it yesterday or today. It's… a muscle relaxer, I think. The doctor gave it to me a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a muscle relaxer. Do you remember the name of it?
PATIENT: No, sorry. I don't remember the name. It's a small white pill. I only take it when my back is really bad. It’s been a while since I used it. Maybe weeks, maybe months.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to be thorough, have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting lately?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I feel okay, except for the pee. I was working a lot last week, maybe a little tired, but no fever or… anything. Just the orange color. It's really worrying my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, orange urine can be caused by a number of things, some more serious than others. Dehydration, certain medications, even some foods can cause it. Let’s do a quick exam, and I’d like to order a urine sample to check for infection or other issues, just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds good. I want to know what's wrong. My wife will be happy you want to check. A urine sample is fine. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: The nurse will escort you to the restroom to collect the sample. She’ll give you a sterile cup and instructions. Then we can do a brief physical exam right here. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds good. I hope it's nothing serious. I have to go back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: We'll get to the bottom of it. I understand you need to get back to work, and we’ll try to be as quick as possible. Let me call the nurse, and she’ll be right in.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. My wife will be very glad.
DOCTOR: She’s on her way. While we wait, can you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: I'm okay, I think. I work hard, construction mostly. A little back pain, like I said. No other problems, really. I try to eat good, but it's hard when you're working all day. I don't smoke, I drink a little beer sometimes. That's it, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Construction work can be hard on the body. Any history of kidney stones or urinary tract infections in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've been sick before, you know, colds and flu. But nothing with my kidneys or... urine. I don't think so. My wife would know, I think. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Right, and she’s a nurse. That's good. Just one more question, and then the nurse should be here shortly. Any family history of kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t know. My father… he had high blood pressure. And my mother, she had… something with her heart, I think. I don’t really know much about it. We didn't talk about it much. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Ah, here’s the nurse now. She’ll get you set up for the urine sample. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it doesn't take too long. I need to go back to work.
