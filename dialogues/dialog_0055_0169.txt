DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. I am Dr. EADDY. Now, let's get right to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Though, honestly, mornings aren’t what they used to be. Not much is, I suppose. You can call me Derick, if you like. So, swelling, you say? Yeah, it's… noticeable. Mostly in the legs and face. Been happening for a bit now, come and gone, you know? Not sure why it’s happening, though.
DOCTOR: “A bit now” is hardly a useful descriptor, Derick. We need specifics. When did you first notice this swelling?
PATIENT: Oh, specifics… right. Well, let me think. It wasn't sudden, that's for sure. Probably… sometime after Agnes passed, I reckon. Maybe a few months? Hard to say, really. Things all kinda blurred together after… well, you understand. I wasn’t really paying attention to myself, if that makes any sense. Just… existing. It comes and goes, like I said. Sometimes I wake up and it's worse, sometimes it's barely there. It’s not like it’s getting worse worse, just… there.
DOCTOR: “Existing” is not a medical diagnosis, Derick. And frankly, grief is not a primary cause of edema, though it can exacerbate underlying conditions. Let’s focus on concrete observations. You mention it’s worse in the mornings. Are there any other times of day it's particularly noticeable?
PATIENT: Edema? Is that what you call it? Fancy words. Look, I work with metal all day, alright? Welding, soldering… not sitting around reading medical books. Mornings, yeah. And… sometimes after I’ve been on my feet a long time. The workshop isn't exactly built for comfort, if you catch my drift. Concrete floor, hot… gets the blood moving, I suppose. Though, I don't know why that would make my legs swell. Never bothered me much before, but it’s getting… harder to ignore, now.
DOCTOR: Derick, I appreciate your… vocational details, but we need to establish a proper timeline and assess potential contributing factors. Let's move beyond the workshop and discuss your overall health. Do you have any history of kidney problems?
PATIENT: Kidney problems? Goodness, no! Never had a thing wrong with my kidneys. Always been a strong lad, even if I do say so myself. I eat alright, I suppose. Not fancy, but solid. Meat and potatoes, mostly. Drink a bit of coffee to get through the day, and maybe a beer with supper sometimes. Agnes always made sure I ate well, that's for sure. She was a good woman. Never complained about a thing. But kidneys… no, never. Why would my kidneys make my legs swell?
DOCTOR: Because, Derick, the kidneys regulate fluid balance in the body. When they aren’t functioning properly, fluid can accumulate, leading to edema. It's a basic principle of internal medicine. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Changes in… Look, Doctor, I go to the bathroom when I need to, alright? It’s… you know… yellow. Sometimes a bit darker if I haven’t had enough water. But no, nothing different. I don’t… inspect it, if that's what you're asking. I just… go. This is getting a bit ridiculous, isn't it? Asking a man about his… well, you know. I came here about my legs swelling, not to be interrogated about my bathroom habits.
DOCTOR: Derick, it is essential to gather a complete medical history. Dismissing pertinent questions hinders accurate diagnosis. Very well. Let's proceed without further… detailed exploration of your excretory functions. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, if there's a lot of pollen around. But that's just sneezing and a runny nose, nothing serious. Agnes always said I was built like a rock. Nothing ever bothered me. Maybe a bit of a sting if a bee got to me, but that’s about it. No medicines, no foods… nothing. Just… strong. Though, things are different now, aren't they?
DOCTOR: Right. “Strong.” Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Haven't touched a pill in my life, if I can help it. Agnes used to take something for her arthritis, but I didn’t need any of that. Still don't. I believe in hard work and fresh air, not bottles and powders. Maybe a bit of liniment on my back now and then when it's cold, but that’s about it. Just… nothing. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's conduct a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to assess your legs and check your vital signs. Perhaps a hands-on assessment will be more… illuminating.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Though, I reckon you can tell just by looking at them they’re swollen. But I suppose you need your fancy instruments and whatnot. Here I go, then. Try not to poke too much, alright? This old body’s seen better days.
DOCTOR: “There is pitting edema present bilaterally, extending to the mid-tibia. Skin is warm to the touch. Pulses are present, though diminished. No signs of cellulitis or ulceration. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart rate is 88 and regular. Respiratory rate is 16. Auscultation of the lungs is clear.” “Your blood pressure is somewhat elevated, and the edema is significant. Given your history – or rather, lack thereof – and the physical findings, I suspect this is likely early congestive heart failure, potentially exacerbated by fluid retention. However, we need further investigation to confirm this diagnosis.”
PATIENT: Congestive… what now? Heart… failure? Now hold on a minute. I feel fine! A bit tired, maybe, but that’s just age. I’ve been working hard my whole life. I weld metal, Doctor, I don’t sit around waiting for my heart to give out. And what’s fluid retention? Is that the swelling? You’re telling me all these fancy words, but you’re not actually telling me anything. What does this mean? Am I… sick?
DOCTOR: “It means, Derick, that your heart may not be pumping as efficiently as it should, causing fluid to build up in your body. It’s not a death sentence, but it is a serious condition that requires management. We need to perform an electrocardiogram – an EKG – to assess your heart rhythm and an echocardiogram to visualize the structure of your heart. We will also need blood work to check your kidney function and rule out other possible causes.” “I will write the orders now. You will need to go to the lab for the blood work, and then schedule an appointment with the cardiology department for the EKG and echocardiogram. Do you understand?
PATIENT: EKG? Echo… cardio… Look, Doctor, I barely understand what you’re saying! I came here about my legs swelling, and now you’re talking about hearts and kidneys and… and tests I can’t even pronounce! I don't even own a computer! How am I supposed to schedule an appointment with a… a cardio… whatchamacallit? This is all too much. I just wanted someone to tell me why my legs are puffy. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Derick, I understand this is overwhelming, but you cannot expect a diagnosis and treatment plan without appropriate investigation. My medical assistant, Nurse Evelyn, will assist you with scheduling the necessary appointments and explain the process in detail. She is very capable. I will also write a referral note for the cardiology department outlining my concerns. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your sodium intake and monitoring your fluid intake. And I strongly advise against heavy exertion until we have a clearer understanding of your condition.” “Nurse Evelyn will be with you shortly. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Sodium… intake? Heavy… exertion? Goodness gracious. I eat what Agnes cooked, and I work hard, like I always have. I don't understand all these rules and restrictions. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you… trying, I suppose. But I'm a simple man. I like my routine. And I don't like being told what to do. But alright. I’ll… I’ll talk to this Evelyn. Maybe she can explain it all in plain English. Just… please, don't expect me to start weighing my food or counting every drop of water I drink. This is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: “Very well, Derick. Nurse Evelyn will be with you shortly. She will provide you with detailed instructions and answer any questions you may have. I trust she can assist you with navigating this process. I will now excuse myself.”
PATIENT: .
