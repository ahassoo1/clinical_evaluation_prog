DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I'm here 'cause I gotta take this exam. For the military. They want me to, uh… prove I'm fit enough. Not that I think there's a problem, mind you. I keep myself in shape. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. A pre-placement exam for the military. Certainly. We'll do our best to help facilitate that for you. Just to be clear, is this for initial enlistment, or a periodic health assessment during service?
PATIENT: Initial. Never been in before. Always meant to, y'know? Now's the time. Though, honestly, all this paperwork and… checking… feels a bit unnecessary. I can build an engine with my eyes closed. That should be enough proof of something, right?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your… enthusiasm, Mr. Hartness. And that is quite a skill! However, the military has certain health standards they need to ensure everyone is physically capable and safe for service. It’s a fairly standard process. Let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? Well, I've had a few bumps and scrapes, working with machines, naturally. Nothing serious. Broke my wrist once, when I was a teenager, falling out of a tree. And I had… the flu, a couple times. Usual stuff. Nothing a good Swedish constitution couldn't handle. You don't need to write all that down, do you? It's hardly important. I've never been… sick sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to have a complete picture, even for minor events. The wrist fracture… do you recall when that happened, and if you needed any casting or surgery?
PATIENT: Around… fourteen, I think? Maybe fifteen. It was a long time ago. And no surgery. Just a cast. A plaster one. It was blue, if you must know. My mum picked it out. I was out of commission for a few weeks, but healed up fine. Strong as new. It hasn't bothered me a bit since. Honestly, doctor, are you sure you need to know this much about a broken wrist from thirty years ago? Seems a bit excessive.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Hartness, and helps us establish a baseline. It's good to know it healed completely without any lasting issues. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, beyond the cast for your wrist?
PATIENT: No. Never. I told you, I'm a healthy man. I’ve never needed surgery. Not a thing. I’ve always been careful with my tools, and, well… I just haven’t broken anything else. Though, I did pull a muscle in my back once, lifting a… a particularly heavy engine block. But that wasn't surgery-worthy. Just a bit of a strain. Rubbed it with some liniment, and was right as rain in a couple days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Good to know. And just a muscle strain in your back. We'll ask about your family history next, if you don’t mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has any significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history... hmm. My father, he had… a bit of a cough. Towards the end. But he smoked like a chimney, so that's hardly surprising. And my mum… she had high blood pressure, I think. Or maybe it was just stress. She worried a lot. My sister’s fine, as far as I know. Perfectly healthy, works in an office. Nothing exciting. I doubt there’s anything worth writing down, really. Mostly just… old people things.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with a cough – smoking history is important, thank you. And mother with potential high blood pressure. We'll make a note of that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not a single thing. I don't believe in all that… fancy stuff. Liniment, maybe, if my back gets a bit stiff. But that’s it. I get all my vitamins from a good Swedish diet. Fish, potatoes, a bit of meat. Keeps me going. Honestly, doctor, are we nearly done? This is taking a long time. I've got things to do, you know. Machines to build.
DOCTOR: Almost, Mr. Hartness. Just a few more questions, and then we'll move on to a physical exam. Have you ever been allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat anything. Never had a problem. I’m a robust Swede, remember? Dust, maybe, when I’m working with the machines. But that’s hardly an allergy. A bit of a sniffle, that’s all. I'm perfectly fine. You're starting to make me think I’m ill, with all these questions! Honestly. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It’s standard procedure to rule things out. Alright, no known allergies. Finally, do you use any tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs?
