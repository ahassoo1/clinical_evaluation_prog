DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's…fine. I suppose. It's this discoloration, really. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, I expect you to know what’s causing it. It’s on my hands, mostly. And it’s not something I just noticed, you know. It’s been…developing.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Developing” is a helpful way to put it. It sounds like this has been a gradual process. To help me understand better, could you describe the discoloration for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a rash, if that’s what you're thinking. It’s…a sort of brownish tint. A bit patchy, and not evenly spread. It's more noticeable on the backs of my hands, and it’s…unattractive. Honestly. I’ve tried several creams, you know, the ones you see advertised, but they’ve done absolutely nothing. A complete waste of money, really. It's not painful, thankfully. Just…there. And increasingly noticeable.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that it's not a rash, and that it isn't painful. “Patchy, brownish tint” is very helpful. And it's good to know you’ve already tried some over-the-counter remedies. When did you first notice this discoloration beginning to develop, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It must have been…around last November, I’d say. Yes, November. We had that particularly dreary stretch of weather, and I remember noticing it then. It wasn't very prominent at first, just a slight change in skin tone. But it’s definitely gotten worse since then. Especially during the winter. Though it hasn’t… improved now that it’s warmer, obviously. It’s quite persistent. I do a lot of gardening, you know. Perhaps that has something to do with it. Though I always wear gloves. Mostly.
DOCTOR: November…that gives us a good starting point. And gardening is useful information, even with gloves. I’ll make a note of that. Do you recall any specific event or change in your routine around November that might have coincided with the initial appearance of the discoloration?
PATIENT: Hmm. A specific event…Well, my husband, Bohdan, and I started using a new fertilizer on the roses. It was highly recommended by Mrs. Kravchuk down the street. She has magnificent roses. Perhaps that’s it? It was some sort of organic blend, I believe. Though I don’t recall the exact name. And we did have a bit of a…leak in the basement around that time too. Nothing major, but we had to do some cleaning up. It was damp for a little while. Though I doubt that would cause this. It seems…unlikely. But I suppose I should mention everything, shouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You absolutely should mention everything, Ms. Bartock. That’s precisely what helps me understand the full picture. The new fertilizer and the basement leak are both pertinent details. Now, outside of the gardening and the changes around the house, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this discoloration?
PATIENT: No, not really. No itching, no pain, no swelling. My hands haven’t felt any different, really. Just…the colour. Though, I have been feeling a bit more tired lately. But everyone feels more tired this time of year, don't they? It's the heat. And Bohdan has been wanting me to take up a new exercise class, but frankly, I haven’t the energy. So I suppose that could be a symptom, if you look at it that way. But I doubt it’s related. It's just…life. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. And fatigue can certainly be a symptom of many things, so it's good to be aware of it. Let's move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. Nothing major. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but everyone gets the flu, don't they? And I had my gallbladder removed…oh, must be fifteen years ago now. And I have a bit of…well, my doctor calls it “mild hypertension”. It’s easily managed with medication. A very small dose, really. Nothing to worry about. And Bohdan keeps telling me I should get my cholesterol checked, but I always forget to make the appointment. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. It’s just…this discoloration, really. It’s the only thing that bothers me. And it’s quite unsightly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. That gives me a good overview. So, mild hypertension managed with medication and a past gallbladder removal. And we’ll certainly make a note to discuss cholesterol screening today. Now, could you tell me what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the one, for the blood pressure. It’s…lisinopril, I believe. A small, white pill. I take it every morning with my tea. Bohdan reminds me, usually. He's very good about that sort of thing. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but not very often. Perhaps once or twice a month. Nothing regular. Honestly, I don’t take many medications. I prefer to avoid them if possible. They always have such…side effects, don’t they? And I’m perfectly healthy otherwise, really. Except for this…discoloration, of course. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for hypertension and occasional ibuprofen. That’s helpful. And I appreciate your preference for minimizing medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, really. Bohdan likes to make Ukrainian dishes, you know, and they often have…various ingredients. I’ve never had any trouble. And I’ve never been stung by a bee or anything like that. I don't have any sensitivities. Honestly, I'm a very…robust person. It’s just this discoloration. It doesn’t make any sense. I’ve always taken good care of my skin, you know. And now this…it’s quite upsetting. I’m starting to feel rather anxious about it, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Bartock. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about a change in your skin, especially one that’s persistent and unexplained. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had…arthritis, I suppose. Badly, towards the end. She was in a lot of pain. And my father…oh, he had a heart condition. Something to do with the valves, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, actually. And Bohdan’s mother…she had diabetes, but she wasn't very good about taking care of herself. She ate a lot of sweets, you know. And she had…complications. Honestly, it’s not a very healthy family history, if you look at it that way. Though I’ve always been lucky, really. Until now. This discoloration…it’s quite worrying. I’m starting to think it’s something serious, actually.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. Arthritis, a heart condition in your father, and diabetes in Bohdan’s mother. That is useful to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only drink a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Usually on a Saturday. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a respectable woman. I wouldn’t dream of it. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, though. And I bake a lot. Usually Ukrainian pastries. And I spend a lot of time in the garden. It's very relaxing. Honestly, I lead a very…sedate life. It’s quite peaceful, usually. Until this…discoloration, of course. It’s really disrupting my routine. I’m starting to feel quite stressed about it, actually.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. Bartock. A healthy lifestyle overall. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination of your hands to get a closer look at the discoloration and assess your overall skin health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Please do. I’m happy to cooperate in any way. I just want to know what’s causing it. It’s really quite bothersome, you know? And it’s getting worse. I'm starting to worry it's something…unsightly. I hope it’s not contagious, or anything. I do a lot of cooking, and I don't want to…pass anything on to Bohdan or our friends. Please, examine them thoroughly. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. If you don't mind, please extend your arms, palms up. I’m noting a patchy, brownish discoloration on the dorsal surfaces of both hands, most prominent on the knuckles and along the areas of sun exposure. The skin feels normal to the touch, no tenderness or swelling. Fingernails appear healthy, no pitting or ridging. There is some mild dryness present. No obvious signs of inflammation or infection. Based on the physical examination, there isn’t evidence of an acute inflammatory process. The dryness suggests possible chronic sun exposure. I’d like to discuss some potential causes and next steps with you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. Chronic sun exposure…well, I do spend a lot of time in the garden, even though I wear gloves. It’s just…it doesn’t seem like enough to cause this. Honestly, it looks rather…unattractive. And it’s getting worse, despite my best efforts. What else could it be? Is it something serious? I’m starting to feel quite anxious about it, Doctor. Please, tell me what you think. And what can we do about it? I’d really like to get this sorted out, you know. It’s really disrupting my routine.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Bartock. It's important to explore all possibilities. While chronic sun exposure is a likely contributor, we need to consider other factors as well. Given the gradual onset and the distribution of the discoloration, several conditions could be responsible. These include localized hyperpigmentation, a reaction to an irritant or allergen, or, less commonly, a manifestation of an underlying systemic condition. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a few basic laboratory tests. Specifically, I’d like to check your complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. These tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the discoloration. I'd also recommend a dermatology consultation. A dermatologist can perform a skin biopsy to examine the tissue under a microscope and provide a definitive diagnosis. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests and a biopsy… Honestly, it sounds rather…serious. But I suppose it’s necessary, if you think it’s the best course of action. I just want to know what’s causing it, you know? And I want it sorted out as quickly as possible. Yes, please, order the tests and schedule a dermatology consultation. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Though I must admit, I’m starting to feel rather anxious about it. Is it something contagious? I really don't want to…pass anything on to Bohdan or our friends. And what if it’s something…serious? I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed, actually.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Bartock. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when faced with an unexplained medical issue. Let me assure you that we are taking a methodical approach to determine the cause of the discoloration. The tests I’ve ordered are routine and will provide valuable information. As for contagiousness, based on my initial assessment, it is extremely unlikely that this is contagious. The discoloration appears to be localized and doesn’t have characteristics suggestive of an infectious process. I will order the lab tests immediately, and I'll have my assistant schedule a dermatology consultation for you as soon as possible. We’ll aim for an appointment within the next week. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to protect your hands from the sun and using a moisturizer regularly. Once we have the lab results and the dermatologist’s assessment, we can formulate a definitive diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan. Would you like me to provide you with a written summary of the tests and the referral?
PATIENT: Yes, please, a written summary would be very helpful. I like to keep track of things, you know. And I need to show Bohdan, so he understands what’s going on. He worries about me, you know. He’s very good about that sort of thing. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your reassuring words. I still feel anxious, but I feel…better knowing that we are taking steps to address it. And thank you for saying it’s unlikely to be contagious. That’s a great relief. So, the tests and the dermatology consultation…just let me know when and where to go. And I’ll try to be patient. Though it’s difficult, you know, when you’re worried about something like this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I'll have my assistant print out a summary of the tests and the dermatology referral information before you leave. She will also schedule the appointment for you and provide you with all the necessary details, including the location, date, and time. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that we are taking a comprehensive approach to this. While the discoloration is concerning, it’s important to remember that many causes are benign and treatable. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to address this. I really appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. Please, just let my assistant know if there’s anything else I need to do. And thank you again. I’m looking forward to getting this sorted out. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. My assistant will be in touch shortly with the scheduling information. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Take care, and please, try not to worry too much. .
