DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Yoshino. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. It’s been over 48 hours now, I think. It’s really annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over 48 hours. That is annoying! We definitely want to figure out what's going on. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They just come and go, randomly. It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing – eating, sitting, walking… doesn't make a difference. And they’re… normal hiccups, I guess? Not painful, just… startling. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water really fast… the usual things, but nothing's worked. I don’t even remember what started them, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense – sometimes they just start for no obvious reason. And you’ve tried some good initial things to try and stop them. Just to get a better picture, are you having any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No fever, no heartburn… my stomach feels okay. I haven’t noticed any trouble breathing, or anything like that. Just the hiccups. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I’ve been a little bit more tired than usual, but I just figured that was the summer heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no heartburn, no trouble breathing. Just the hiccups and some increased fatigue. That's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently, or anything stressful going on in your life?
PATIENT: Not really in the diet, no. I eat pretty much the same things as always – lots of vegetables, some fish, you know, normal Egyptian food. And stressful… well, being divorced is stressful, I guess. But nothing new happened, no big arguments or anything. It’s just… life, after the divorce.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Divorce is definitely a significant life event. And it’s good you haven’t had any major changes in your diet. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. The doctor gave me some cream for it a while back, and that helps. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I haven’t been to the doctor in a few years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, some arthritis in your hands, managed with cream, and haven’t been to the doctor in a few years. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been hospitalized. And no surgeries either. I’ve been very lucky, I think. Just the usual childhood illnesses when I was little, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, just typical childhood illnesses. What about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes. And my sister… she had some problems with her heart a few years ago, but she’s doing better now. Other than that, I don’t really know much about their medical history. We don’t talk much, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and some heart problems with your sister. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my arthritis, like I said. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that’s it. No vitamins or anything like that. I prefer to just… deal with things if I can, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, just the arthritis cream and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, and I haven’t had any problems with medications before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Ivette, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen, just to make sure everything looks alright. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just take some deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. This might be a little cold. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Everything seems normal here too. And finally, let me just check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. However, given the hiccups lasting over 48 hours and the fatigue you mentioned, I think it's worth doing a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying issues. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it can rule things out, then yes, I’m happy to have some blood tests. What sort of things are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll check a complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function and electrolytes, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level to see if your thyroid is functioning properly. Those hiccups, along with the fatigue, can sometimes be related to these things, although it's not common. We'll also check your Vitamin D level since low Vitamin D can sometimes cause fatigue. I'm going to write you a lab order now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of drawing the blood. It shouldn’t take too long. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly alright. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to know you’re checking everything. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I’m glad I can help. And don't hesitate to come back if the hiccups get worse, or if you develop any new symptoms while you're waiting for the results. Here's the lab order. The receptionist will help you schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Dr. Yoshino.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. Get well soon!
