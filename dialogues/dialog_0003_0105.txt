DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I am Dr. Yackey. Let’s not waste any time, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, sure. Whatever gets things moving. I appreciate you seeing me. It's… well, it's a big step, this whole surgery thing.
DOCTOR: Surgery?
PATIENT: Right. Bariatric surgery. That's what my wife and I decided on. I… I think. She did most of the research, to be honest. I just… agreed it seemed like a good idea. It's been hard, you know? Keeping the weight off. Or even on sometimes, if that makes sense. It feels like a constant battle.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, many people struggle with weight management. We need to determine if you are a suitable candidate for such a procedure. Let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me about your current symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. That's a good question. Honestly, I'm usually just… tired. Really tired. And my knees ache, especially at the end of the day. It's hard to keep up with my kids, you know? Playing with them… it's getting harder and harder. And I get winded pretty easily. Just walking up the stairs… It’s not like it used to be. I don't really know if those are symptoms though, or just… getting older?
DOCTOR: Tiredness and knee pain… vague, but noted. And how long have you been experiencing these… difficulties?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. A long time. Years, I guess. It’s kinda crept up on me, little by little. Maybe… the last five years, things have really started to get worse. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when, it wasn't like a sudden thing. Just… slower and slower, everything. I try to ignore it, mostly. My wife says I don't listen to my body. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: Five years… alright. And have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. I get these headaches sometimes, behind my eyes. Not terrible, but they’re annoying. And I… I snore, really loudly. My wife says I wake her up all the time. She sleeps in the other room sometimes because of it. I also… I feel like I’m always thirsty. I drink a lot of water. I don't know if that counts as a change, I always drank water, but maybe more now? It's hard to remember what “normal” even felt like.
DOCTOR: Headaches, snoring, increased thirst… alright. Let’s move on. Do you have any significant past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football. Had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox and stuff. But nothing… major. No serious illnesses, no surgeries before this, nothing like that. I went to the dentist regularly, if that counts. I really don’t get sick often, to be honest. My wife keeps telling me I should probably go to the doctor more, but I always put it off. I just… don’t like doctors. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history… acceptable. Any past surgical history?
PATIENT: Like I said, no. Nothing before this. Not even tonsils out or anything. Just the broken arm a long time ago. It healed up fine. I think. It’s been a long time. My wife might remember more details, she's always been good with dates and stuff. I'm terrible with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tough one. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom, she had… arthritis, maybe? It was in her hands. She had trouble moving them. And my grandfather on my mom's side, he was… big. Really big. That's about all I know, honestly. We weren't really a family that talked about medical stuff. It was just… never discussed. My wife says I should ask my relatives, but I don't really talk to them much. It's complicated.
DOCTOR: Vague family history… typical. Now, tell me about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My wife hates it. She wouldn't let me, even when I was younger. And I’m glad she didn't, honestly. It just seems… unhealthy. I do drink sometimes, though. A beer or a glass of wine with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Not a lot. I'm not a big drinker. I mostly just… relax at home with my wife and the kids. We watch TV, play games, stuff like that. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption… acceptable. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medication in my life. Maybe some Tylenol for headaches, but nothing regularly. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I don't usually even bother with allergy medicine, unless I'm really stuffed up. I haven't really needed to. My wife is the one who keeps track of all that stuff, she’s got a list of everything I’ve ever taken, I think. She’s very organized. I’m… not.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescriptions or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, like I said, nothing. I don’t take anything regularly. Just the occasional Tylenol if I get a bad headache. But that's it. Really. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I don't like feeling like I need something to get through the day. My wife keeps telling me I should be taking a multivitamin or something, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. She buys them, they’re just… sitting in the cupboard. I promise I’ll start… eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I always feel a little embarrassed doing this. I know I need to lose weight, that’s why I’m here, right? It’s just… hard.
DOCTOR: 139 pounds… and your height is 155 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. 155. It's… not very tall, I know. My wife says it doesn't matter, but… It is what it is. I guess it doesn’t really come up much.
DOCTOR: Your BMI is… significant. Now, if you’ll please lie down on the examination table, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need, Doctor. I’m not a big fan of hospitals, or doctors’ offices, to be honest. It always makes me a little nervous. Just tell me if anything seems wrong, okay?
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, slightly elevated. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though there is some mild wheezing on auscultation. Blood pressure is… also elevated. And I'm detecting some abdominal adiposity, as expected. Your thyroid feels normal on palpation. Reflexes are within normal limits. Now, do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Not really. Not that I've noticed. Sometimes my feet feel a little tired at the end of the day, but that’s probably just from being on them all day. My wife might notice something I don’t. She has a good eye for details. I’m always forgetting things, you know? I’m not sure if that answers your question. No, I don’t think I’m swollen.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your history and the physical exam findings, it appears you are a candidate for further evaluation for bariatric surgery. However, before we proceed, I recommend a comprehensive metabolic panel and a lipid profile to assess your overall health. We also need to rule out any underlying conditions contributing to your weight gain and fatigue. Would you be willing to undergo these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… Yeah, okay. If that’s what you recommend, then yes. I just… I want to get this done, you know? I’m tired of feeling this way. I trust your judgement, Doctor. What do I need to do? I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have a life, and my wife is probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll have my assistant schedule the bloodwork for you. You’ll need to fast for 12 hours prior to the appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. I'll also require a referral from your primary care physician confirming medical necessity. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Primary care… Uh… I think so. I used to see Dr. Ramirez, a few years back. But I haven’t been in a while. Honestly, I mostly just go to urgent care when I need something. I don’t really have a regular doctor, I guess. Would a referral from urgent care work? I’m not sure what to do about this. My wife handles all the medical stuff usually. I feel like I’m making this harder than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: A referral from urgent care is… acceptable, but not ideal. It’s preferable to have a long-term physician familiar with your medical history. However, given your current circumstances, we will proceed with the urgent care referral for now. I’ll provide you with a requisition form. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your options. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with me. I just want to get this done, you know? And I'll get the requisition form. My wife will be happy to hear we're moving forward. Thank you again. I think that’s everything. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I trust your wife will manage the logistics. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
