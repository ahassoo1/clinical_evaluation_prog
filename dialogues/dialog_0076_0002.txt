DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Stoffregen, yes… 87. Right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks, you see. Not working so good anymore. Takes a long time to… go. It's a bit of a bother, really. I don’t remember exactly when it started, just… gradually, I think.
DOCTOR: "Waterworks," right. So, difficulty… emptying your bladder?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Emptying… yes. It feels like it doesn’t all come out, sometimes. And I have to… push a little. Not good, is it? My husband, he says I take too long in the bathroom. He’s a good man, but… he doesn’t understand these things.
DOCTOR: Pushing… alright. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a hard one. A while now. Maybe… a few months? Or longer? Time just… slips away, you know? I used to be able to just… go. Now it’s… effort. It's not painful, exactly, just… troublesome. I don’t rightly recall when it started being troublesome. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: A few months… progressive difficulty. Right. Any burning or discomfort while you’re trying to go?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not really discomfort either. It’s just… weak, like the stream isn’t strong. And like I said, I feel like I don’t get it all out. It’s a strange feeling, hard to explain. Like… a little bit left behind, always. Does that make sense? I hope I’m not being a bother, doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, alright. We’ll figure it out. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no chills. And my tummy doesn’t hurt. Not a bit. Just… this waterworks problem. It's mostly just annoying, to be honest. And my husband keeps looking at his watch! He worries, you see. He’s a good man. Does the waterworks problem sound bad, doctor? I get worried sometimes, thinking it's something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, just to get a better picture. Nothing major. Just a simple check.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An exam, you say? Okay. I hope it doesn’t take too long. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. Will I need to… undress? I hope it’s not too cold in here.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to undress from the waist down. There’s a gown in there. I’ll be right back. And no, it’s reasonably warm. Try not to worry. It's a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. A gown, you say? Okay. I suppose I can manage that. It’s just… getting old isn’t easy, is it? Thank you, doctor. I’ll be right in.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look. Nothing remarkable there. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Hmm. Feels a bit of… retention. Not severe, but present. I’ll order a urinalysis, just to rule out infection.
PATIENT: Retention? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Infection… well, I try to stay healthy. I eat my vegetables, you see. What does the… urinalysis do, doctor? Will it hurt? I don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: It's just a sample of your urine, Mrs. Stoffregen. A simple cup. No needles involved. It just tells us if there's anything in the urine that shouldn’t be there. Infection, blood… things like that. The nurse will give you a container. Go in there, collect the sample, and bring it back to me. It’s standard procedure. It's not going to hurt. Just… a bit inconvenient.
PATIENT: Oh, a cup, you say? That’s… alright. A cup is much better than a needle. A cup… yes. I can manage that. Thank you, doctor. I’ll be right back with the sample. Do I need to… drink anything first?
DOCTOR: Yes, drink a normal amount of fluids before you go. Enough to… fill the cup, if you understand. Don’t overdo it, just… normal. And try to be quick about it. I have other patients, you know.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Normal fluids. Yes, I can do that. Not too much, just… normal. I’ll try to be quick, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. It's good to know what’s happening, you see.
DOCTOR: Honestly. Some people…
