DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. It's lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you too. I suppose I’m here because I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. Honestly, I’d rather not take up too much of your time, if we can get straight to it. It’s just… a general sadness, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. It’s perfectly alright to want to get straight to the point, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. “General sadness” is a good place to start. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It's difficult to explain. Things just… lack colour, you know? I used to enjoy my garden, my work… keeping people safe at the ski slopes, the beach… but now… it all feels like a chore. I don’t get the same pleasure. And I find myself… withdrawing. Not wanting company. It's not like I'm actively unhappy, just… empty. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I don’t even know how long now. A few months, perhaps? Time slips away these days.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful description, Ms. Derasmo – “lacking colour” and feeling like things are a chore despite previously enjoying them. And withdrawing from activities and company… those are important details. A few months is certainly enough time for it to be impacting your quality of life. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if anything specific happened around the time you started feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific… That’s a good question. Let me think. My divorce was… final about six months ago. It wasn’t acrimonious, exactly, but… it was a big change. We’d been together for a long time, you see. Fifty years. Perhaps that’s it? I hadn’t really allowed myself to feel much during the process, just… handled things. Maybe it’s all catching up with me now. It’s silly, isn’t it? To take this long to… process it.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Derasmo. Fifty years is a lifetime, and even a peaceful divorce represents a profound loss and a significant adjustment. It’s very common to have delayed reactions to major life changes like that. You were likely very focused on handling things practically, and it makes perfect sense that the emotional weight is coming to the surface now. Besides the sadness and withdrawal, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling, either physically or emotionally?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to love cooking, Nigerian food especially, but now I just… nibble. And I’ve been sleeping… too much, perhaps. Or not sleeping well. I wake up a lot during the night, thinking. Just… thoughts swirling around. I wouldn't say I'm anxious, exactly, but… restless. And I’ve lost interest in… everything, really. Even my grandchildren don't seem to cheer me up as much as they used to. Which is… worrying.
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Ms. Derasmo – changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, and a loss of interest in things you typically enjoy. It sounds like these symptoms are significantly impacting your daily life. I’m going to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind, just to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I haven’t weighed myself properly in… well, I don’t know when. But my clothes are certainly looser. I don’t think it’s a huge amount, but noticeable. My daughter commented on it when she visited last month. Said I was looking… thinner. It’s not like I’m trying to lose weight, you understand. Quite the opposite, actually. I just… don’t have the energy for proper meals.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. That’s helpful information. And it's good your daughter noticed; sometimes it's easier for others to see changes in us. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, nothing major. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, which is why I retired from the ski patrol. It acted up too much. I take some over-the-counter medication for that, but that’s about it. My doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high, but nothing that required medication. Otherwise, I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. Good genes, I suppose. Though they don’t seem to be helping much lately.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like you’ve generally been in good health. And arthritis is certainly something to keep in mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression or anxiety in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not officially. I’ve had my share of sadness, of course. Losing my parents, some friends… but I always managed. I just… got on with things. It's not really the Nigerian way to dwell, you see. We're a strong people. But this… this feels different. It's not like a temporary grief. It's more… pervasive.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Derasmo, and I understand that cultural factors can influence how we experience and express emotions. It sounds like this is a different kind of sadness than you've experienced before. Now, I’d like to ask about your medications. Besides the over-the-counter medication for your arthritis, are you taking any other prescriptions, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis cream, really. Sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I've been rather forgetful lately, so it's not regular. And occasionally, a little ginger for my tummy. That's all. I try to eat healthy, get enough rest... but it's not always easy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. That's helpful to know. To complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother, she was a bit… melancholy, perhaps. She never really talked about it, but my father used to say she had a “sensitive nature.” She didn't go to doctors much, though. It wasn't the thing to do in our village. My father was very stoic, always practical. No one in the family ever talked about… mental illness, if that’s what you mean. It was just… not discussed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. That’s understandable, given the cultural context. Okay, Ms. Derasmo, based on what you’ve told me, and considering the recent divorce, the changes in your appetite and sleep, the loss of interest in activities, and the overall feeling of sadness and emptiness, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to remember that depression is a common and treatable condition. It's not a sign of weakness, and it's not something you should feel ashamed of.
PATIENT: Depression? Oh. Well. I suppose… that explains why everything feels so… heavy. It’s not just a case of being a bit down, then? It's… a condition? I always thought I was just… getting old. A bit weaker, a bit less enthusiastic. But this feels… different. What does… treatment involve? I must admit, the thought of talking about all this… it’s rather daunting.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel daunting, Ms. Derasmo. And you’re right, it’s not just “being a bit down.” Depression is a medical condition, just like arthritis or high blood pressure. It involves changes in brain chemistry and can significantly impact your mood, thoughts, and behavior. Treatment usually involves a combination of approaches. We could explore talk therapy – psychotherapy – where you can discuss your feelings with a trained professional in a safe and supportive environment. We also have medications – antidepressants – that can help regulate the brain chemistry. Often, the best results come from combining both. We don’t have to jump into anything right away. I'd like to start with some basic blood work to rule out any other potential medical causes for your symptoms, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Then, we can talk more about your options and decide what feels right for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Blood work first, to rule things out. Yes, that feels… less overwhelming. And then, we can talk. No immediate decisions. I suppose I’m a little wary of medication. I’ve always preferred to handle things myself. But I can see… perhaps I need a little help now. What kind of therapy would you recommend? And how long does… all of this take? I have a few trips planned with my grandchildren, you see, and I wouldn’t want to… disappear.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable approach, Ms. Derasmo. It’s perfectly alright to be cautious about medication, and we can definitely explore that option thoroughly before making any decisions. There are different types of therapy, but given your situation, I would recommend either cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy . CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns, while IPT focuses on improving your relationships and social support. Both have been shown to be effective for depression. As for how long it takes… that varies. Therapy typically involves weekly sessions for several months, and it can take some time to see significant improvement. We would work at your pace and tailor the treatment to your specific needs. The goal isn't to "disappear," but to help you feel more like yourself again and enjoy those trips with your grandchildren. Let’s start with the blood work. I’ll have my nurse draw a few vials. Then, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and explore your therapy options in more detail. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… manageable. Blood work, then a follow-up. Very good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so… clearly. It’s a relief to feel… heard, if that makes sense. I suppose I've been bottling things up for a while now. Alright. Let's get the blood work done. The sooner we get started, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel heard, Ms. Derasmo. That's my priority. I’ll have Nurse Anya come in and take your blood pressure and explain the process. She’s very gentle and will make you comfortable. After the blood work, she'll let me know, and we can discuss next steps. Is there anything else I can address for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… getting through the blood work, and then we’ll take it from there. Thank you again, Doctor. And please, tell Nurse Anya I appreciate her gentleness. I’m not a fan of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll let her know. She's very good with patients who are apprehensive. And please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns at any point. Anya! Could you come in here for a moment, please?
