DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve noticed some swelling… somewhere. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I'm afraid my memory isn’t the greatest, so details are… hazy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if details are unclear. We’ll take our time and try to piece things together. When you say swelling… could you be more specific as to where you’ve noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s… on my face, I believe. Yes, definitely my face. Around my jawline, perhaps? It’s… hard to say exactly. It feels… puffy, mostly. And it seems to be worse in the mornings. I apologize for being so vague; it’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Mr. Tomassoni. These things happen. It’s helpful that you’ve narrowed it down to the face and jawline, and that it’s worse in the mornings. Has this swelling been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Definitely not constant. There are days where I don’t notice it at all, and then other days… well, like today, it’s quite prominent. It doesn’t hurt, which is good, I suppose. It’s more… uncomfortable, and a little worrying, naturally. I'm not sure if anything specific triggers it, honestly. It just… appears.
DOCTOR: Alright, so intermittent swelling around the jawline, more noticeable in the mornings, and not associated with pain. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the swelling?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. No pain, no fever, no… anything else, really. Just the swelling. I haven’t felt unwell otherwise. My appetite is normal, I sleep fine… it’s just this one thing. It’s rather odd, isn’t it? I do sometimes feel a bit… tired, but that’s probably just life, you know? Nothing specific linked to the swelling, I don’t believe.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… that’s a good question. I haven’t had any major illnesses, thankfully. No surgeries, no serious injuries… I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose—chickenpox, measles—but nothing beyond that. I don’t see a doctor often, so there isn’t much to report, really. I do have… a slight allergy to pollen, perhaps? It causes a little sneezing in the spring, but nothing debilitating. That's all I can think of at the moment. It’s rather frustrating, this lack of memory, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history, childhood illnesses only, and a mild pollen allergy. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, I don’t believe so. I don’t take any regular medications. Occasionally, I’ll take something for a headache—paracetamol, I think it’s called—but that’s it. No vitamins, no supplements… I try to eat a healthy diet, so I haven’t felt the need. I might have used some eye drops recently, because my eyes were feeling a bit dry, but that was just a temporary thing. Nothing consistent, definitely.
DOCTOR: Very well. And could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s another area where my memory is a bit hazy, I’m afraid. My parents were both healthy, as far as I know. My mother passed away a few years ago, from… old age, I believe. My father is still living, but I haven’t seen him in quite some time. I don’t recall any major illnesses running in the family—no heart problems, no cancer… but I’m really not certain. I apologize for being so unhelpful; I wish I could provide more information. It’s incredibly frustrating, not knowing these things.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Tomassoni. You’ve provided what you can, and that’s perfectly acceptable. It’s common for details to be unclear. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol—perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally—and I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to live a healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned before. I eat well, I get regular exercise… mostly walking, and a bit of swimming when I can. I work as a speech-language pathologist, so I’m quite active during the day. That’s all, really. I lead a pretty quiet life, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tomassoni. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll primarily focus on your head and neck to assess the swelling and check for any other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni, I’m just going to gently feel around your jawline and neck. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. I do note some mild swelling along your jawline, primarily on the left side. The texture feels… slightly firm, but not particularly hard. Your lymph nodes don't appear to be significantly enlarged, and there's no tenderness upon palpation. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I hope it’s not anything too serious. I’m trying not to worry, but it’s difficult, you know? It’s just… unsettling, not knowing what’s causing this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m just looking for any signs of infection, inflammation, or unusual growths. Your oral mucosa appears normal. No obvious lesions, inflammation, or unusual growths are present. Your salivary glands also seem unremarkable. The swelling appears to be primarily subcutaneous—under the skin—and doesn’t seem to be originating from within your mouth. Okay, everything looks normal, which is reassuring. Now, given your intermittent swelling, the lack of pain, and the normal examination findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to minor fluid retention, a benign lipoma – a fatty deposit under the skin – or even a slightly enlarged submandibular gland, although that usually presents with some discomfort.
PATIENT: That… sounds reasonable, Doctor. Fluid retention… that’s not too worrying, I suppose. A lipoma… is that something serious? And a submandibular gland… you said that usually causes discomfort, so the fact that I don’t have any pain is a good sign, right? It’s just… all of this is a bit overwhelming, to be honest. What do you recommend we do next? Do you think we need any tests? I’m happy to cooperate with whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and it's good you're being proactive. A lipoma is generally harmless, though it can sometimes grow and become cosmetically bothersome. The submandibular gland enlargement is less likely given the absence of pain, as you correctly pointed out. To get a clearer picture, I would recommend a simple ultrasound of the neck. This will allow us to visualize the soft tissues beneath the skin and determine if there’s a fatty deposit, an enlarged gland, or anything else causing the swelling. It's a non-invasive procedure and shouldn't cause any discomfort. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. An ultrasound sounds perfectly reasonable. Non-invasive is good, and I’d certainly feel better knowing what’s going on beneath the skin. When can we schedule that, Doctor? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? I want to be as cooperative as possible and make sure we get accurate results.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I can schedule you for an ultrasound at the imaging center across the street on August 5th at 10:00 AM. No preparation is needed; you can eat and drink normally beforehand. The technician will apply a gel to your neck and then use a handheld device to create images on a screen. The whole process usually takes about 20-30 minutes. After the ultrasound, the radiologist will send me the results, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan if necessary. In the meantime, if the swelling worsens significantly, becomes painful, or is accompanied by fever or difficulty breathing, please contact me immediately. Does that sound acceptable to you, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. August 5th at 10:00 AM works perfectly. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. Knowing what to expect is a great comfort. And I will definitely contact you immediately if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better already.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tomassoni. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Remember, we’re just gathering information at this point, and it’s likely nothing serious. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I’ll see you on August 5th.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Abady. I will. You have a good day as well. And I look forward to seeing you on August 5th.
