DOCTOR: Alright, Lakiya. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is… pain. A lot of it, actually. In my back. It has been… difficult to manage. I would like to get it sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Approximately… three months. It started gradually, but it has worsened significantly in the last month. I work, you see. Fence work. It is… hard on the body.
DOCTOR: Fence work, alright. Three months, gradually worsening, significant increase in the last month. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It is… a deep ache. Mostly in my lower back. Sometimes it shoots down my leg, the right one. It is worse when I bend, or… lift things. Even sitting for too long is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep ache, lower back, radiating down the right leg... worse with bending, lifting, and prolonged sitting. Does anything help relieve the pain at all?
PATIENT: Not much, truthfully. Rest… a little. But I have to work. Warm baths sometimes dull it for a short time, but it always comes back. I have tried some… creams, from the store. They do not seem to do much good either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Rest provides minimal relief, warm baths temporarily help, and over-the-counter creams aren’t effective. Have you noticed any numbness or weakness in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes… tingling in my toes, on that right foot. And occasionally… it feels… heavy. Like it is hard to lift it fully. Not all the time, but it happens. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling and heaviness in the right foot. Good to know. And have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: I… I do not understand. What do you mean? I am sorry, I am not familiar with those terms. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler language?
DOCTOR: Of course. Sorry about that. I just want to make sure we cover everything. Basically, have you noticed any changes when you go to the bathroom – either having trouble going, or any loss of control?
PATIENT: No. No changes at all. Everything is… normal, in that regard. I apologize for my confusion. I am not used to doctors asking about such things. It is… private.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. It's important we ask, but you're right to feel that way. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just… arthritis. My hands, mostly. It is not too bad, mostly just stiffness in the mornings. And… I have Medicare, if that is important. My husband… he passed away a few years ago, and I have been on my own since then. I do not believe I have any other… conditions.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, primarily in the hands. Medicare is good to know. Sorry to hear about your husband. Okay. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I have always been… healthy, until recently. My mother… she said I took after her. Strong bones. But this back pain… it is different. It is… debilitating. I am worried it will prevent me from working.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Let's see… Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones besides the creams you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just… ibuprofen, when the pain is particularly bad. Sometimes two, sometimes three pills. But I try to avoid it, if possible. It does not… agree with my stomach. And… that is all. No other medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed. We'll make a note of that. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just so I can get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll start with your back, and I'll check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… acceptable. I understand you need to examine me. I would like to get this sorted, if possible. Please proceed. I just… hope it does not take too long. I have work to return to.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the table, face up, that would be great. I'll start by gently feeling along your spine to see where the pain is most prominent. Just let me know if anything feels particularly sensitive. Okay...can you tell me where it hurts the most when I press here?
PATIENT: Right… there. Just below my ribs, on the left side. And a little bit lower, on both sides. It is… a dull ache, but it sharpens when you press. It feels… tight, like a muscle is knotted. Yes, right there. That is… quite painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And what about when I ask you to lift your leg like this?
PATIENT: It… hurts. A shooting pain down my leg. I cannot lift it very high. It feels… stuck. And my back… it is aching terribly now. Please… stop. It is too painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, right away. Sorry about that. That's very helpful to know. And when you bend forward, like trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: I… cannot. It is too difficult. It feels like something is blocking me. And the pain… it radiates down my back and into my leg. I feel… stiff, like an old woman. I can barely move. Please, no more bending. It is… unbearable.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. We'll stop there. No need to push it. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you may have a nerve compression in your lower back, likely causing the pain radiating down your leg – what we call sciatica. We need to confirm this with some imaging. I'm going to order an X-ray and an MRI of your lower back. The MRI will give us a better look at the nerves and discs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… That sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have to return to work, you see. I need to know if it will interfere with my schedule. I am not… fond of hospitals. They… remind me of bad times. Is there… anything else I can do in the meantime? Perhaps a stronger pain medication? Something to help me work?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The MRI is non-invasive, it doesn't involve any needles or radiation. You'll lie on a table, and a machine will take pictures of your back. It's a little noisy, but it shouldn’t be painful. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the pain, I can prescribe you a short course of a stronger pain reliever, a muscle relaxant, to help manage the discomfort until we get the MRI results. However, it's important to remember these are temporary solutions, and we need to identify the underlying cause. I’m going to write you a prescription for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine. Naproxen is a stronger anti-inflammatory, and cyclobenzaprine is a muscle relaxant. I'll also give you a referral to a physical therapist, they can teach you exercises to strengthen your back and help with the pain. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds acceptable. Naproxen and cyclobenzaprine, and a referral to a physical therapist. I suppose that is… a good plan. Will the physical therapist… make the pain worse? And how long will it take to get the MRI? I need to know if I can schedule it around my work. I work five days a week. It is… important.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about making the pain worse. A good physical therapist will start you slowly and carefully, tailoring the exercises to your specific needs and pain level. It shouldn't increase your pain, but it might be uncomfortable at first. As for the MRI, it usually takes a few days to get scheduled. I'll have the scheduling department contact you directly to find a time that works with your schedule. I’ll also write a note requesting they prioritize finding a quick appointment due to your work commitments. Okay, I’ve submitted the MRI order and the referral to physical therapy. You should receive a call from both departments within the next 24-48 hours. Now, I want to make sure you're aware of some warning signs. If you experience any weakness in your legs, loss of bladder or bowel control, or severe, unrelenting pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Weakness in my legs… or loss of control… That sounds… frightening. I will remember that. Thank you. No, I believe that is all for now. I just… hope this does not take too long. I need to work. And I need to be able to support myself. Perhaps… if you could just tell me where to pick up the prescriptions? And… thank you for your time. It has been… informative.
DOCTOR: Of course. The prescriptions have been sent electronically to your pharmacy, which I see is Miller’s Pharmacy on Elm Street. They should be ready within a few hours. And you're very welcome. We're here to help. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or if your pain worsens. Here's my card with the clinic's number. I hope you feel better soon. Take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you. I… appreciate your kindness. Goodbye.
