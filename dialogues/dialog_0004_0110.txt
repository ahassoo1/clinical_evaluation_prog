DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. Well, I suppose… I’m feeling a bit… stuck. Like an old engine that needs a good tune-up, you know? I’m 87 years old, and I’ve lived a good life, but I just want to feel a little more… alive. I want a “reset,” as they say. Or a “jumpstart.” Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: "Alive," is a rather broad term, Ms. McNabb. And a “reset” isn’t a medical diagnosis, unfortunately. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. Can you describe what feels stuck?
PATIENT: Oh, you are right, dear. I do ramble. Let me see… it’s not one thing, exactly. My energy isn’t what it used to be, of course. I get tired easily, even with just a little walking. And my memory… well, it’s not as sharp as it once was. Not that I’m forgetful, mind you, but things just don’t… stick like they used to. I used to be very active in the community, volunteering at the school, helping with the church… but lately, I just haven’t had the oomph to do much of anything. Does that make more sense?
DOCTOR: "Oomph," is still rather vague, Ms. McNabb, but marginally better. Fatigue and memory concerns… alright. Let’s start with the fatigue. When did you first notice this decrease in energy?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been a gradual thing, really. Perhaps… six months ago? No, maybe a little longer. Around the holidays, I think. Last Christmas, I found myself needing to sit down much more than usual during the family gatherings. And I wasn’t able to help with the cooking as much as I normally do. My daughter, bless her heart, had to take over most of it. It’s just… not how I’m used to things being.
DOCTOR: And has this fatigue been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes, dear. It's not every single day. Some days I wake up feeling quite alright, and I can manage my usual little chores. But then other days… it just hits me like a wave. I’ll be doing something simple – watering my plants, maybe – and suddenly I feel utterly drained. And it doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing. Even just sitting and reading can exhaust me sometimes. It’s… frustrating, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding this memory… you said things don’t “stick” like they used to. Can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… just last week, my grandson, little Kai, was telling me about a school play he was in. He was so excited, and he told me all about his part, and the costumes, and the other children… and then, five minutes later, I couldn't remember what play it was! He had to tell me all over again. And it wasn’t like I didn’t listen to him, you see? I was paying attention, but it just… slipped away. Little things like that happen more and more often these days. Names, too. I’ll meet someone, and I’ll know I’ve met them before, but the name… it’s just gone.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any difficulty with short-term recall generally?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That’s a good way to put it. It's not so much remembering things from a long time ago – I can still recall my childhood quite vividly, thankfully – but things that happened just recently… those are harder to hold onto. Like, I’ll go to the store, and I’ll make a list, and then I’ll forget half of what I was supposed to buy! Or I’ll start telling a story, and I’ll lose my train of thought mid-sentence. It’s… embarrassing, really. I used to have such a good memory.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I want to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. It’s just a routine check to rule out any obvious underlying causes. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever I can to help. I do hope I’m not too much trouble. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, I confess.
DOCTOR: 149 pounds. And your height is listed as 199 centimeters. Now, if you’ll just step back, we’ll take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138/82. Heart sounds are regular, but a little diminished. Lungs are clear, but slightly reduced breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit sluggish, but within normal limits for your age. Everything appears… unremarkable, physically. But we need to run some blood work to get a clearer picture. I’d like to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and B12 levels.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds… thorough. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem… concerned. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I don’t want anything serious.
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, I am always concerned with my patients’ well-being. However, “concerned” does not equate to “alarmed.” These tests are standard procedure when evaluating fatigue and memory concerns in someone your age. It's simply a matter of ruling things out. We need to see if there’s an underlying medical cause, such as anemia, thyroid dysfunction, or vitamin deficiencies. We’ll also need to discuss your medications and any supplements you’re taking, as well as your family history. Do you have a list of your current medications with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I understand. You're right to be thorough, dear. I just get anxious easily, I suppose. Here you are. It’s a bit messy, my daughter wrote it for me. Just the usual, I think. Blood pressure medication – Lisinopril, I believe – and a little something for my arthritis, Celecoxib. And sometimes, if I’m really hurting, I take Tylenol. Oh, and I take a daily multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. My family… well, my mother had some heart trouble, and my father had… I believe it was Alzheimer’s, yes. It was a long time ago, now.
DOCTOR: Alzheimer’s… alright. That’s pertinent information. This fatigue and memory loss, coupled with your family history, warrants further investigation. We’ll get these blood tests done, and I’ll also need you to fill out a cognitive assessment questionnaire. It’s a series of simple questions to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Depending on the results of these tests, we may need to consider a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. I want to rule out any possibility of early-stage dementia. It’s important to be proactive, Ms. McNabb. The earlier we identify any potential problems, the better we can manage them.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Dementia… That sounds… frightening. I… I hadn’t even considered that. My memory isn’t that bad, is it? I just forget things sometimes, like everyone does. Is it… is it serious? Will I… will I forget my family?
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, please. Let’s not jump to conclusions. I’m simply being thorough, as any responsible physician would be. A cognitive assessment is not a diagnosis. It’s a screening tool. It helps me determine if further evaluation is necessary. And even if it is something more serious, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms and slow the progression. Now, let’s focus on getting these tests done first. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood samples, and then she’ll give you the cognitive assessment questionnaire. After we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. We’ll take this one step at a time, Ms. McNabb. And I assure you, I will do everything I can to provide you with the best possible care.
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. You’re right. One step at a time. It’s just… it’s unsettling to think about. Very well. Let’s get the blood work done. And… and the questionnaire. Whatever you think is best. Thank you, Doctor. For… for being thorough. And for not… not alarming me.
DOCTOR: Good. My nurse will be with you shortly. She’ll explain the process. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try not to worry. And Ms. McNabb, try to get some rest. That is often the best medicine. .
