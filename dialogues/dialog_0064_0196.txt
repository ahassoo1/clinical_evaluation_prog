DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, to be honest. It’s been a while, though. A long while. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tiredness can be very frustrating, especially when it lingers. You said it's been going on for a while… can you tell me a bit more about that draining feeling?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard to explain. It’s not like I did something to be tired, you know? It's just… there. Even when I sleep, I don’t feel rested. Like I haven't slept at all. And I… I used to be able to do so much more. Now, just getting through the day is… something. Is that making sense? I don’t even know if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Janie. It’s very helpful. It sounds incredibly difficult, feeling constantly exhausted even after sleep. And it’s common for things to feel less clear when you’re dealing with ongoing tiredness. Now, let’s try to get a bit more specific. When you say “getting through the day is something,” what activities specifically are becoming difficult?
PATIENT: Oh… well, work, for one. I’m a pharmacy tech, and it’s… hard to concentrate sometimes. Counting pills… remembering things… it takes so much longer now. And then… just the housework. You know, cleaning, cooking… things I used to do without thinking. Now I have to sit down halfway through and… rest. It’s embarrassing, really. I don’t even do much to clean anymore. My daughter helps a lot now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty concentrating at work, particularly with tasks requiring precision and memory, and needing to rest during housework. That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… sometimes I feel a little achy, like I’ve been doing too much, even when I haven’t. And… I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible ones, just… nagging ones. Oh! And I’m always cold. Even in the summer. My daughter keeps telling me to put another sweater on. I don't know… is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Janie. Achiness, headaches, and feeling cold… they can definitely be related. Do these headaches feel like they're all over your head, or are they in a specific spot?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re… mostly in my forehead, I think. And sometimes… in my temples. Not like a pounding headache, just… a pressure. Like a tight band around my head. It comes and goes, really. It’s not constant. Honestly, everything comes and goes. It’s just… this tiredness is always there. It's the one thing that doesn’t go away. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Janie. You're giving me very helpful information. A pressure-like headache in your forehead and temples, coming and going, alongside the persistent tiredness… okay. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. My doctor… he passed away a few years back. And I haven’t really… seen a new one since then. I had… high blood pressure, I think. Years ago. But I was taking pills for it. And… honestly, I can't remember much else. It was a long time ago. My daughter handles most of that stuff now, if I'm being honest. She reminds me to take what I do take. I'm sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely helpful, Janie. It’s perfectly alright that details are fuzzy, especially with a change in doctors. High blood pressure in the past is good to know. And it’s wonderful that your daughter helps you with that. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. No, I really don’t. It was… a little white pill, I think? Or maybe it was pink? I honestly have no idea. Everything is just… a blur. I feel terrible. I should know this stuff, shouldn't I? My daughter would know, but I don’t want to bother her right now. She's busy. I don’t want to keep interrupting her.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Janie. Don’t worry about it. It's very common to forget medication names. We can look it up in your records if possible, or your daughter can let us know when she has a moment. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my wrist when I was younger. A long time ago. Fell off a ladder while picking apples. That needed a cast. And… oh! I had my gallbladder out, I think. Years ago. That was… okay, I think. I don’t really remember a lot about it. It just… happened. I was in the hospital for a few days. That's it, I think. I’m so bad at this. Is this helping you at all? I’m just… drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: You are doing perfectly fine, Janie. Every bit of information is helpful. Broken wrist and gallbladder removal… that’s good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh… my husband… he passed away five years ago. Heart trouble. And I have a daughter, Elena. She’s… wonderful. She lives nearby, thank goodness. My mother… she passed away a long time ago. I don't really… have any other close family. I wasn't close to my siblings, if that makes sense. They lived far away. Is that… relevant? I'm probably just rambling again. I just want to know what's wrong with me. This tiredness… it's just ruining everything.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Janie. You're not rambling. It's perfectly normal to want answers, and I understand your frustration. Knowing about your husband and daughter is helpful. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Now, before we move on, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I don’t think so. I used to have hay fever when I was a kid, but I haven't had that in years. No known drug allergies, I don’t think. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, that I remember. Maybe a little… indigestion sometimes, but that's not an allergy, is it? I'm sorry, I feel like I'm just… useless at this. I can't remember anything! I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are not useless at all, Janie. It's perfectly alright to not remember everything. It sounds like you don’t have any known allergies, and that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I take… a little pill for my blood pressure. Elena makes sure I take it every morning. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my headaches, if they’re really bad. That’s about it, I think. No vitamins or anything fancy. I used to take something for my arthritis, but I stopped taking that a long time ago. It didn’t really seem to help. Elena would know for sure. She keeps track of everything. Honestly, I’m a mess. Is it okay if we just… stop now? I’m so tired. I’m getting confused.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janie. It’s perfectly alright. You seem quite tired, and it’s important that you don’t feel overwhelmed. We've covered a good amount of information. To summarize, you've been experiencing persistent tiredness, with associated achiness, headaches, and feeling cold. You have a history of high blood pressure, a broken wrist, and gallbladder removal. You're currently taking a blood pressure pill and ibuprofen as needed. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're up to it. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your thyroid, and taking your blood pressure. Then, I'd like to order some blood tests to help us figure out what might be causing your tiredness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I guess so. If you think it will help. But please don’t take too much blood. I don’t like needles. And… please hurry. I really just want to go home and rest. I'm so tired. Just… please be quick. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janie. I understand. We’ll take it very slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. We won't take a lot of blood, just enough for the tests. First, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Finally, I'm going to gently feel your thyroid gland. It feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly. Now, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a basic metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. These tests will help us rule out several possibilities and get a better understanding of what might be causing your tiredness. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Oh… um… vitamin D? Is that… important? I don't go out in the sun much. I don’t like it. And… will the blood tests hurt? I really hate needles. Elena said they have to take a lot of blood now. Is that true? I don't understand all this… I just want to know what's wrong with me, so I can get better and go home. Is it going to be a long wait? I'm so tired…
DOCTOR: That's a very good question about vitamin D, Janie. It’s important because it plays a role in energy levels and overall health. Many people are deficient, especially if they don’t get much sun exposure. As for the blood tests, they will involve a small amount of blood being drawn. It's a quick pinch, and it doesn’t usually hurt much. Elena may be exaggerating a bit about the amount—it’s typically a few small tubes. It’s standard procedure to check a few different things when investigating tiredness. The lab should be able to process the tests fairly quickly, and the results usually come back within a few days. I’ll have my assistant call you as soon as we have them. Now, while we wait for the results, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy diet. It might also be helpful to keep a log of your symptoms—when you're most tired, what activities make it worse, and if anything seems to help. Would you like me to give you a handout with some general tips for managing fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh… um… a handout would be nice, I guess. If it’s not too much trouble. But please don’t make me read too much. I get… confused easily. And… thank you, Doctor. For trying to help. I just… I just want to feel normal again. I’m so tired. Can I go home now? I just want to rest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janie. You've been very brave today, and I understand your exhaustion. Here's a simple handout with some tips for managing fatigue. Just a few basic ideas. Don't feel pressured to read it all at once. My assistant will be right in to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your lab results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—especially chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe weakness—please go to the emergency room immediately. Let's get you checked out and on your way home. You take care now, and remember to get plenty of rest. .
