DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Doctor Billman, right? I need… evaluation. For… referee. And maybe coach. Fitness, you know? They want me to get check-up first.
DOCTOR: Referee and coach, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Basketball. High school. I… did this before. But… things change. I want to make sure I’m okay. Still strong enough. It's… important. For the kids.
DOCTOR: Right. Important. Okay. So, let's start with the basics. Have you been experiencing any new symptoms lately?
PATIENT: New… symptoms? Like… sick? No. Not really. Just… get tired faster, maybe. When I run. A little bit of pain in my… knee. But old pain. From… long time ago. Nothing new, I think.
DOCTOR: "Tired faster, old knee pain." Okay. And when you say tired faster... how would you describe that?
PATIENT: Um… before, I could run up and down the court… many times. Now… I need to stop. To breathe. More often. It’s not… bad pain. Just… need more rest. It’s… hard to explain. I’m not… young anymore. You know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're recognizing changes. Let's get a bit more specific. On a scale of one to ten, with one being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you rate that knee pain when you're running?
PATIENT: Uh… one to ten… Hmm. When I really push it… maybe a… four? Five? It’s not… constant. Only when I move fast. Most of time, it’s… nothing. Just a little… ache. It's not stopping me, but… I worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling or stiffness in that knee?
PATIENT: No. No swelling. Sometimes… a little bit stiff in the morning. But after I walk around… it’s okay. It’s… normal, right? Old man problems. Sorry. I… I don’t want to take up your time.
DOCTOR: It's not about taking up my time, Mr. Shanor. It's about getting a clear picture of what’s going on. "Stiffness in the morning, resolves with activity." Okay. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. No diabetes. Doctor checked me last year… everything okay. Blood pressure… sometimes a little high. But the doctor said… watch the salt. That's it. I try to eat healthy. Mostly. My wife… she liked to cook. Now… it’s just me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything, even over-the-counter stuff?
PATIENT: Uh… just… pain reliever. Sometimes. For the knee. When it really hurts. Ibuprofen. And… vitamins. Multivitamins. Old man stuff, again. That's all. I don't like to take too much medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, multivitamins. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries. Never been in hospital. Knock on wood. Just… a few broken bones when I was young. Playing basketball, of course. Nothing serious. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My… family? My wife… she passed away two years ago. Heart… problems. I don’t have… children. My parents… they are gone now, too. It’s… just me. I don't know what you want to know. Sorry. I’m not good at this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Shanor. It’s alright. We just need a little information, if you’re comfortable sharing. Did your parents or wife have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: My wife… she had high blood pressure. And… cholesterol. She took medicine for it. My father… he smoked a lot. Lung problems, I think. But he never went to the doctor much. My mother… she was healthy, mostly. Just… old age. Is this… important?
DOCTOR: It helps us get a better picture, Mr. Shanor. Alright. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. Never liked it. I drink… sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner. Maybe two. Not every day. And… no drugs. Never. I’m a referee. I need to be… clear-headed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, what do you do for work?
PATIENT: I… repair things. For factories. Refractory materials. Bricks. Things get hot. I fix them. It’s… hard work. Lots of bending and… lifting. It's… what I do. It's a job.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Shanor. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Whatever you need. I… want to get this done. Quickly, if possible. I have to… get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Heart rate is 78 and regular. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. Lungs are clear bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… bad? The blood pressure? I… I worry about that. My wife… she had trouble with that.
DOCTOR: It's slightly elevated, Mr. Shanor, but we can address that. It's not an emergency, but something we'll need to monitor. Now, let's check your knee. Can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here. When I bend it. And when I… twist it. It’s… a dull pain. Not sharp. It’s… annoying more than anything.
DOCTOR: There’s some tenderness to palpation along the medial joint line, and a mild range of motion limitation with flexion and extension. No obvious swelling or warmth. I'm also going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs.
PATIENT: Okay. Ouch. That spot… that’s where it hurts. A little bit.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups. There’s some discomfort with resisted medial rotation of the knee. Alright, Mr. Shanor. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have some mild osteoarthritis in your right knee, possibly with a slight medial meniscus tear. However, we need to confirm that with some imaging.
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis? A tear? Is that… bad? Will I have to… stop refereeing? I just want to be sure I can still do my job. That's all.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Shanor. Many people have mild osteoarthritis as they get older. It doesn’t automatically mean you have to stop doing the things you enjoy. The meniscus tear, if present, could be contributing to the pain and discomfort. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an X-ray of your right knee to assess the joint space and look for any bone spurs. An MRI might be necessary if the pain persists after initial treatment to evaluate the meniscus more closely. We’ll start with the X-ray. In the meantime, I recommend rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Physical therapy could also be beneficial to strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your range of motion.
PATIENT: Okay. X-ray… and maybe… MRI. I… I don't like the sound of that. It's expensive, right? And… time-consuming. I just want to get back to work. And… refereeing. Is there… anything else I can do? Before… all that? Just to… see if it gets better?
DOCTOR: Well, you could continue with rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers for a week or two. However, without a proper diagnosis, we’re just treating symptoms, not the underlying problem. That’s not ideal. If the pain doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse, it's important to get it checked out. Ignoring it could lead to further damage. I’ll write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory, if you’d like. But understand, that’s just a temporary solution. The X-ray will give us the information we need to create a more effective long-term plan. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… the X-ray. And… the prescription. I… I guess that's what I have to do. Can I… get it done here? At the clinic? Or do I have to go somewhere else? I don't have a lot of time. I need to get back to work, you know? And… I need to get ready for the season. .
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do the X-ray here at the clinic. I’ll have my nurse schedule it for you. We'll review the results as soon as they come in, and then discuss the next steps. The nurse will also give you the prescription for the anti-inflammatory. Now, I’m going to give you some written instructions about RICE – Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. It’s a good idea to follow those guidelines while you're waiting for the X-ray results. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
