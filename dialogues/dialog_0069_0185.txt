DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time for chatting. It's my breath, okay? It smells bad. Really bad. My ex-husband definitely noticed, and frankly, it's embarrassing. Can we just...fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's definitely frustrating when something like that is causing you concern, and you’re right, let’s focus on getting it sorted out. “Bad breath,” or halitosis, can have a lot of causes, some very simple, some that need a bit more investigation. To help me figure out what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, "investigation." Seriously? I brush my teeth. Sometimes twice a day. And I floss… when I remember. Is that not enough? It just…stinks. Especially in the morning, but honestly, it's pretty much all the time now. What kind of "investigation" are we talking about here? This is a waste of my Saturday.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I made it sound more complicated than it needs to be. It's just that I want to be thorough. Brushing and flossing are a great start, absolutely. It sounds like you’re doing the basics. When you say it's "pretty much all the time now", has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually getting worse?
PATIENT: Gradually, I guess. It wasn't always like this. Maybe...the last few months? It's hard to say exactly. Things have been…busy. And stressful. Look, does it matter why it started? Can't you just give me something to mask it? Like, mouthwash or something? I really don't need a life story session here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can certainly discuss options to help with the odor itself, but I still want to quickly rule out anything that might be causing it, so we address the root of the problem, if there is one. It’s good that it wasn’t sudden, that gives us a little more to work with. Besides the odor itself, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…feeling sick? No. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Look, I work on the highway, okay? It's not exactly a glamorous job. Maybe it’s just…the air? Or the food I eat? I grab whatever's fast when I'm on break. I don’t have time to be making salads. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, thank you. Working on the highway could contribute to it, and fast food can sometimes play a role as well. Just to be thorough, let me ask a few quick questions. Have you noticed any dry mouth?
PATIENT: Dry mouth? Sometimes, I guess. When I'm really focused on driving, I forget to drink water. It's hot out there, obviously. Is that a problem? Seriously, is everything a problem? I just want this fixed. Can we get to the fix already? I've got things to do. And honestly, this chair isn't very comfortable.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the uncomfortable chair, and I understand your frustration. We are getting closer to a solution. Dry mouth can definitely contribute to bad breath, so that's good information to have. One last quick question, and then we can move on to some potential remedies. Have you noticed any changes in your gums - like redness, swelling, or bleeding when you brush or floss?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. No. My gums look…fine. Normal. I don’t know. I don’t stare at my gums. Look, are you going to ask me about my whole life now? This is ridiculous. Just give me something to get rid of the smell. I’ll buy whatever’s strongest. What do you recommend? And how long is this going to take? I've got a landscaping appointment at 2.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, no life story required, I promise. It sounds like we’ve covered the basics, and thankfully, you haven’t mentioned anything that points to a serious underlying issue. Since you’ve already mentioned brushing and flossing, we can try a few things to supplement that. I recommend a tongue scraper, as bacteria often accumulate on the tongue. Also, a mouthwash containing chlorine dioxide can be very effective at neutralizing odor-causing compounds. Avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes, as they can dry out your mouth and worsen the problem. Let's start with those two things – the tongue scraper and a chlorine dioxide mouthwash – and increase your water intake throughout the day. We can also discuss a few over-the-counter dry mouth sprays if that continues to be an issue. Would you like me to write you a quick prescription for a chlorine dioxide mouthwash, or would you prefer to get one over the counter?
PATIENT: Over the counter is fine. I don't need a prescription. Honestly, the less time I spend here, the better. Just tell me where I can find it. And how much does all this…stuff cost? I'm not made of money. This job doesn’t pay that well, you know. And where can I get a tongue scraper? Is it like, at the drugstore? Look, just give me the simplest possible instructions and the cheapest options. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can find both chlorine dioxide mouthwash and tongue scrapers at most drugstores – Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, even Walmart or Target. The mouthwash will typically cost between $5 and $10, depending on the brand and size. Tongue scrapers are very inexpensive, usually around $3 to $5. For the mouthwash, look for brands like TheraBreath or Closys. As for the scraper, any basic plastic scraper will do. To summarize: scrape your tongue gently morning and night, rinse with a chlorine dioxide mouthwash twice a day, and drink plenty of water. If the problem doesn't improve after a week or two, or if it gets worse, please come back and see me, and we can investigate further. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…okay. Manageable. Fine. Scrape, rinse, drink. I can do that. Look, thanks, I guess. I’ve got to go. I don't want to be late for my appointment. And honestly, I really need some fresh air.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zelina. I’m glad we could come up with a plan. Don't hesitate to come back if you have any concerns or if things don’t improve. Have a good day, and I hope you enjoy some fresh air!
