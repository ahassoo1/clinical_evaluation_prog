DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s August 2nd, and I see you’re 53 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brendan. Well, it’s this itching, really. It’s just… everywhere, and it’s been going on for a little while now. Not terrible, but enough to be annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Itching can be very disruptive. “A little while now…” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, maybe six weeks ago? Started on my arms, then spread to my back and legs. It comes and goes, but it's pretty consistent now. Not like a rash, more just… a constant need to scratch. I don’t remember doing anything different, haven’t used any new soaps or lotions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks, starting on the arms and spreading. No new soaps or lotions… that's helpful to know. Is the itching worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I don't think so, really. It doesn’t seem to be worse at night, or after I’ve been working. I work dispatch, you see – mostly sitting. Maybe a little more noticeable when I'm stressed, but honestly, that job is always stressful. It's hard to tell if that's the itching, or just me being… well, agitated.
DOCTOR: Alright, dispatch work… definitely a stressful environment. It’s good you’re recognizing that as a potential factor. Aside from the itching, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no fatigue… no bumps or anything like a rash, as I said. Skin feels normal, just… itchy. I haven’t lost any weight, and my appetite’s been fine. Honestly, Doctor, if it wasn’t so bothersome, I probably wouldn’t have come in. It’s just… persistent. And a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms. That’s good information. Now, let’s go over some general health questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I take a low-dose aspirin, that’s it. Doctor recommended it years ago, just as a preventative thing. Otherwise, pretty healthy. I try to eat well, though sometimes with my schedule, it’s hard to get a good meal. My wife… well, she always took care of that. Sorry. Getting off topic.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize. It’s okay. Aspirin, just as a preventative. And you said your wife usually handles meals. That's good to know. Now, have you had any serious medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe twenty years ago? I was in the hospital for a few days. And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. Other than that, nothing major. Regular checkups, blood pressure’s usually a little high but manageable, that’s about it. I haven’t seen a specialist in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia, appendectomy. Blood pressure a bit high, but manageable. And no recent specialist visits. Have you had any surgeries other than those?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix and the pneumonia treatment, which wasn't a surgery, really. I had a sports injury years ago – a torn ligament in my knee – but that was just physical therapy. Nothing else. I’m pretty lucky, actually. Never been a sickly person. This itching is just… strange. It feels new.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries or significant medical history. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated. My mother had heart trouble, passed away when I was in my thirties. My father had diabetes, later in life. My sister… she had some kind of autoimmune thing, I think. Rheumatoid arthritis maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. On my wife's side… her mother had osteoporosis. I don't really know much beyond that, honestly. We never talked about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, autoimmune condition in your sister, and osteoporosis in your wife's mother. That gives us something to work with. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work… a lot. Dispatch is shift work, so my hours are all over the place. I try to get some exercise when I can, mostly walking. I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. I live alone now, as I mentioned. Quiet life, mostly. I keep busy with work, and… try to take care of things around the house. It's not much, but it's my life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for being so open with me, Brendan. That gives me a good overview of your health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your vital signs. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat here. I’m going to start by taking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll take a closer look at your skin. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, could you please loosen your shirt so I can examine your skin?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. It's been a little high lately, the blood pressure. Probably the stress, to be honest. I try to manage it, but… it's hard sometimes. Go ahead, Doctor. Take your time. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan, your skin appears normal in terms of color and texture. I don’t see any evidence of rash, lesions, or anything visually concerning. There’s no obvious sign of eczema or psoriasis. There is some mild dryness, but it’s not significant. Heart sounds are regular, although slightly stronger than normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I’m going to gently scratch your skin in a few areas to see if it triggers any hives. Does that feel itchy, or cause any burning or stinging?
PATIENT: A little… yes, that’s a bit itchy. Not terrible, but noticeable. It's like… a normal itch, not a painful one. Just… irritating. It’s hard to explain. It’s like the scratching brings up the itching, rather than causing it. Does that mean something? I’m not very good with medical stuff, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. A positive dermatographia suggests your skin is sensitive to pressure. It's not uncommon, and often harmless. However, in your case, given the persistent itching without any visual signs, and the positive dermatographia, I suspect we are dealing with a form of chronic idiopathic urticaria, possibly exacerbated by stress. Essentially, it means a long-lasting, unexplained itch. We need to rule out other causes first though. I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test, just to get a baseline and make sure everything else is normal. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and hopefully get some relief. I’m happy to have the tests done. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for them? Fasting? Anything like that?
DOCTOR: Fortunately, no special preparation is needed for these tests. You can eat and drink normally. The blood draw can be done at the lab just down the hall. They'll give you instructions when you go. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, and avoiding any harsh soaps or detergents. To manage the itching itself, an over-the-counter antihistamine like cetirizine or loratadine might provide some relief. I wouldn’t recommend long-term use without discussing it with me first, though. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Moisturizer, and the antihistamines… I’ll try that. Cetirizine, you said? I think I’ve seen that in the store. And I’ll get the blood work done right away. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better, just knowing we’re looking into it. It’s been… unsettling, not knowing what was causing it. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. I understand your concern, and I’m glad I could offer some reassurance. The lab results should be available in a few days. My nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re in. In the meantime, if the itching gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, hives, or difficulty breathing, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Here’s a copy of the lab order, and a brief summary of our discussion, including the medications we discussed. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Everything’s pretty clear. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. I appreciate your help. I’ll see you in a few days, then. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care.
