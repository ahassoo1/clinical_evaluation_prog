DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Gorga. It's...family history, really. My mother's side, specifically. There's a lot of…problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And cancer. It’s just…I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Before anything happens. It’s probably nothing, but it’s always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history...heart stuff and cancer. Right. That’s…sensible to get checked out. Just to be sure. Hmm. Let’s start with the heart issues. Can you tell me a little more about what kind of heart problems your mother or other relatives had?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t know the specifics. My mother didn’t really…talk about it. She just said “heart trouble.” And my grandmother…well, she passed when I was pretty young. I just remember everyone being sad and saying it was her heart. It wasn’t like detailed medical discussions, if that makes sense. Everyone just kind of...avoided the topic.
DOCTOR: Okay, vague family history of heart issues…that’s…helpful to know, even if it’s not detailed. We can work with that. And the cancer?
PATIENT: It's…more specific on the cancer side. My aunt, on my mother’s side, had breast cancer. She…didn’t make it. And then my cousin, her daughter, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer a few years ago. She’s…still fighting it, I think. It’s just…a lot, you know? Everyone’s always worried about getting “the same thing.” It feels…inevitable, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, aunt with breast cancer, cousin with ovarian cancer… That is a lot, and understandably concerning. Alright. And just to get a full picture, do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions currently?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And…no, nothing currently. I'm…relatively healthy, I think. I mean, I try to be. I eat okay, I exercise when I can…I’m not exactly a marathon runner, but I’m not completely sedentary either. I just…worry. A lot. It doesn't feel like enough, you know? Just trying to be healthy when there’s…all of this hanging over me.
DOCTOR: Right, preventative measures. Good. Okay. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had anything like that. I…broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. Just a cast, nothing major. I’m not really the type to…end up in the hospital, generally. Which is probably why I’m here now – trying to prevent anything from happening. It feels silly, honestly. Like I’m just being paranoid. But my ex-wife…she always said I worried too much. Which…was probably true.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, just a childhood broken arm. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I specifically avoid taking pills if I can help it. I just…don’t trust them, I guess. Even over-the-counter stuff, I try to avoid it. My grandmother…she was always on medication, and it never seemed to help her much. So, I’ve always been a little wary of it, if that makes sense. Prefer to just…deal with things, if I can.
DOCTOR: No medications. Alright. Okay. And, just to finish up the background, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t even like the smell of cigarettes. And alcohol…I had a bad experience with it in college. Not worth it. And recreational drugs? Never even considered it. I’m…pretty straight-laced, actually. My ex-wife used to say I was boring. Which, again, probably true. I just…don't have any of those habits. It’s another thing I guess, trying to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. No allergies, no medications, no surgeries, no unhealthy habits… That’s all good. Given your family history, though, and your concerns, I think it’s prudent to do a basic physical exam and some blood work. Just to get a baseline and see where we’re at. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…sensible. I mean, I was expecting something like that. It's just…the thought of finding something wrong…it's unsettling. But I guess it’s better to know, right? Blood work and a physical…okay. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And what will the physical involve? I…I’m not a fan of doctors, if I’m being honest. It’s just…a little nerve-wracking.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. We'll start with a complete blood count – CBC – to check your overall health. Then, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, given the heart history. And finally, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. It’s standard stuff. As for the physical, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, feel your abdomen, and a quick neurological exam—reflexes, balance, that sort of thing. It’s not invasive at all. We’ll start with your blood pressure, if that’s okay?
PATIENT: Okay…that doesn’t sound too bad. Blood pressure first…yes, that’s fine. Just…try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind? I get a little…claustrophobic in medical settings. It’s silly, I know. But…it’s just a little unsettling being poked and prodded, you know? And…will I get results right away? Or will I have to wait? I…I don't do well with waiting. It just makes the worrying worse.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. We'll be as quick as possible. Blood pressure cuff…just a little squeeze. And the results will take a few days, unfortunately. The lab needs time to process everything. But I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they're in. We can discuss them then. Just relax, deep breaths.
PATIENT: Okay…deep breaths. Right. This is…fine. Just a little tight. How long will it take? I…I really don’t like being confined, even for a few minutes. It’s a ridiculous phobia, I know, but…it’s just a little unsettling. Just tell me when it’s over. Please.
DOCTOR: Just a few more seconds... 130 over 80. Okay, that’s…slightly elevated, but not alarming. It can fluctuate with anxiety, actually. Alright, all done. See?
PATIENT: Slightly elevated…that’s…not good, is it? I mean, I knew it. I just knew something was wrong. It’s probably my heart. It always feels like it’s racing, even when I’m just sitting still. So, what does that mean? Do I need…tests? Medication? I really don’t want medication. Is it serious? Just…tell me straight. I can handle it. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot, let’s not jump to conclusions. Slightly elevated blood pressure is common, especially in a clinical setting. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We'll need to repeat it at a later date, and then look at the overall picture. As for the racing heart, that could be anxiety, as well. But, to be thorough, I think an EKG would be a good idea—just to check the electrical activity of your heart. And a basic cholesterol panel, given the family history. That’s all, for now. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: An EKG…and more blood work. Of course. It’s always something. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just…try to be quick about it. And…explain everything, okay? I don’t want any surprises. I…I really don’t like surprises. Especially when it comes to my health. It’s just…a lot to process, you know? And the waiting…it’s going to be awful.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. I will explain everything, step by step. The EKG is quick and painless - just some stickers on your chest. The nurse will get you set up right away. Then we'll draw a little more blood for the cholesterol panel. It’ll be over before you know it. Let me have the nurse come in and get started. It’s a standard procedure, Mr. Theriot. We're just being thorough.
PATIENT: Alright. Thorough…yes. That’s what my ex-wife always said I needed to be. Thorough. Just…please don’t find anything too bad. I…I don’t think I could handle it. It's silly, I know, but…that’s just how I feel.
