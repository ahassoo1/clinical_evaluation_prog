DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. Things just… come and go, you know? My hearing, mostly. And I get really dizzy sometimes. It’s been happening on and off for a while now. My daughter, she was the one who said I should come in. She worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, “things come and go,” I understand. Let’s try to get a little more specific. You mentioned your hearing and dizziness. How long has this been going on for – roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. Seems like… years, maybe? It’s not constant, you see. Weeks where I don't even notice, and then suddenly… whoosh. Everything spins and I can barely hear a thing. It’s hard to keep track when it’s not always happening. My husband, bless him… he used to help me remember these things.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds frustrating when it comes and goes like that. And I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Let's focus on what’s happening now. When you say “whoosh,” can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, imagine spinning around and then stopping really fast. That feeling in your tummy? It's like that, but in my head. And everything gets quiet, muffled. Like someone turned down the volume. It usually lasts a few hours, maybe half a day. Sometimes I can’t even stand up without falling over. It's scary when it happens, especially when I’m alone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a spinning sensation, muffled hearing, and sometimes difficulty standing. Does anything seem to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, really. I mean, I don’t do anything different when it happens. Sometimes it seems to come out of nowhere. My daughter thinks it might be stress, but I don’t feel particularly stressed. I try to take things easy. Maybe… maybe when I’m tired? But everyone gets tired, don’t they?
DOCTOR: That’s good to consider. Okay, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the dizziness and hearing issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, sometimes I feel a bit… off-balance, even when I’m not having a full-blown episode. Just a little wobbly, you know? And I've been getting headaches, but I get those anyway. Old age, I suppose. Nothing too serious, I wouldn't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some ongoing unsteadiness and headaches in addition to the episodes. Now, have you ever had any problems with your ears, like infections or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… yes, sometimes. A little bit of a hum in my ears, mostly when it’s quiet. It doesn't bother me too much. And I think I had ear infections as a child, but a long, long time ago. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. My mother always took care of things like that. I just hope it's nothing serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history in general?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tricky one. I’ve been to doctors, of course, over the years. But… honestly, I don’t remember all the details. I have Medicare, so they keep track of things, I suppose. I know I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago. And… my daughter says I have high blood pressure, but I don't feel any different.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and high blood pressure according to your daughter. I can certainly look through your records to get more details. Do you mind if I take a quick look?
PATIENT: No, no, not at all. Please do. Honestly, the more information the better. I just… things don’t stick like they used to. It’s embarrassing, really. I just want to feel normal again, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, it looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension about five years ago, and it’s been managed with medication – Lisinopril, 20mg daily. You also have a history of cholecystectomy, as you mentioned. There are some notes about occasional tinnitus, and… ah, yes, here’s a record of a fall about a year ago, with no significant injuries reported. Do you remember that fall?
PATIENT: Oh, the fall… yes, vaguely. I was walking in the garden, and just… stumbled. It was a silly thing, really. Nothing broken, thank goodness. My daughter fussed over me for weeks afterwards. She said I needed to be more careful. I think I just lost my balance. These little wobbles… they happen sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm... I don’t think I have any allergies. I’ve never been one for hay fever or anything like that. I eat pretty much everything. Though, now that I think about it, sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I use certain soaps. But I just figured it was dry skin.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Just the one, I think. Unless... oh! I take a little something for my arthritis sometimes, when my hands are really bothering me. It's just over-the-counter, though. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. I don't take it every day, just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so Lisinopril daily, and ibuprofen as needed. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your balance, and look in your ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I'm not very good with medical things, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, but that's not entirely unexpected given your history. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your ears look relatively normal – there's a little bit of wax buildup, but nothing significant. Now, when I asked you to walk, I did notice a slight unsteadiness. You also had some difficulty with quick changes in direction. Can you tell me if that's something you experience regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s… that’s just how I feel most of the time, I suppose. A little wobbly, a little off-balance. It's hard to explain. It's not terrible, but it makes me nervous. I don't like feeling like I'm going to fall. I try to be careful, but… sometimes it just happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms of dizziness, unsteadiness, and history of hypertension, I suspect we may be dealing with a few things happening at once. It's possible your blood pressure is contributing to the dizziness. The unsteadiness could be related to something called vestibular dysfunction – that's a problem with the inner ear that affects balance. And the tinnitus could also be related to that. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some further testing. I think a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count would be helpful. Also, an audiogram to assess your hearing, and a VNG test – that's a video nystagmography – to evaluate your inner ear balance function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many tests… Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? I just hope it's not something too serious. What does the VNG test involve? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned about all the tests, Ms. Mayhugh. The VNG test is not painful at all. It involves wearing some goggles and having sensors placed on your head and neck. We’ll measure your eye movements while you’re in different positions. It helps us see how your inner ear is functioning. It takes about an hour. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend we keep a close eye on your blood pressure. I’m going to ask you to monitor it at home, twice a day, and write down the readings. And I want you to continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed. I’ll have the nurse schedule these tests for you. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… not too bad. Twice a day, that’s alright. I can manage that. I think… I think that’s everything. Just… when will I get the results? I don’t want to wait too long. And… will you explain them to me? I’m not very good with medical jargon, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. We’ll get the results back within a week or so. And of course, I’ll explain everything to you in plain language. I want to make sure you understand what’s going on and what our options are. I’ll also give you a handout with some information about managing your blood pressure and what to expect during the tests. Do you have any concerns about your current medication or experiencing any side effects?
PATIENT: No, no side effects, not that I've noticed. My daughter always reminds me to take it, and I do. She’s very good like that. I just wish my husband was here… he always knew what to ask. But… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It was my pleasure. And I understand how difficult things can be. I will do my best to help you get to the bottom of this. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule your tests and give you the handout. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Mayhugh.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
