DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I keep getting… flushed. Like, red face, hot. It happens sometimes, not all the time. It's been going on for a couple weeks now, I think. Maybe a little longer. Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Flushing – a sensation of redness and warmth, happening intermittently over the past few weeks. That gives us a starting point. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe a typical episode of flushing?
PATIENT: Well… it just comes on. I'm talking, or maybe walking, and suddenly my face feels warm. Then it gets red. Not just my cheeks, but my whole face, sometimes even my neck. It doesn’t hurt, it just… feels hot. It usually goes away after a few minutes, maybe ten minutes. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy when it happens, but not always. It’s just… uncomfortable. I don’t know what makes it happen. It doesn’t seem to be anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it comes on suddenly during activity or conversation, affects your whole face and sometimes your neck, lasts a few minutes, and is occasionally accompanied by dizziness. And you haven't been able to identify any specific triggers?
PATIENT: That’s right. No triggers that I can see. I thought maybe spicy food, but I eat spicy food all the time. And I drink tea, lots of tea. It doesn't seem to be related to that either. I don't drink alcohol, not since… well, a long time ago. It just happens. Very strange. It makes me worry a little, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. It’s good you’re paying attention to this. To help me rule out different possibilities, let's go through a little bit more of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Doctor said I was healthy as a horse, last time I went. That was… before my wife passed. Maybe five years ago? I haven’t been to a doctor since then, really. I mostly just try to stay active, eat okay. I used to work a lot outside, but now I mostly do counseling work, sitting down. It's… less physical. No high blood pressure or anything. I don’t feel sick, just this flushing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were last seen by a doctor about five years ago and were told you were in good health. Your work has become less physically demanding recently. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. My wife… she had some problems, a long time ago, but I haven’t. Just the usual colds, maybe a bad flu now and then. Nothing serious. I always thought I was a pretty healthy guy. That's why this flushing is so… odd. It's not like me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… well, my parents are gone now. They lived in India most of their lives. I came here a long time ago. They… they had normal problems, I guess. High blood pressure, maybe? My sister, she has some trouble with her heart, I think. She lives far away, we don’t talk much. But I don’t think anyone else had this… flushing thing. It doesn't seem to run in the family. Mostly just… old age problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I can eat anything. I take no medicine, not regularly. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that's it. I always try to avoid medicine if I can. Makes me feel worse sometimes. No, no allergies at all. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, to complete the picture, could you tell me about your current medications, if any, and about your lifestyle – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Like I said, I don't take any medicine regularly. Just sometimes for a headache. And I don't drink alcohol. Not since… a long time ago. And I never touch drugs. Never have. I used to smoke, when I was younger, but I quit a long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago? I’m a pretty clean liver, Doctor. Honestly. I eat mostly vegetables, and try to get some exercise when I can. Mostly just walking. It's… a simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe, that gives me a good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your face and neck. It will just be a brief exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I'm not good with… poking and prodding, but I'll try to be still. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear. I don’t see any rashes or obvious abnormalities on your skin. I’m going to palpate your neck to check your thyroid and feel for any enlarged lymph nodes. Thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. No enlarged lymph nodes. Okay, everything seems normal on the physical exam, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll need to monitor. Now, to investigate this flushing further, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Blood tests. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Yes, that's fine. I don't mind the needles, not really. I just hope it’s not… something serious. What kind of things are you looking for? Do you need a list of my medicines? I told you, I don’t take much. But yes, go ahead with the tests. Let's find out what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll check a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and thyroid hormone levels. We'll also check your vitamin D levels. Those are good starting points. As for medications, you’ve already mentioned you don't take much, which is helpful. No need for a list at this point. The lab is just down the hall. They'll need a small blood sample. It should take about 10-15 minutes. While we're waiting for the results, are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing, even if they seem unrelated?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I'll go do that. Ten minutes, that's not bad. Let me think… unrelated symptoms… Well, I’ve been a little… forgetful lately. Nothing major, but I misplace things more easily. And sometimes I feel a bit… down. Just sad, I guess. It's probably just because I miss my wife. It's been a few years, but… it still gets to me. And… oh! My sleep isn’t very good. I wake up a lot during the night. Not every night, but often. I thought it was just getting older, honestly. Nothing that bothers me too much. Do you think that’s related to the flushing?
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Mr. Withycombe. Forgetfulness, feeling down, and difficulty sleeping. It's good you brought those up. It’s certainly possible those symptoms are related to the flushing, or they could be independent issues. The blood tests will give us some clues, and we can discuss them further when we have the results. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. I'll let you head down to the lab, and then we’ll go over the results together as soon as they’re available. Do you know how to get to the lab from here?
PATIENT: Yes, the nurse pointed me in the right direction. Down the hall and to the left, I think. I’ll go do that now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. I just want to feel like myself again, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. We’ll do our best to figure this out, Mr. Withycombe. Please, take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask the lab technician if you have any questions. I'll see you shortly.
