DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I'm Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh…coughin’. Been coughin’ a bit. And…there was some stuff. Red stuff. When I coughed. It…worried me. I smoke, you know. Always have. Don't remember exactly when it started, though. Just…happened.
DOCTOR: Okay. Coughing… and you mentioned some red… sputum?
PATIENT: Sputum? Is that…the stuff I coughed up? Yeah, that. Red stuff. Not a lot, but enough to…notice. It's just…I don’t want it to be somethin’ bad. I gotta get back to work, too. Dispatchin’ needs me.
DOCTOR: Right, dispatching. And you said you smoke?
PATIENT: Yeah. A long time. Since I was…young. Don’t rightly remember how many packs a day now. It was a lot, back then. Still is, I guess. Look, is this gonna take long? I got calls comin’ in. They can cover, but…not for too long.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be quick. Just need a bit more information to get a sense of what's going on. Have you had any fever, chills, or shortness of breath with the cough?
PATIENT: Fever…maybe. I get warm sometimes. Hard to tell if it's the cough, or just the weather. We had a hot spell. Chills…no, not really. Shortness of breath…sometimes, when I walk up the hill to the store. But I'm not a young man anymore, you know? Always been a little winded. Is that…bad? I don't remember feelin' sick sick. Just…a cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm feeling, possibly related to the weather, some shortness of breath with exertion... Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Hard to say. I eat…when I can. Work keeps me busy. Don't really keep track of things like that. My clothes fit the same, I think. Maybe a little looser…but that could be the heat, too. Everything shrinks in this weather. Look, I really need to get back. Is it somethin’ serious? Can you just…tell me that?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, with a history of smoking and coughing up red sputum, we need to rule out some possibilities. It could be something serious, and that's why I want to do a quick exam, just to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oxygen levels…exam… sighs Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just…make it quick, Doc. People need power. And…I don't like doctors much. Never have. But…if you think it's serious…then I guess. Just…tell me what you’re doin’, okay? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Good. I’m hearing some…wheezing. And some crackles in the lower lobes. Now, I’m just going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Let me just see… 92%. That’s a little low.
PATIENT: Low? 92…is that bad? I don’t… I don’t understand numbers. Is that why I’m winded? Wheezing and crackles…sounds…bad. Look, Doc, can you just tell me straight? Is this the smokin’? Is it somethin’ else? Is it gonna kill me? I need to know. Just…be honest. I’ve lived a long life, but…I got people relyin' on me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, your oxygen level is a bit low, and the sounds I’m hearing in your lungs are concerning, especially given your smoking history. It’s highly likely that the smoking has contributed to this. We need to investigate further to determine the exact cause. It could be something like chronic bronchitis or emphysema, which are common in smokers, but it could also be something more serious, like pneumonia or even lung cancer. I don’t want to alarm you, but we need to rule those possibilities out. We'll need a chest X-ray and possibly some blood work. I'm going to order those now. We also need to discuss quitting smoking. I can provide resources to help with that. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: X-ray…blood work…lung cancer… sighs deeply, rubs forehead Cancer… I… I don't know. That’s…that’s what my sister died of. I… I guess I gotta. If you think it's needed. But…the waitin’… I hate waitin’. And…quittin’? I've tried. So many times. It…it doesn’t work. But…okay. Do the tests. Just…tell me when I can get back to work. People need power, Doc. They really do. And…tell me honestly. If it's…bad. I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. The X-ray and blood work can be done here at the clinic. It will take a few hours to get the results back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll discuss them in detail. I promise to be honest with you, Mr. Reyno. And I understand your concern about getting back to work. I’ll write a note for your employer explaining you’re undergoing medical evaluation. As for quitting smoking, we can start with smaller steps and explore different resources. There are medications and therapies that can help. But first, let's focus on getting a clear understanding of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… not that I know of. Never had a problem with anythin’ they gave me before. Not that I remember. Look, can I just…sit down? I feel kinda weak. And…can you tell me how long this waitin’ is gonna be? A few hours… is that all? I got calls comin’ in already. They’re probably wonderin’ where I am. Just…tell me honestly, Doc. This feelin’… is it serious right now? Like, do I need to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. Now, regarding your current condition, your oxygen saturation is a bit low, and you’re feeling weak, which is concerning. However, your breathing isn’t severely labored at the moment, and your vital signs are stable enough that a trip to the hospital isn’t immediately necessary. We’ll monitor your oxygen levels while you’re here, and if they drop significantly, we’ll need to consider going to the emergency room. As for the wait time, the X-ray should take about 15-20 minutes, and the blood work results typically come back within a couple of hours. I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Let's get the X-ray done first, and then we can draw some blood. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Let’s just…get it over with. X-ray first. But…don’t keep me waitin’ all day, Doc. People need power. And…I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. Just…be quick. And…tell me what you see, okay? Don’t sugarcoat it. Just…tell me the truth. sighs heavily, looking down at his hands This…this isn't good, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand. I promise to be as quick and thorough as possible. And you’re right, I’ll be honest with you about what the X-ray shows. I will explain everything in a way you can understand. I’ll go get the technician ready. Please just stay seated and try to relax. I’ll be right back.
