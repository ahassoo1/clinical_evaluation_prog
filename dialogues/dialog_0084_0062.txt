DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Voytek. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and perhaps some other protective gear. It’s… causing a bit of a difficulty for me, and I was advised to seek an exemption, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it sounds like you're needing documentation regarding potential medical reasons for an exemption from wearing masks and possibly other PPE at work. Let's talk about what's making it difficult for you. Can you tell me specifically what issues you're experiencing when you try to wear a mask?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Documentation would be most helpful. As for the difficulties… well, it’s a sensation of… constriction, I suppose. A tightening. It makes it hard to breathe comfortably, and my heart begins to race. It’s not painful, exactly, but deeply unsettling. It brings back… memories. I find it very difficult to focus on my work when I am experiencing this. It happens with most masks, even the lighter cloth ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sensation of constriction, racing heart, and difficulty focusing, triggered by wearing masks… and it brings back memories. That’s helpful information. Just to clarify, when you say “memories,” are these related to a specific event or trauma?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, they are. It’s… difficult to speak of, truthfully. When I was a boy, my family and I… we were involved in a house fire. A very bad one. There was a lot of smoke, and we were all wearing those… those oxygen masks. It was a frightening time, and the sensation of having something over my face… it reminds me of that day. It causes a… a feeling of panic, I believe is the word. It’s not constant, but the masks bring it on quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that provides a lot of context. A traumatic experience with smoke and oxygen masks during a house fire. That certainly explains the anxiety response. Have you been formally diagnosed with any anxiety disorders, like PTSD or panic disorder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. I’ve always… avoided doctors, to be honest. My upbringing didn’t encourage it. I’ve managed, mostly, on my own. I work as a protective service worker, and that requires a certain… stoicism, I suppose. I didn’t want to appear… weak. But this mask situation is making it very hard to do my job effectively. I haven't sought any formal help for… this reaction, before now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding medical care is common, and it sounds like you’ve developed coping mechanisms to manage on your own. It’s good you’re addressing this now, though. Just to get a better picture, how often are you required to wear a mask at work?
PATIENT: It varies, Doctor. It depends on the situation. When I’m visiting clients in their homes, it’s often requested, or required by policy. Perhaps three or four times a week, on average. Sometimes more if there’s a flu outbreak, or something similar. And there's talk of requiring more protective gear, like face shields and gowns, soon. It's the enclosed feeling, mostly. The feeling of being… trapped. It affects my concentration, and I worry about being able to respond quickly if a situation becomes… difficult. I need to be alert and focused, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four times a week, potential increase with more PPE, and it’s the enclosed feeling that triggers the anxiety, impacting your concentration and ability to respond quickly. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying respiratory issues that might be contributing to this. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough assessment. Please proceed. I’ll do my best to remain calm. It’s the… anticipation, I think, that is most unsettling. But I trust your professional judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up and take a few deep breaths for me, that would be great. Lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 135/85, pulse is 88 and regular. Heart sounds normal. Overall, physically, everything seems within normal limits. It does appear this is more likely related to the anxiety response you're describing. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your general health. Have you had any significant medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate the thoroughness. As for my medical history… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, quite a long time ago. No complications, thankfully. Other than that… I’ve been remarkably healthy, considering my lifestyle. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and I try to maintain a good diet. Nothing else of note, I believe. No chronic illnesses, no major surgeries, no… long-term medications. I haven't even had the flu vaccine regularly, which I know is foolish, but… I’ve always been a bit wary of doctors, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager, otherwise healthy, and generally avoid medical interventions. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. No allergies of any kind, to my knowledge. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and I’ve never had a reaction. My family was… resourceful, and we didn’t have the luxury of being overly cautious with food. We ate what we could find, or grow. So I’ve built up a good tolerance, I suppose. No known sensitivities or reactions to any medications either. It’s… quite unusual, I realize, but I truly have no allergies.
DOCTOR: That is unusual, but good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: That is a… complicated question, Doctor. My family history is… fragmented. We were separated quite a bit, and I didn’t have much contact with my extended family growing up. My mother… she suffered from bouts of… melancholy, I suppose you would call it. Periods of deep sadness and withdrawal. But it wasn’t diagnosed, and it wasn’t discussed openly. My father… he was a strong, stoic man. He didn’t talk about his health, or anyone else’s. I believe he had some… heart trouble, later in life, but I don’t have any specific details. As for other relatives… I honestly don’t know. We didn’t keep in touch, and I have very little information about their health histories. It’s… a difficult subject.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with periods of sadness, father with possible heart trouble, limited information on extended family. That gives me something to work with. And finally, just to complete the picture, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My social life is… quiet. I live alone. I don’t have a spouse, or children. I have a few acquaintances at work, but I don’t socialize much outside of that. I spend most of my free time outdoors, hiking or fishing. I find solace in nature. I don’t drink alcohol, or use tobacco. I’ve never been much of a social person, truthfully. I prefer my own company, and I find contentment in a simple life. My work is demanding, and it leaves me with little energy for much else. It's... sufficient. I have Medicare, as you likely see in my chart.
DOCTOR: Okay, quiet social life, lives alone, enjoys outdoor activities, no alcohol or tobacco, Medicare. Thank you for sharing that. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it appears your anxiety response to wearing masks is likely related to the traumatic experience you had as a child during the house fire. There are no significant underlying medical conditions contributing to this, and your overall health is good. Given your job requirements, and the impact this is having on your ability to perform your duties, I can write you a note explaining that you experience anxiety related to mask-wearing due to a past trauma, and recommending reasonable accommodations, such as alternative forms of PPE if possible, or a modified work environment. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be immensely helpful. Truly. To have something in writing, explaining the situation… it would alleviate a great deal of stress. And to have some consideration given to alternative options… it would make a significant difference in my ability to do my job effectively. I appreciate your understanding, and your willingness to help. It is… a great relief. Thank you. Would you need any further information from me, or any documentation from my side? I can try to provide it, if necessary.
DOCTOR: No, I think I have enough information at this point. I’ll draft a note outlining your history of trauma, the anxiety response to mask-wearing, and recommending reasonable accommodations. I’ll also include a statement that I’ve performed a physical exam and found no underlying medical conditions contributing to this. I can print that out for you now. It's important to be aware, though, that accommodations are ultimately at the discretion of your employer. And I would strongly recommend considering some form of counseling or therapy to help you process the trauma and manage your anxiety long-term. I can provide you with some referrals if you’re interested. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That is… thoughtful, Doctor. I appreciate the offer of referrals. Perhaps, after I’ve secured the accommodation, I will consider that. For now, the note is the most pressing matter. I will be most grateful for that. And no, I believe that is all. Thank you again for your time, your understanding, and your willingness to help. It has been… a positive experience, despite the difficult subject matter. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the note. Please keep it with you, and feel free to share it with your employer. If you have any further questions or concerns in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. And again, if you do decide to pursue counseling, I have a list of local therapists if you'd like. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Voytek. I will. And I will certainly keep your offer in mind. You have my sincere gratitude. Have a pleasant day as well.
