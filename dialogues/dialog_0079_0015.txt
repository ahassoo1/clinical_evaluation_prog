DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, please, call me Mikeisha. Um... it is my nose, I think. It feels... bad. Like a lot of pressure, you know? It has been like this for… a little while now, I guess. I don’t remember exactly how long. Sorry. It just… hurts when I breathe sometimes.
DOCTOR: A little while…yes. It’s often difficult to pinpoint these things precisely. And where exactly do you feel the pressure, Mikeisha?
PATIENT: Hmm... it’s hard to say. Mostly… around here? And maybe… behind my eyes a little bit? It’s not a sharp pain, more like… full. Like something is blocking the air. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A full sensation, yes. Blocking the air… and does this happen constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days it is… worse than others. Like today, it feels… a lot. Other days, I don’t even notice it so much. But it has been happening… more often lately, I think. I am sorry, I am not very good at remembering things. My husband usually remembers everything.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright. We can work through it. And when it’s worse, are there any particular activities that seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it…? Oh. Um… not that I know of. I work… with machines. Rotary drills. It is… loud. And sometimes dusty. But it happens even when I am not working. Maybe when I lie down? Yes, I think it is worse when I lie flat. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Lying flat exacerbates it... and you mentioned dust at work. Have you noticed any nasal discharge, Mikeisha?
PATIENT: Nasal…discharge? Oh. I don't think so. Maybe a little bit sometimes, but it is clear. Not… thick or colored. It doesn’t bother me much. I just… blow my nose like anyone else. I am sorry, I am probably not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: That’s acceptable. Now, have you experienced any fever, headaches, or facial pain accompanying this nasal congestion?
PATIENT: No fever, I don’t think. And… headaches sometimes, but I get headaches a lot. It’s just… normal for me. Like a tension headache, you know? Not… a bad one. And no, no pain in my face. Just the pressure in my nose. It’s mostly the pressure. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: We will determine that, Mikeisha. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll need to listen to your breathing and examine your nasal passages. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… please be gentle? It feels… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth, and then exhale slowly. Breath deeply… and again. Good. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to take a look at your nasal passages. Please look straight ahead. …Hmm. Mildly swollen nasal turbinates, with clear nasal mucosa. No significant purulent discharge observed. Right nostril appears similar. No signs of acute infection at this time. Palpating around your sinuses… no tenderness to percussion.
PATIENT: Okay. It feels a little strange, but not… painful. So, it is not an infection? What is it, then? It just feels so… full. Is it allergies, maybe? I don’t usually have allergies, but I have been feeling… different lately. Everything feels different.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be a straightforward infection, given the lack of purulent discharge and absence of fever. Allergies are a possibility, although you state you don’t typically suffer from them. However, given the subjective nature of your symptoms – this feeling of “fullness” – and the lack of definitive findings on examination, it’s difficult to ascertain the precise etiology at this time. The nasal swelling is mild, and could be attributable to a number of factors – irritants, even a slight vasomotor rhinitis. I suspect we're dealing with a chronic inflammatory process.
PATIENT: Chronic…? Inflammatory…? Oh dear. I don’t understand. Does that mean it will… always be like this? I just want it to stop hurting. Is there… medicine for that? Something to make the feeling go away? I just want to breathe normally again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: While a definitive cure isn’t always achievable, we can certainly attempt to manage your symptoms. I’m hesitant to prescribe a systemic steroid without further investigation, given the potential side effects. However, I can recommend a saline nasal spray to help moisten the nasal passages and alleviate some of the congestion. I also suggest an over-the-counter decongestant, used sparingly and as directed. If your symptoms persist or worsen, I recommend a referral to an otolaryngologist – an ear, nose, and throat specialist – for further evaluation. They may consider allergy testing or imaging studies to determine the underlying cause. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter…? Oh. I don't know. I don't usually take much medicine. I don't think so. No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. My husband usually handles the medicine. He knows all of that. Is this… serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Boham, it is unlikely to be anything serious. However, it is important to rule out any underlying causes, hence my recommendation for a specialist referral should your symptoms persist. Here is a prescription for the saline spray. Use it twice daily. And, as I said, use the over-the-counter decongestant sparingly. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Um… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope it helps. It's just… a lot to remember. And I don't want to bother you again if it doesn't. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Should you experience any worsening of symptoms – fever, severe facial pain, or significant nasal bleeding – seek immediate medical attention. Good day, Ms. Boham.
