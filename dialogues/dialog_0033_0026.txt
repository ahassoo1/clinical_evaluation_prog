DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this… tiredness. Just awful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it really comes. I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck, honestly. My husband keeps telling me I need to slow down, but… well, a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do, doesn’t she?
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It’s not like it started yesterday, you know? It comes and goes, like I said. Maybe… a few months? Hard to say. Things just… blur together after a while. I’m not one for remembering dates, never have been.
DOCTOR: A few months. And is this tiredness constant when it’s present, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: Fluctuate? Oh, it definitely fluctuates. It's not like I’m always completely wiped out. Some days are better than others, but then it hits… and it hits hard. Usually in the afternoons, I think. After I’ve been… well, doing things. It’s hard to explain. It's not like I'm laying in bed all day, mind you. I still have things to do.
DOCTOR: “Doing things.” Could you be a little more specific about what those “things” are?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. Well, I… I still do a bit of diving, you know. Not like I used to, of course. My bones aren’t what they used to be. But I help out where I can. And around the house, you know. Cooking, cleaning… a woman’s work is never done. Honestly, it's a bit disrespectful asking what I do. As if I just sit around all day!
DOCTOR: Right. Diving… and housework. And you said it’s worse in the afternoons?
PATIENT: Yes, afternoons. After I’ve been… exerting myself. It’s a bit like my batteries just… run out. And then my muscles ache, too. Not all the time, but when the tiredness really hits, they get quite sore. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations with this tiredness, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Oh, goodness. I don’t know what that even is. My heart… it beats, of course. It always has. Shortness of breath… sometimes, maybe? After a particularly hard dive, perhaps. But I just chalked it up to being out of shape. I’m not a spring chicken anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just take a quick look. Blood pressure first… and pulse. 130 over 80. Pulse is 78. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Breathing sounds are clear, though a slightly rapid rate. Heart sounds… normal. No murmurs that I can detect.
PATIENT: Normal, you say? That’s good, isn’t it? I always worry about my heart. My father… well, he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. But clear lungs... that’s good. I always try to breathe properly. It’s important, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen feels soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s just check your reflexes. Reflexes are… a little diminished, but not concerning for your age. You mentioned muscle aches. Where specifically are you experiencing those aches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, really. But mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms, after a hard dive. It's not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a… dull ache. Like they’ve been used too much. It passes eventually, but it’s quite bothersome while it lasts.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it flares up. And… I think that’s it. Just the arthritis stuff, when I need it. A little white pill, I believe. I don’t usually bother with names, you see. My husband keeps track of it all. He's a very organized man, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Do you recall the name of the arthritis medication, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. It's… white. Small. I take it with a glass of water. Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay much attention to these things. My husband gets it for me, and I just take it when he tells me to. It’s probably something simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I eat most things, too. Though I don't care for beets. They taste… earthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing generalized fatigue, likely related to age and activity level, and potentially a mild contribution from your arthritis. The diminished reflexes could be age related. It's difficult to say more without some blood work. We'll do a CBC and a CMP, and check your thyroid levels.
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? I don’t mind a little poking, but I do get a bit faint sometimes. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, couldn't it just be… old age?
DOCTOR: It's best to rule out other potential causes, Ms. Oitker. Things like anemia, thyroid problems, or electrolyte imbalances can all cause fatigue. It's a standard precaution. We can have the phlebotomist take it easy with you, and you can lie down during the procedure if you’d like. It's better to be thorough, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please tell them to be gentle. And yes, I think I would like to lie down. I do get a bit… wobbly sometimes. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. It's just… all this poking and prodding is so bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll make a note for the phlebotomist to be very gentle and have you lie down. We'll get those labs ordered. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and see what the best course of action is. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to manage your arthritis as you have been, and try to pace yourself. Don’t overexert yourself. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Pace myself… that’s easier said than done, you know. But alright, I’ll try. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… when will I get the results? I don’t want to have to wait too long. My husband gets quite worried when I’m unwell, you see.
DOCTOR: The labs usually take 24-48 hours to come back. The results will be available through the patient portal, and my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are in. Is there a number where we can reach you?
PATIENT: Oh, good. 24-48 hours isn’t too bad. My number is… 555-123-4567. My husband answers it, usually. He’s very good with these things. And the… portal, you say? I don’t think I’ve ever used one of those. Is it difficult?
DOCTOR: It’s quite simple, Ms. Oitker. My office staff can help you set it up before you leave. They can walk you through it. Alright, well, I think that covers everything for today. If anything changes or you feel worse before your follow-up, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was… a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I do hope these tests don’t reveal anything too serious. Honestly, I just want to be able to keep up with things. And my husband, of course. Now, where did I leave my purse…?
