DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line needs some medical information from a doctor. Just a general check, really, to say I'm fit to travel. It’s to Scotland, as it happens! Though not my bit, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-travel clearance form. That’s perfectly reasonable. And Scotland, lovely. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been generally healthy?
PATIENT: Generally, yes, Doctor. I’ve been quite fortunate, all things considered. My husband, God rest his soul, was the one who always needed looking after. I haven’t had any major illnesses, no. Just the usual little things, colds and such. I had a bad bout of the flu a few winters back, but that was all. Nothing… chronic, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, no major chronic conditions. That’s good to hear. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. Years ago now, when I was thirty-two, I had my appendix removed. It was quite sudden, a terrible pain. And… oh! I had my wisdom teeth out, too, but that was under a local anesthetic, so it wasn’t a proper surgery, I wouldn't have thought. Just a bit uncomfortable afterwards. Is that what you need to know, Doctor? Anything important about those?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed at thirty-two, and wisdom teeth extraction. No complications from either one, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: No, not a single one, Doctor. The appendix was a bit frightening at the time, but the doctors were very good. I recovered quickly enough. And the wisdom teeth… well, I was young and foolish then, didn’t take much notice. Just a bit sore for a few days, that’s all. No lingering problems whatsoever. I remember the dentist being very kind, though. A lovely man.
DOCTOR: Good. No complications from either procedure. Now, thinking about your family... is there any significant medical history on either side – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. My mother lived to be eighty-nine, a very active woman, she did. She had a bit of arthritis in her later years, mostly in her hands, but that was about it. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, a heart condition, I believe. Nothing terribly specific, I wasn’t old enough to really understand it. And my husband’s family… his mother had high blood pressure, I think, but other than that, not a great deal I’m aware of. It wasn't something we talked about much, truthfully. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart condition in your father, and high blood pressure in your husband’s mother. We’ll make a note of that. Now, just to be complete, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I've always been quite lucky that way. I can eat anything, take most medicines without a bother. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve seen enough people suffer with allergies, so I consider myself very fortunate. Not even hay fever, mind you, and I live right near a field! It’s rather remarkable, really.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I pride myself on staying as natural as possible. I eat a good diet, get plenty of fresh air, and that’s usually enough. I tried a vitamin D supplement last winter, but I honestly couldn't tell if it was doing anything, so I stopped taking it. Just water and a bit of tea, mostly. I do enjoy a nice cup of Earl Grey, you see. But nothing medicinal, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or supplements. Just Earl Grey tea. Okay, Ms. Squiers, to get a better picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Of course. I wouldn't want you to fill out that form without having a proper look, would I? Please, go right ahead. I'm quite used to doctors, you see. Not that I enjoy it, mind you, but I understand it's necessary. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, if you could just sit back and relax. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is good. Now, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Ears are clear. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulse is regular. All seems well, Ms. Squiers.
PATIENT: Well, that was remarkably quick, Doctor. Thank you. Everything feels fine, as far as I can tell. Is there anything you found of concern? I do worry a little, you see. Old habits, I suppose. My husband always needed a bit of looking after, so I’m used to being anxious. But I trust your judgement, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Squiers. And honestly, everything is well. The exam was completely normal. Blood pressure, heart and lungs all sound excellent. No tenderness in your abdomen, ears and throat are clear. Given your history and the exam findings, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be fit to travel. I’ll go ahead and fill out the pre-travel clearance form stating that you are in good health for international travel.
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful news, Doctor! A great relief, truly. Thank you so much for your time and thoroughness. I appreciate your kind reassurance. Would there be a charge for this, Doctor? And will I receive a copy of the form for my records? I do like to keep everything organized, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, you’ll receive a copy of the completed form. Our office will charge a standard consultation fee of $75 for the pre-travel clearance. I can have our receptionist prepare a bill for you. And just to be safe, do you have any pre-existing conditions or anything you're specifically worried about while traveling?
PATIENT: Seventy-five dollars is perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Thank you. As for pre-existing conditions... no, nothing I'm aware of. Though, now you mention it, my ankles do swell a little if I stand for too long. It’s nothing major, just a bit of discomfort. And I do get a bit travel-sick on winding roads, but I always take ginger biscuits with me. That usually does the trick. Nothing that would stop me from enjoying a lovely cruise, I assure you. It's just sensible to be prepared, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll make a note of the occasional ankle swelling and travel sickness. Given that your ankle swelling is occasional and you manage the travel sickness with ginger biscuits, I don’t think it requires further investigation at this time. However, if the swelling becomes frequent or painful while traveling, please seek medical attention. As for the travel sickness, over-the-counter remedies like Dramamine can also be helpful if the ginger biscuits aren't sufficient. I'll include a brief note with the form mentioning this. Here's the completed form, Ms. Squiers. It states you are fit to travel with the notes regarding your occasional ankle swelling and travel sickness. Our receptionist will handle the bill. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s absolutely perfect. You’ve been very thorough and kind, and I feel much more confident about my trip now. Thank you again for your time and patience. And thank you for including those notes, that’s very considerate. I’m sure I’ll be fine, but it’s always good to be prepared, isn't it? Everything looks in order. I believe that’s everything. Thank you once more, Doctor. Have a lovely day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise to Scotland! And don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before or during your trip. Have a wonderful time. .
