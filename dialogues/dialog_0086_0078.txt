DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a reset, or a jumpstart, to get my health back on track. I'm not sure where to even begin, really. It's not one specific thing, more a general feeling of…less than optimal.
DOCTOR: “Less than optimal.” Right. Well, that’s…vague. We need to get specific if we’re going to do anything useful. Let’s start with the basics. When did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s not sudden, not like a cold or anything. I suppose…over the last year, maybe? It’s been a gradual thing. I used to have so much more energy, and I felt…lighter, if that makes sense. Now everything feels like a bit of an effort. Does that help at all? I’m terrible with dates, I apologize.
DOCTOR: It does, a little. “Gradual” is better than nothing. Okay. And what specifically feels like an effort?
PATIENT: Well, just…daily things, Doctor. Getting up in the morning is harder. I used to enjoy gardening, but now it feels…overwhelming. Even just walking around the block leaves me winded. And I’ve been having trouble sleeping, which makes everything worse, of course. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, I suppose. I also feel…a bit foggy-headed, if you know what I mean. Not like a serious illness, just…not as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, difficulty sleeping, reduced stamina, and some cognitive fog. Let's see… have you noticed any weight changes recently?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. I think…maybe a few pounds? I wouldn’t say a significant amount. My clothes feel a little tighter, but I’ve also been…less active, so it’s hard to say. I try to eat reasonably well, but I do enjoy a good arepa now and then, and those aren’t exactly low-calorie.
DOCTOR: Right. And what does “reasonably well” mean, specifically?
PATIENT: Well, I try to have a good balance. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein – fish, chicken. I cook most of my meals at home. We eat rice and beans often, which is very typical, of course. I do enjoy sweets, and like I said, I’m partial to an arepa or two. We don’t eat a lot of processed food. I suppose I could be better, but I don’t think it’s terribly bad. It's just...getting older, perhaps? Is that even a thing?
DOCTOR: Getting older is a thing, yes, but it doesn’t necessarily mean feeling constantly exhausted. Let's move on. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My joints ache a little sometimes, especially in the mornings. It’s not debilitating, just…a bit stiff. And I’ve been feeling…a little more anxious than usual. Nothing major, but I find myself worrying more about things. Is that…connected, do you think? I haven't really told anyone about the anxiety, to be honest. It’s…embarrassing, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it feels silly to complain about being anxious when so many people have real problems, you know? It’s just…little things. Worrying about my husband, the news, things like that. It’s not like I’m having panic attacks or anything. Just…a constant low-level worry. And I'm afraid I'm rambling. I apologize, Doctor. I don't usually talk this much about myself.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pitzel, everyone’s problems are valid. Don't minimize your feelings. And it’s my job to listen. Now, regarding your husband, is he healthy?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, thankfully. He’s very healthy, actually. A bit stubborn about going to the doctor himself, but otherwise, very good. He’s a retired carpenter, still very active, puttering around in the garden with me when he’s not…avoiding the doctor. The worrying is just…natural, I suppose. Knowing his age, and…well, you understand. He’s the love of my life. I just…want him to be okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, husband healthy but reluctant to seek medical attention. Let’s get back to you. Any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, when I was younger, I had a rather nasty bout of…dengue fever, back in Colombia. I recovered fully, but I sometimes wonder if it left any lingering effects. And I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago. Otherwise…nothing major. I haven't been a regular at the doctor’s office, thankfully. I tend to just…tough things out. It's a habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Tough things out.” Right. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have a bit of a sensitivity to dust, I think. Makes me sneeze and my eyes water. Nothing severe, though. And sometimes, certain pollens bother me in the spring. But nothing that requires medication, usually. Just a bit of discomfort. Is that relevant, Doctor? I apologize if I’m being unhelpful. I’m not sure what information is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dust and pollen allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. I've always preferred natural remedies, if that makes sense. Things like chamomile tea for sleep, or ginger for an upset stomach. I know it’s not very scientific, but… It's just always been my preference.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Now, Ms. Pitzel, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. It’s just a routine check, nothing to worry about. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. Then, I'll order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’m ready whenever you are. Please, let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Strength 5/5 in all extremities. No obvious deficits noted. Okay. Seems unremarkable so far. I'm going to write an order for a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. We'll review the results next week.
PATIENT: That sounds…thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary changes, or… I just want to feel like myself again. I know it’s a lot to ask.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pitzel, I'm a physician, not a miracle worker. We need the lab results before we can determine the best course of action. However……I suggest you try to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night. And……reduce your intake of processed foods and sugary drinks. That's a start. Avoid strenuous activity until we have more information. I'll see you next week. Here’s the lab order. The lab is just down the hall. Schedule a follow-up appointment when you've completed the tests. Next patient.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. .
