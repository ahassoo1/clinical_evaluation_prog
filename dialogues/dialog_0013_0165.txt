DOCTOR: Hi Clide, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Chriselda. It’s this fever, see? Keeps comin’ back. It’s been botherin’ me for… well, I’d have to think, but a while now. Not constant, comes and goes. It’s just…annoying, you know? I just wanna get rid of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever. That is annoying. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the evenin’, I think. Gets me feelin’ pretty weak, kinda chills, but not always. Sometimes just hot. Usually goes away by mornin’, but then… it might come back the next evenin’. It ain't been super high, not like 103 or nothin’, more like… a warm forehead. I haven’t really taken my temp, to be honest. My wife usually does that, and she’s at a bingo tournament all week.
DOCTOR: Got it. So, it’s worse in the evenings, comes and goes, and it doesn't seem to be a very high fever. Okay. Any other symptoms along with the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache a little. Not bad, just…old man stuff, you know? And I’ve been a little tired, but… I am 65. It’s hard to tell what’s the fever and what’s just gettin’ old, honestly. No cough, no sniffles, nothin' like that. Just the achiness and the heat.
DOCTOR: Alright, no cough, no sniffles, just aches and heat. And the aches are fairly mild. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or if you’ve lost any weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite's been okay. My wife, she always makes sure I'm eatin'. She worries. Weight… probably a little, but not much. I wouldn't say I've lost weight, just…not gainin' like I used to, if that makes sense. I used to be a pretty big guy, but things change, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, appetite is good, and some slight weight changes, but nothing dramatic. Now, thinking back, have you traveled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: Nah, haven’t been anywhere. Just been stickin' around here. And no, not really been around anyone sick, not that I know of. We go to church, but everyone seems alright. Old Man Hemmings had a cold last month, but that was it. A regular cold, nothin’ bad. Wait… my grandson visited last week. He had something, a little sniffly, but kids get sick all the time, right? It didn’t last long.
DOCTOR: Okay, your grandson visited and was a little sniffly. Good to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. Let’s see… high blood pressure, yeah, I got that. Been on medicine for it for… oh, fifteen years, maybe? Gets checked regular. Other than that… nothin’ major. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age again. No diabetes, no heart problems. I see a specialist for my blood pressure every six months. Dr. Ramirez, over in the city.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some arthritis. That's good to know you’re seeing Dr. Ramirez regularly. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yeah, I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And a knee replacement about ten years ago, on this left one. That went pretty well, but it still gets stiff sometimes, especially when the weather changes. Other than that...nope, nothin' else. Pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child, and a knee replacement ten years ago. And any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. My wife always asks when she gets me new prescriptions, and I always tell her no. Never had a reaction to anything. We both eat pretty much anything. She’s a good cook, tries new things all the time. Still, she always checks.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they’re really botherin' me, but that's it. Not every day, just when I need it. Over the counter stuff, you know? Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for your blood pressure, and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and just take a look around. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. Whatever you gotta do. Just try not to poke too hard, these old bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.2. Heart and lungs sound good. I feel some mild swelling in your knees, which is likely from the arthritis. Lymph nodes feel normal. Given your recurring fever, aches, and slightly elevated temperature, it sounds like you might have a mild viral infection. It's hard to say for sure without further testing. However, based on your symptoms and the exam, it doesn’t sound like anything serious. Do you have any other concerns I should address?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers it. A viral thing… sounds about right. I just wanna get over it, you know? Is there somethin' I can take to get rid of it faster? Maybe somethin' for the fever? I don't want it comin' back again. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is annoying. For a mild viral infection, the best thing to do is support your body while it fights it off. I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids – water, broth, anything to stay hydrated – and taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the fever and aches. Since you don’t have insurance, and I don’t think this is anything serious, we can try managing it with these over-the-counter options first. If your fever goes above 101.5°F , lasts longer than three days, or you develop any new symptoms – like a cough, shortness of breath, or severe headache – then we need to re-evaluate and potentially consider further testing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Rest and fluids… I can do that. And the over-the-counter stuff is fine. Three days, you said? If it gets worse. Okay, I can remember that. Thanks, Chriselda. I appreciate you not makin' a big deal outta nothin'. I just wanna get back to normal, you know? Bingo night’s next week, and my wife would kill me if I missed it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clide. I'm glad I could help. It's good to know it doesn’t sound like anything major, and hopefully, you'll be feeling back to normal in no time. Bingo night is important! Here’s a little handout with information about managing a viral infection at home. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Chriselda. You're a good doctor. I’ll see you if I need somethin’.
