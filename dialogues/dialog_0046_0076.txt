DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they really hurt. Been botherin’ me for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Red and kinda hard, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bumps on your shins that have been present for about a month, and they're red and hard, causing you pain. That’s helpful information to start with. Could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like… achy. And it gets worse when I walk a lot. I do a lot of moving things at work, you know, boxes and stuff. Sometimes, just standing for too long is enough to make ‘em bother me. It’s not always hurting, though. Just when I’m on my feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy pain that worsens with activity, especially walking and standing, and improves with rest. That gives me a better idea. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the bumps better besides rest?
PATIENT: Not really, to be honest. I haven’t tried anything special. Maybe putting my feet up helps a little, but I’m not sure if it’s that or just… time. I haven’t used any creams or anything on ‘em. I figured I’d see what a doctor thinks first.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Have you noticed any changes to the bumps themselves – in size, number, or appearance – over the past month?
PATIENT: Well, I think there's maybe one or two more now than when it started. They haven't gotten huge, but they’re definitely not gettin’ smaller, that’s for sure. And they… kinda stick out, you know? They’re not flat against my skin. They’re raised. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Raised bumps that are increasing in number, but not decreasing in size. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see… nothin’ major. I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but I take medicine for it. Been takin’ it for… oh, maybe ten years now? Keeps it under control, mostly. And my knees are a little achy sometimes, old work injury. Other than that, I think I’m pretty healthy for my age. Oh, and my wife says I snore, but I don’t count that as a medical condition!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee pain from a previous injury. Do you recall the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s a white pill… I always forget these names! My wife handles most of the refills, you see. I think… it starts with an ‘A’? Amlodipine? Is that right? Something like that. I’m really not good with names, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Aluia. Amlodipine is correct. And don't worry about remembering medication names; that’s what we’re here for. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not even tonsils! And I haven’t been in the hospital since I was a little kid, had a bad fever. Nothing serious, just stayed overnight for a couple of days. It was a long time ago, I don’t remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, just to get a complete picture, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had diabetes. She had it pretty bad towards the end. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. Something with his cholesterol, maybe? It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about that stuff much back then. My wife’s side of the family seems pretty healthy, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes and heart problems. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife always jokes that I have an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, just to confirm, are you currently taking any other medications besides the amlodipine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they’re really botherin’ me, but that’s it. Not every day, just when I need to. And maybe a little cough syrup when I got a cold, but that’s rare.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed for knee pain and occasional cough syrup. Now, I’d like to take a look at your legs. Would you mind if I examined them?
PATIENT: No, go ahead, Doctor. Please do. It’s these shins, right here. They’re kinda sensitive, so be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the bumps here on your shins. There are approximately six to eight of them, ranging in size from about half a centimeter to one centimeter in diameter. They are firm to the touch, slightly raised, and warm to the touch. They’re a reddish-purple color. Do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little bit. Not super painful, but I can feel it. Right there, especially. And… a little bit over here too. They’re pretty tender, Doctor. I usually just try to ignore ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness is present on palpation of the bumps. Your pulses are strong and regular. The skin around the bumps doesn’t show any signs of significant inflammation or open wounds. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, these bumps could be several things, but a likely possibility is shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, or possibly a form of vasculitis. Given your age and medical history, further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection, and to check your kidney function. I'll also order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Okay… Sounds good, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m just tired of these bumps hurtin’. I don’t mind the tests if it means finding out what’s goin’ on. Will it take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. The lab is just down the hall; I'll have my nurse, Maria, come in and draw the samples for you. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible, applying ice packs to the area for 15-20 minutes at a time, and taking ibuprofen as needed for the pain. Avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates the symptoms. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Rest, ice, ibuprofen… I can do that. One week follow-up is fine. Thank you for lookin' into this for me. It makes me feel a little better knowin’ we're tryin' to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could help. Maria will be in shortly to draw your blood. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms—such as increased pain, fever, swelling, or redness—please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before Maria arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You explained everything really well, Doctor. I’ll just wait for Maria. Thank you again for your help. I appreciate it.
