DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 31 years of age. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it's this…patchiness on my skin. It's quite bothersome, really. Not aesthetically pleasing at all. It started a few months ago, I suppose. Though, honestly, I don't keep close track of such things. It’s on my arms mostly, and a little on my neck.
DOCTOR: A few months, you say. And it’s primarily on your arms and neck. Is it… itchy?
PATIENT: Itchy? Heavens, no. Not at all. It's…discolored. That’s the problem. Like… blotches. Not a nice, even tone. It’s just… there. It wouldn’t be so bad if it was just a bit of redness, but it's… different shades. Honestly, it looks rather…unrefined.
DOCTOR: Different shades… unrefined, you say. Hmm. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean changed? My routine is perfectly consistent, thank you very much. I haven't altered my soaps, my lotions, my diet…nothing. I assure you, I’m a very practical person. One doesn’t simply change things without a very good reason. It’s quite baffling, really. It just…appeared.
DOCTOR: Practicality is admirable, Ms. Bartock, but sometimes even the most consistent routines can be affected by unforeseen factors. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveled? Goodness, no. Why would I travel? It's terribly inconvenient. And frankly, quite unsafe these days. I haven’t left the state in…well, a very long time. I prefer to remain where I'm comfortable, thank you. Everything one needs is right here. So, no, I haven’t been gallivanting off anywhere.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you started any new medications, even over-the-counter remedies, in the last few months?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I rarely need anything. I find a strong cup of tea solves most ailments, honestly. And a good night’s sleep. I certainly don’t go around popping pills for every little thing. It's…common these days, and frankly, quite ridiculous. No, absolutely no new medications. Are you suggesting I’m unwell? Because I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: I am merely gathering information, Ms. Bartock. It’s my job. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly. No, I do not. I've eaten everything, done everything… I have a perfectly robust constitution. My grandmother always said so. Dust bothers me a little, perhaps, but that’s not an allergy. It’s just…dust. I don’t react, I simply prefer a clean environment. It's a matter of good housekeeping, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at the affected areas, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. But I must warn you, it’s quite unsightly. And please be gentle. I’d rather not have it aggravated. It’s on my left arm, mostly. And a bit here, on my neck, just below my ear. There. You can see it’s not a uniform color. It’s… distressing.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. There’s a clear demarcation in pigmentation. It does appear…irregular. And is there any texture change?
PATIENT: Texture change? Goodness. I hadn’t really noticed. It feels…normal, I suppose. Maybe a little rougher than usual, but that could simply be the lotion. I do use a rather…exfoliating formula. It’s quite good, really. Keeps everything toned. Is it concerning? Because it's really just an aesthetic issue, isn't it? I mean, it's not hurting me.
DOCTOR: The texture is slightly coarser than ideal, yes. And the discoloration…it’s not consistent. Ms. Bartock, while it may be primarily an aesthetic concern to you, we cannot dismiss potential underlying causes without further investigation. It could be a simple dermatological issue, but we must rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any fatigue, weight loss, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Weight loss? Good heavens, no! I am perfectly energetic, thank you very much. And I maintain a very consistent weight. I have always been…slender. It’s a family trait. And my appetite is perfectly normal. I eat a balanced diet. Small portions, of course. One doesn’t want to overindulge. Really, I don't understand why you're asking these things. This is about a patch on my skin, not… whatever it is you’re suggesting. It’s quite inconvenient to be questioned about my lifestyle like this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I assure you, I am not attempting to question your lifestyle. I am attempting to gather a comprehensive medical history. This discoloration could be indicative of a number of conditions, some more serious than others. To proceed responsibly, I would like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test, to start. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Blood work? Really? It seems…excessive, frankly. For a patch? But… I suppose if you insist. It's terribly inconvenient, but I don't want to be accused of withholding information. Yes, fine. Do whatever tests you deem necessary. But I trust they won’t take too long. I have a luncheon scheduled on Thursday, and I absolutely cannot be late. I do hope it doesn’t disrupt my schedule too much.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the lab technician draw the samples now. It shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes. Please take this to the lab, and they'll take care of it. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. And Ms. Bartock… try not to worry unduly. We will get to the bottom of this. We'll start with the basics.
PATIENT: Fine. I suppose. I will go and have this done. But I do hope it doesn't take long. And I expect a thorough explanation of the results, not just… medical jargon. I trust you'll have everything prepared by the time I return.
