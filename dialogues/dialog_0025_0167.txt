DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my foot, you see. It’s been…troubling me. A sore, it is. On my foot. A very painful sore.
DOCTOR: A sore on your foot, alright. And how long has this sore been…troubling you, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe…two, three months? It started small, I think. Didn’t think much of it then. But it just…got worse. It hurts to walk, you know. Especially barefoot. And I like to walk barefoot. It’s good for the soul.
DOCTOR: Two or three months…and it’s gotten progressively worse. It’s good you came in when you did. Now, can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…red. Very red around the edges. And it’s…open. Not a big hole, but…it's not closed up properly. And it sometimes…weeps a little. Sorry to be graphic, Doctor. It’s just…it hurts. A lot. And it smells a little bad, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Red, open, weeping, and…an odor. Alright. Have you noticed any pus draining from it?
PATIENT: Pus? Hmm… I don’t know what that looks like, exactly. It’s…white, sometimes. And…thick. Like…cream, maybe? But not always. Sometimes it’s more…clear. Is that pus, Doctor? I’m not good with these medical things.
DOCTOR: White or clear discharge can be pus, yes. Okay. And have you been doing anything to care for it?
PATIENT: I try to keep it clean. Wash it with soap and water every day. And I put a bandage on it. A simple bandage. But…it doesn’t seem to help much. It just…gets wet under the bandage. And then it smells worse. I put some ointment on it once, a friend gave me, but it didn't seem to do anything either.
DOCTOR: Soap and water, a bandage…and an ointment from a friend. We need to take a closer look, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m going to need to examine your foot. Would you mind if I take a look?
PATIENT: No, no. That’s alright, Doctor. Please do. I want it fixed, if that’s possible. It’s been interfering with my walks. I like to walk down to the beach every morning. Can’t do that properly now. Be gentle, please. It's sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. It is red and inflamed, as you said. And there’s some warmth to the touch. The area is quite tender…yes, I see. And it does appear to be draining. I’m concerned about a possible infection, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's likely a bacterial infection. We need to get a culture to determine what kind of bacteria we’re dealing with. I'll need to clean the wound thoroughly and we'll send it to the lab.
PATIENT: Infection? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. Is it…serious, Doctor? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t want to go to the hospital. And what about my walks? Will I be able to walk again?
DOCTOR: Now, let’s not jump to conclusions. Most infections like this can be treated with antibiotics. We’re not talking about a hospital stay at this point, Mr. Stoegbauer. But it is important to address it promptly to prevent it from getting worse. As for your walks…we’ll need to keep the wound protected and clean while it heals. That means limiting activity for a little while, yes. I'll need to debride the wound and apply a sterile dressing. We’ll see how it responds to treatment. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. My wife…she was the one who remembered those things. I just ate what she put in front of me. She was a good cook, my wife. But no, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’m pretty sure. Can we get back to the walks now? Even short ones?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. And we'll try to get you back to walking as soon as it’s safe, Mr. Stoegbauer. Now, I’m going to clean this wound. It may sting a little. I'll then apply a medicated dressing and we’ll need to keep it covered and dry. I’m also going to prescribe an oral antibiotic to fight the infection. We’ll need to monitor the wound for any signs of worsening—increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus. If you notice any of those, you need to contact the office immediately.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Sting a little? That’s alright. I’ve had worse. Just…be gentle. And thank you. You’re very kind. I do like my walks.
DOCTOR: Alright, this may feel cool at first. And now, the dressing. We need to keep this clean and dry. I've prescribed a course of amoxicillin—it’s a common antibiotic for infections like this. You'll need to take it twice a day for ten days, even if you start feeling better before then. It's important to complete the full course of antibiotics to ensure the infection is completely eradicated. I’ll write you a prescription for the antibiotic and a wound care kit—gauze, antiseptic wipes, and some tape. I want you to change the dressing daily, or whenever it gets wet or dirty. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week so we can assess the wound and make sure it’s healing properly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…very good, Doctor. Ten days of medicine, a kit, and a check-up. I can manage that. Will the medicine make me tired? I like to be up and about, you know.
DOCTOR: Amoxicillin can sometimes cause a little drowsiness, yes, but it’s not a common side effect. Most people don’t experience any significant fatigue. If you do feel unusually tired, just be careful when operating machinery or driving. And, most importantly, stay hydrated. Here’s your prescription for the antibiotic, and this sheet provides detailed instructions on how to care for your wound. Read it carefully. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Now, do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I have the sugar. Diabetes, they call it. It’s been…under control, mostly. I try to eat right. My wife…again, she helped with that. She made sure I didn’t eat too much sweet stuff. It's why this foot problem is so serious, I think. I understand that. Will the sugar make it harder to heal?
DOCTOR: Yes, diabetes can make it more difficult to heal, unfortunately. High blood sugar levels can impair your body’s ability to fight infection and repair tissue. That's why it's especially important to keep your blood sugar under control while we're treating this foot. Are you currently monitoring your blood sugar levels regularly?
PATIENT: I used to. Every morning, like clockwork. But…since my wife passed… it’s been harder to keep up with things. I have the machine, still. And the little sticks. But… I haven't been as diligent. I should be, I know. It’s just… everything feels different now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s difficult to adjust to big changes. But it's crucial that we get your blood sugar under control to help this foot heal. I’m going to order a blood test to check your current A1c level—that will give us a good indication of your average blood sugar control over the past few months. I also recommend that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your diabetes management. They can help you adjust your medication or lifestyle to better control your blood sugar. In the meantime, try to stick to a healthy diet and avoid sugary foods and drinks. And if you haven’t been checking your blood sugar regularly, please start again. It's an important step in your healing process. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… no questions. I understand. Check the sugar, see the doctor, healthy eating. It’s a lot, but… I can try. For my walks. And… because it’s important. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I think that’s everything. I guess I'll be going then? If you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I have faith you can manage this. Remember, if you have any concerns or notice any worsening of your condition, don’t hesitate to call the office. And please, follow up with your primary care doctor as soon as possible. Here, let me help you with that. And take care. We’ll see you in a week. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. I’ll see you next week then. .
