DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you don’t mind. I’m Kahrin, by the way. Quick in, quick out is the plan, if that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kahrin. “Quick in, quick out” is perfectly alright, as long as we cover everything necessary. I do want to make sure we address all your concerns, even if it’s just to confirm things are as expected. I see here you had some bloodwork done on July 26th. Let's review those results together. Do you recall why we ordered those tests, or would you like me to refresh your memory?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, the bloodwork. It was…routine, right? Just checking everything was okay after I started that new job. Lots of travel, different time zones, wanted to make sure I wasn’t completely falling apart. I think you just wanted a baseline, honestly. Is everything…bad? You sound like something might be up.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Kahrin. You're right to pick up on my tone; I just want to be thorough. It's good you're aware of your body and potential changes with the new job and travel. The bloodwork did establish a baseline, as you said, and for the most part, everything looks quite good. However, there are a couple of things I’d like to discuss. Your white blood cell count was slightly elevated. It’s not dramatically high, but enough for me to want to investigate a little further. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been…tired, maybe? But honestly, that’s just the travel. Red-eye flights will do that to you. No actual sickness, though. Definitely no chills or sweats. And my temperature’s been normal as far as I can tell. I check it sometimes with that little scanner thing on my wrist. Is it a big deal? I’ve got a pretty important shipment leaving next week, I really don’t have time to be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Fatigue with travel is very common, and it’s good you haven’t had any fever or chills. Elevated white blood cell counts can be caused by many things – infection being one possibility, but also stress, dehydration, or even strenuous activity. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: I’m a logistician. Basically, I move stuff. Lots of stuff. All over. Right now, I’m coordinating a shipment of…well, it doesn’t matter what it is, exactly. But it's a big one, a lot of responsibility. Lots of phone calls, emails, making sure everything gets where it needs to be on time. It’s stressful, yeah, but I’m good at it. Lots of problem-solving. And honestly, the travel is the hardest part. It throws everything off. Do you need to know where I went? Because I can give you a list, it was pretty extensive.
DOCTOR: No, the destinations aren’t necessary at this point. Just knowing it's extensive travel is sufficient. It sounds like you have a demanding job with a lot of moving parts, and that could certainly be contributing to the slightly elevated white blood cell count. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, like diabetes, heart disease, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I eat okay, try to get some sleep when I can, but it’s hard with the schedule. No family history of anything major, either. My grandma had high blood pressure, but that’s it. And she lived to be ninety, so…I think I’m good on that front. Is it going to be something I need medication for? Because I really don't want to deal with that right now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about your overall health and family history. It sounds like you’ve been fortunate so far. And that’s a valid concern regarding medication. Given your travel schedule and generally good health, I’m not immediately inclined to start any medication. However, a slightly elevated white blood cell count does warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a repeat blood test in one week to see if the levels have changed. In the meantime, could you focus on staying well-hydrated – especially during your travels – and prioritize rest whenever possible?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, I can do that. Repeat blood test…that’s not terrible. I’ll try to drink more water. It's just…hard, you know? Always running. And sleep…forget about it. One week, right? Is there anything else? I have a call in about an hour and I need to prep. Honestly, if it's just a slightly elevated count and you think it's stress, can we just…monitor it? I’m really not keen on having to take time off right now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Kahrin. Given your demanding schedule and lack of other symptoms, my initial thought is to monitor it closely, as you suggest. A repeat test in one week is a reasonable first step. To be thorough, however, I'd like to ask a few questions about any recent infections or unusual exposures. Have you had any recent illnesses – even something minor like a cold?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I had a bit of a sniffle about two weeks ago, but it was gone in a day. Just allergies, I figured. And I was helping unload a shipment of…agricultural products last week. A little dusty, but nothing major. I wore a mask, but you know. It wasn’t like I was breathing in fertilizer all day or anything. Does that count? Honestly, I deal with weird stuff all the time. Mostly paperwork, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild sniffle two weeks ago and some dust exposure last week – that’s helpful to know. It’s possible either of those could contribute to a slightly elevated white blood cell count. To cover all bases, I’m going to order a complete blood count with differential. This will give us a more detailed breakdown of the different types of white blood cells, which can help us narrow down the cause. I'll also recommend a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels – just as a precaution. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you being thorough, I really do. But is it necessary? I mean, if it’s just stress from work, can’t we just agree to monitor things for a bit? I've got a pretty good track record of not, you know, falling apart. And I really don't want to deal with extra appointments right now. I’m happy to repeat the basic blood count, but all the extra panels…it feels a little much. Is there anything…specific you're worried about?
DOCTOR: You're right to question the necessity, and I apologize if I’m overwhelming you with tests. I understand your hesitation and respect your desire to avoid unnecessary appointments. The reason I suggested the additional panels is to rule out less common, but potentially serious, causes of an elevated white blood cell count. It's my responsibility to explore all possibilities, even if they are unlikely. However, given your history and the fact that you’re generally healthy, I am happy to modify the plan. Let’s agree to repeat the complete blood count in one week. We can then reassess the situation based on those results. If the levels remain elevated, we can discuss further investigation at that time. Does that sound like a reasonable compromise?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds…much better. Repeat the CBC, see what happens. That I can do. Honestly, that's a relief. And if it’s still up…well, we’ll deal with it then. But no extra tests right now, please. Okay. So, just the blood test next week? Do I need a referral or anything? And…is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Like, if I start feeling really sick, or…? Just give me the red flags. And then I really need to get going. Thanks, Doctor. You’ve been…patient. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Repeat CBC next week is the plan. No referral needed at this time. As for red flags, please contact me immediately if you develop any of the following: fever above 100.4°F, chills, persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or any signs of infection, such as a cough, sore throat, or body aches. Otherwise, focus on staying hydrated and prioritizing rest whenever possible. Thank you for your honesty, Kahrin. I understand your busy schedule and appreciate your trust. I’ll send the lab order to your preferred lab now. Have a safe day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
