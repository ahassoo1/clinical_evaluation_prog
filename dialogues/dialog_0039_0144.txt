DOCTOR: Hello Lilly, welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Kamahele, you say? It's… nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, I don't really need anything. My daughter just thought I should, you know, get a check-up. She worries too much. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just thought I'd see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of your daughter to encourage you to come in. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, even if you're feeling well. It’s good to have a baseline, you know?
PATIENT: Baseline? Is that like… a starting point? Honestly, doctor, I’ve been to enough doctors in my life. Mostly with my husband, bless his soul. He was always getting something. I just don't see the point of poking and prodding if everything feels alright. But if you insist… what exactly are you going to do?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. A baseline is a starting point - just a record of how things are today. And you're also right, no need for poking and prodding if it's not needed! We’ll start with some questions about your overall health, any past illnesses or surgeries you’ve had… things like that. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and maybe a quick look in your ears and throat. We can take it slow, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, questions, huh? Well, let’s see. I was married for… a long time. Very long. My husband, Arthur, he was a… a good man. Worked at the factory, mostly. Had a bit of trouble with his knees towards the end, but that’s neither here nor there. Surgeries… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was little, and… I think I had a cyst removed from my wrist once? Honestly, it was ages ago, and I don't remember much. I was probably very young. Is that helpful? I mostly just try to forget things these days. It’s easier that way.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It’s perfectly alright if you don't remember all the details. We'll just do our best. Tonsils and a cyst, noted. And it’s understandable wanting to forget things sometimes. Now, how about any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… hmm. Arthur had the flu a lot. Horrible cough. I always managed to avoid it, thank goodness. I did have… something with my gallbladder, years and years ago. They took the whole thing out. That was… unpleasant. I mostly just remember being very, very tired afterwards. And I had the shingles once, but that was ages ago too. Is this what you want to know? It feels like I’m recounting my life story! It’s all so… distant now.
DOCTOR: It is a bit like recounting your life story, but it’s important information, so thank you for sharing. Gallbladder removed and shingles… noted. Do you have any trouble with any ongoing conditions now?
PATIENT: Ongoing conditions? Like… what does that even mean? Honestly, doctor, I get a little ache in my hip sometimes, getting up from the chair. And my hands… they get a little stiff in the mornings, but nothing I can’t manage. Mostly just old age, I suppose. I don't go around complaining. I just… deal with it. Is that what you're asking about? Because if it is, honestly, I don't have any problems. Not really.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for clarification, and thank you for explaining. It sounds like you're very resilient! Yes, I was asking about things that bother you regularly, even if it’s just a little. The hip and the stiff hands… those are good to know. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my daughter, Susan, she’s the one who brought me here. She worries too much, as I said. She has two boys, my grandsons. They’re… alright. Don’t visit much, too busy with their lives, I suppose. My husband… he had a brother, but he passed away years ago. That’s about it, really. A very small family. Nothing exciting. Honestly, doctor, I don't think my family history is going to tell you anything important. We’re just… ordinary people.
DOCTOR: “Ordinary” is good! It’s important to know, even if it seems unremarkable. And it’s wonderful you have a daughter who cares for you. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can move on to a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I ate everything as a child, and I still mostly eat whatever Susan brings me. I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything. Arthur… he was allergic to bee stings, but that’s not relevant, is it? I don’t go around poking bees. Honestly, doctor, I’m a very simple person. No allergies, no fancy foods, no exciting problems. Just… plain. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: "Plain" is perfectly fine! It’s helpful to know you don't have any known allergies. And no, Arthur's bee sting allergy isn't relevant for you. Now, one last question before we move on to the physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, good gracious. Let me think… Susan gives me something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. I take it every morning, I think. And sometimes, she brings me something for my… bones? Calcium, maybe? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I don’t really keep track. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because she says I don’t get enough sunshine. That’s about it, I think. A little white pill, a bone thing, and vitamin D. Is that all you need to know? I really don’t like remembering these things, doctor. It makes my head ache.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Lilly. Blood pressure medication, calcium supplement, and vitamin D – noted. Don't worry about remembering; we can always double-check with your daughter if needed. Alright, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and have a quick look in your ears and throat. It shouldn't take long, and you can tell me to stop at any time. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. If you must. But don’t poke too much, dear. And please be gentle. My skin is rather sensitive these days. Just… get it over with quickly, if you can. And tell me if you find anything wrong. I don’t want any surprises. Honestly, doctor, I’m not very good with medical things. It makes me anxious. But if you insist… go ahead. But be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilly. I'll be as gentle as possible. I'll explain everything as I go along. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. It’s just to check for any unusual sounds. Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur, likely benign given age. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’ll just check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not critically so. Finally, I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear. Throat is slightly red, but no visible lesions. Overall, a routine examination. Now, do you have any concerns about anything that was done?
PATIENT: Routine, you say? Hmm. Well, my throat does feel a little scratchy sometimes, but I figured it was just the air conditioning. A little scratchy, that’s all. And what was that about my heart… a murmur? Is that bad? Honestly, doctor, you’re starting to worry me now. A murmur sounds very serious. Is it something I need to be concerned about? And my blood pressure… is that really too high? I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Are you sure you’re not overreacting? Honestly, I think I preferred it when you were just asking questions. Now you're poking and prodding and saying things that scare me. A murmur! What does that even mean?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilly, and I apologize if I caused any worry. Let me explain everything clearly. The murmur I heard is very common in people your age, and it’s often harmless. It’s usually just the sound of blood flowing through a normal heart valve. We can monitor it over time if you’d like, but it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem. As for your blood pressure, 140/85 is slightly elevated, but not critically high. We can discuss lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, to help manage it, or if needed, consider medication. We don’t have to make any decisions right now. We can start by just keeping an eye on it. It’s important to remember that everyone's body is different, and a little variation is normal. Now, is there anything I can clarify about those findings?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… Diet and exercise? Oh, dear. At my age? Honestly, doctor, I don’t think I’m up for any strenuous activity. And my diet… well, Susan mostly controls that, and she’s very particular about everything. I just eat what she gives me. Honestly, it all sounds very overwhelming. A murmur, high blood pressure, lifestyle changes… it's all too much to take in. I just want to be left alone, mostly. Is there anything wrong with me that requires immediate attention? Anything that I need to worry about right now? Because if there isn’t, I’d really like to go home and have a cup of tea. Honestly, this whole visit has been rather upsetting.
DOCTOR: You're right to feel overwhelmed, Lilly, and I apologize again for upsetting you. Let me be very clear: there is nothing that requires immediate attention right now. The murmur is likely benign, and your blood pressure is only slightly elevated. We can manage both of these things with regular check-ups and, if you're comfortable, some minor lifestyle adjustments. We don't have to make any drastic changes today. You are perfectly safe to go home and have a cup of tea. I’ll write down a few notes for your daughter regarding follow-up appointments and a referral to a cardiologist for a formal assessment of the murmur, just for peace of mind. But there's no need to worry or panic. Is that reassuring?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… more doctors? Oh, dear. Honestly, it never ends, does it? Alright then. Follow-up appointments and… a cardiologist. As long as it doesn't involve any poking or prodding, I suppose. And as long as I can go home and have my tea. You promise there’s nothing seriously wrong with me? Because if there is, I really don't want to know. Honestly, I'm a very simple woman, and I don't handle stress very well. Just… write down your notes, and let me go home. I need to lie down and calm my nerves. And tell my daughter to stop worrying so much. It's bad for my health. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilly. I’ll write down everything for Susan, and we’ll take things one step at a time. And I promise, there’s no immediate cause for concern. Just routine follow-up and a bit of extra monitoring. Here's a note for the cardiologist, and here’s a schedule for your next appointment with me in three months. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And I'll be sure to mention to Susan to take it easy on you!
