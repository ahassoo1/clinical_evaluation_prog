DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's about this tiredness. It’s just…getting worse. And it’s embarrassing to even say this, but I’ve been…eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, but enough that I figured I should probably mention it to someone. It started a few weeks ago, and now I just…crave it. Is that even possible? It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: That’s…certainly something I haven’t heard every day, Candis. But it’s good you're telling me. We want to understand what’s going on. The tiredness is concerning, and the…dirt-eating, as you put it, is something we need to investigate. To start, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m collapsing or anything. It's just…everything feels like a huge effort. Getting out of bed, even. And I used to be so active! I volunteered at the library, helped my neighbor with her garden...now, even those things feel impossible. I just want to sit. And frankly, I don’t have the energy to do much of anything else. It's been building for a while, but it's really gotten bad in the last month.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset of fatigue, worsening over the last month. And it’s impacting your daily activities, making things you used to enjoy difficult. That helps. Now, when you say "tiredness," is it more of a physical exhaustion, or do you feel mentally fatigued, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, both, definitely both. My body just feels…heavy. Like I’m dragging it around. But my brain feels foggy too. I forget things constantly – not major things, you know, but little things. Where I put my keys, what I was about to say…it’s irritating. It's not like real forgetting, just…scattered. And honestly, it’s probably just old age, if you want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this, Candis. And it's never too late to investigate what's going on, regardless of age. We all experience changes as we get older, but these symptoms warrant a closer look. Let's talk a little bit more about this craving for dirt. Can you describe what kind of dirt it is?
PATIENT: Honestly? Just…dirt. From the garden. It’s red clay mostly. I don’t go digging for anything fancy. It just…smells earthy. I know it’s strange. I usually find it when I'm weeding. It's not like I'm actively seeking it out, it's more like…when I’m out there, I just…have to have a little bit. And it makes my stomach feel…settled, if that makes any sense. It's awful, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, red clay from your garden, and it seems to have a somewhat…soothing effect on your stomach. That's…helpful information, believe it or not. This craving, combined with the fatigue and mental fog…it’s raising some questions. Now, Candis, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat. I don't love eating, if that makes sense. It’s just…routine. I used to enjoy cooking, but now it feels like a chore. I mostly just have a little soup or something simple. And I’ve been a bit…constipated, if you must know. Another lovely detail to share.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of this, Candis. It's all important. Loss of appetite and constipation…okay. And have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Probably. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself in…well, I don’t remember the last time I weighed myself. I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing. I'm not a big person to begin with.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potential unintentional weight loss. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox…nothing serious. My blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but the doctor said it wasn’t anything to worry about, just watch my salt. I don’t take any regular medication, though. And I haven’t been to the hospital for…oh, goodness, decades, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past. And no current medications. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. I've always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Until…well, until all this started. It’s just…strange. I've never felt like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, Candis, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had…arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. And my brother…he had some trouble with his heart, but he didn't take care of himself, if you know what I mean. Smoked too much, drank too much. My father was always healthy as a horse, though. Really strong. That’s about it, really. Nothing major, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your brother. And a healthy father. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink since…well, not since my husband passed away, and that was…a long time ago. I just don't have the taste for it anymore. I prefer tea. Earl Grey, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or alcohol. Now, Candis, I’m going to ask about allergies, just to be thorough. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything. And I haven’t had any trouble with insect bites or anything like that. I can’t remember ever having an allergic reaction. Honestly, I'm a pretty boring case, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Candis. Everyone is different, and it's good to rule things out. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a general look at your overall health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could please sit back on the exam table, that would be great. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not critically high. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. And now, I'll listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, but I do detect some tenderness in the lower quadrants. And I notice some mild swelling. Now, I’ll check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. I'm also noticing some pallor in your skin, Candis. All in all, the exam shows some concerning signs - the tenderness in your abdomen, the pallor, and the elevated blood pressure. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think we need to run some blood tests to investigate further. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly. What are you looking for? I told you, I just eat a little dirt. It’s not like I have some terrible disease. But fine. Do your tests. Just…get it over with. I’m not fond of needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Candis. The blood tests will help us rule out a number of possibilities and pinpoint what might be causing your symptoms. We’ll be looking at your complete blood count, iron levels, vitamin deficiencies, and some basic metabolic markers. Specifically, given the dirt-eating, we want to check for iron deficiency anemia and rule out any underlying absorption issues. We'll also check your kidney and liver function. It’s important to investigate, even if it seems unlikely. We need to understand what's driving this behavior and address any underlying health concerns. I’ll order the tests now. The lab technician will draw a small amount of blood, and it will take a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions about the tests or the process?
PATIENT: No. Just…when can I leave? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab technician is ready whenever you are. They'll give you instructions for after the blood draw. Once you've had the blood tests, you're free to go. I’ll have the lab results sent to me, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as severe fatigue, shortness of breath, or significant abdominal pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for your patience, Candis. I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Here’s a referral for the lab. The technician is just down the hall.
PATIENT: .
