DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Durig. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my color, I think. My skin, it’s gotten quite yellow. Not a good look, and I’ve been feeling… poorly. The young man at the clinic said something about my liver, but honestly, I don't recall all the details. It’s been a bit of a blur lately.
DOCTOR: Yellowing of the skin… that’s jaundice, Mrs. Durig. And the young man was right to consider the liver. It’s a common sign of liver issues. "Poorly" is rather vague, though. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, jaundice. That sounds right. It’s… uncomfortable, if that makes sense. Not pain, exactly. Just… off. And poorly… well, I tire easily. Much more than usual. And my appetite has vanished. Food just doesn’t seem appealing anymore. I’ve lost a bit of weight, I suspect, though I haven’t weighed myself recently. It’s all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss alongside the jaundice. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a difficult question. It feels like… weeks, perhaps? A month or two? Time slips away from me these days. I think the yellowing started more recently, maybe a few weeks. But the tiredness... that’s been building for longer. I honestly can’t say for certain. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It's… adequate, Mrs. Durig, though precision is always preferred. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Such personal questions! Well… they’re paler than usual, I suppose. And… looser. Not terribly alarming, just… different. I haven't paid much attention, if I'm being honest. Old women have all sorts of… irregularities. Is that relevant, Doctor? I’m terribly sorry; I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Pale and looser stools… right. And have you noticed any dark urine?
PATIENT: Dark urine… Now, that… I believe so. Yes, it’s been… darker than usual. A sort of tea color, perhaps? I haven’t thought much about it. Everything feels… off, as I said. It’s hard to keep track of everything. Is this about my liver, Doctor? You mentioned it earlier. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It could be indicative of a liver issue, Mrs. Durig. It’s certainly concerning. We need to run some tests to determine the cause. Now, have you had any abdominal pain, any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. And thankfully, no vomiting. Just… a general unwellness. And… … sometimes I feel a bit confused. Not all the time, but… moments. Like I’m trying to grasp a thought and it slips away. Is that normal? I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. I'm just an old woman.
DOCTOR: Confusion is… not ideal, Mrs. Durig. Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with hepatitis, or any other liver problems?
PATIENT: Hepatitis… Oh dear. I… I honestly don’t recall. I’ve had so many doctors over the years. I think… many years ago, perhaps in my thirties, there was some mention of something… an infection, perhaps? But I was young and didn’t pay much attention. It wasn’t serious, I don’t believe. They gave me some pills, and it went away. Is that helpful? It’s all so long ago. I apologize for being so useless.
DOCTOR: It's… partially helpful, Mrs. Durig. We'll need to try and obtain records, if possible. Now, have you ever had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, my gallbladder... I believe… yes. Many years ago. It caused me a great deal of trouble. I remember the surgery, though not much else. It was quite painful, I recall. A long recovery. Is that… relevant to this current trouble? I truly hope this won’t require another surgery. I’m not as strong as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Possibly relevant. Alright. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No prescriptions. I try to avoid them if possible. I prefer to… manage things naturally. A bit of chamomile tea, a good rest… that sort of thing. I haven't needed anything serious in years. Though, my friend gives me something for my arthritis. A small white pill, I believe. I don't know the name of it. It doesn’t seem to be helping much lately. Is that important?
DOCTOR: An unlisted medication… wonderful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to be quite hardy, you know. A strong constitution. Though, I do get a bit of a rash if I handle certain flowers… roses, I think. But that’s hardly a medical allergy. Is that what you mean? I apologize for being so vague. I'm just an old woman, as I said. I don't have much recollection of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your family history. Were any of your parents or siblings ever diagnosed with liver disease, hepatitis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, my family... That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My parents are long gone, and I haven’t spoken to my siblings in… well, decades. We weren’t close. I believe my mother had some sort of… illness, many years ago. But I don’t recall the details. It wasn’t liver-related, I don’t think. We didn’t discuss such things openly, you know. Is that helpful? I truly wish I could be of more assistance. I'm just an old woman with a poor memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll need to palpate your abdomen. It may be slightly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I do hope it won't be too unpleasant. My bones aren’t what they used to be. I apologize if I make a fuss. Just be gentle, Doctor, if you would.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. I also note some mild swelling. Your sclera – the whites of your eyes – are markedly yellowed, confirming the jaundice. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs now… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, though breath sounds are a bit weak. Now, I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will help us assess your liver function, and the CT scan will give us a better look at your liver and other abdominal organs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Blood work and a scan. That sounds… thorough. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Will it take long? And… will it be painful? I worry about being poked and prodded. I truly don't understand much of what you're saying, Doctor. Liver function… CT scan… it’s all rather overwhelming. Is it bad? Are you… concerned? I just want to know what’s wrong with me. And how long this will take. I have a luncheon next week, you see. With my friend. I wouldn't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: The blood work is routine, Mrs. Durig. A few vials of blood, that's all. The CT scan involves lying still in a scanner for a short period. It's not painful, but you must remain perfectly still. As for being concerned… your symptoms are concerning enough to warrant further investigation. We need to rule out serious causes. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now and schedule the CT scan for tomorrow. We’ll discuss the results when they’re available. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No further questions. Just… please be quick. And… gentle. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you, Doctor. I think I’ll just… wait for the nurse. I’m rather tired now. It’s been a long morning. .
