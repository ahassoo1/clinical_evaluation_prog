DOCTOR: Right. Alese Glymph, 62. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s… my tummy, really. It’s been hurting quite badly, on and off. It’s down low, mostly. I… I have trouble remembering exactly when it started, but it’s been a few weeks, at least. It comes and goes, and when it does come, it’s a rather significant pain. I believe Dr. Aris mentioned something about… well, something about my system being a bit off-kilter, years ago? It all gets rather muddled, you see.
DOCTOR: Years ago. Right. Well, "off-kilter" isn’t a diagnosis, is it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Dr. Aris was a… a very colorful man. He did mention something about my… lupus, I think? Something autoimmune. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t terribly good at remembering details even then. I understand it causes… flares, doesn’t it? And I believe this pain might be connected to that, though I couldn’t say for certain. It just feels… similar to things I’ve experienced before, vaguely.
DOCTOR: Lupus… yes, I see a note from Dr. Aris, quite a while back. But no recent follow-up. And frankly, "vague recollections" aren't very helpful. Is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I apologize. I truly do try to be more precise. It does come and go, yes. It’s not… a steady ache, not at all. It’s more like… sharp stabs, really. And it’ll come on suddenly, then fade away after… well, sometimes an hour, sometimes longer. It’s been difficult to pinpoint. And I do seem to recall… feeling quite nauseous a time or two when it’s particularly bad. But I’m not even certain that’s connected, truthfully. My memory… it's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Sharp stabs… nausea. Alright. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me see. Oh, yes, I’ve been feeling rather… fatigued lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And… well, this might be unrelated, but my appetite hasn’t been particularly strong. I haven’t been eating as much. Oh, and I believe I’ve had… a slight fever, a time or two. Just a little one, nothing alarming. I haven’t bothered taking my temperature, truthfully. Would you like me to start keeping track of things? Perhaps write it all down? I'm afraid I'm just not very good at remembering details as they happen.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, loss of appetite, low-grade fever… it’s all very nonspecific. Look, I’m going to need a more concrete history if we’re going to figure this out. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh… dear. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? Well, I suppose… no, nothing particularly different. Everything seems… regular, for lack of a better term. Perhaps a little… looser, a time or two, but I attributed that to the nausea, if I’m being honest. I haven't paid terribly close attention, I confess. I truly apologize for being so vague. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness. No, no blood. Definitely not. I… I would certainly remember that, wouldn’t I? That sounds rather alarming. No, no blood at all. Absolutely not. I… I hope you don’t mind my being so… easily startled. These questions are… a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, yes, I take something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And… a little something for my arthritis, just as needed. Celecoxib, perhaps? And… a multivitamin, just a general one. I do occasionally take something for heartburn, but that’s only when it flares up. I can’t recall the name, truthfully. It’s… over-the-counter, I believe. Would it be helpful if I brought a list of everything I take? I do have a rather disorganized pill organizer at home.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. Well, I did have a bit of an upset stomach once after taking some… antibiotic, years ago. But I don't believe it was a true allergy, just… a bit of indigestion. Should I be concerned about that? It was a long time ago, and I haven't taken that particular medication since.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. I'm going to do a quick abdominal exam, if you don’t mind. Just lie back on the exam table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. An exam. Very well. I… I hope I'm not too much trouble. I'm afraid I haven't had a thorough exam in quite some time. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. I'll listen to your abdomen first. Normal bowel sounds… diminished, perhaps, but present. Now, I’m going to palpate. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… a little tender, yes. Down low, on the right side. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And… yes, a little bit here too. It’s… hard to pinpoint exactly, truthfully. It seems to shift around a bit. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant… and left. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Tympanic throughout. Right. Well, it’s nonspecific, but given your history and the tenderness, we need to rule a few things out. I’m going to order a CBC, a CMP, and a urinalysis. We’ll also do a stool sample to check for infection.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Tests. Very well. A CBC… and a CMP… and a urinalysis. And a stool sample. Will these tests take long? And… will they be uncomfortable? I confess, I’m not terribly fond of providing samples. I just want to feel better, truthfully. This pain is… quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: The blood work is straightforward, just a quick prick. The urinalysis is… well, you know. And the stool sample… it’s not pleasant, but necessary. It’ll take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, if you develop a fever over 101, severe pain, or vomiting, go to the emergency room immediately. Here are the requisitions. The lab is down the hall. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they come in. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A fever… severe pain… vomiting. I understand. Thank you, Dr. Osga. I… I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. It's just… everything feels so uncertain. I'll try to remain calm, and I will be sure to call if anything changes. I truly hope we can determine the cause of this pain soon. Perhaps a list of what I should eat and avoid? I'm often unsure what's best when I'm feeling unwell. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Yes, well, stick to bland foods – toast, rice, bananas. Avoid anything spicy or fatty. And frankly, given your vague symptoms, I'm not ruling out irritable bowel syndrome. We'll see what the tests say. Good day. .
