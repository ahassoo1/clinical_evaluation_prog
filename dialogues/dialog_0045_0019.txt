DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta, good to see you. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor Billman… yes. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me? My wife… she wants… a baby. We are older, you see. She thinks maybe… we need help to make it happen. I forget things easy, so I came with her. She said to ask about… planning. Yes, planning.
DOCTOR: Planning, alright. Well, that's... ambitious. Seventy years old and wanting to start a family. Let’s be frank, Mr. Carlotta, this is… unusual. First, let's clarify. Your wife is… of reproductive age, is she?
PATIENT: Reproductive… that means… can have baby, yes? She is… sixty-two. Yes, sixty-two. Strong woman, my wife. Always been strong. But… maybe not as strong now. That is why we are here, I think. To see if… possible. I don't know all the words, Doctor. It's confusing.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two… right. Well, Mr. Carlotta, to be perfectly honest, the chances of a natural conception at that age are… extremely low. We'd need to consider assisted reproductive technologies, which come with their own risks and, frankly, aren't always successful. Before we even think about that, let's get a complete medical history. Have you or your wife had any children previously?
PATIENT: No children. Never. Always wanted… but life… life got in the way. Worked too much. Now… now we have time. But… maybe body not good enough. I had some trouble with… my back. Old injury. She has… little aches. Nothing serious, she says. Just… old. Is that bad, Doctor? Is being old bad for having baby?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Carlotta, let’s not use the term “bad.” Aging naturally brings changes. A woman's egg quality declines with age, and there's a significantly increased risk of complications during pregnancy – things like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, chromosomal abnormalities… the list goes on. And your back injury... that’s something we’ll need to assess as well. Pregnancy puts a lot of strain on the body. Now, let’s start with you. Any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Doctor, I forget so easy! I see the… heart doctor, sometimes. My heart… skips a beat. Not often. And… I take pills for… blood pressure. Small pills, blue ones. That is all I remember. Maybe there is more. My wife knows better. She keeps the papers. I just… feel tired, sometimes. Is that a problem? Being tired?
DOCTOR: A heart condition and high blood pressure… alright. That adds to the complexity. Pregnancy can significantly strain the cardiovascular system. Being "tired" isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Carlotta. We need specifics. Have you been diagnosed with anything specific related to your heart?
PATIENT: Doctor… I think… arrhythmia? Yes, that sounds right. The heart doctor said… sometimes fast, sometimes slow. He gave me the pills. I take one every morning. And… he said to take it easy. But I like to work with my hands. I make little models. Metal and plastic. Keeps me busy. Is that okay? Making models? Will that hurt the… baby plans?
DOCTOR: Arrhythmia… right. And you're on medication for it. Look, Mr. Carlotta, frankly, pursuing pregnancy with your existing health conditions carries considerable risk. Making models… that’s not the primary concern here. We need a very thorough cardiac evaluation to determine if your heart can handle the stress of pregnancy. I'm going to need you to get a referral from your cardiologist. A stress test, an echocardiogram… the whole nine yards. I'm also going to order some blood work for both you and your wife, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Stress test… echocardiogram… So many words, Doctor! My wife will be very worried about all these tests. She just wants a baby… but she is scared too. Will the tests… tell us if it is possible? If… we can have a baby safely? I hope… I hope it is not too much trouble. And… how much will all this cost? We are… retired now.
