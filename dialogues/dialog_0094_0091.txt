DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, lately... I does be feeling very thirsty all the time. And hungry too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, is like I still need more. Is really bothering me, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling thirsty and hungry all the time, even after eating, that’s definitely something we need to look into. That started recently, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. I think it start... maybe about a month now? Not sure exactly. Things does be a little hazy sometimes, you know? But I remember it wasn't like this before. I used to eat and feel satisfied for hours. Now... not so much. It’s just… different.
DOCTOR: I see. A month or so. And you said it feels different from how you usually experience fullness after eating?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is right. Before, a good plate of doubles or a roti would keep me going 'til dinner time. Now… I eat the same thing, same amount, and maybe an hour after, I feeling like I could eat again. It’s not a comfortable feeling, you know? Like something missing. And the thirst… oh lord, the thirst! I does drink so much water, but it just don’t seem to help.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, increased thirst and increased hunger, despite eating normal amounts of food, for about a month. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. Well, I does be going to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. I have to get up, you know? That is not good for an old woman like me. And… sometimes I feeling a little tired. Not all the time, but sometimes I just don’t have the energy like before. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Increased urination, especially at night, and some fatigue… Those are all important things to note. Have you experienced any changes in your vision, Bianca?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… Well, now that you mention it… things does be a little blurry sometimes. I thought it was just my eyes getting old, you know? I haven't been to the eye doctor in years. But yes, I does have to strain a little to see things far away now. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant. Any unexplained weight loss, Bianca?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh… well, I haven't been weighing myself, you know? I does just wear my clothes, and if they feel a little loose… I just figure is the heat. But now that you ask… maybe I have lost a little. Not much, I don't think. But maybe. I haven't been eating less, though. In fact, I eating more!
DOCTOR: Okay. So, increased thirst, increased hunger, increased urination – particularly at night – fatigue, blurry vision, and possible weight loss, all developing over the past month. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't been sick with anything. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know? Nothing serious. I had a little cough a few weeks back, but that went away with some bush tea and rest. But no fever, no flu, nothing like that. I does try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my fruits and vegetables.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I does have a little high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little tablet for that, every morning. Other than that… not much. I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my arm, but that heal up good. And I does have the usual aches and pains of getting old, like I said. Nothing major. I haven't been to the doctor much over the years. Is mostly just the blood pressure tablet I take.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication. And you had a broken arm in the past. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear... let me see. The name... it's a small white tablet. I does get it from the pharmacy every month. It's… hmm… I think the doctor said it start with an "A"? But I can't remember the full name, sorry. I does just ask the pharmacist for my blood pressure tablet, and they always give me the right one. I don’t like to bother my head with remembering names. Is too much for an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Bianca. We can look it up. Okay, it looks like you’re currently taking Amlodipine 5mg daily for your high blood pressure. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is it! Amlodipine. That's the one. Thank you for finding that for me. I always forget these things, you know? Is good you have it written down. Now, what does all this mean, Doctor? Is something serious wrong with me? I does be getting so worried sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, Bianca. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, my family... let me see. My mother, she was a very strong woman. She had a little trouble with her feet towards the end, the doctor said it was something with the sugar. She had to be careful what she eat. And my brother, he was always a little weak. He got sick a few years back, and they said it was the sugar too. He had to take injections. So, yes, my mother and my brother, they both had the sugar. Is that what you mean, Doctor? The diabetes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Bianca, that’s exactly what I mean. Given your symptoms – increased thirst, increased urination, increased hunger, fatigue, possible weight loss – and your family history of diabetes, it's important we investigate that possibility. I'd like to perform a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what is going on with me. I does be feeling so tired all the time, and the thirst… oh lord, the thirst! So, yes, please do what you need to do. I trust your judgement. Let's get it over with, eh?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your blood pressure. Then I’ll take a look at your feet. Afterwards, we'll do a simple blood test. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Your blood pressure is 150/90. That’s a little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Now, let's take a look at your feet. Your feet feel warm to the touch, and your pulses are present, which is good. I notice some mild dryness, but no open sores or signs of infection at this time. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. Sometimes they feel a little heavy, especially at the end of the day. But no numbness or tingling. Is just a little heavy feeling, you know? Like I been walking too much. But no pain or anything like that. Is good to hear the pulses is good, though. I was worried about that. My mother, she had trouble with her feet towards the end, so I does always be watching mine.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’re being proactive about checking your feet. Alright, Bianca. Based on your symptoms, your family history, and this quick physical exam, I am concerned about the possibility of diabetes. To confirm this, I'm going to order a fasting blood sugar test and an HbA1c test, which will give us a picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. Is it bad, Doctor? Is it serious? I does be getting so worried. I just want to know what is going on with me, you know? And what can I do about it. Is there something I can start doing now, even before we get the results? Is there a special diet or something?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Bianca. It’s too early to say definitively whether you have diabetes, but the tests will give us the answers we need. If it is diabetes, it’s a manageable condition. Many people live long, healthy lives with diabetes. And yes, there are things you can start doing now. Even before we have the results, I recommend staying well-hydrated—continue to drink plenty of water. And try to focus on eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit sugary drinks and processed foods as much as possible. Regular, moderate exercise is also helpful, if you're able. I'll write you a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you develop a meal plan that’s right for you. Also, I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for when the test results are available, so we can discuss them and plan a course of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. A dietitian, that would be very helpful. I does be cooking for my husband, you know, and I want to make sure we both eat healthy. And I will try my best to drink more water and eat better. Is just… hard sometimes, you know? But I will try. When will we get the results, Doctor? And… how long does it take to see the dietitian? I does be a little worried about the cost, too. Is it covered by insurance? I don't have much money, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s great that you’re willing to make these changes, Bianca, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. Regarding the dietitian, I can write a referral to a local clinic that offers a sliding scale fee based on your income. That means the cost will be adjusted based on what you can afford. We can also explore any available community resources that may offer free or low-cost nutrition counseling. I don’t have the exact details of all the programs, but my nurse can help you find them. As for the insurance, unfortunately, I don't know the specifics of your coverage since you're currently uninsured. But we can discuss options for financial assistance once we have a better understanding of the costs involved. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
