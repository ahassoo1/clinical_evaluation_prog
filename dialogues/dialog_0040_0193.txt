DOCTOR: Right. Jammal Goodstein, 39. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a bit embarrassing, truly. But I have been… passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, if you understand. It started, oh, maybe two weeks ago? It is not painful, not exactly. Just… frequent. And sometimes… loud. It makes me feel… self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Passing gas, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… a lot. I eat normally, I think. Not much has changed in my diet, truly. I have always liked my potatoes, but I eat the same amount. And cabbage, sometimes. But not every day. It is just… more now. I do not know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Potatoes and cabbage… right. And you said this started about two weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. About two weeks, give or take a few days. I remember because it was around the time my cousin visited. He stayed for a week. I did not think much of it at first, you understand. Everyone has gas, yes? But it has not gone away. It is… constant, now.
DOCTOR: Constant, two weeks… Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No stomach pain, truly. Maybe a little… bloating, sometimes, after I eat. But not always. And no… changes in my, how do you say… bathroom habits? Everything else is normal, if you understand. Just the gas. A lot of gas.
DOCTOR: Bloating, sometimes. Alright. And have you noticed anything different about your diet around that time?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. Now that you mention it… my cousin, he brought some… sausages. From back home. Very good sausages, truly! I ate a few… maybe four or five over the week he stayed. I do not usually eat sausage. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Sausages… Possibly. Some people have trouble digesting certain foods. Alright. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, truly. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. But, you know, maybe these sausages were… different?
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you been recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. Never have, truly. I try to stay healthy. Just a bit of vitamin D in the winter, maybe. But that is it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like… perhaps some dietary indiscretion. The sausages, most likely. Try to avoid them for a while and see if things improve. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
PATIENT: So, you think it is the sausages, Doctor? That makes sense, truly. I will try to avoid them. And if it does not improve… what should I do then? Is there something I can eat to help? Perhaps a tea?
DOCTOR: Look, it's gas. Most likely just your system adjusting. If it doesn’t improve in another week, come back and we’ll talk about… possibly some over-the-counter remedies. But honestly, I doubt it will come to that. Don't bother with the tea. It’s probably just a temporary thing. Now, is there anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I understand. A week, then. I will avoid the sausages. And no tea. Thank you, Doctor. No, truly, I do not think there is anything else. Just the gas. I appreciate you seeing me, truly. It was… embarrassing, but you have put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s what I’m here for. I'll make a note in your chart. Let’s get you scheduled for a follow-up, just in case. Don't worry about it. It’s very common. Now… next patient.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you very much. Goodbye. .
