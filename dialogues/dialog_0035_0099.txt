DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Alzoubi. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I received some results from a test… a test of my insides, I believe they called it an “endo test,” and it wasn’t quite right. My regular doctor suggested I come in for a discussion. I’m a bit worried, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. An “endo test” – you likely mean an endoscopy, a procedure where we look at your digestive tract. And it's perfectly normal to be worried when you get results that aren’t what you hoped for. We'll go through everything together. First, can you tell me a little bit more about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For several months now, I’ve been experiencing… discomfort in my stomach. Not constant pain, but a sort of… unsettled feeling. And some difficulty digesting my food, if you understand. It was becoming quite frequent, so my doctor thought it best to investigate. I’ve also noticed a… a change in my bowel habits, though I hesitate to speak so plainly. It’s been… looser than usual, if you follow me. I do apologize for being so… descriptive.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Denis. It's important to be thorough, and I appreciate you being so open. “Unsettled feeling,” difficulty digesting, and a change in bowel habits… that gives me a good starting point. And how long ago did you start noticing these changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Let me think… it began, I believe, around late February. So, approximately five months ago. It wasn’t immediate, you understand. It started subtly, a little different than usual, and gradually became more pronounced. I initially dismissed it as something I ate, or perhaps a temporary upset. But it persisted, and that’s when I decided to see my regular doctor. She was very attentive, and that led to the… endo test.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about five months of progressively worsening symptoms. And the endoscopy report… it shows some inflammation in your colon. We need to discuss what that means and what our next steps should be. Before we dive into that, let me ask a few broader questions, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard. I’ve always been relatively healthy. I do have some… arthritis in my hands, which is typical for someone my age, I suppose, but nothing serious. My doctor monitors it periodically, but it doesn’t require any specific treatment beyond occasional over-the-counter remedies. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything else, and I haven’t had any major surgeries. I am a widow, you see, and my late husband always said I was too stubborn to get sick.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Denis. And it sounds like you've been very proactive about your health. No major surgeries, arthritis managed with over-the-counter remedies… that’s helpful information. Now, regarding your family history – do you know of anyone in your family who has had problems with their digestive system, like colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we are Aztec, and we didn’t traditionally keep such detailed medical records. My parents passed away when I was very young, and I didn’t have much contact with extended family. I know my grandmother, on my mother’s side, suffered from some sort of… stomach ailment, but I never knew the specifics. It was a long time ago, and it wasn’t discussed openly. There were… other concerns in those days, you understand. I sincerely apologize for not being more helpful. It’s not something I’ve ever thought about before.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. It's very common for people not to have detailed family medical histories, especially with cultural or generational differences. You've given me what you know, and that’s what’s important. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My late husband was a smoker, unfortunately, but I always refused. It simply didn’t appeal to me. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps two or three times a week, but I wouldn’t consider myself a heavy drinker. I’ve always tried to live a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I enjoy gardening, and I walk for at least thirty minutes every day, weather permitting, of course. I do try to maintain a balanced diet, though I confess I have a fondness for sweets.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Denis. A healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet is very important. The occasional glass of wine isn’t a concern. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for my arthritis, Doctor. Nothing regular, perhaps once or twice a month when it flares up. And a daily multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. I do take a calcium supplement as well, as my doctor suggested, to help with bone density. Other than that, no. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I’ve always believed in letting my body heal itself, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed, a daily multivitamin, and calcium supplements. That’s good to know. Alright, Denis. So, to summarize: you've been experiencing discomfort, digestive issues, and a change in bowel habits for about five months. The endoscopy showed some inflammation in your colon. You're otherwise healthy, with no significant medical history, and a family history that's largely unknown. You maintain a healthy lifestyle, and you only take occasional medication for arthritis. Given these findings, the most likely explanation is some form of inflammatory bowel disease, such as colitis. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this and determine the specific cause. Would you be open to having some blood work done, and potentially another, more detailed stool sample analysis?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Whatever you deem necessary to understand what’s happening. I trust your judgment entirely. Blood work and a stool sample… that sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m eager to get to the bottom of this, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to have a plan. And if you require any further information from me, please don’t hesitate to ask.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ve ordered the tests. The lab results should be back in about a week. In the meantime, I want you to continue with your regular diet, but please avoid anything that seems to aggravate your symptoms. And if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or bloody stools, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I will certainly avoid anything that worsens my symptoms, and I will be vigilant for those signs you mentioned. And yes, a follow-up appointment next week would be ideal. Thank you for your thoroughness and your kindness. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place. Here… is this form all I need to take with me to the lab?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all you need. It has all the necessary information for the lab technicians. And Denis, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You’ve been most helpful, and I truly appreciate your time and attention. I will be sure to contact the office if any questions arise. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next week. .
