DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’ve started to droop a bit. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids for a few weeks. I understand it's concerning when things change like that. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. First, can you tell me more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not like… a sudden thing, you understand? It’s gradual. It started, I think, with my arms. Lifting things felt… harder. Now it’s also in my legs, a bit. Climbing stairs is… more effort than it used to be. It’s hard to describe exactly. It's like they get tired quickly. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Gedalya. Gradual onset is important information. And you said it’s in both your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though… I think it started more noticeably in my arms. It's… symmetrical, if that's the right word? Both arms feel about the same, and both legs, too. It’s not like one side is worse than the other. Not yet, anyway. I hope not, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, symmetrical weakness, started in the arms and progressing to the legs. Good to know. And you mentioned drooping eyelids – is that happening on both sides as well?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. Both eyelids. Again, it's… gradual. I didn’t notice it immediately, to be honest. It was my ex-wife who pointed it out, actually. She said I looked… tired. Which, well… I am sometimes, but this felt different. It's gotten more noticeable over the past week or so. It's frustrating, because it makes it harder to keep my eyes open sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Both eyelids drooping gradually, and also making it hard to keep your eyes open. That's a good detail. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. I haven't had any trouble swallowing or speaking. My vision seems okay, though I do wear glasses, so it’s hard to say if it's changed. I guess… I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to… everything, to be honest. It’s been a stressful year.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, numbness, tingling, trouble swallowing or speaking. Vision seems stable, despite wearing glasses. A little more tired, but attributing that to stress. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, at least. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. I broke my arm once when I was a boy, but that’s it. I don't take any regular medication. I haven't been to the hospital in… well, it must be over ten years, I think. Nothing serious ever, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history, no medications, and haven’t been hospitalized in over ten years. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My parents are both… passed away now. My father died of a heart attack when I was quite young. My mother… she had some sort of… I believe it was a neurological condition, but I wasn't very close to her later in life, and I wasn't involved in her medical care. I don't know much about it, to be honest. My sister is still alive, she lives in Stockholm. I haven’t spoken to her in a while. I don't know if she has any health problems. I wish I could tell you more. It’s not something we ever really discussed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Gedalya. It’s okay if you don’t have a lot of information. We work with what we have. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and certainly not. I don’t smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a year. And I’ve never used any recreational drugs. I try to keep a fairly healthy lifestyle, all things considered. Though, I do admit, my job can be quite stressful, and I haven’t been eating as well as I should lately. It's difficult to find the time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Stressful job and difficulty finding time to eat well. Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and look at your eyes a little more closely. It shouldn't take too long.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, Gedalya, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I think so. Is that alright? It feels… strange. It doesn’t feel like I have as much control as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Now, can you frown for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… a bit harder than it used to be, I think. My face feels… stiff. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Gedalya. Okay. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Here you go. Is that… strong enough? It doesn't feel as powerful as it used to, honestly. My hands feel… a little shaky too.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you lift your arms?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… difficult. They feel heavy. And they're starting to shake. I can’t hold them up for very long, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Gedalya. I’ve done enough of the initial exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like you're experiencing progressive weakness, particularly in your arms and facial muscles, along with drooping eyelids. To help me understand what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help rule out a few things, and also check for certain vitamin deficiencies. I also want to order an MRI of your brain and potentially a nerve conduction study. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An MRI… and nerve tests? That sounds… rather serious. What are you thinking it could be, Doctor? I’m a bit worried, to be honest. And… how much will all this cost? I don’t have insurance, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gedalya. It is a bit concerning, and it's natural to feel worried. The MRI and nerve conduction study will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. As for what it could be, it's too early to say definitively. Your symptoms could be caused by a number of things. One possibility we need to rule out is Myasthenia Gravis, which is an autoimmune condition that causes muscle weakness. Other possibilities include certain neurological disorders or vitamin deficiencies. That's why the tests are important. Regarding the cost… I understand not having insurance is a significant concern. Let me see what the approximate costs are, and I can also connect you with the hospital's financial assistance department. They may be able to offer a payment plan or reduce the costs based on your income. I’ll also see if there are any resources available in the area that offer discounted testing. The MRI will likely cost around $1500-$2000, and the nerve conduction study around $500-$800. It’s not ideal, I know, but we need to get this checked out properly. Let me see what we can do. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: $2000? That’s… a lot of money. I don't know how I’m going to manage that. Myasthenia Gravis… is that serious? And is it… treatable? I appreciate you looking into the financial assistance, Doctor, truly. I just… I feel overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Gedalya. It is a significant amount of money, and feeling overwhelmed is completely understandable. Let's take things one step at a time. Myasthenia Gravis can be serious, but it is treatable. Many people with MG live full and productive lives with treatment. The treatment usually involves medication to help improve muscle strength, and sometimes other therapies. It's important to remember that we don't know if that's what you have yet - these tests are to help us figure it out. Let me call the hospital's financial assistance department now and see what options are available to you. They’ll need some information about your income, but they are usually very helpful. “Hi, this is Dr. Alzoubi. I have a patient, Gedalya Schaust, who needs an MRI and nerve conduction study but is uninsured. Could you please provide information about financial assistance options?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, he's right here. He's very concerned about the cost. They’re asking about your annual income, Gedalya. Do you mind telling me roughly what you earn each year? And… do you have any savings or other assets? They need to get a full picture to determine how much assistance they can offer.
DOCTOR: Okay, it sounds like they can offer a payment plan with reduced rates based on your income. They will require some paperwork, but they can send it to you electronically. They also mentioned a local charity that sometimes provides assistance with medical bills, and they can provide you with their contact information. Okay, Gedalya, it’s not ideal, but they can offer a payment plan with reduced rates. They’ll send you the paperwork. They also gave me the number for a local charity that might be able to help. The next step is to schedule the MRI and nerve conduction study. I’ll have my assistant call you tomorrow to set those up. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before the MRI?
PATIENT: That's… good. A payment plan is better than nothing, thankfully. No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. And… thank you. For being patient, and for explaining everything so clearly. I still feel anxious, but… I appreciate you trying to help me navigate this. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the MRI? Should I stop eating or drinking anything beforehand?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I understand this is a lot to take in. For the MRI, you don't need to do much preparation. You can eat and drink normally before the scan. However, it's important to remove any metal objects, like jewelry, watches, and hairpins, before the scan. They’ll give you a gown to wear. Also, the MRI machine is quite loud, so they’ll provide you with earplugs or headphones to help reduce the noise. It's also important to lie very still during the scan to get clear images. My assistant will go over all of this in detail when she calls you to schedule the appointment. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Alzoubi. You’ve been very kind. I’ll wait for my assistant to call.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. I’ll have my assistant give you a call tomorrow. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day. .
