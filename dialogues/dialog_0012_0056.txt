DOCTOR: Hi Erle, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s… the job, mostly. I’ve been a teacher for a long time. A very long time. And frankly, the… the students these days. It’s just not what it used to be. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Is there a form I need to fill out? I’d rather just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed by changes at work. We can definitely address that. While there is some paperwork, we'll get through it quickly. But first, I want to make sure I understand everything that’s going on. It sounds like the stress is the main concern right now, but are you experiencing any physical symptoms along with that stress?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness, at my age, everything is a physical symptom! But… let me think. No, not particularly. I sleep alright, I suppose. Though not as soundly as I used to. And my appetite… well, it comes and goes. Is that what you mean? Really, I just find the whole situation… demoralizing. The disrespect! It’s simply unheard of. I don't understand why I even need to explain this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so changes in sleep and appetite, along with feeling demoralized due to issues at work. That’s helpful to know. It’s good that you're still sleeping, even if it's not as restful. And it's common for appetite to fluctuate with stress. Just to get a clearer picture, when you say "comes and goes," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Must I detail my eating habits? Very well. Some days, I have no interest in food at all. Absolutely none. Just the thought of it… unpleasant. And other days, I'll eat a small portion, perhaps some soup, and that's enough. It's not a consistent thing, you understand. It’s just… lacking enthusiasm, shall we say? I haven’t lost weight, if that’s what you’re thinking. I maintain a perfectly respectable physique, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so varying appetite with days of no interest, then small portions on other days. And you haven't noticed any weight loss, which is good. It sounds like it's more about a lack of enjoyment of food rather than a significant change in your eating patterns. Now, besides the changes in sleep and appetite and feeling demoralized, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, I am not a hypochondriac. I am a perfectly rational man. If something were seriously wrong, I would know. I just feel… worn out. And irritated. Constantly irritated. By the students, by the administration, by… everything, really. Is this going to take much longer? I have a rather important book to catalogue this afternoon. A first edition, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Erle, and I certainly don't want to keep you from your book. Feeling worn out and easily irritated are definitely symptoms we should explore, especially given the stress you’re under. It’s good you recognize those feelings. Let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Good heavens, no! I am a very healthy man for my age. I've always taken care of myself. A sensible diet, regular… well, regular walking. And a keen intellect, which keeps the mind sharp, you understand. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that's about it. My late wife, bless her soul, she was the one who always went to the doctor. I avoided it whenever possible. A complete waste of time, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally good health, with just a mild case of the flu a few years ago. No chronic conditions diagnosed. That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. Absolutely not. I broke my arm when I was a boy – climbing a tree, foolishly – but that was a simple matter. A cast, and that was that. No major operations, no lengthy stays. I have a very strong constitution, you see. I’ve always prided myself on that. Really, I’m wasting my time here. I could be back at the library, ensuring the proper Dewey Decimal System is maintained.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, no surgeries or hospitalizations otherwise. Good. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm. My mother… she lived to a good age, I believe. She had… aches and pains, as one does when getting old. My father was a stern man. Never talked about his health. And my sister… she was always a bit… delicate. I don’t recall any specific illnesses, honestly. They weren't a family who discussed such things. It was considered… impolite. Is this really necessary, Doctor? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Erle, and I apologize if it feels like an interrogation. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health history. It’s helpful to know if there's a family tendency towards certain conditions. Okay, so no significant family medical history that you're aware of. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your daily habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Smoke? The very idea! I find it utterly repulsive. Alcohol… occasionally a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. A very small glass. And recreational drugs? Doctor, I am a retired librarian! I spend my days surrounded by literature, not… vice. Really, these questions are quite insulting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional small glass of wine, no smoking or recreational drugs. I apologize again if the questions feel intrusive; I’m just trying to gather as much information as possible. Now, just one more set of questions before we move on to a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Just a small dose of ibuprofen occasionally, for my arthritis. Nothing serious. And a multivitamin, you know, to keep things… regular. That's it. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very simple man with very simple needs. Can we please get this over with? I have a book to catalogue, and the sooner I return to it, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for arthritis and a multivitamin. Good to know. Alright, Erle, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sighs heavily. Very well. Get it over with. But please be gentle. And don't take too long. This is a complete waste of my afternoon, you understand. A first edition is not going to catalogue itself.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, just relaxing your arm here… excellent. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Throat looks normal. Lymph nodes are normal. Everything seems generally okay, Erle. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure, combined with the stress you’re experiencing, warrants some attention. And, given your reported changes in appetite and sleep, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, I am beginning to regret coming here. Very well. If you insist. But I expect a full explanation of the results. And I expect them quickly. I haven't got all day to be poked and prodded. And I still have that book…
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Erle, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I assure you, these tests are just a precaution to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll check your basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and thyroid function. It should give us a good overview. I’ll write the order for the lab now. They'll need a small blood sample. It'll be quick. Okay, the order is sent to the lab. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your stress levels. Have you considered any relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation?
PATIENT: Meditation? Deep breathing? Doctor, with all due respect, I am a retired librarian, not a… a hippie. I find solace in the Dewey Decimal System, thank you very much. Solace and order. That's what I need. Not… breathing exercises. Honestly, this is all rather ridiculous. Can I go now? I really must return to the library.
DOCTOR: I understand, Erle. Everyone finds their own way to cope with stress. And I appreciate that the Dewey Decimal System brings you comfort. We'll proceed with the blood tests as planned. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. I'll give you a summary of today's visit and the lab order. Please contact the lab to schedule your appointment. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. I just want to go home. And catalogue that book. Good day, Doctor. .
