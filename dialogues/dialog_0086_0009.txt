DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it's my sight. It’s… diminishing, shall we say. Not a sudden thing, more a gradual fading. I noticed it quite some time ago, but it's become… inconvenient. I suppose I should have come sooner, but one has responsibilities, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, responsibilities. Of course. “Diminishing,” you say. And how long exactly would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… at least five years, maybe longer. It's difficult to pinpoint precisely. One doesn't keep a ledger of such things, you know. It started with needing a bit more light to read, then things seemed… less sharp. Now, driving at night is… problematic. I mostly avoid it if I can. It's not completely gone, mind you. Just… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Five years. That’s… significant. And you said driving at night is problematic. Can you describe what you’re experiencing when you drive?
PATIENT: Well, the glare, for one thing. The headlights from oncoming cars are… overwhelming. And the streetlights. They create halos, you see? Everything seems to bleed together, making it hard to distinguish shapes. It's not a safe feeling, Doctor. I used to be a very confident driver. Now… I rely heavily on the painted lines and hope for the best. And I avoid wet roads entirely, if possible. They only make it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Halos around lights… difficulty with night vision… Okay. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Bifocals. Been wearing them for… oh, close to twenty years now, I suppose. Though, truthfully, they haven't seemed to be helping much lately. I’ve had them adjusted a few times, but it’s just a temporary fix, if anything. The optician keeps telling me my prescription is… stable. Which doesn’t explain this, does it? It feels as though it’s something beyond a simple correction.
DOCTOR: "Stable," you say. Opticians. They see what they see. Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let's do a quick visual exam, just to get a baseline. It’s unlikely I’ll be able to give you a definitive answer without further testing, but it will give us a starting point. Can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I suspect that's a waste of time. I can barely make out the big letters anymore. But, very well. If you insist. … I can see the first line, just barely. The second… no. No, I cannot. They're all just… blurred shapes. A rather pointless exercise, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Pointless?
PATIENT: Well, with all due respect, Doctor, it's hardly a revelation, is it? I came here because my vision is declining. To have me strain my eyes at a chart I can't read… it doesn't seem a particularly insightful diagnostic step. I'd hoped for something a bit more… thorough. Perhaps an examination of the back of the eye? Or some other… modern technology? I'm not one for antiquated methods, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I assure you, I am not employing "antiquated methods." A basic visual acuity test is always the first step. It helps me determine the scope of the problem. However, given your description and… your frankly dismissive attitude toward a simple examination, it’s clear further investigation is required. I'm going to take a look at the back of your eye with an ophthalmoscope. It will allow me to assess the health of your retina and optic nerve. After that, I will refer you to an ophthalmologist for more specialized testing. They have the equipment to perform a visual field test and an OCT scan, which will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An ophthalmoscope, you say? Very well. As long as it's… efficient. I have commitments, you understand. And I do appreciate you recognizing the… limitations of a basic chart test. Though, frankly, one would think a seasoned professional would have grasped that sooner. An OCT scan sounds… comprehensive. I trust the ophthalmologist is reputable? I wouldn’t want to waste my time with an amateur. Please, do ensure they are board-certified.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, I assure you I only refer to highly qualified specialists. Now, if you could just look straight ahead… and try to relax. This won’t take long. … Hmm. Some mild optic disc pallor. Not dramatically significant, but something we need to investigate further. And some… drusen present. Also not alarming in isolation. But again, the ophthalmologist will need to assess this comprehensively. I’m going to write you a referral now. They’re located on Elm Street. I’ll also make a note of your concerns regarding their qualifications. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before they potentially dilate your eyes?
PATIENT: Elm Street… I believe I’ve heard of it. A rather… unremarkable part of town, if memory serves. As for allergies… no, not to my knowledge. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a penicillin derivative some years ago, but that was decades past. I highly doubt it's relevant. Just… please ensure they have a comfortable waiting room. And that the staff are… punctual. I detest waiting. It’s a needless waste of time. Also, if they attempt to upsell me on any… unnecessary procedures, I will be most displeased. I am a discerning patient, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Penicillin reaction noted. Discerning patient… noted. I’ve written a rather detailed note for the ophthalmologist, outlining your concerns. They’re aware of your… preferences. I’ll also have my staff provide you with their contact information and directions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers it. I trust this referral process will be… expeditious. I'm not one for prolonged medical engagements. And please, do ensure my insurance information is correctly processed. Though, admittedly, I am currently… un-insured. A temporary situation, you understand. Hopefully, they are understanding. Perhaps they offer a… discount for discerning patients? Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though, frankly, I remain cautiously optimistic. I do hope for a swift resolution to this matter.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. I’ve noted your un-insured status and will make a note for the ophthalmologist’s office to discuss payment options with you. I strongly advise you contact them directly to inquire about any potential discounts or financial assistance programs. I'll have my staff escort you to the reception desk. Hopefully, the ophthalmologist can provide you with a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Have a… good day, Mr. Alcorta.
PATIENT: Thank you. Though, I anticipate further… complications. One rarely receives efficient service these days. Still, I remain hopeful. …Good day to you as well, Doctor. And may your day be… uneventful. .
