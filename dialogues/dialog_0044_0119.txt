DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's...well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I don't usually bother doctors with these sorts of things, but I thought I should probably get it checked. It's my... husband, actually. He's been having a… discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so. I’m not sure what it is, and he’s too proud to come in himself.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's good you're bringing it up, and it's very common for people to be hesitant about these things. No need to be embarrassed at all. We're here to help. So, this discharge… can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's… not normal, that’s for certain. It's yellowish, and sometimes there's a bit of… odor. Not a strong odor, but noticeable. It started about a week ago, maybe a little longer. He’s been a bit… quieter than usual, and I noticed he’s been going to the bathroom more frequently. He claims it doesn’t hurt, exactly, but he definitely seems uncomfortable. He’s also been…well, a little less interested in, shall we say, marital relations. Which is… concerning. He's a very active man, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge with a noticeable odor, started about a week ago, increased frequency of urination, and a change in his usual activity level and… intimacy. And no reported pain, just discomfort. That gives us a good starting point. Just to be clear, and please don't hesitate to tell me if this is too personal, is the discharge coming from his urethra – that’s the opening where he urinates – or is it elsewhere?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… I suppose it is from there. Honestly, Doctor, I didn’t get a very close look, if you understand. He's a modest man, and I didn't pry. But yes, as far as I could tell, it's coming from… that opening. I truly wouldn't know the proper terminology. It's simply… distressing to see him so unwell. He prides himself on his… virility. It's just not him to be suffering like this.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like this is causing him a lot of distress, and you're understandably concerned. It's good you've brought him in, even if he wasn't keen to come himself. Okay, so yellowish discharge from the urethra, no pain, increased frequency of urination, and a change in his usual activity… that's suggestive of a few possibilities. The most common would be a sexually transmitted infection, but it could also be a non-sexually transmitted infection, or even something like urethritis. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and collect a urine sample for testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… sexually transmitted infection? Oh dear. He'd be mortified. Truly. He's always been… very careful, or so he claims. Though, I suppose… one can never be entirely certain, can one? A urine sample, yes, that sounds reasonable. A physical exam… well, I suppose it’s necessary. But please be discreet, Doctor. This is already quite upsetting enough. And I'd prefer not to be involved in… the examination itself, if possible. He's a private man, as I've mentioned.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Discretion is my utmost priority, Jinnie. I completely understand his privacy concerns, and I will ensure the exam is conducted with the greatest sensitivity and respect. You absolutely do not need to be involved in the examination itself. I will explain everything to him beforehand, and he can let me know his comfort level with each step. I will need to ask him a few questions directly, as well, regarding his sexual history, just to ensure we cover all bases. I assure you, this is all confidential and part of standard medical practice. Let's start with the urine sample. We have a private bathroom just down the hall. I’ll provide a sterile cup and instructions. Then, I'll speak with your husband directly. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Asking him directly is certainly preferable. He’s a bit… stubborn, sometimes, and won’t admit to anything if I’m around. Honestly, I suspect he’ll downplay the whole situation, but at least you’ll be getting it straight from the source. A sterile cup, you say? Very well. I suppose he’s capable of providing a simple urine sample. Though, knowing him, he'll probably try to overcomplicate it. Tell me, Doctor, is there anything I should do or avoid saying while he’s preparing the sample? I don't want to accidentally make things worse.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful question, Jinnie. Honestly, just try to remain calm and supportive. Avoid pressing him for details or making any accusations. Just let him know that you're there for him and that you want him to get the care he needs. It’s also best to avoid mentioning your suspicions or concerns directly while he's collecting the sample, as that might make him feel defensive and less forthcoming. Just a simple encouragement to take his time and follow the instructions will be sufficient. I will do my best to put him at ease when I speak with him directly. We'll get to the bottom of this, Jinnie. Let's start with the urine sample, and then I'll have him come into the examination room. Here's the cup and instructions. The bathroom is just down the hall on the right. Take your time, and I’ll be here when you’re both ready.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I'll do my best to remain… neutral. It’s not easy, you understand. But I’ll try. Honestly, I’m just relieved to be getting something done about this. It’s been hanging over me for days. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… discretion, and your patience. .
