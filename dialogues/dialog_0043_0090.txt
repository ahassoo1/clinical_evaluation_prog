DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Um... well, I believe I’m here for a check-up before... before a surgery. A cosmetic surgery. Honestly, things have been a little… hazy lately, so I don't recall all the specifics, but my understanding is this is standard procedure.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Brightful. A pre-operative evaluation is quite standard. It’s good you’re coming in for this. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me what type of cosmetic surgery you are scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… that’s a good question. I wish I could say for certain. I think it has something to do with… my face? Perhaps my nose? Or maybe my cheeks? It was… a long time ago when we discussed it. My husband… he was the one who really initiated the conversation, and I just… agreed. It's all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Please don’t apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly alright. Memory can be unreliable, and it sounds as though this was some time ago. We'll figure things out. Let’s start with what you do remember. Do you recall when approximately you scheduled this surgery?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s difficult. I believe it was… before my husband passed. Yes, definitely before. Let me think… he… he got sick in the spring of 2024. So, it must have been sometime before then. Perhaps late 2023? Or even earlier? I truly wish I had a better recollection. We used to keep very detailed calendars, but… well, after he was gone, those things just… disappeared. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable, Ms. Brightful. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly natural for details to become less clear during such a challenging time. We’ll proceed at your pace. Do you recall the name of the surgeon or the facility where the surgery is scheduled?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The surgeon’s name… I want to say Dr. Alvarez? Or perhaps Ramirez? It was a Spanish name, I’m fairly certain. He had a very nice office, quite modern. As for the facility… I believe it was in the city. Not a large hospital, more of a… a clinic, specializing in cosmetic procedures. I wish I could be of more help. My memory feels like it’s… full of holes. Is it alright if I pause for a moment? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Brightful. Please, take all the time you need. It’s perfectly alright to pause. We can absolutely take things slowly. No need to rush. Perhaps we can try a different approach. Do you have any paperwork from the surgeon’s office, such as consent forms or pre-operative instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe I do. I brought a small bag with me, just in case. Let's see… here it is. It’s a little disorganized, I apologize. My husband usually handled all these things. Hopefully, this will jog my memory, or at least provide you with some useful information.
DOCTOR: Excellent. This is a great start. Alright, it appears you are scheduled for a rhinoplasty – a nose reshaping procedure – with Dr. Rafael Ramirez on September 15th of this year. The paperwork indicates a consultation took place on February 20th, 2024. Does that information sound at all familiar, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Rhinoplasty… Dr. Ramirez… February 20th… Yes… yes, that does ring a bell. Dr. Ramirez was very kind, very patient. He showed me… simulations, I think. Pictures of what my nose could look like. And February… that was around my husband’s birthday. Yes, I remember now. It’s… slowly coming back to me. Thank you, Doctor. Just hearing the details has helped. Is it normal to not remember everything so clearly? I’m worried I’ll forget important aftercare instructions, or… or something else.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly normal, Ms. Brightful, especially given the emotional stress you’ve been under. Grief and stress can significantly impact memory recall. The fact that the details are surfacing now is a positive sign. We will ensure you have clear, written instructions for all aftercare procedures, and we can review them together multiple times if necessary. Now that we’ve clarified the procedure, let’s go through a brief medical history. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And… I broke my arm when I was younger, playing football with my brothers. Other than that… not much, I believe. I’ve always been quite healthy. No chronic conditions, no allergies, nothing like that. I do take a daily multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. Oh! And I had my tonsils removed when I was around ten years old. Does that count as major surgery? I was terribly sick afterward, I recall.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Brightful. Tonsillectomy does count as a surgery. And no allergies?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband always joked that I could eat anything without a problem. He’d try to feed me spicy peppers just to see if I’d finally react! But no, truly, no known allergies. I can tolerate all sorts of foods and medications without any issues.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin, as I mentioned before. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, of course. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. My husband always encouraged me to avoid medication whenever possible. He believed in natural remedies. Oh! And I used to take iron supplements a few years ago, but the doctor said my levels were fine, so I stopped. That’s it, I think. Really, I rarely take any medication at all.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Brightful. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some sort of heart condition later in life. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. My siblings are both healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses or genetic conditions that I’m aware of. My husband’s family… that’s a bit harder to recall. He didn’t talk much about his medical history. He was very private about those things. Is it alright if I’m a bit vague? My memory is still… fragmented.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly alright. We’ll proceed at your pace. Knowing about high blood pressure in your mother is helpful, and we can make a note of that. We don't need to delve into specifics if you're not comfortable. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband detested smoking, and I wouldn’t dream of it. As for alcohol… I’ll occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a month. Nothing excessive, just a small glass to relax. And recreational drugs… absolutely not. I’ve always been very health-conscious, and I steer clear of anything that could harm my well-being. I prefer a good cup of chamomile tea, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Brightful. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your current reason for seeking this pre-operative evaluation. You mentioned earlier it was standard procedure before the surgery. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted this appointment?
PATIENT: Well, to be honest, I don't have any specific symptoms. I mostly just feel… a little anxious about the surgery. It's been so long since we discussed it, and my memory is so hazy, I just want to make sure everything is alright. I’m worried about complications, or… or forgetting important instructions afterward. And I want to be absolutely certain I’m healthy enough to undergo the procedure. I suppose I just want peace of mind. Is that alright? I feel silly admitting it.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious, and wanting peace of mind is an excellent reason to come in for a check-up. It’s my job to address your concerns and ensure you’re in the best possible condition for the surgery. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, rate is approximately 72 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128/78 mmHg, pulse is 72 and regular. Ears are clear bilaterally. Nose is clear, no signs of congestion or polyps. Throat is clear, no tonsillar enlargement or exudates. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. There are no immediate concerns preventing you from undergoing the rhinoplasty. However, I would like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel just to have a baseline assessment of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A baseline assessment seems like a good idea. A complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel… absolutely, please. I trust your judgment entirely. When can I expect the results? And… how will I receive them? I don’t have a regular physician, so I’m not sure how these things work.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab work can be done right here in the clinic today. It typically takes 24-48 hours to receive the results. I will personally review them and contact you directly by phone to discuss them. I’ll also have a copy of the results sent to your home address for your records. Since you don’t have a primary care physician, I’m happy to answer any questions you may have regarding your overall health during that call. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That is incredibly kind of you, Doctor. Thank you so much for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. Hmm… yes, I do have one question. It’s probably a silly one, but… what can I expect during the surgery itself? I’m a little anxious about being… asleep. And will there be a lot of pain afterward? I understand every case is different, but… perhaps a general idea?
DOCTOR: That’s not a silly question at all, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about the surgical process. Typically, rhinoplasty is performed under general anesthesia, meaning you’ll be completely asleep during the procedure. An anesthesiologist will be present throughout the surgery to monitor your vital signs and ensure your safety. Before the anesthesia begins, you’ll receive intravenous medication to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. As for pain afterward, there will be some discomfort, naturally, but it’s usually manageable with pain medication. Most patients describe it as a dull ache or pressure. We’ll prescribe you pain medication to take as needed. You can also expect some swelling and bruising around your nose and eyes, which is normal. This typically subsides within a week or two. Dr. Ramirez will provide you with detailed post-operative instructions, including how to care for your nose, manage pain, and schedule follow-up appointments. He’s an excellent surgeon, and his priority is ensuring your comfort and a successful outcome. Do you have any other concerns or questions I can address?
PATIENT: That is very reassuring, Doctor. Knowing that an anesthesiologist will be present is a great comfort. And Dr. Ramirez sounds very capable. No, I believe that answers all of my questions for now. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve truly put my mind at ease. I’ll go ahead and have the lab work done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. The lab technician is ready for you now. Just follow me. I will be in touch within 48 hours with your results. Have a pleasant day. .
