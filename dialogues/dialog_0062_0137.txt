DOCTOR: Hi Lindra, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My husband… he think I need… how you say… check before I go to the… old people place. He worry. I feel okay, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable, and it’s good your husband is looking out for you. It’s always a good idea to get a check-up before a big transition like moving to a new place. So, mostly you feel okay… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly okay. Sometimes… my memory, it not so good. Like… I forget what I eat for lunch. Or… the name of the nice lady next door. Little things. Not big things. And… sometimes I feel tired. But who not feel tired, eh? I sleep good, though.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. It’s common to experience some memory changes as we get older, and feeling tired can be caused by many things. It’s good you’re sleeping well, that's a positive. Just to get a clearer picture, when did you start noticing these memory issues and the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… the memory… maybe six months ago? Not sure exactly. It come slow. The tired… maybe same time. But sometimes I work late at the bar, you know? Long hours. So maybe that too. I not sure. Is hard to say. Is a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, gradually noticing some memory lapses and tiredness. And you mentioned working at a bar... do you still work there?
PATIENT: Yes, I still work. Three nights a week. Not so much anymore, though. My son, he help now. He good boy. He say I need to rest more. But I like to keep busy, you know? I make good drinks! People like me.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! It’s good you enjoy your work and have your son’s support. Keeping busy is great, as long as it doesn't become too much. Now, besides the memory and tiredness, have you noticed any other changes in how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my knees hurt. When I walk too much. And… I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up fast. But old people things, right? Everything ache a little. Nothing too bad. I take something for the knees, when they really bother me. A little white pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain and dizziness when standing up quickly. And you take a white pill for your knees – do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: No, I do not know the name. My daughter, she get it for me. She know all the pills. I just take it when I need. It help the pain, mostly. It small and white. That all I know. I not good with names and numbers anymore, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lindra. Don’t worry about it at all. We can figure it out. It's good you have family to help with things like that. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Long time ago, I have… what you call… gallstones. They take it out. Many years ago. And… I have the flu sometimes. Like everyone, eh? Nothing else, I think. No big problems. I try to eat good, mostly. My husband, he like to cook. Very good cook.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the past and occasional flu. That’s good to know. And you said your husband is a good cook - that's wonderful! Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the white pill for your knees?
PATIENT: No, just the white pill. And… sometimes I take something for my… what you call… heartburn. When I eat spicy food. But not every day. Just when I have too much… peppers! My husband, he make very spicy peppers. Very good, but… the heartburn. A little pink pill, I think. Small.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pink pill for heartburn as needed. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he grow lots of things in the garden. Tomatoes, peppers, flowers… I taste everything. Never had a reaction. I think I would know if I had allergy, eh?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she have… what you call… the sugar sickness. Diabetes, my daughter say. And my father, he have problems with his heart. Old age, I think. Many years ago. And… my brother, he have high blood pressure. He take pills for it. That all I remember, Doctor. Old family, many problems, eh? But we all live long lives. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, heart problems, and high blood pressure. That’s good to know. And it's good that your family has generally lived long lives. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I just want to ask one more question. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: I do not smoke. Never smoke. My husband, he used to smoke, but he stop many years ago. I drink… a little wine sometimes. With dinner. One glass, maybe two. And no, no drugs. I am old lady, Doctor! I make good drinks, I do not take them, eh? Just wine, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lindra! Just checking. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and reflexes, and take a look in your ears and eyes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. Just tell me if it will hurt. I am old, but I still feel things, eh?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't hurt at all, Lindra. Just a few simple checks. Okay, take a nice deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. I’m going to check your blood pressure now. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let's check your reflexes… Your reflexes are a little slow, which is not uncommon at your age. And finally, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears and eyes… Your ears look clear, and your eyes have some mild cataracts, which is also common with age. Everything else looks normal. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but your blood pressure is a little high, and your heart rate is a bit fast. Your reflexes are a little slow, and you have some mild cataracts, which are expected for your age.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that bad, Doctor? The blood pressure? Should I stop drinking the wine? My husband will be sad. He likes to share it with me.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad right now, Lindra, but it's something we need to monitor. Ideally, we want to keep your blood pressure below 130/80. As for the wine, you don't necessarily need to stop completely, but reducing your intake would be a good first step. Perhaps just one glass a few times a week instead of every night. We can discuss that more, and see how your numbers look after a few weeks. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. Just a basic check of your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. And also a urine test. That will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Blood tests, urine tests… whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. My daughter, she always say I need to get more tests. She worry too much. But… if you think it is good, I will do it. When do I have to go? And where?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Lindra. Your daughter sounds like a caring person. And you're right to listen to your body, and I think a few tests will give us a good baseline. You can go to the lab right across the street, at 123 Main Street. They're open Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. You don’t need an appointment, just tell them Dr. DeCosta sent you. It will take about 30 minutes. After we get the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to address any concerns. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, across the street, 123 Main Street. No appointment. Thirty minutes. I can do that. So, you think I need to drink less wine? And… maybe rest more? My son, he say that too. It is hard to rest when you have been busy all your life, eh? But… I will try. For my health. And for my family.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Lindra. Small changes can make a big difference. Reducing your wine intake and trying to get a little more rest – those are both excellent steps. And it’s wonderful that you’re doing it for your health and your family. That shows a lot of strength. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication. It's a very mild one, and we can adjust the dosage if needed. It will help us get your numbers under control. Here you go. Take this to your pharmacy, and they can explain how to take it. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay, a little pill for the blood pressure. I will take it to the pharmacy. My daughter, she will help me with that. She knows all the pills. So… is something seriously wrong, Doctor? Am I very sick? My husband, he will be so sad if something happen to me. He loves me very much.
DOCTOR: No, Lindra, you are not seriously sick. That’s why I’m ordering these tests – just to get a clearer picture and rule out anything serious. Your symptoms – the memory lapses, tiredness, and slightly elevated blood pressure – can be caused by many things, and most of them are not life-threatening. It's good we’re addressing these things now, so we can prevent them from becoming more serious in the future. We are being proactive, that’s all. And honestly, you seem very healthy and active for your age. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we’ll discuss a plan to help you feel your best. In the meantime, try to reduce your wine intake a little, and get a little more rest when you can. And please, don’t worry. We’re going to take good care of you. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You explain everything very good, Doctor. And you are very kind. I will go to the lab across the street. And I will take the pill to the pharmacy. And I will try to drink less wine. For my husband. And for my son. And for my health. Thank you very much, Doctor. You are a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindra. It was lovely meeting you. And you’re very kind as well. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, small changes can make a big difference. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT:
