DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's this fever. Keeps comin' back. It's been a real pain, honestly. Not fun at all.
DOCTOR: A fever, you say. Coming back… okay. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It'll go away for a day or two, maybe three, then bam, it's back. Happens maybe once a week now for the past month, give or take. I don’t really keep track of the exact dates, you know how it is. Feels like a regular flu fever – chills, achy all over. Not too bad, but annoying enough to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Alright, a recurring fever for about a month. And you describe it as flu-like – chills, body aches. Do you take your temperature when it comes back?
PATIENT: I do, when I can. My wife usually takes it for me when I'm feelin' really bad. It usually gets up to around 101, 102, somethin' like that. Not sky high, but definitely not normal for me. I don’t have one of them fancy thermometers that tells ya everything, just a regular one.
DOCTOR: 101, 102… alright. And when you say “regular one,” is that oral, rectal, or under the arm?
PATIENT: Usually under the arm. Easier, you know? Especially when I'm not feelin' great. My wife does it for me, and that's the easiest way for her too. I’ve done oral a couple times, but I prefer not to mess with it when I’m sick.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, axillary temperatures – under the arm – are the least accurate, naturally. But 101-102 is still a temperature we need to investigate. Besides the fever and aches, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yeah, I figured that one wasn't the best. Look, doc, I'm not a doctor, alright? I just tell ya what's happenin'. Other than the fever and aches… let me think. I've been a little tired, more tired than usual. And a bit of a cough, but it's not bad, just a tickle in my throat, really. Nothing major, and it comes and goes. No nausea or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue and a mild cough… and no nausea. Have you noticed any sweating, especially at night?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been waking up a little damp. Not soaked, but definitely more sweaty than usual. My wife notices it more than I do, honestly. She's always saying I'm kickin' off the blankets. I just thought it was the summer heat, you know? We don’t really use the AC much.
DOCTOR: Night sweats… okay. Do you have any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really. I had the flu bad when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I don’t take nothin’ for it. He said to watch my diet, so I try. And I had my knee replaced about ten years ago, but that healed up fine. Other than that… nothin' major that I can think of.
DOCTOR: “Not much,” you say. High blood pressure, even if untreated, is significant. And a knee replacement… alright. Any family history of… anything, really?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I'm tellin' ya, my family’s pretty healthy. My mother lived to be 90, and my father was 85 when he passed. They didn't have much in the way of problems, honestly. A little arthritis here and there, but nothin' serious. No heart problems, no cancer… nothin' like that. We’re Puerto Rican, we're built tough!
DOCTOR: “Built tough,” right. Well, genetics aren’t always so straightforward. Alright. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, doc. Never smoked a day in my life. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that's it. And definitely no drugs. I'm a chiropractor, for goodness sake! I help people stay healthy, I don’t go around doin’ things that mess ‘em up.
DOCTOR: Chiropractor… alright. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ regular. I take ibuprofen sometimes for my back if it’s acting up, but that’s it. And maybe a little Vicks Vapor Rub when I got a cold, but that's about it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I believe in lettin' the body heal itself, ya know?
DOCTOR: Right. “Letting the body heal itself.” Well, let’s have a look at you, then. I’m going to listen to your lungs, check your heart, and feel your abdomen. Then we’ll see what we’re dealing with. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Let's get this over with. Just try to be quick, doc. I got patients waitin’ back at the office.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear bilaterally. Pulse is 88 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no guarding or rebound. No hepatosplenomegaly. Slightly overweight, BMI approximately 25. Now, I’m going to check your lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Fine. Just tell me if somethin's wrong, alright? Don't just poke around without sayin' nothin'. This is kinda uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: No significant lymphadenopathy noted. Cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes are within normal limits. Now, let's take your temperature. Temperature is 101.3 Fahrenheit. I’d like to draw some blood for a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. We'll also send a sample for a chest X-ray to rule out anything in your lungs.
PATIENT: Ugh, blood? Really, doc? Can’t ya just tell me what’s wrong? I hate needles. And an X-ray? This is gettin’ outta hand. Look, I just want somethin’ for the fever, that’s all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I understand you dislike needles, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your recurring fever. It could be a simple infection, but we need to rule out more serious possibilities. Ignoring it won't make it go away. And frankly, giving you medication without knowing what we're treating is irresponsible. I'm trying to provide you with proper medical care. We need to know what we're fighting here. I’ll order the bloodwork and the X-ray. The nurse will come in to draw the blood shortly. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Do what ya gotta do. But I’m tellin’ ya, it’s probably just a little flu. As for allergies… hmm. Let me think. I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a kid, broke out in hives. Other than that, nothin’ major. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle, okay? This is gonna be a long day.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Alright. I’ll make a note to have the nurse be careful. We’ll get these tests done, and then we’ll go from there. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you some acetaminophen to help manage the fever. It’s not a cure, but it will make you more comfortable while we wait for the results.
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… okay. Fine. Just let me know when this is all over. I got people waitin’, doc.
