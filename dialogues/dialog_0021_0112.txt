DOCTOR: Right. Hello, Keoni. I’m Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Havird. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom very frequently lately. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I don’t quite know how to explain it beyond that. It just feels like I constantly need to go.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, alright. Well, it's good you're addressing it. Frequent urination… hmm. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. I… I honestly can’t pinpoint a specific date. It feels like it’s been a few weeks, perhaps a month? Everything feels a bit… hazy, lately. I apologize for being so vague. It's not that I want to be unhelpful, it's just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A month, roughly. Okay. And is it just frequent?
PATIENT: Just frequent… I think so. I haven’t noticed any pain, or… anything unusual in the urine itself, if that makes sense. It doesn’t burn when I go, and the color seems normal, as far as I can tell. Though… now that you mention it, I have been feeling rather thirsty lately. Is that related, perhaps? I’m not sure. I really don't know much about this at all.
DOCTOR: Thirst… possibly. Increased urination can lead to dehydration. Right. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weight… I haven't stepped on a scale in ages, truthfully. And my appetite… it’s been a little all over the place. Some days I feel ravenous, others I have no desire to eat at all. It's difficult to say if it’s connected or just… me being stressed. I recently went through a divorce, you see, and things have been rather… unsettled. Perhaps that’s affecting everything. I truly am sorry for being so disorganized. It feels like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Divorce. Right. Stress can certainly manifest in… various ways. It doesn’t necessarily explain the frequent urination, but it’s good to know. Now, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh… um. No, Dr. Havird. Not currently. I haven’t been… involved with anyone since the divorce. It's… been a difficult adjustment, as you can imagine. I apologize for the personal question; I understand it's likely necessary. I just… it feels odd discussing these things with someone I’ve just met. But I assure you, there’s no… connection there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, I don’t believe so. My family doesn’t have a history of it, as far as I know. And kidney problems… that’s… I honestly can’t recall. I’ve seen doctors sporadically over the years, mostly for routine check-ups and the occasional cold, but I don’t remember being told I had any issues with my kidneys. I’m terribly sorry. I wish I was more helpful. Would it be possible to check my records somewhere? Perhaps at a previous practice?
DOCTOR: We can try to get records, but it takes time. Do you know where you’ve been seen before?
PATIENT: Let me think… there was Dr. Almeida, a general practitioner. He retired a few years ago, but his practice was on Elm Street, near the bakery. And before that… oh, dear. This is so frustrating! There was a woman, Dr. Silva… but I can’t remember the name of the practice. It was… smaller, I think, a bit further out of town. I really wish I could remember more details. I feel like I'm letting you down. Is there a way to search for doctors in the area? Perhaps by specialty?
DOCTOR: We can look, but it's unlikely to be fruitful. Let's move on. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I've never had a reaction to any medication I’ve taken. I’ve only really used over-the-counter things, pain relievers and the occasional allergy pill for seasonal allergies. Nothing serious, and certainly nothing that caused a reaction. I'm usually quite careful about what I take. Would it be helpful if I listed the specific medications I’ve used in the past? Perhaps that would jog my memory about potential practices?
DOCTOR: No, that won't be necessary. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Havird. I'm not taking any medications at the moment. I made a conscious decision to avoid them if possible. I prefer to… manage things naturally, if I can. Though, admittedly, with this frequent urination, I'm not sure what "naturally" even means anymore. It's becoming quite disruptive, and I'm starting to feel rather… anxious about it. Perhaps I should have sought help sooner. I apologize for being so… verbose.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's do a quick examination. I want to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll need a urine sample.
PATIENT: Of course, Dr. Havird. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I apologize for being such a… difficult patient. And thank you for your patience. I’m ready whenever you are. Where would you like me to… provide the sample?
DOCTOR: In there. There's a cup. Try to collect a mid-stream sample. And wash your hands afterwards. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Of course. Mid-stream. Right. Thank you, Dr. Havird.
DOCTOR: Here you are. I… hope that’s sufficient. It was a bit awkward, but… I did my best.
PATIENT: Alright. We’ll send this to the lab for analysis. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime… I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Can you please sit up on the examination table?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dr. Havird. Whatever you need. I’m a little nervous, I must admit. I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations, but I understand it’s necessary. Please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and again. Do you have any history of asthma or other respiratory problems?
DOCTOR: No, Dr. Havird. No history of asthma or any respiratory problems. I’ve always had fairly good lungs, as far as I know. I used to run quite a bit when I was younger, but I haven’t been as active lately. Perhaps that’s contributing to… everything. I really am sorry for rambling again. Is everything alright so far?
PATIENT: Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dr. Havird. I’m a little anxious, I hope that doesn't affect the reading. I tend to get quite flustered during medical procedures. Is everything alright?
PATIENT: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not alarming. It's likely due to anxiety, as you suspected. Alright. We’ll wait for the urine sample results. In the meantime, I’m going to suggest you drink plenty of water, and try to reduce your stress levels. We'll discuss the results when they come back and determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
DOCTOR: Acceptable, yes. Though, frankly, I’m not sure how much more “stress reduction” I can do. Everything feels rather… overwhelming at the moment. But I suppose it’s worth trying. Will the results be sent to me directly, or will I need to schedule another appointment?
PATIENT: We’ll contact you when the results are back. You don't need to schedule an appointment at this time. We'll give you a call with the findings and discuss the next steps. If you experience any worsening symptoms - fever, pain in your back or abdomen, blood in your urine - please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
DOCTOR: No, I… I don’t think so. I’m still a little confused, frankly, but I suppose I’ll wait for the results. Thank you, Dr. Havird. For your time and… patience. I appreciate it.
PATIENT: You're welcome, Keoni. It was my pleasure. Try not to worry too much, and remember to stay hydrated. We'll figure this out. Have a good day.
