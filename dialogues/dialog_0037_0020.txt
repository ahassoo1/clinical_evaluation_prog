DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is that how you say it? Dr. AX? It is very nice to meet you too. I am here for… a check-up, I think? The lady on the phone, she said a telehealth visit, but I am here now. I hope that is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. AX is fine. And you are absolutely right to clarify, sometimes those appointments get mixed up. It’s perfectly okay you’re here in person; in fact, it’s often better for a thorough check-up. So, you’re here for a general check-up today?
PATIENT: Yes, a general check-up. I… I have been feeling a little tired lately. And my back, it is not so good. Not bad enough for a real doctor visit, I thought, but my daughter, she said I should come. She worries too much, maybe. But she made the appointment, so here I am.
DOCTOR: That’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. It's always best to get things checked out, even if you're not sure it's serious. Feeling tired and having back pain are definitely things we should discuss. Let's start with the tiredness. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It is just… all the time, I feel like I need a nap. Even after sleeping, I am still tired. It started… maybe a few months ago? I do not do so much anymore, you see. My husband, he… he passed away two years ago. I used to garden, a lot. And bake. Now… not so much. I sit a lot. Maybe that is it? I do not know. It is hard to say.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s completely natural to experience changes in your energy levels and daily routines after such a significant loss. It sounds like this tiredness has been going on for a while now. And you’re right, a change in activity level can certainly contribute to feeling fatigued. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about how tired you feel?
PATIENT: How tired… hmm. It is not like… sick tired. Not with a fever or a cough. It is more… heavy. Like… carrying a big weight all the time. Even simple things, like walking to the kitchen, it takes effort. And I… I have trouble remembering things sometimes. Not important things, usually. Just… where I put my glasses, or what I was going to buy at the store. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, "heavy fatigue" and some trouble with memory. That's helpful. It's good you’re bringing these memory concerns up. It’s not uncommon to experience some forgetfulness, especially with changes in routine or stress, but we want to make sure everything is okay. Now, when you say trouble remembering things, is it more recent events, or older memories as well?
PATIENT: Mostly recent things, I think. Like… yesterday, I made a sandwich, and I forgot what kind of cheese I used. Silly things, like that. And I sometimes… I repeat myself. My daughter tells me I ask the same question five times. It is embarrassing. I do not think it is… a big problem, but it worries her. She is a nurse, you see, so she worries about everything.
DOCTOR: It's good she's attentive, even if it's a little worrisome. Repeating questions and difficulty with recent memory can be normal, but it's certainly something we should explore further. Let’s move on to your back pain. Can you tell me where exactly it hurts, and what makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: It hurts… low on my back, on the left side. Not all the time, but mostly when I stand for too long. Or when I bend over. Sitting is okay, usually. And… lying down helps. But getting out of bed in the morning… that is the worst. It is a little stiff, and it takes a few minutes to feel better. It is not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. Like a muscle is tired, maybe. I do not know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. "Dull ache" that's worse with standing and bending, and improves with lying down. It sounds like it could be related to muscle strain or stiffness. Before we do a physical exam, let’s quickly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had… high blood pressure, a long time ago. The doctor put me on medicine, but I stopped taking it. He said it was okay, that I could watch my diet. And… arthritis, in my hands. Not bad arthritis, just a little stiff sometimes. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. That is all I can think of right now. Is that enough? I am sometimes forgetful, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Benites. High blood pressure, arthritis, and gallbladder removal - thank you for letting me know. And don’t worry about being forgetful – it's perfectly alright. We can always revisit things if you think of anything else. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a little… vitamin D, sometimes. My daughter, she tells me I need it. But that is all. I try to avoid medicine if I can. It never feels good. And… I do not like all the side effects. I prefer to just rest when I am not feeling well.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the occasional vitamin D. And I respect your preference to avoid medication if possible. Before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, I can take anything, I think. Maybe… dust, a little. I sneeze sometimes. But that is all. Nothing serious. I am very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Benites. Okay, let’s move on to a physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a look at your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a nice deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. Not significantly high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, if you could please lean forward a little for me, I'd like to examine your back. Okay, just relax. I'm feeling some mild tenderness on the left side of your lower back, which is likely the source of your pain. No swelling or redness, which is good. Can you point to the exact spot where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: It hurts… right here. Just a dull ache, like a muscle is tired. Not a sharp pain, thankfully. Is it bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It doesn't seem to be anything structurally concerning, Ms. Benites. It feels like muscle strain or tension. The fact that it's relieved with lying down supports that. It's not something that sounds alarming, but it is something we need to address to prevent it from becoming chronic. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and range of motion. Can you please extend your arms out to the sides?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It is a little hard, you know. My shoulders, they are not so good anymore. I used to be very active, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see some limited range of motion, and you're right, some discomfort with movement. It's common with age, and inactivity can contribute to it. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to check your feet and ankles. Please take off your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Okay. There you go. My feet… they are not so pretty, I am afraid. But they get me around!
DOCTOR: They look perfectly functional to me, Ms. Benites. I’m just going to check your pulses and look for any swelling or tenderness. Okay, everything looks good here as well. Some mild tenderness on the tops of your feet, but nothing concerning. Now, based on everything we’ve discussed – your fatigue, back pain, limited range of motion, and slightly elevated blood pressure – I think we have a good starting point. It sounds like we're dealing with a combination of factors, including muscle strain, potential vitamin D deficiency, and possibly some age-related changes. To get a better understanding of your vitamin D levels and rule out any other underlying causes for your fatigue, I'd like to order a few blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests are okay. I do not mind. If it helps to find out what is wrong, then yes, please do them. And… what about the tiredness? Is there anything I can do for that right now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. While we wait for the blood test results, there are a few things we can do to help manage your tiredness. First, let's focus on gentle exercise. Even a short walk each day can make a big difference. Second, make sure you're staying well-hydrated. And third, try to prioritize getting enough sleep. I know it's easier said than done, but aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. We should also consider if there is anything that may be disrupting your sleep. Regarding your back pain, I recommend applying a warm compress to the area for 15-20 minutes several times a day. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if needed. I will also give you a prescription for Vitamin D, 2000IU daily to start, and will follow up with blood work in a month to check levels. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Walk, drink water, sleep… and warm compress. And take the vitamin D. It sounds… doable. Thank you, Doctor. Will the tests… will they take a long time? And… where do I go to get them done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. The tests shouldn't take too long. You can go to the lab right across the street, at the hospital. I’ll have the order sent over electronically, so they should be expecting you. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. My nurse, Sarah, will call you with the results once they're available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You have been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you again. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Sarah will be in shortly to go over the lab order and answer any remaining questions you might have. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a month.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
