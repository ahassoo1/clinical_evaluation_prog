DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Fazzina. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it’s…family history, mostly. My mother’s side, a lot of heart problems. My aunt just had a triple bypass, and honestly, it’s got me a bit worked up. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don’t want to end up like them. It’s probably nothing, but better safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Mr. Theriot. Family history is very important, and it’s good you’re being proactive about your health. It is always better to be safe. So, just to clarify, you’re coming in because of the heart problems in your mother's family, and you’d like to get checked out?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Checked out. I mean, are there tests? Things you can do? I’ve been feeling…fine, really. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. But that doesn’t mean anything, does it? They say a lot of things don't show up 'til it's too late. Honestly, I expect a full work-up. I want to know everything. And I’d prefer if we didn’t waste time with…basic questions, if you catch my drift. I’ve already thought this through.
DOCTOR: I understand you're wanting a comprehensive assessment, and that’s perfectly reasonable. We can definitely do that. It’s good you’ve already given it some thought. Just to be thorough, and so I have a complete picture, I do need to ask some standard questions – even if you feel they might be…basic. It helps me understand your overall health and risk factors. It won’t take long, I promise. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a teacher. Post-secondary engineering, so I’m not exactly a…hypochondriac. But fine. No, nothing diagnosed. I had chickenpox as a kid, that’s it. Maybe a few bad colds over the years. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I keep myself in decent shape, generally. I try to eat reasonably well, although with the job…it's tough. Long hours, stressful work. But I haven’t been sick. Not seriously. Can we just skip to the tests? I’d really rather not spend all day recounting childhood illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Theriot. I understand your desire to get straight to the testing. No problem. Just one more quick question about family history then, to clarify what you mentioned earlier. You said your aunt had a triple bypass… Do you know if any other family members on your mother’s side have had heart problems – like heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Yes, plenty. My grandfather on my mother's side…died of a heart attack, early sixties. My uncle, her brother, has high blood pressure, takes medication for it. And my cousin, her daughter, just found out she has high cholesterol, she's in her forties. Honestly, it’s almost a family tradition, this heart stuff. It's ridiculous, really. They all just…eat poorly and don't exercise. I'm trying to be different, but I worry about the genetics of it all. It's frustrating. Can we talk about what tests you recommend? And do you take my insurance, Medicare?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite a significant family history, Mr. Theriot. And you’re right to be concerned. We do take Medicare, so that won't be an issue. Given your family history, I recommend we start with an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to look at the electrical activity of your heart. We'll also do a comprehensive lipid panel – that’s a blood test to check your cholesterol levels – and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and blood sugar. We should also check your blood pressure, of course. Depending on those results, we might consider further testing, like an echocardiogram or a stress test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That…sounds thorough, I suppose. Fine. But I want to know what you’re looking for. Specifically. I don’t want to just get a bunch of numbers back and have you tell me “everything’s fine” without actually explaining what those numbers mean. I want to understand if I have a predisposition to…anything, even if it’s early stages. Are we looking for plaque buildup? Irregular heartbeat? What exactly are the warning signs? I’m an engineer, I need specifics. Don't patronize me with vague assurances.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, and I apologize if I was being too vague. As an engineer, you deserve specifics. With the EKG, we're looking for any irregularities in your heart's rhythm – signs of arrhythmia, for instance, or evidence of a past heart attack. The lipid panel will tell us your levels of LDL cholesterol – that's the “bad” cholesterol that contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries – HDL cholesterol, the “good” cholesterol that helps remove plaque, and triglycerides. Elevated LDL and triglycerides, and low HDL, increase your risk of heart disease. We'll also be looking at your blood pressure to ensure it's within a healthy range, as high blood pressure puts extra strain on your heart. Based on the results of those tests, we can determine if you have any early indicators of heart disease, like early signs of atherosclerosis – that’s the plaque buildup I mentioned – or an increased risk of developing heart problems in the future. We can discuss lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medication options to manage your risk. Does that clarify things?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s…better. Thank you. Finally, a clear explanation. Okay. So, let’s get these tests done. Do I need to fast beforehand? And where do we do them? Is there a lab here, or do I need to go somewhere else? And roughly how long until I get the results? I have commitments, I don’t want to be left waiting indefinitely. I also need to know, if something is wrong, what’s the next step? Who do I see? A cardiologist? I need a plan, Doctor. A detailed plan.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the lipid panel. That means no food or drinks, except water. The lab is right here in the clinic – room 3. We can get the blood draw done immediately after you see me, and the EKG will only take a few minutes. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. I will personally review them and contact you as soon as I have them. If anything is wrong, the next step would be a consultation with a cardiologist. I have several excellent colleagues I can refer you to. Depending on the findings, they might recommend further testing – like an echocardiogram or a stress test – and discuss potential treatment options, which could include lifestyle modifications, medication, or, in some cases, procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery. I will explain everything to you in detail and help you make the best decision for your health. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s…acceptable. Okay, let’s get this over with. Room 3, you said? And no food. I can manage that. I just… I appreciate you taking the time to actually explain things. It's rare these days. Lead the way, if you wouldn't mind. I'd like to get it done and get some answers. Hopefully, it's nothing. But better safe, right? That’s what I’m paying for.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's what we're here for. And you're right to be proactive. It's always best to be informed. Let’s get you checked out. Room 3 is just down the hall on the left. The lab technician, Sarah, is already expecting you. She’ll take good care of you. She'll get your blood draw done, and then we can do the EKG right here in my office when you're finished. Just let me know when you're ready.
PATIENT: .
