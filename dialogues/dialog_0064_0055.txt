DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I’m here about getting one of those… medical marijuana cards, I believe they call them. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps saying it will help with… things. Though I still think a good night’s sleep and a sensible diet would be far more effective, frankly.
DOCTOR: Right, a medical marijuana card. Yes, I understand. Well, we can certainly explore that option. To do so properly, I’ll need to understand what “things” you’re referring to – what symptoms are you hoping to address with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, it’s just… getting older. My joints ache, naturally. And I don’t sleep as well as I used to. Though I assure you, I maintain a very respectable routine. It's not as though I'm up all night carousing. It’s more… a restlessness. A general… discomfort. Really, it’s just the indignity of it all, if I'm being perfectly frank. It wasn’t always this way, you know. I used to be quite the dancer.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ellan. Getting older does come with its… challenges. And it sounds like you’ve been very active in the past – dancing is wonderful exercise. So, the aches and restlessness are your main concerns. Could you tell me a little more about these aches?
PATIENT: Well, they're mostly in my hips and knees, naturally. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp, debilitating pain, mind you. But it’s there. Especially in the mornings, or after I've been… well, sitting for too long. I try to stay active, with a little walking, but it doesn't quite… cut it, if you understand. And the restlessness… that's more of a… a fidgeting, I suppose. I find myself pacing, even when I don’t need to. It’s quite irritating, really. It doesn't allow for a good, peaceful evening, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, hips and knees, mostly dull aches, worse in the mornings and after sitting. And this restlessness, the fidgeting… Has this been going on for a long time, or is it a more recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been… creeping up on me, I suppose. The aches started a few years back, gradually worsening. The restlessness is more recent, perhaps the last six months or so. It's quite bothersome, especially at night. It disrupts everything. I try to read, but I can't focus. I try to watch television, but I simply can’t sit still long enough to enjoy it. It's simply… a nuisance. I really don't understand what's happening to me, and frankly, I resent it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. It sounds very disruptive to your daily life. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the aches and restlessness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… my digestion isn’t what it used to be, if you must know. But that’s hardly new. I’ve always had a… delicate constitution. And I tire more easily, certainly. But I suppose that's to be expected at my age. I wouldn’t say anything truly remarkable, no. It’s mostly these aches and this… inability to simply relax. My daughter keeps suggesting this marijuana will help, but I must admit, I’m rather skeptical. I've never touched the stuff in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some digestive issues and increased fatigue alongside the aches and restlessness. And you’re understandably hesitant about trying medical marijuana. That's perfectly reasonable. Before we discuss that further, let’s just quickly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – arthritis, perhaps, or anything else?
PATIENT: Arthritis? No, never. I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises, a touch of the flu now and then, but nothing… official. I had high blood pressure for a while, but that’s been under control for years, thankfully. I take a small pill each morning, that’s all. And I had a rather nasty bout of shingles a few years back, but that's long gone, thank goodness. My daughter, bless her heart, is always trying to get me to see specialists for this and that, but honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been a remarkably healthy woman. I attribute it to good genes and sensible living. Really, I don’t think I need a lot of poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ellan. Controlled hypertension and a history of shingles. That’s helpful. And you’re right, a sensible lifestyle is often the best medicine. Now, before we move on, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one pill, Doctor. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. A small white one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. That's it. No creams, no potions, no supplements. I find all those things are rather… unnecessary. My daughter tries to get me to take all sorts of things, vitamin D, glucosamine… but I simply refuse. I believe in a balanced diet and a good night’s sleep. That’s always been my philosophy. Really, I think all this fuss over medication is rather modern. People used to rely on common sense, you know. Not a pill for every ache and pain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. A sensible approach is often best. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. A little hay fever in the spring, perhaps, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Nothing serious, certainly. I’ve always been quite robust, you see. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Honestly, I think all this worry over allergies is rather… excessive. People used to build up immunity, you know. Not hide from a little pollen.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, just to complete the picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. Well, my mother lived to be 89, a remarkably strong woman. She had a touch of arthritis in her later years, but nothing debilitating. My father passed away relatively young, a heart condition, I believe. And my sister… she’s still alive, thankfully, but she has some trouble with her digestion, much like myself. It’s hardly a remarkable family history, Doctor. Mostly just… ordinary people living ordinary lives. No grand ailments, no terrible diseases, thankfully. A rather… unremarkable constitution, all around, if I’m being perfectly frank.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. That’s helpful. Now, before we consider anything further, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t had one of those in… well, I can’t even remember. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. But if it will satisfy your professional obligations, I suppose I can endure a little poking and prodding. Just try not to take too much of my time, if you please. I have a luncheon planned with my friends this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I’ll be as quick as possible. We'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. Please, have a seat on the examination table. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a good range. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, when I press here on your hips and knees… does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: A little… yes, a little discomfort there. Not a sharp pain, mind you, but a dull ache. It's always worse in the mornings, as I said. And on the left hip, just a little tenderness. It's nothing remarkable, Doctor, I assure you. I've always been rather… sensitive in those joints. It's probably just a little arthritis, as my mother had. Though I still think a good warming salve would be far more effective than all these… modern treatments. Honestly, I’m not one for a lot of fuss. Is this what you were looking for? A little ache here, a little tenderness there? Now can we please get this over with? I do have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ellan. No visible swelling or redness, which is good. It sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of osteoarthritis, as you suspected. However, to get a more definitive diagnosis, we could consider getting some X-rays of your hips and knees. That would allow us to see the condition of the joints and rule out any other potential issues. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: X-rays? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve never been one for a lot of… machinery. It all seems rather… excessive. And frankly, I don’t see what good it will do. I know my joints ache. I know my mother had arthritis. What more do we need to know? I really think a good warming salve, as I said, would be far more effective. And frankly, I’m not keen on being exposed to all that… radiation. I’ve heard it’s not particularly good for one's health. Really, I think I’ll pass on the X-rays, thank you very much. What does this have to do with this marijuana card, anyway? Are we getting closer to a decision? I really don't see why all this poking and prodding is necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. You’re right, it’s your decision. While X-rays would help confirm the diagnosis, we can proceed without them. Now, regarding the medical marijuana card... given your symptoms of aches and restlessness, and your reluctance to pursue further testing, it could be an option to explore. However, it’s important to understand that it’s not a cure, and the effectiveness varies from person to person. Also, there are potential side effects to consider. Do you have any specific concerns about trying medical marijuana?
PATIENT: Concerns? Well, frankly, I’ve never touched the stuff in my life! I was raised a respectable woman, you understand. It all seems rather… disreputable. And frankly, I don’t want to be… altered. I have a luncheon to attend, and I certainly don’t want to be giggling like a schoolgirl. I’m perfectly capable of holding a conversation without… assistance. Really, I’m just not sure this is for me. My daughter keeps saying it will help, but honestly, she’s always trying to get me to try the latest fads. I really don't understand why you would even suggest it, frankly. It just seems… inappropriate. Is this what modern medicine has come to? Suggesting illegal substances to perfectly respectable women? It’s quite shocking, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your reservations completely, Ellan. You’re right to be cautious. It’s not about suggesting anything illegal, and it’s definitely not about altering your personality. Medical marijuana is a regulated treatment option, and it's used by many people to manage chronic pain and other conditions. It’s a different approach than traditional medications, and it’s not right for everyone. Given your strong reservations, and the fact that you're already hesitant to pursue further testing, I wouldn’t recommend forcing the issue. We could explore other options for managing your pain and restlessness, such as physical therapy, gentle exercise, or over-the-counter pain relievers. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Now that sounds more sensible, Doctor. Physical therapy… gentle exercise… those are things I can understand. Over-the-counter pain relievers… I suppose I could try those. Frankly, I’m not keen on putting anything foreign into my body if I can avoid it. My daughter has been pushing this marijuana thing so relentlessly, I was beginning to think she’d lost her mind. Physical therapy… yes, that sounds much more reasonable. Do you have any recommendations for a good physical therapist nearby? Perhaps one who understands the… sensitivities of a woman of my age? I really don't need anyone pushing me beyond my limits.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I have a few excellent physical therapists in the area who specialize in geriatric care. They are very patient and understanding, and they will tailor a program to your specific needs and limitations. Here are the names and numbers of Dr. Anya Sharma and Mr. David Chen. Both have excellent reputations and are very experienced with patients of your age. I recommend calling them and scheduling a consultation to see which one would be the best fit for you. Would you like me to write a referral note for them as well?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… yes, that sounds… respectable. A woman doctor, perhaps she’ll understand my… concerns better. Yes, a referral note would be most appreciated, Doctor. That would be very helpful. Honestly, I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my… reservations. My daughter is always trying to rush me into things, and it's nice to have someone who understands the importance of a… sensible approach. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Now, is there anything else you require? I do have that luncheon to attend, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the referral note for Dr. Sharma. It simply outlines your symptoms and my recommendations for physical therapy. I don't require anything further from you at this time. Just remember to listen to your body, and don’t push yourself too hard. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a lovely luncheon! And if you’re still experiencing discomfort after a few sessions of physical therapy, feel free to schedule a follow-up appointment with me. Take care, Ellan.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… restraint. And your understanding. I do hope this physical therapy will be effective. I really don't want to become one of those… frail old ladies. I shall certainly keep that luncheon in mind. And if this therapy proves… ineffective, I may consider that follow-up appointment. Though I still maintain a good warming salve would be far more effective. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you once again for your… sensible approach.
