DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? Just need some papers signed. I got these health forms… need them notarized, I think is the word? For… well, it doesn’t really matter where, exactly. Just need it done quick, if we can.
DOCTOR: Papers signed. Notarized. This is a medical practice, Ms. Tippens, not a…document-servicing facility. While I appreciate your…directness, I require a medical reason for an examination to justify my time and resources. Do you have any health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… see what you mean. I didn't… I suppose I didn’t think of it that way. No, no real concerns, not lately. Just trying to get these forms filled out for… a program. It requires a doctor’s signature to verify I’m healthy enough to participate. That’s all. I just thought… you sign papers all day, right? Is that so much to ask? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect, simply signing a form without assessing your health status is…unethical. It provides a false representation and compromises my professional integrity. However… given your age, and the fact that you are presenting without a clear medical complaint, I will perform a brief examination. A brief one. It will include vital signs and a cursory physical assessment. Then, and only then, will I consider signing the forms, assuming your health allows. Do you agree to this procedure?
PATIENT: Oh, gracious. Yes, Doctor, of course. Whatever you need. Brief is good. Very good. I just… I really need these forms done, and I appreciate you working with me. Vital signs… that’s blood pressure and… what else? Is there a fee for all this? I don’t… well, I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature. Standard vitals. And yes, there is a standard consultation fee, even for a brief examination. Given your lack of insurance, we can discuss a payment plan afterward. Let's not dwell on finances at this moment, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh. A payment plan… Right. That’s… okay. I guess. Just… let's get the examination done, then we can talk about money? I don’t want to cause trouble. Whatever you need first, Doctor. I’m ready. Is there somewhere I should… sit, or…?
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the examination table. I’ll need you to remove your shoes and socks. And please, try to remain still during the examination. This isn’t a social visit; it’s a medical assessment. We need to be efficient.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Efficient. I understand. It’s just… it’s been a long time since I had a proper check-up. I suppose I haven’t needed one, until now. Alright… here we go. Is there anything special I need to do? Breathe a certain way, or…?
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally, Ms. Tippens. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your blood pressure. Try to relax. And please, refrain from speaking unless directly asked a question. I need to concentrate. Blood pressure is… 148 over 82. Slightly elevated. Heart rate is 78, regular.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated? Is that… bad? I do get a little nervous at the doctor, maybe that’s it? I haven’t had my blood pressure checked in… well, a very long time. It’s probably just the nerves. Is everything else alright? You don't seem very talkative, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Slightly elevated blood pressure can be attributed to several factors, including anxiety, as you mentioned. However, it warrants further investigation. Pulse is regular and present. Now, if you don’t mind, I need to auscultate your lungs. Please take a deep breath, and exhale slowly. Breathing is… somewhat diminished on the left side. Any history of shortness of breath, Ms. Tippens?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Not really. Well… sometimes, when I walk uphill. But I’m… not a young woman anymore, Doctor. I figured it was just getting old. I live in a hilly area, you see. Lots of walking. It’s not bad, just… takes my breath away a little. And I smoke, if that matters. Though I’ve been trying to cut back.
DOCTOR: You smoke?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I have for… a long time. It’s a bad habit, I know. My mother smoked, and her mother before her. It’s just… something I do when I’m stressed. Or bored. Or… just about anything, really. I know it's awful for me. I’ve tried to quit so many times. Patches, gum, everything. It just doesn’t seem to work. It doesn’t change anything about the forms, does it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, your smoking history is… significant. It explains the diminished breath sounds and raises concerns about potential respiratory issues. Simply signing a form stating you are “healthy enough” would be… irresponsible. I cannot, in good conscience, fulfill your request without further investigation. I recommend a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. We need to assess the extent of any lung damage.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? And… what was the other thing? A pulmonary… test? Oh dear. That sounds… expensive. And complicated. I just needed a signature, Doctor. A simple signature! Is there anything else I can do? Maybe just… write down that I’m generally feeling okay? I don't want to cause trouble, and I don't have a lot of money. Honestly, I think I'm just getting old and worried about nothing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your financial concerns, but I am a physician, not a notary. My duty is to ensure your health and safety, not to facilitate participation in programs without proper medical evaluation. I cannot compromise my professional ethics. I will not sign the form. However, I can provide you with a list of low-cost clinics in the area that may be able to assist you with the necessary testing.
PATIENT: .
