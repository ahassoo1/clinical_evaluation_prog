DOCTOR: Hi Edric, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks for having me. It’s… muscle weakness, mostly. It’s been getting worse the last few weeks, and honestly, it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness. And you said it's been getting worse over the last few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, um… it started with just feeling a bit tired after doing things, like carrying groceries. Now, even getting up from a chair takes effort. It’s mostly in my legs, I think, but my arms feel it too sometimes. Not all the time, though. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating when it's not consistent. So, it began with fatigue during activities like carrying groceries, and now you're noticing difficulty with things like standing up from a chair. You feel it mainly in your legs, but occasionally in your arms as well. Is it a gradual weakness, or does it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It wasn’t like one day I couldn’t do something. More like… it just got harder and harder over time. I didn’t really pay attention at first, figured I was just getting older, you know? But now… it’s noticeable. It's mostly when I try to do something, not just all the time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Gradual onset, more noticeable with effort. Okay. And when you say "harder," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It's… like trying to push through thick mud. That’s the best way I can put it. It’s not painful, exactly, just… heavy. And like it takes a lot more focus to even start the movement. It’s hard to explain, it’s not a sharp thing, it’s just… resistance. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, thank you for explaining it so clearly. "Like pushing through thick mud" is a really helpful description. No pain, just heavy resistance and difficulty initiating movement. Let’s get a little more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I've been a bit more tired overall, I guess. But I work long hours, so that’s not unusual. No numbness, no tingling, no… anything else that stands out, really. Just the weakness and the tiredness. Oh! Wait. I have been feeling a little dizzy sometimes, but only when I stand up too fast. That’s… is that related?
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the weakness and tiredness, you've also noticed some dizziness upon standing quickly. That could be related, yes. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much, honestly. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I had chickenpox as a kid, broke my arm once, the usual. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, no… anything major. I mostly just try to avoid doctors if I can. Is that bad? I don't take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all. Lots of people feel that way. Just trying to get a complete understanding. So, no significant past medical history, no surgeries, no regular medications. What about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… something with her joints, arthritis maybe? She walked with a cane for a long time. That's about all I know. We weren't really a family that talked about health much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure in your father and possible arthritis in your grandmother. That’s good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little about what you do for work and what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Sure. I'm an insurance appraiser, auto damage. Basically, I go to car accident scenes and assess the damage, figure out how much the insurance company needs to pay. It's a lot of walking around, bending, lifting… and a lot of paperwork. A typical day is… long. I'm on my feet most of the time, driving between sites, taking photos, writing reports. Usually 10-12 hours. It's pretty physical work, even though it doesn't seem like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a physically demanding job – a lot of walking, bending, lifting, and long hours on your feet as an auto insurance appraiser. That’s helpful information. Alright, Edric. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let's get it over with, hopefully we can figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could sit here for me, and we’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and range of motion. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72, both within normal limits. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Okay, and now I’m going to ask you to resist as I push against your arms and legs. Hmm. Your grip strength is good, but I am noticing some slight weakness in your legs, particularly when resisting my pressure. Not dramatically weak, but reduced compared to your arms. Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. There. Is that okay? It felt… a little unsteady. I don't usually feel like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. I noticed a slight hesitation in your steps and a bit of instability. It's subtle, but it confirms what I was feeling during the strength testing. Okay, Edric. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. The weakness in your legs, along with the fatigue and dizziness, could be due to a number of things – everything from vitamin deficiencies to nerve issues. Given your job and the gradual onset of symptoms, we should also consider muscle strain or early signs of something more long-term. I'd like to order some blood tests to start. We'll check your vitamin levels – particularly B12 and D – as well as your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. We should also run a thyroid panel, just to rule out any thyroid issues. Finally, I want to order a creatine kinase level to check for muscle damage. Do you have any allergies to medication, or any conditions that would prevent you from having blood drawn?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. And no, nothing that would stop a blood draw. I don't like needles, but I can handle it. That sounds… thorough. Is it something serious, Doctor? I mean, you’re checking for a lot of things.
DOCTOR: It’s good you don’t have any allergies. And you’re right, it is a comprehensive panel. I order these tests to rule things out, Edric, and to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean I suspect anything serious, but it’s important to be thorough, especially with a gradual onset of symptoms like yours. There are several possibilities, ranging from relatively minor things like a vitamin deficiency to something more involved, like a nerve issue or a muscle disorder. It's too early to say without the test results. I’ll write up the lab order, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It should take about 10-15 minutes. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if your weakness gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as numbness, tingling, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Just… try to rule things out. And go to the ER if it gets worse. Okay. I guess I just… want to get back to normal. I have a lot of work to do. When do you think I’ll get the results? And… will this take long to fix? I have insurance clients waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Edric. It’s frustrating to feel limited, especially when you have responsibilities. We’ll work as quickly as possible to get you back to normal. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back to us. I’ll have the nurse contact you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment. As for how long it will take to fix, that really depends on what the tests show. If it’s something simple like a vitamin deficiency, it could be resolved relatively quickly with supplementation. If it’s something more complex, it may take longer to diagnose and treat. I know it’s not a definitive answer, but I promise we’ll keep you informed every step of the way. And I'll do my best to get you back on your feet as soon as possible. For now, try to avoid any strenuous activity that worsens your symptoms. Rest as much as possible, and stay hydrated. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Edric. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. The nurse will be right in. Take care.
