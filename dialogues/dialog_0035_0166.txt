DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become… noticeable enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s primarily in my left leg, though sometimes I feel a little tingling in my right one as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your left leg, with some tingling in the right. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not constant, Doctor. It comes and goes. When it is there, it feels… almost like it’s fallen asleep, but not quite as intense. More like a… muted sensation. It started maybe a week ago, and I didn’t think much of it at first. I assumed I’d just been sitting in a strange position while working, but it hasn’t really gone away. It’s worse after I’ve been on my feet for a long time, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started about a week ago, intermittent numbness, more like a muted sensation, and worsened with prolonged standing. Do you notice anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When I sit down and elevate my leg, it tends to ease up pretty quickly. Not completely gone, but definitely less noticeable. Also, if I’m actively moving around – like walking, but not for too long – that seems to help as well. Just sitting still seems to make it worse, strangely enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting and elevating helps, and moderate activity seems to be beneficial. Do you recall any specific injury or event that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. That’s what’s been bothering me. There hasn’t been any sort of fall, twist, or anything like that. I’ve been working a lot on a new animation project, so I have been spending a lot of time at my workstation, but I haven’t noticed any specific incident that would explain it. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright, no specific injury. Let’s talk a little bit more about where exactly you’re feeling this numbness. Can you point to the specific areas on your leg where it’s most prominent?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. It’s… primarily along the outside of my left leg, Doctor. Starting sort of around my hip and running down to just above my knee. Sometimes I feel it in my foot as well, mostly in the top of my foot and my toes. It’s not a sharp pain, just the numbness, but it’s… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, along the outside of the left leg, from the hip down to just above the knee, sometimes extending into the top of the foot and toes. Any weakness in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s a good question. It’s subtle, Doctor, but I have noticed that my left leg feels a little less stable than my right, especially after I’ve been standing for a while. It’s not enough to make me stumble, but I definitely feel like I need to concentrate a bit more to keep my balance. And, now that I think about it, it takes me a moment longer to get going after I've been sitting for a long period, like my leg needs to… wake up.
DOCTOR: Alright, some subtle weakness, feeling of instability, and a delay in initiating movement after sitting. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation. This might involve some light tapping and I'll ask you to move your leg in different directions. Just let me know if anything feels painful. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Relax your leg… Okay, good. Left side reflex is… 2+, normal. Right side is also 2+, normal. Now, I want you to try to push your foot up against my hand. Good. And now, push your foot down against my hand. Okay, strength seems good. Now, can you wiggle your toes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can wiggle my toes. No problem there. I can also curl them, and spread them apart. I believe my strength is alright, as you said. It doesn’t feel any different than usual, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Close your eyes for me. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your leg with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel the touch. Okay, sensation is intact. Everything feels normal on both sides. Do you have any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. Just the sensation of the touch. It feels… normal, as you said. No tingling, no burning, just… the cotton swab.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check one more thing. This might be a little uncomfortable. I’m going to gently stretch your leg, trying to raise it straight up in the air. Tell me if you feel any pain in your back or down your leg.
PATIENT: There’s a little bit of discomfort… mostly in my lower back, Doctor. Not sharp, more like a… pulling sensation. And… yes, a little bit of tingling down the back of my leg, now that you mention it. Not intense, but definitely noticeable. Perhaps around a 6 out of 10? Mostly the back pain though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6/10 pain in the lower back, and some tingling down the back of the leg with leg raise. That’s helpful. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some radiculopathy, which means a nerve in your lower back is being irritated or compressed. It's possible this is causing the numbness, tingling, and weakness you're feeling in your leg. The straight leg raise test was positive, which supports that. Do you have any history of back problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I’ve never really had any trouble with my back before. I’ve occasionally had a little soreness after strenuous activity, but nothing that would require a visit to the doctor. This is… new. I mostly do a lot of sitting, as I mentioned. Animation work is quite sedentary, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior back problems. Given your sedentary lifestyle and the onset of these symptoms, it's likely related to some irritation of the sciatic nerve, probably due to muscle imbalances or a slight disc issue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an MRI of your lower back to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. An MRI would be fine. I’d like to know for certain what’s causing this, and if it's something I need to be particularly concerned about.
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll send the order to the radiology department, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or prolonged sitting. Try to take frequent breaks to stretch and walk around. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage the discomfort. I also want to recommend physical therapy. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles, which can help alleviate the pressure on the nerve. Do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And I'm not currently taking any medications at all. I generally try to avoid them if possible. I’ll definitely follow your recommendations regarding the stretching, walking, and physical therapy. That all sounds very reasonable. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies or medications. As for warning signs, you should contact me immediately if you experience any of the following: worsening weakness in your leg, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe, unrelenting pain that doesn't respond to over-the-counter pain relievers. These could indicate a more serious condition that requires immediate attention. I’m going to give you a written summary of our conversation, the plan of care, and the MRI order. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: That’s very thorough, Doctor, thank you. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel much better knowing what steps we’re taking. I appreciate your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad I could help. Let’s get you scheduled for that MRI, and we’ll discuss the results once they’re available. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns in the meantime. I’ll have the nurse print out that summary for you. Have a good day, Tarin.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Alzoubi. You as well. .
