DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my back. It's been really bad. Worse than usual, I think. It hurts to move, and even sitting is hard now. I got cancer, you see... and it’s… well, it’s in my back now too. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, Ms. Meigs. Both the back pain itself and the cancer diagnosis. We'll definitely get to the bottom of what's going on. Just to clarify, when you say “worse than usual,” how long have you been experiencing back pain in general, and when did it start to worsen?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time, Doctor. Back pain… maybe five years now? On and off. But this bad… this started maybe two weeks ago. It just kept getting worse each day. I didn't think much of it at first, you know? Just thought it was a bad day. But then it didn't get better.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years of on-and-off back pain, with a significant worsening over the past two weeks. That’s helpful. And can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. It's not just one kind of hurt. It’s like… a deep ache, all across my lower back. And then sometimes… sharp pains. Like needles. It feels like it goes all the way through. It’s worse when I try to stand up straight, or bend over. Even just coughing makes it hurt bad. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. A deep ache with sharp, shooting pains… that's a pretty clear description. And it’s aggravated by movement and even coughing. Now, you mentioned a cancer diagnosis. Do you mind if I ask what type of cancer, and where it was originally diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, no problem. It's… breast cancer. They found it three years ago. I had surgery and… treatment. Everything was okay for a while. But the doctor… they said it spread. To my bones. Mostly in my back, they think. That was… six months ago. They started me on new medicine for it, but it doesn't seem to be helping much anymore. That's why I'm here. I'm scared, Doctor. Really scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Meigs. It’s completely valid to feel that way given everything you've been through. We will do everything we can to help manage your pain and improve your quality of life. Let’s take a closer look at your back. I'm going to need to do a physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, I can do that. Be careful… it hurts when I move.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I'm just going to feel along your back. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, I'm noticing some tenderness right here, and some muscle tightening on this side. Now, can you try to bend forward for me, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooooh… that hurts! Just a little… can’t go much further. It feels like something is… stuck. And it really hurts when I try to push it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion, and pain with forward flexion. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’m going to lift your leg straight up in the air, one at a time. Just let your leg go limp, and tell me if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. No radiating pain with the straight leg raise, which is good. And your reflexes and sensation seem normal, which is also encouraging. Okay, Ms. Meigs. I've completed the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it appears you’re experiencing pain likely related to your cancer affecting the bones in your spine. However, we need to confirm this with imaging.
PATIENT: Okay… that makes sense, I guess. Imaging… like an X-ray? Is it going to hurt? And… will it show how bad it is? I'm… really worried about how much worse it's gotten. It’s just… I don’t want to be in pain all the time.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Ms. Meigs. Yes, we'll start with an X-ray of your spine to get a better look at the bones. We might also need a CT scan or MRI, depending on what the X-ray shows. The X-ray itself is painless – it's just a quick picture. CT scans and MRIs are also painless, but you will need to lie very still for a while. The imaging will help us see how much the cancer has affected your spine, and whether there are any new areas of involvement. It will also help us rule out other possible causes of your pain. I understand your concern about being in pain all the time. That’s something we can address, and we have several options for managing your pain, including medication, physical therapy, and other treatments. We will discuss all of those options with you once we have the results of the imaging. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help you feel comfortable and improve your quality of life. In the meantime, I'm going to order those X-rays right now. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. My husband… he had some trouble with dye once, but that wasn't me. And… thank you, Doctor. It helps just to talk about it, you know? And to know you'll try to help. So, X-rays… okay. Will they tell me when I can get them done? I can’t drive myself if it's far away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. And you’re right, it always helps to talk things through. I’m going to have my nurse schedule those X-rays for you right now. She’ll make sure they’re scheduled at a location that’s convenient for you, and we'll ensure you have a ride arranged if needed. She'll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the imaging. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, I want to address your pain. Are you currently taking any medication for pain?
PATIENT: Yes… I take something. A little blue pill. The doctor gave it to me after the surgery. It doesn't help much anymore. Maybe takes the edge off… but mostly, I just try to rest. And… pray. It’s just getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little blue pill. Do you happen to know the name of the medication or the dosage?
PATIENT: Um… I think it's called… oxycodone? 5 milligrams. I take two, three times a day. Sometimes four, when it's really bad. But… like I said, it doesn’t help as much now. Is that… too much? Should I be taking less? I don’t want to get addicted or anything. My sister… she had problems with pills, a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, oxycodone 5mg, two to four times a day. It's good that you're aware of the potential for dependence, Ms. Meigs, and that’s a very valid concern, especially given your sister’s history. Taking more than prescribed can indeed lead to tolerance, dependence, and other side effects. Given that it's not providing adequate pain relief, and the amount you're taking, we need to re-evaluate your pain management plan. We can consider several options. We could try a different pain medication, add another medication to help with the pain, or explore non-medication options like physical therapy or nerve blocks. Before we make any changes, I’d like to review your medical history in more detail to make sure there aren't any contraindications to other medications. Let me just pull up your records here…
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds good, Doctor. Anything to help. I just want to be able to… live a little. It's hard to do anything when you're always hurting. My grandkids… they want me to play with them. I don't want to miss out. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden, Ms. Meigs. And you deserve to enjoy time with your grandkids and live a full life. That's exactly what we're going to work towards. I see here that you’ve had surgery for breast cancer three years ago, followed by chemotherapy and radiation. You also have a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. And as you mentioned, you’re currently taking oxycodone for pain. Given your history and current medications, I think we should start by optimizing your pain control without increasing the dose of oxycodone. I’m going to prescribe you a medication called gabapentin, which can help with nerve pain. We can also discuss referral to a pain management specialist, who can offer additional treatment options like injections or nerve blocks. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Gabapentin… okay. I haven't heard of that one. Will it… make me sleepy? I need to be able to drive to pick up my grandkids sometimes. And… what's a nerve block? That sounds… scary. I don't want anything that's going to mess me up even more. I just want the pain to go away.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Ms. Meigs. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about new medications and treatments. Gabapentin can sometimes cause drowsiness, especially when you first start taking it. However, the dosage is adjustable, and we can start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed to minimize side effects. If you experience excessive drowsiness, we can always reduce the dose or switch to a different medication. A nerve block is an injection of medication near a specific nerve to temporarily block pain signals. It’s a relatively safe procedure, and it can provide significant pain relief for several weeks or even months. It's not a permanent fix, but it can give you a break from the pain and allow you to participate in activities you enjoy. It’s important to emphasize that we’re not going to do anything without your full understanding and consent. We will discuss all the risks and benefits of each treatment option, and you have the right to refuse any treatment you’re not comfortable with. For now, let’s start with the gabapentin. I’m going to prescribe you 300mg three times a day. I’ll also write a referral to a pain management specialist. Would you like me to give you information about the gabapentin and the pain management specialist now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be helpful. And… thank you, Doctor. You really listen. It’s nice to have someone who cares. I'm… ready to try anything to get my life back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. That’s my job, and I’m glad I could offer you some reassurance. I truly believe we can find a way to manage your pain and improve your quality of life. Here's the information about gabapentin and the pain management specialist. Please read it over carefully, and don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions. I'm also going to send a prescription for the gabapentin to your pharmacy. And my nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to see how you're doing. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse or you experience any concerning side effects, please call us right away. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've really helped me feel a lot better. I’m going to go home and try to rest. And… maybe call the pain specialist. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Have a good day.
