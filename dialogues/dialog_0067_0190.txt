DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this unsteadiness, really. I… I don't quite know how to explain it beyond that. It’s just… I feel off-balance sometimes. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it seems to be… more frequent lately. I apologize, it’s difficult to recall specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble remembering details when you're feeling unwell. “Off-balance” is a good starting point. Let's try to pinpoint it a bit more. When you say it’s been happening for a "little while," can you give me a rough estimate – weeks, months?
PATIENT: Hmm… months, I believe. Perhaps… three or four months? It started subtly, and I initially dismissed it as fatigue from work. I work… I work with rotary drills, out in the oil and gas fields. It's rather physical. But it hasn't… improved with rest, and I’ve begun to worry. It's just… disconcerting, you see. And now it’s becoming… noticeable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, starting subtly and gradually worsening, despite rest. And you work in the oil and gas fields with rotary drills – that's good information to have. So, when you say "noticeable," can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to describe precisely. Sometimes I feel like I’m swaying, even when I’m standing still. And I’ve… stumbled a few times, though thankfully nothing serious. It's more… a feeling of instability, like I might fall. It happens mostly when I’m walking, but occasionally just standing. I’m… quite tall, you see, so perhaps that contributes? It’s… unnerving, especially at work. I don't want to be a hazard to myself or others.
DOCTOR: Okay, swaying, stumbling, a feeling of instability mostly when walking but sometimes standing. And you’re wondering if your height plays a role. That's a valid thought. Now, can you tell me anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger…? That’s… a good question. I’m not certain. I don’t recall any specific events. It doesn’t seem to be related to exertion, necessarily. It happens… even when I’m calm. Perhaps… I notice it more when I turn my head quickly? Or when it's very bright. But honestly… I’m grasping at straws, Doctor. I truly don’t know. It's… frustrating. I wish I could pinpoint something concrete. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers – it doesn’t seem to be consistently related to exertion, and you've noticed it might be worse with quick head movements or bright light. That’s helpful information, even if it’s not definitive. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any dizziness – a spinning sensation – along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… a spinning sensation… I… believe I have, yes. Not always, but… occasionally. It's not a constant spinning, more like… waves of it. And sometimes… my vision seems a little blurry when it happens. It passes relatively quickly, usually. But it’s disconcerting, of course. I’m afraid I’m not very helpful with specifics, Doctor. My memory… it’s not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent dizziness – a “waves of” spinning sensation – and occasional blurry vision accompanying the unsteadiness. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, have you experienced any headaches, nausea, or vomiting along with these symptoms?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. They are… not severe, usually. More like a dull ache. Nausea… I believe I had a bout of nausea a few weeks ago, but I attributed it to something I ate. And no, no vomiting. Certainly not. I… I tend not to get sick easily, if that makes any difference. I apologize for being so vague. It’s… difficult to recall everything precisely.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dull headaches, one instance of nausea, no vomiting. You don't get sick easily. Alright. Let’s shift gears a little. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears…? Hmm. That’s… a good question. I work around… quite a lot of machinery, as you know. There is constant noise. I suppose… I’ve grown accustomed to a constant hum. It’s possible I’ve blocked it out, or simply not noticed. As for changes in my hearing… I haven’t been specifically aware of any. But I haven’t had my hearing checked in… many years. I apologize again for my lack of precision, Doctor. It is frustrating to me as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant noise exposure at work, potentially masking any ringing, no recent hearing check. Alright. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you experienced any weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No. No weakness, numbness, or tingling. Nothing of that sort. I… I've been perfectly capable physically, until this unsteadiness began. I have to be, with my line of work. It requires a great deal of strength and coordination. I do feel rather fatigued at times, but I attribute that to the physical demands of my job, and perhaps… the stress of everything. I apologize if I am rambling, Doctor. I simply want to be as thorough as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weakness, numbness, or tingling, fatigue attributed to work and stress. Alright. One final question before we move on to your medical history: Have you had any recent head injuries, or any changes in your vision besides the occasional blurriness?
PATIENT: Head injuries… No. Nothing recent. I’ve been… fortunate in that regard. I take precautions, of course, with my work. And changes in vision… only the occasional blurriness, as I mentioned. No double vision, or loss of vision, or anything of that nature. Just… a temporary clouding, sometimes. I truly wish I could be more specific, Doctor. It's… disheartening to me that I can't recall more details. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent head injuries, only occasional blurriness. Alright. It's perfectly fine, Lilyanna. You're providing as much information as you can, and that’s what’s important. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic medical conditions… I… I believe I’m generally quite healthy, Doctor. I have never been formally diagnosed with anything of that nature. I’ve always been… robust, I suppose. Though… my late husband, Arthur, he… he had some heart troubles. But that was… many years ago. I don't recall the specifics, truthfully. I do have private insurance, if that is relevant. I apologize for my inability to provide a more detailed response. My memory… it truly is a hindrance.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no formal diagnoses, late husband had heart troubles, private insurance. Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No. I have never undergone any surgery, to my recollection. Nothing of that sort. I… I've always been fortunate in that regard as well. I’ve never required hospitalization, except for… the birth of my children. But that was… many years ago, and I don't recall the details precisely. I truly apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, only childbirth. Alright. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not currently taking any medications, not even over-the-counter. I prefer to avoid them, if possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but nothing regularly. I believe in maintaining a healthy diet and getting enough rest, as much as my work allows. I did take something for… a mild cold a few months ago, I believe. But that was temporary, and I don't recall the name of it. I apologize for my lack of precision, Doctor. It’s… frustrating for me as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, occasional multivitamin, used something for a cold recently but doesn't recall the name. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, Doctor. I do not believe I have any allergies. I have never experienced a severe allergic reaction to anything, to my recollection. I can eat… most foods without issue. Though… I sometimes feel a bit sluggish after consuming dairy, but I wouldn't classify that as a true allergy. I apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. I wish I could be more specific, but my memory… it truly is a hindrance.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, occasional sluggishness after dairy. Now, let’s talk about family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have a history of neurological conditions, heart problems, or any other significant medical issues?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… difficult. My parents… they passed away many years ago. And I don’t… I don't recall specifics about their health. They lived… quite a distance away. My late husband, Arthur, he did have those heart troubles, as I mentioned before. And… my children are both healthy, as far as I know. They live abroad, and we don’t… communicate frequently. I apologize for my inability to provide a more detailed response, Doctor. My memory… it is a significant obstacle. It’s frustrating for me as well. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, late husband had heart trouble, parents passed away long ago, limited information about their health, children are currently healthy. Alright. And finally, before we move onto a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, as I mentioned, I am… widowed. My husband, Arthur, passed away several years ago. I work as a rotary drill operator in the oil and gas fields. It’s… demanding work. I don’t… I don't have many close friends, to be honest. I live alone, and spend most of my time focused on my work. I don’t… I don’t drink alcohol, and I don’t smoke. I apologize if that is not the sort of information you were seeking, Doctor. My life is… rather simple, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, widowed, rotary drill operator, lives alone, no smoking or alcohol. Alright. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Lilyanna. Now, I'd like to conduct a physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I understand. I trust your judgment, and I am willing to cooperate in any way that I can. I apologize if I am a difficult patient, with my lack of specific recollections. I truly hope this examination will prove helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. You aren't difficult at all. And it’s perfectly understandable. Let's start with your vital signs. I'm going to take your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration rate is 16. That's all within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear, normal breath sounds bilaterally. Next, I’ll check your neurological function. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can follow your finger without moving my head. It… it is a bit difficult to maintain focus at times, but I am trying. Is this… is this normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's okay if it’s slightly difficult. Now, I’m going to assess your balance. Can you stand up and try to stand on one leg for 30 seconds, first on your right leg, then on your left?
PATIENT: Alright. Oh… Doctor… I… I don’t believe I can. It’s… rather difficult to maintain my balance. I’m… I’m afraid I’m quite unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Please sit down. Alright. That demonstrates some instability, as you’ve been experiencing. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical bilaterally. Finally, I will perform a quick Dix-Hallpike maneuver to check for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV. This may induce some brief dizziness, so please let me know if you feel uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A Dix-Hallpike maneuver… and it may induce dizziness? Yes, Doctor. That is alright. I… I understand that it is necessary to determine the cause of my symptoms. But please, do let me know if I should stop at any time. I… I am rather sensitive to dizziness, as you know. I trust your judgment. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. I've observed a nystagmus – involuntary eye movement – on the right side during the maneuver. This suggests a potential diagnosis of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV, in your right ear. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… Doctor… That was rather unsettling. I feel… a bit dizzy, and a bit nauseous. The room is still… spinning slightly. It’s not severe, but… it’s definitely there. It feels… similar to the sensations I’ve been experiencing, but perhaps… more intense. What does this… diagnosis mean, Doctor? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, it's good that you're aware of the sensations. The good news is BPPV isn't typically serious. It's a relatively common condition caused by small calcium crystals becoming dislodged in the inner ear. These crystals disrupt the signals sent to your brain about your head’s position, leading to brief episodes of dizziness when you change positions, like when you lie down or roll over in bed. The dizziness itself isn't dangerous, but it can be quite disruptive and increase your risk of falls. Fortunately, there’s a very effective treatment called the Epley maneuver, which helps reposition the crystals and relieve your symptoms. Would you like me to explain the maneuver, and then we can perform it here in the office?
PATIENT: The Epley maneuver… to reposition the crystals? That sounds… promising, Doctor. Very promising indeed. And it is performed in the office? That would be… most convenient. Yes, please. I would be very grateful if you could explain it to me, and then we can proceed. I… I am a bit apprehensive, of course, given my sensitivity to dizziness, but… I trust your expertise. Please, tell me everything you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. The Epley maneuver involves a series of specific head movements while lying down in a particular position. I’ll guide you through each step very carefully. It may induce some brief dizziness and nausea during the procedure, but it should be temporary. We’ll start with you lying on your back with your head turned 45 degrees towards your right side. Then, I’ll quickly rotate your head 90 degrees to the left, and then roll you quickly onto your left side while keeping your head in the same position. Finally, we’ll sit you upright. The goal is to allow the dislodged crystals to settle back into their correct location in your inner ear. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Lying on my back, head turned to the right… then quickly rotate to the left, and roll onto my left side… while keeping my head in the same position… It sounds… a bit complicated, to be honest. And the quick movements are… a little concerning, given my instability. But I understand the goal is to reposition the crystals. Yes, Doctor. I believe I understand. I trust your guidance, and I am willing to proceed, despite my apprehension. Please, take it slowly, and let me know if I need to stop at any time.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We will take it very slowly. I’ll explain each step before we do it, and I’ll stop immediately if you feel uncomfortable. First, let’s lie down on your back with your head turned 45 degrees to your right side. Perfect. Keep your eyes open, and focus on a fixed point on the ceiling. Now, let me know when you’re ready, and we’ll proceed to the next step.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I am lying on my back, head turned 45 degrees to the right. I am… ready when you are. But please, be gentle. And let me know what to expect before you proceed. I… I am a bit nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, you’re doing great. Now, I’m going to quickly rotate your head 90 degrees to the left, keeping your eyes open and focused on that point. This might cause some brief dizziness, but it should be temporary. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor… I… I am ready. But please, be quick. And… and let me know if I need to stop. I… I am a bit frightened, to be honest. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, Lilyanna. You're now on your left side. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… Doctor… That was… rather unsettling. I feel… incredibly dizzy. And nauseous. The room is spinning violently. I… I think I’m going to be sick. Please… please hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. Just breathe deeply. Let it pass. I’m right here. Alright. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… Doctor… that was… truly awful. I feel… incredibly weak and exhausted. And… still a bit dizzy, though not as violently as before. The nausea… has subsided, thankfully. I… I don’t think I’ve ever felt so unwell. Is… is it over? Did it work?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, you did amazing. That's a very normal reaction. Yes, the worst of it is over. Now, let's sit you up slowly. We've completed the Epley maneuver. The goal was to reposition the crystals in your inner ear, and it sounds like we were successful. We will need to wait a little while before we know for sure. For the next 24 hours, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Avoid bending over, lying flat, or turning your head quickly. Try to sleep with your head elevated on a couple of pillows. It's also important to stay well hydrated. I also recommend avoiding any strenuous activity. The dizziness may come and go for a short while, but it should gradually improve. We will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to assess your progress and make sure everything is resolving as expected. Do you have any questions about those instructions?
PATIENT: No bending, lying flat, or turning my head quickly… sleep with my head elevated… stay hydrated… avoid strenuous activity… No, I believe I understand. It sounds… rather restrictive, but I am willing to follow your instructions to the letter. Will the dizziness… return? And is there… anything else I should be aware of? I… I am a bit anxious about experiencing another episode as severe as that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a valid concern. The dizziness may come and go for the next few days, but it should be less severe and shorter in duration than what you just experienced. The goal of the maneuver was to resolve the issue, and the crystals should stay in the correct position, preventing a recurrence of the severe episode. However, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, hearing loss, double vision, or difficulty walking – please contact me immediately. Rarely, the maneuver may need to be repeated, but that is uncommon. We will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to assess your progress and make sure everything is resolving as expected. This will also give you the opportunity to ask any questions or concerns you may have. For now, just focus on resting and following the instructions I’ve given you. You’ve done a fantastic job today, and I’m confident you’ll be feeling much better soon. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No severe headache, hearing loss, double vision, or difficulty walking… I will keep a close watch for those symptoms. And I will follow your instructions to the letter. No, Doctor. I believe that is all. I am… incredibly grateful for your expertise and patience. This was… a rather unsettling experience, but I feel… much more reassured now. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to rest. Perhaps… you could help me to the door?
DOCTOR: Of course. Take your time. I’m right here. Please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And get some rest. You deserve it. It was my pleasure to help you, Lilyanna. I’m confident you’ll be feeling much better soon.
