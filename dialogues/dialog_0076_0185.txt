DOCTOR: Right, Zelina Ambris. Eighteen years old. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s… embarrassing. But it’s my breath. It smells. Really bad. And it’s not just sometimes, you know? It’s… consistently awful. I tried gum, obviously. Doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: Consistently awful, you say. Gum doesn't help. Well, these things happen. It’s probably just… hygiene. Though at your age… it’s unusual. How often are you brushing?
PATIENT: Look, are you implying I don't brush my teeth? Because that’s… rude. I brush twice a day, like a normal person. Maybe more if I’ve had, like, garlic or something. It’s not like I’m some… animal. It’s just… persistently bad, despite everything. It’s affecting things, alright? I don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get defensive. Just covering the basics. Twice a day... fine. And you floss?
PATIENT: Floss? Ugh. Honestly, not really. It’s… annoying. And it makes my gums bleed. Is that what we're doing here, grilling me about dental habits? I came here because I have a problem, not to be judged for not enjoying flossing. It’s not like it’s going to fix everything anyway.
DOCTOR: So, you brush, don’t floss… and the problem is… persistent. I see. Bleeding gums, you say. That is a little concerning. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or pain in your gums?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. They just… bleed when I try to floss. Which is why I don’t. And honestly? I don’t really think it’s my gums. It just smells bad. Like, really bad. It's not like there’s visible… anything. It’s just… a bad smell. Look, is there a quick fix for this or what? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: A quick fix. Right. Well, sometimes these things are more complicated than they appear. Do you have any issues with…postnasal drip?
PATIENT: Postnasal…what now? Look, I don’t get sick very often, if that’s what you mean. Just normal stuff, you know? A cold every couple of years. Nothing that would make my breath smell like… well, you know. Is that even a thing? I'm starting to think you don’t know what you’re talking about.
DOCTOR: Right, right. No frequent colds. Okay. And how about your diet?
PATIENT: What's my diet got to do with it? I eat normal food. I mean, I like sweets, okay? Doesn’t everyone? Is this a guilt trip about sugar now? Look, I'm a highway maintenance worker, not a nutritionist. I need a solution, not a lecture on healthy eating.
DOCTOR: Fine. Look, let's just do a quick examination. Open wide. Let's see what's going on in there. Don't expect miracles.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But don’t poke me too hard. And hurry up. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tongue appears coated. Some mild gingivitis. Nothing alarming, but… not ideal. No obvious cavities. Smell is… noticeable. Okay. We'll need to rule out some things. I'm going to order a basic metabolic panel, and a complete blood count. Also, a urine analysis.
PATIENT: Urine analysis? What for? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. Is this some kind of joke? I came in here for bad breath, not a full physical. Look, I don’t have insurance. Are these tests going to cost a fortune? Just tell me if there's a mouthwash that will fix it. I'm not paying for a bunch of unnecessary tests.
DOCTOR: Look, I am a doctor. I need to rule out systemic issues. Bad breath can be a symptom of many things. Diabetes, kidney problems, liver issues… I'm not just going to prescribe a mouthwash and send you on your way. As for the cost… I'm not a billing office. I can write you a referral to a dental specialist. They can do a more thorough cleaning and assess the situation. They'll be able to tell you about costs. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine! Whatever. A dental specialist. Just… give me the referral. And don't expect me to be happy about this. Just hurry up. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Here. Dr. Anya Petrova. She’s on Elm Street. It’s best to call and schedule an appointment. I’m documenting the referral and the reason for it. And honestly, floss more. It's really not that difficult. Anything else?
PATIENT: No! No, that’s it. Just… done. Thank you. Goodbye. .
