DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sayar. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter saying I'm able to fly. That's it, really. My insurance company, Medicare, needs it to approve a trip I’m planning. It’s… a bit complicated, but that’s the reason.
DOCTOR: A letter stating your fitness to fly, you say. While I understand Medicare has requested this documentation, simply providing a letter without understanding why such a request has been made feels… inadequate. Flying, as you may know, can present certain physiological challenges. Are you experiencing any medical conditions that prompted this specific inquiry from your insurer?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s so strange! I haven’t been to a doctor recently for anything serious. I just…booked the flight, and then Medicare sent the form. They didn't say why they needed it, just that I did. It feels like a standard thing, honestly. I was widowed a few years ago, and I’m trying to visit some family, and this is just… paperwork. I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Doesn’t feel sick” is not a diagnosis, Ms. Sayar. While I appreciate your attempt to simplify this, Medicare doesn’t typically request fitness-to-fly forms without a rationale. It’s…peculiar. Perhaps there was an error in processing, or a flagged code related to a previous claim?
PATIENT: I really don’t know. I haven’t looked closely at past claims, to be honest. I just handle the basic stuff. I let my daughter deal with most of the insurance things, she’s much better at it. She’s at work right now, so I can’t ask her. Is it possible to just… fill it out and say everything is fine? I mean, I don’t have any heart problems or anything. I walk every day.
DOCTOR: While your daily walks are commendable, Ms. Sayar, a medical evaluation is still prudent. It would be… irresponsible of me to simply sign a document without assessing your current health status. We need to rule out any underlying conditions that might be exacerbated by air travel. Let’s start with a basic review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – diabetes, hypertension, asthma, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I really have been pretty healthy, all my life. My family… we just have good genes, I guess. I did have the usual childhood things – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. And I had a normal pregnancy and delivery with my daughter. Honestly, I can't think of anything else. Is this going to be a long process? I just want to get the letter and go.
DOCTOR: “Pretty healthy” is still insufficient, Ms. Sayar. I understand your desire for expediency, however, a thorough assessment is vital. Let’s proceed with a review of systems. Have you experienced any recent changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, being a widow is tiring, just generally. But physically, I'm okay. I sleep pretty well, I eat… fairly healthy, and I get out and walk most days. Sometimes I feel a little…forgetful, but I always have. It’s not new. I remember everything from years ago perfectly, it's just… recent things sometimes slip my mind. Like where I put my keys! But nothing major.
DOCTOR: “Forgetful” can be a symptom of various conditions, Ms. Sayar. While you state it's longstanding, it warrants further investigation. Now, let's move on. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: No changes to my weight or appetite, Doctor. I’ve been steady around 130-135 pounds for years. And my bowel habits…are regular. Sorry to be so blunt. Everything is… normal, really. I'm starting to feel like this is a waste of time, if I'm honest. Is there a specific reason Medicare is asking for this? Can we just call them and find out? I really just need the letter.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, your frustration is understandable, but a dismissive attitude towards a potential medical concern is… unproductive. Medicare’s request, however arbitrary it may seem, necessitates a responsible evaluation. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations recently?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, and no palpitations. Nothing like that. I walk uphill regularly, and I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Look, I'm 33, I walk every day, and I've never had any serious health problems. Is it possible this is just a form they send to everyone who books a flight? Maybe it's a new regulation or something? I really don't understand why I’m being interrogated like this. Can we please just call Medicare? Maybe they can tell us why I need this letter, and then we can decide what to do. I just want to see my family. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sayar. I will attempt to contact Medicare directly. However, I must inform you that my time is valuable, and I cannot guarantee they will provide a satisfactory explanation. In the meantime, allow me to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It’s a standard procedure, and will provide a more objective assessment of your current health status. Please sit back and relax.
