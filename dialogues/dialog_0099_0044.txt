DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Sachar. Calin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Calin Sachar. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Overgaard, wasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Overgaard, yes. Ledarius Overgaard. Though, honestly, just Doctor Overgaard will do. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I received a letter about being checked for… home health, or hospice care? To be honest, I wasn’t quite sure what it was about when I got it, and I thought it best to come in and ask. It mentioned eligibility certification, but I’m not really clear on what that means either.
DOCTOR: Right. A letter… concerning home health or hospice. Honestly, the paperwork these days. It sounds like someone flagged you for potential services, perhaps based on some recent medical history. Eligibility certification just means determining if you qualify for those services – it’s not a judgement, just a process. Before we get into that, though, let’s talk about you. Are you currently experiencing any health issues?
PATIENT: Well, I do a lot of pressing, you know, with clothes? It's my work. And lately, my back’s been giving me trouble. Really aching, especially after a long day on my feet. And my hands… they get stiff sometimes, and it’s hard to grip things. It’s been getting worse over the last few months, I’d say. I haven’t really seen a doctor about it, though. Just been trying to push through.
DOCTOR: "Pushing through," right. That's what everyone says. And this back and hand pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Some days are better than others. But after a full day at work, it's definitely there. The back pain is more of a dull ache, and my hands feel… swollen, sometimes. And stiff, like I said. It makes it hard to do things around the house, even. Like opening jars, or buttoning shirts. It’s not debilitating, but it’s… annoying, to say the least.
DOCTOR: "Annoying." Understandable. Do you notice anything specific that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… definitely standing for long periods. And if I have to lift anything heavy. Even just carrying groceries can set it off. Also, cold weather makes it worse. My hands get really, really stiff when it’s cold. I try to wear gloves, but it doesn’t always help. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I'm not sure what kind of information you need.
DOCTOR: Relevant, yes. Everything is potentially relevant. Alright. And are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No numbness or tingling. Sometimes they just feel… weak, like I don't have a good grip. But no pins and needles, or anything like that. I was a little worried about that, to be honest, but thankfully, no. Is that a good thing? I'm sorry, I don't mean to ask so many questions. I just… I don’t really know what to expect from all of this.
DOCTOR: It’s… fine. Look, Ms. Sachar, you work a physically demanding job. These symptoms – the pain, the stiffness, the weakness – could be related to that. It’s likely musculoskeletal, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, let’s talk about your general health. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but I take medication for it. It seems to be under control, thankfully. Other than that… not really. I try to eat as healthy as I can, but it’s hard when you’re working long hours. And I haven’t been to the dentist in… longer than I’d like to admit. I really should get that sorted. Does the blood pressure medication matter in this situation? I just want to make sure I’m telling you everything that’s important.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, yes. That’s relevant. Medication… what are you taking, specifically?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s Lisinopril, I believe. 10 milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for about three years now. My doctor at the time—Dr. Ramnarine—said it was working well, and I haven’t had any problems with it. I get it refilled regularly. I haven’t seen Dr. Ramnarine in a while, though. I just keep getting the refills sent to the pharmacy. Is that… okay? I feel like I should have all of this written down somewhere.
DOCTOR: "Of course it's okay" Look, Ms. Sachar, it is very important that you maintain a consistent doctor-patient relationship. Relying on automated refills is… suboptimal. Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh! No allergies, thankfully. Not to medications, food, or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. I can eat whatever I want, and I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. It's one thing I don't have to worry about, at least. Does that help? I'm trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: It… does. Alright. Let's move on to your family history. Any significant medical problems run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes. And my father’s brother had heart problems, but he wasn’t very healthy, to be honest. He smoked a lot, and didn’t really take care of himself. Other than that… not really. My mother was healthy as a horse, and my other siblings are all doing well. I don’t know if any of that is relevant, though. It feels like I’m just listing things at this point.
DOCTOR: Alright. And socially… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I don't drink alcohol, either. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm not much of a partier, to be honest. I prefer a quiet night in with a good book. It's probably a boring answer, but that’s the truth. Is that helpful? I feel like I should be telling you something more important.
DOCTOR: It is… adequate. Finally, Ms. Sachar, do you currently work?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I told you, I work as a presser. For a dry cleaner’s downtown. It's… physical work, as I mentioned. Long hours on my feet, ironing and steaming clothes. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills. And I’m pretty good at it, if I do say so myself. It’s what I’ve been doing for years now. Does the type of work matter? Because it’s pretty demanding.
DOCTOR: "Of course it matters." Let's perform a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We will start with your back. Remove your shirt, and I will assess the range of motion and palpate for any tenderness.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. I wasn’t expecting… a physical examination so quickly. Alright. Just let me… excuse me for a moment. Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll lie down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie flat on your stomach. I need to assess your spinal alignment and feel for any muscle spasms. I’ll start with palpation along your lumbar spine. I note some tenderness to palpation at L4-L5. Range of motion is limited in flexion and extension. I also detect mild muscle spasm on the left paraspinal muscles. Now, I’ll assess your hands. Please extend your arms forward. Grip my hands tightly, then relax. Repeat several times. Grip strength is slightly diminished bilaterally, more pronounced on the left hand. I also note some swelling around the metacarpophalangeal joints. Wrist mobility is mildly restricted in both directions. Alright, Ms. Sachar. You may get dressed.
PATIENT: Alright. So… what does that mean? What did you find? It sounded like… not good. Is it something serious? I’m a little worried now, to be honest. Is it my back? Or my hands? Or both?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sachar, let’s not jump to conclusions. The physical exam reveals some findings consistent with musculoskeletal strain, likely exacerbated by your physically demanding work. The tenderness, limited range of motion, and muscle spasm in your back suggest a lumbar strain. The swelling and diminished grip strength in your hands point towards some degree of inflammation, possibly early signs of carpal tunnel syndrome, or tenosynovitis. We will need some imaging to confirm the extent of the strain and rule out other potential causes. I’m ordering lumbar spine X-rays and hand and wrist X-rays. Additionally, I will order blood work to assess for inflammatory markers and rule out rheumatoid arthritis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-rays… and blood work? That sounds… serious. Okay, I understand. So, it could be something like… carpal tunnel? And a bad back? Is that what you’re saying? And the blood work is just to rule things out? I just… I need to know what’s going on. Is it something I need to worry about? Will I need surgery? I've heard horror stories about carpal tunnel surgery.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sachar, let's not catastrophize. We haven’t even seen the results of the tests yet. It's possible it's a simple strain, and physical therapy will suffice. However, we need to rule out more serious conditions. The blood work is standard procedure to exclude inflammatory arthritis and other systemic causes. As for surgery, that is a last resort. We will explore conservative treatments first – physical therapy, ergonomic adjustments at work, possibly splinting for your hands. The X-rays will help us assess for any bony abnormalities or disc issues. I will have the radiology department schedule the imaging as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m prescribing a course of ibuprofen for pain and inflammation. Take two tablets every six hours as needed. Do you have any allergies to NSAIDs?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to ibuprofen, or any other NSAIDs that I know of. I've taken ibuprofen before for headaches, and it's always worked fine. Okay, so… ibuprofen, and wait for the X-rays. And then we’ll see what happens. It’s just… I can’t really afford to be out of work. I have bills to pay. I'm a little worried about how long this whole process is going to take. Is it going to be weeks? Months? And… what if it is surgery? What about the cost of that?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sachar, I understand your concerns. The timeline is difficult to predict without the test results. I can write a note for light duty restrictions at work while we await the imaging, to minimize strain on your back and hands. As for the cost of surgery, that’s something we can discuss further if it becomes necessary. We can explore options for financial assistance and payment plans. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Right now, we need to focus on getting a clear diagnosis. I will call in the prescription for the ibuprofen to your local pharmacy. Please follow the dosage instructions carefully. Finally, I’ll have my staff schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the X-ray results. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I guess… I’ll just try to take it easy, and wait for the results. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Don't hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen. .
