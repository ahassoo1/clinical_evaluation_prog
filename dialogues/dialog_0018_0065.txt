DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve gained weight, and I can’t seem to figure out why. It’s not like I’ve been eating differently, and I try to keep active, but… it just keeps going up. I was hoping you could help me understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s perfectly reasonable to seek medical advice when experiencing unexpected weight gain, and there’s absolutely no need to feel embarrassed. Many factors can contribute to weight fluctuations, and we'll work together to figure out what might be going on with you. To start, could you tell me a little more about how long you’ve noticed this weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was worried you’d think I was just… letting myself go. It's been… let me think… about six months, I'd say. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, and now… well, now my clothes definitely don’t fit like they used to. It's about ten pounds, perhaps a little more. I haven't actually weighed myself recently, if that makes sense. I don't really like doing that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s common to avoid the scale if it causes anxiety. Six months of gradual weight gain is certainly worth investigating. And ten pounds, even if it’s an estimate, is a good starting point. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe your typical diet for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Describing my diet… it’s not very exciting, I assure you. Mostly… traditional Lithuanian food, I suppose. Lots of potatoes, beets, some pork, and rye bread. I bake my own bread, usually. And I do enjoy a good soup! Not much fruit, I’m afraid, and not a lot of salad, either. My husband does the grocery shopping, and he likes to get what we’re used to. I do try to have some vegetables with dinner, but… it’s not always a large portion. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Selbitschka. Thank you for being so open. Traditional Lithuanian cuisine sounds lovely, and it’s helpful to have an understanding of your usual eating habits. Now, you mentioned you try to keep active. Could you tell me a little more about what that looks like?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I do a lot of walking. I walk to the market most days, which is… quite a distance, actually. Perhaps a mile each way. And I help my husband in the garden – weeding, mostly, and some planting. It's not strenuous, but it keeps me moving. And I do some housework, of course. Sweeping, dusting, laundry… you know, the usual things. I haven’t been doing formal exercise, if that’s what you mean. No gym or anything like that. I just try to stay busy.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Ms. Selbitschka. Walking a mile each way to the market daily is excellent, and gardening and housework contribute to a good level of activity. It sounds like you are generally quite active, which is positive. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve been… generally healthy, thankfully. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, but that’s it. I haven’t been to the doctor regularly, to be honest. We don't have much money for things like that, and… I always just figured I was fine. My husband's mother had some trouble with her heart, but that was when she was very old. I don't have any allergies, either. I can take most medications without any trouble, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s good to know you haven't had any significant medical issues in the past, and that you haven’t experienced any allergies. It’s also helpful to know about your husband’s mother’s history. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very lucky, really. Nothing like that. Just the usual… vaccinations when I was a child, I suppose. And I had my children naturally, if that’s what you mean. No complications with those, thankfully. I really haven’t spent much time in a doctor’s office, and I’m starting to feel a bit silly for taking up your time with this weight issue. It just… it worries me.
DOCTOR: You are not taking up my time at all, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s my job to listen to your concerns and help you feel your best, and worrying about unexplained weight gain is a perfectly valid reason to seek medical attention. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take an aspirin, but that’s it. And sometimes, in the winter, I take a vitamin D supplement, because the days are so short. But that's only when I remember, to be honest. Nothing else. I prefer to avoid medications if I can. My mother always said, “Let food be your medicine,” and I’ve always tried to live by that.
DOCTOR: That’s a lovely philosophy, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s good to know you only take aspirin occasionally and a vitamin D supplement. Before we proceed, could you tell me your height and weight, if you're comfortable sharing?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I’m not very tall. About five feet, perhaps a little less. Five feet two, maybe? And… I weigh a bit more than I used to. Around 170 pounds, I think. It’s hard to say exactly. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, like I said. I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that. I always thought I was a healthy weight, but… clearly, something has changed. I really don't like talking about numbers. It makes me feel… judged.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Selbitschka, and I assure you I am not here to judge. Knowing your approximate height and weight simply helps me get a better understanding of your overall health picture. Five feet two and 170 pounds gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history a little more specifically. Besides your husband's mother's heart condition, are there any other health problems that run in your family, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or obesity?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… My father had some trouble with his blood pressure when he got older, I think. And my aunt, on my mother's side, she had diabetes. She wasn't very careful with her diet, I'm afraid. And… well, both my grandparents were… large people. Not necessarily unhealthy, but… they weren't small. I always worried I’d end up like them. My husband’s family is mostly healthy, as far as I know. He doesn’t talk about it much. I think they prefer to avoid those conversations. Does that help? I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Selbitschka. Knowing about your father’s blood pressure and your aunt’s diabetes, as well as your grandparents’ size, provides valuable information. It sounds like there may be a genetic predisposition to weight gain and related health issues in your family. Now, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle a little more. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother always said smoking was terrible for you, and I listened. My husband smokes sometimes, when he’s stressed, but he does it outside and away from me. He knows I don’t approve. He’s trying to quit, but it’s difficult. He’s been doing it for so long. I’ve never even been tempted to try it. I think it smells awful. Does that answer your question? I try to live a healthy life, even if I’m struggling with my weight right now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that answers my question perfectly, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s good to hear that you don't smoke and that your husband is trying to quit. Finally, let's talk about stress. Have you been experiencing any significant stress lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A bit. My daughter is going away to university in the fall, and I'm… well, I'm worried about her. She’s always been a bit fragile, and I’m afraid she won’t take care of herself. And my husband’s business hasn’t been doing very well, so he’s been very stressed, too. We’re trying to support each other, but… it’s difficult. And the world just feels… uncertain, you know? Everything is so expensive, and there’s so much bad news. It’s hard to relax. I find myself worrying about everything, all the time. I try to keep busy to distract myself, but it doesn’t always work. Does that make sense? I'm probably just being an old worrywart.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Selbitschka. It's completely understandable to feel stressed given the circumstances – your daughter going away to university, your husband's business challenges, and the general uncertainty in the world. It sounds like you're carrying a significant emotional load. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your thyroid. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I suppose I should have come sooner, if I’m being honest. I just… I don't like bothering people with my problems. But if you think it's necessary, please go ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. It’s just… I always feel a bit foolish in a doctor’s office. Is there a paper gown I need to put on? I’m not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Selbitschka. There’s absolutely no need to feel foolish. Many patients feel the same way. And yes, there is a paper gown in the changing room just over there. Please feel free to take your time getting changed, and let me know when you’re ready. I will step out of the room to give you some privacy.
