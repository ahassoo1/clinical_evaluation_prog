DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I… I’ve been having trouble with my speech, I think. It feels slurred sometimes, and it’s worrying me a little. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Trouble with your speech…slurred sometimes.” And you said you don’t recall exactly when this started?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. It’s like… a fog, you know? Things aren’t very clear. I just noticed it recently, but it could have been happening for a while. I really can’t say for sure. My husband mentioned it a few times, now that I think about it, but I didn't pay much attention then.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, your husband has noticed it as well. Has it been getting worse, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Hmm… consistent, I think. Or maybe… sometimes it’s worse after I’ve been working. I’m a Construction Manager, so I do a lot of talking and… well, running around, really. But other times it seems alright. It’s hard to tell. I don't keep track of these things. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be potentially exacerbated by activity. Do you notice any difficulty understanding what people say to you, or is it mostly when you are speaking?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I think mostly when I’m speaking. People seem to understand me, or they just politely pretend to, maybe? I haven't noticed any trouble understanding them, no. But it’s possible, I suppose. I wouldn’t be able to say for certain. I haven't really been paying close attention to that, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this – any weakness, numbness, headaches, vision changes, dizziness, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Weakness… no, not really. Numbness, no. Headaches… I get headaches sometimes, but everyone does, don't they? Vision… I wear glasses, so things are always a little blurry, but not worse than usual. And dizziness… I wouldn’t say so, no. Difficulty swallowing… no, I don’t think so. I eat everything my husband cooks! Is that… enough? It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, I have Medicare, so I must have something, right? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really keep track of these things. My husband usually handles all of that. I know I go to the doctor for check-ups, but… I couldn’t tell you what for, specifically. I apologize. It’s not that I don’t care, it’s just… things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem at all. We can try to figure it out. Do you know if you’ve ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. And… Oh! When I broke my arm, a long time ago. That required a cast, I remember. Hospitalized… yes, I think so, when I had the surgery for my tonsils. But other than that, I can’t recall anything specific. My husband would know for sure. He has a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she’s getting on in years, and she’s had some trouble with her joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe? And my father… he passed away a few years ago. He had… high blood pressure, I believe. And heart trouble, possibly. But honestly, Doctor, I wasn't very close to my father, and my husband handles all the family medical history stuff too. I’m terribly sorry, I feel like I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We’ll try to get as much information as we can. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill, every morning. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you know? Just the regular kind. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I don’t take it every day. Honestly, I’m not very good with remembering these things. My husband usually fills the pill organizer for me. I do apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll get to the bottom of things. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a brief neurological exam to assess your speech and coordination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. Please, go ahead. I’ll just sit here and try not to fidget.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are normal, and strength is good in all limbs. Coordination seems okay, but I did note a slight slurring of your speech when you say the phrase “red car”. And some mild difficulty with rapid alternating movements – saying “pat-a-cake” quickly several times. I'm noting all of this for the record.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? I didn’t realize I was slurring when I say “red car”. I just… talk. Is that something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? My husband will be very concerned if I tell him I’ve been slurring. He worries about everything.
DOCTOR: It's good that we're looking into it. The slurring and difficulty with rapid movements could indicate a few different things. It’s not necessarily cause for immediate panic, but we need to investigate further to understand what’s going on. It could be related to a neurological issue, but it could also be something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I'm going to recommend an MRI of your brain to get a better look at the neurological structures. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. I’ve never had an MRI before, so I haven’t been exposed to any dye. But I am slightly allergic to penicillin, if that matters. I get a bit of a rash, but nothing serious. Is that something I should be concerned about with the dye? And… an MRI sounds a little frightening, Doctor. Will it hurt? My husband always says I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the penicillin allergy. It doesn't directly contraindicate the MRI contrast, but we'll make sure to inform the radiology department. The MRI itself doesn’t hurt, it’s a bit noisy and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-40 minutes. They’ll give you earplugs. The contrast dye is usually given intravenously, and some people experience a brief, mild sensation of warmth or flushing. We’ll monitor you closely during and after the procedure. In the meantime, let’s review your current medications. You mentioned a pill for your blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Do you know the dosage of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I really wish I knew these things! It’s a small, white pill… I think it’s 10 milligrams? Or maybe 20? I honestly couldn't say for certain. My husband orders the refills and fills the pill organizer, so I just take what he gives me. He has a very good memory for these sorts of things. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. I’m feeling a bit flustered now. Is it alright if I just let my husband handle all of this? He can explain everything much better than I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. It's alright. I understand it can be overwhelming. It would be helpful if your husband could come in with you for a follow-up appointment, or at least provide a list of your medications and dosages. For now, let's get the orders in for the blood work and the MRI. I will also write you a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. They are the specialists in this area, and they can help determine the cause of your speech difficulties. Here’s a script for the MRI and the bloodwork, and a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist. Please schedule the tests as soon as possible. I also want you to keep a log of any changes in your symptoms - when they occur, what makes them worse or better. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I think… I think that’s all for now. I’ll definitely have my husband schedule everything. And I’ll try my best to keep a log, although I can’t promise I’ll remember everything. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or… anything I should be worried about in the meantime? I don’t want to alarm my husband unnecessarily. He gets so anxious.
