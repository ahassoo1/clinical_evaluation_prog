DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my joints, you see. They’re just… stiff. Especially in the mornings. It's a bit of a bother, really. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints, particularly in the mornings. I understand. It can be quite bothersome. You mentioned you don’t recall exactly when it started, that's alright. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Can you tell me where exactly are you feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not just one place, you know? My hands, mostly. When I’m trying to make breakfast, it’s hard to grip things. And… my knees, I think. Getting out of bed is a little… oof. And maybe my hips? It's hard to say for sure. Everything feels a bit… achy, all over, really. I don’t know which is which sometimes. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. That’s very helpful information, actually. It sounds like it’s affecting multiple joints, which is important to note. “Achy all over” is a good way to describe it. Now, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give your pain on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a number? I’m not good with numbers. Let me think… Hmm… On a bad day… maybe a 6? But some days it’s… less. Like a 4, maybe. It goes up and down, you see? It’s not always bad. But when it's bad, it really slows me down. I don't like to complain, though.
DOCTOR: A 6 on a bad day, and a 4 on a better day. That gives me a good starting point. It’s perfectly alright not to be precise; we’re just trying to get a sense of the severity. You mentioned it slows you down. Can you tell me a little more about how it affects your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I like to garden, you see? But bending down is getting harder. And lifting the pots… forget about it! My hands just… won't cooperate. And I like to play with the grandkids sometimes, but I can't always keep up. I don't want to bother them, so I mostly just watch. It’s… frustrating, I guess. It's not the same. I used to be able to do so much more.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's impacting activities you truly enjoy, and that's definitely frustrating. It's good that you’re still finding ways to be involved, but it's also important to address the limitations. Now, Lilliana, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the joint pain and stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh… other symptoms? Hmm… let me think… Sometimes I feel a bit tired, I suppose. But I’m getting older, so maybe that’s just… old age? I don't know. I haven't really noticed anything else… except… sometimes my hands feel a little… swollen? But not always. It comes and goes, like everything else. I really can’t remember much detail, I’m afraid. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and occasional swelling in the hands. It’s alright that the details are a bit fuzzy; we’ll work through this together. Swelling is something to note. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history? I… I don't really remember. My husband… he always took care of all that. I was never very good with those things. I think the doctor told me I had a little bit of high blood pressure, a long time ago. But I was on some pills for it, and then… I don't know. I haven't seen a doctor regularly in… well, a long time. And I'm a widow now, so there's no one to remind me of things. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t apologize. It’s perfectly understandable. We’ll do our best to piece things together. High blood pressure in the past is good to know. Do you recall what medication you were taking for that, or how long you were on it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medication… No, I really don't. It was a little white pill, I think? Or maybe it was pink? I honestly can't remember. It was a long time ago. My husband used to fill the prescription. He always knew everything. I just… took the pill. I don't recall the name at all, I'm so sorry. It was years and years ago. I just remember he told me it was to keep my blood pressure down.
DOCTOR: Alright, a small white or pink pill for blood pressure, years ago. It's alright, we can try to access old records if possible. Now, Lilliana, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... surgeries? Let me think... Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. That was… in the 80s, I think? Maybe the early 90s? It was a pretty standard thing back then, my doctor said. I don’t think I was in the hospital for very long. And… that’s it, I think. Nothing else that I can remember. I was always pretty healthy, for the most part. Until… well, until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the 80s or early 90s. Good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – your parents, siblings, or children – have arthritis, autoimmune diseases, or other joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history? Let me think… My mother… she had some trouble with her hands when she got older, I think. They were always a bit stiff. But she just said it was “old age,” you know? She didn't go to the doctor much. And my father… he was pretty healthy, for the most part. No, I don’t think anyone else in my family had any… joint problems, not that I can recall. It’s been a long time, you see. I’m not very good at remembering these things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some stiffness in her hands. That’s helpful to know. Don't worry about remembering everything; we’ll do our best with what we have. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I never smoked. My husband… he used to smoke a little, when he was younger. But I always told him it was bad for his health, and he eventually quit. But me? No, never touched a cigarette in my life. I always liked fresh air, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. My husband and I… we used to enjoy a glass with our meal. But not every night. And not a lot. I don’t really drink much anymore, to be honest. It doesn't really appeal to me much these days. I prefer tea, you see. A nice cup of chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine. And finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies? Let me think... Oh! Yes, I think I'm a little allergic to penicillin. I got a rash once, a long time ago. My doctor told me to avoid it. Other than that... no, I don't think so. I've never really had any serious allergies. I eat just about anything, you see. I’m not a picky eater. But definitely penicillin. I remember that. It was quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy. Very important to know. Alright, Lilliana, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, please? My joints are a bit… sensitive, you see. I don't want to cause any more trouble.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s just check your range of motion in your hands and wrists. Could you open and close your hands for me a few times?
PATIENT: There… it’s a bit stiff, you see? Especially when I first wake up. It gets a little easier after a while, but it's never really completely comfortable. It feels… achy, like there's a little bit of grit in there. Oh dear… is that normal?
DOCTOR: I see. Yes, that stiffness and aching are consistent with what you’ve described. I notice some mild swelling in the knuckles of both hands, as well. And a slight limitation in your range of motion. Now, let's check your wrists. Could you bend them up and down, and side to side for me?
PATIENT: Oof… that’s a little… uncomfortable. It feels tight, you see? And it pops a little when I bend it. I don't know if that’s good or bad. It's never really felt this bad before. Oh dear… I'm sorry if I'm complaining. I don't mean to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, please don't apologize at all. You're not bothering me at all. I'm noting some tenderness on the radial side of both wrists, as well. Now, let's move on to your knees. Could you please sit back and extend your legs out in front of you?
PATIENT: There… that’s alright, for now. But if I bend them too much, it gets a little… achy. And I can feel a little bit of a click when I move them. Oh dear… is that something to worry about? I hope it's not anything serious. I need my knees to walk, you see.
DOCTOR: I'm noting some mild crepitus—that’s the clicking sound you’re feeling—in both knees. And a slight limitation in your range of motion, particularly when bending. There’s also some mild tenderness along the joint line. Now, let's just check your hips. Could you lie down on your back for me?
PATIENT: There… that’s alright. But bending my legs up to my chest is a little… difficult. It feels tight in my hips, you see? And it doesn't really go very far. Oh dear… I hope it’s not arthritis. My mother used to have terrible arthritis in her hips.
DOCTOR: I'm noting some mild limitations in hip flexion and rotation on both sides. And some tenderness with palpation. Alright, Lilliana, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I suspect you may be experiencing osteoarthritis, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood tests and an X-ray of your hands, knees, and hips to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? Like my mother? Oh dear… That doesn’t sound very good. Blood tests and an X-ray? Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I hope it's not too expensive. I'm not really… well, I don't have a lot of money, you see. I'm a widow now, and… it’s just me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilliana. The blood tests will only involve a small sample of blood taken from your arm, and shouldn't be painful – just a quick pinch. The X-rays are also painless; you'll simply lie still while the machine takes pictures. Regarding the cost, I'll have the billing department check if there are any financial assistance programs available. We'll do our best to keep the costs as low as possible. We can also discuss the results and treatment options thoroughly before making any decisions. I'm also going to order a CRP and ESR to help rule out other causes of your joint pain. It will help us better understand what is going on. It will likely take a few days to get the results back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds alright, Doctor. A few days… that’s not too bad. And you’ll check about the money? That would be wonderful. I really appreciate that. I just want to know what’s going on, you see? And I want to be able to… well, I want to be able to play with my grandkids again. That’s all. So, yes… let's do the tests. And I'll wait for your call. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I understand how important it is to be able to enjoy time with your grandchildren, and we'll do everything we can to help you get back to doing the things you love. I’ll have the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they’ll schedule your blood tests and X-rays. In the meantime, I recommend trying to stay as active as possible, within your comfort level. Gentle exercise, like walking or swimming, can help keep your joints mobile. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're experiencing a lot of pain. But please, check with me or a pharmacist before starting any new medications. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… ibuprofen? I think I’ve taken that before. Yes, that’s alright. I’ll try to walk a little more, and I’ll try to keep moving. Gentle exercise… that sounds good. No… I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. I’ll wait for your call. And I’ll try not to worry too much.
