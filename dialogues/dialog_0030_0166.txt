DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. I see here you're with us today. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Yes, I’m here because I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg. It’s been… persistent, I suppose would be the right word.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent numbness in your leg. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began, if I recall correctly, approximately three weeks ago. It’s primarily in my left leg, starting just above the knee and extending down to my foot. It isn’t constant, you see. It comes and goes, and the sensation… well, it feels like pins and needles, but also a sort of… dull ache when it's more pronounced. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Pins and needles and a dull ache. And is it just the left leg, or are you experiencing any similar sensations elsewhere?
PATIENT: No, it’s solely the left leg. I’ve been quite mindful of it, trying to determine if it’s radiating anywhere else, and thankfully, it hasn’t. It’s rather… localized, I suppose. I haven't noticed it in my right leg, or anywhere else for that matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, localized to the left leg, starting just above the knee and extending to your foot. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I've been attempting to correlate it with activity, but I haven't found a definitive pattern. Prolonged standing seems to aggravate it somewhat, but I also experience it after periods of rest. I work as a special effects artist, and sometimes I'm on my feet for hours, other times I'm seated at a computer. As for making it worse… nothing immediately springs to mind. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to occur regardless of activity level, though prolonged standing might be a factor. And it’s been going on for three weeks now. Have you noticed any weakness in your left leg, or any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve been actively testing my strength, doing squats and walking, and everything feels normal in that regard. My balance hasn't been affected either. I’m quite meticulous about noticing such things, given the nature of my work – needing steady hands and precise movements, you see. So, I'm reasonably confident there’s been no change to my strength or coordination.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you experienced any pain in your back or neck at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t experienced any pain in my back or neck. I occasionally have a bit of stiffness from sitting for long periods while working, but that’s quite common, and it doesn't feel related to the numbness in my leg. It’s more of a muscle ache, if anything, and easily relieved with stretching. No sharp pain or anything of that nature.
DOCTOR: Okay, no back or neck pain. Let’s move on to some other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Quicksey, I haven’t. Everything has been… regular, for lack of a better term. No changes to either my bowel or bladder function at all. I apologize if that's… a rather personal question. I understand it’s important to gather all relevant information, of course.
DOCTOR: Not at all, it’s a very important question. Thank you for being open. Now, have you had any recent injuries, even minor ones, to your left leg or back?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any recent injuries to either my leg or my back. I'm generally quite careful, and I haven't had any falls or bumps that I can recall. I’ve been thinking back, trying to identify a potential incident, but nothing comes to mind. I did help a friend move some furniture about a month ago, but it was nothing overly strenuous, and I didn't experience any pain or discomfort at the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent injuries. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any known medical conditions. I’ve always been reasonably healthy, if I may say so myself. I eat a fairly balanced diet, I exercise regularly when my work schedule allows, and I’ve never been diagnosed with anything significant. No diabetes, arthritis, or any other chronic illnesses. I have private insurance, so I do receive regular checkups, and everything has always been within normal limits.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Nothing at all. I've been fortunate in that regard. I did have my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was a relatively minor procedure and I recovered without any complications. Other than that, no surgeries of any kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother's side has a history of… hypertension, I believe it’s called. High blood pressure. My father's side… there was a great-uncle who had something involving his joints, but I don’t recall the specifics. It wasn’t arthritis, I don’t believe. Beyond that, not really any major hereditary medical concerns that I’m aware of. I’m Yupik, and historically, we've faced more challenges with access to healthcare than specific genetic predispositions, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m not currently taking any medications of any kind. Neither prescription nor over-the-counter. I rarely get sick, thankfully, and I prefer to manage any minor discomfort with rest and hydration. I don't take any supplements either. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle through diet and exercise, and I avoid relying on medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Quicksey, I don’t have any known allergies. I haven’t experienced any allergic reactions to food, medication, or anything else, as far as I’m aware. No pollen sensitivities, no reactions to insect bites… nothing at all. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything of that nature.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Thank you for providing all of that information, Tarin. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to assess your leg and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I'm quite accustomed to being meticulously examined, given the nature of my work. Steady hands are a requirement, you see, so regular check-ups are standard practice for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. I'm going to start by checking your reflexes in both legs. Then, I’ll assess your muscle strength and sensation. Please let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. Okay, your reflexes are… symmetrical and within normal limits. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'm squeezing as hard as I comfortably can. Please let me know if you need me to adjust my grip. I try to maintain a consistent pressure throughout.
DOCTOR: Good. Your grip strength appears normal on both sides. Now, I'm going to test your leg strength. Can you lift your left leg while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: I am lifting my left leg, Doctor. I'm trying to maintain a consistent position. Please let me know if you would like me to hold it for a specific duration or adjust the angle. I’m capable of lifting it higher, if required.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you point your toes on your left foot?
PATIENT: I am pointing my toes, Doctor. I'm holding it as steadily as I can. Please let me know if you need me to adjust the position.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to use this cotton swab to gently test the sensation in your left leg. Please tell me when you can feel it. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that now. Right… about there. It feels like a light touch, but it’s definitely discernible. It feels a bit diminished compared to my right leg, if I’m being honest. But I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It does seem like there's some diminished sensation in your left leg compared to your right. Now, is there any specific area where you feel the numbness the most acutely?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The most pronounced numbness is along the top of my foot, right between my big toe and my second toe. That’s where I feel the most… tingling and lack of sensation. It extends slightly towards the outside of my foot as well, but it’s most concentrated in that area. It’s not a sharp pain, but it's consistently… absent, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Okay, Tarin, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, potentially affecting the superficial peroneal nerve. However, to rule out other possible causes, such as a more localized nerve compression or other underlying conditions, I'd like to order some further testing. Would you be amenable to a nerve conduction study and electromyography ?
PATIENT: Nerve conduction study and electromyography… Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. I understand the importance of gathering more comprehensive data to ensure an accurate diagnosis. I’m amenable to whatever testing you deem necessary. I work with detailed measurements and diagnostics regularly, so I’m not unfamiliar with such procedures. Is there anything specific I should prepare for beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good to hear. No specific preparation is needed for the NCS/EMG, but it’s possible the testing site may require you to avoid lotions or oils on your legs the day before. I’ll have the receptionist schedule you for an appointment with the neurology department. They will provide you with specific instructions. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding prolonged standing or activities that aggravate your symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, may help manage any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful to know. I will be sure to avoid lotions and oils, and I will contact the neurology department regarding scheduling. And yes, I do have a question. If it is peripheral neuropathy, is that something that can be… managed, or is it a progressive condition? And are there any lifestyle adjustments, beyond avoiding aggravating activities, that might be beneficial? I understand you haven’t seen the full results yet, so a general overview would be sufficient.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Peripheral neuropathy can have many causes, and the management depends on the underlying cause. Sometimes, identifying and treating the root cause—such as diabetes or vitamin deficiencies—can resolve the symptoms. In other cases, it’s managed with medications to relieve pain and improve nerve function. Lifestyle adjustments can definitely be beneficial. Maintaining a healthy weight, controlling blood sugar if you have diabetes, and avoiding alcohol and tobacco are all important. Regular exercise, especially low-impact activities like walking or swimming, can improve circulation and nerve health. In some cases, physical therapy can help improve strength and balance. We’ll have a clearer picture once we have the results of the NCS/EMG. We can then discuss a personalized treatment plan based on your specific needs. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Quicksey, I believe that answers my questions thoroughly. Thank you for your time and your clear explanations. I appreciate your thoroughness and willingness to address my concerns. I will schedule the NCS/EMG as soon as possible and look forward to hearing from the neurology department.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results. .
