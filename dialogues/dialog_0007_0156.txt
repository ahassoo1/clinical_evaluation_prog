DOCTOR: Hi Jase, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Hernandez, nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's my stomach, I think. It's been... not good, lately. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while, and honestly, I can't really remember when it started exactly. It just… is. I think it's something to do with my insides, because, you know, I've had problems with that before.
DOCTOR: Okay, “not good” and a lot of diarrhea… and you're not sure exactly when it started, but it's been going on for a while. You mentioned problems with your insides before – can you tell me a little more about those previous issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… it was a few years back, I think. Doctors said something about… IBD? Or maybe celiac? Something like that. They did a lot of tests, and I was on some medicine for a while, but then I felt better, so I stopped taking it. Honestly, I don’t really remember the details. It was a long time ago, and I was dealing with a lot then. It was just… a lot of tests and feeling sick, and then I felt okay, so I just… moved on. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. A lot can happen, and it's common to focus on feeling better and put things in the past. So, IBD or celiac was a possibility a few years ago. Okay. And this current bout of diarrhea… is it happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It’s not always happening, but it’s… frequent. Like, most days I have to go more than once. Some days are worse than others, definitely. And it’s… well, it’s pretty watery, if you don’t mind me saying. It just… keeps happening, and it's tiring, honestly. I just want it to stop. I don’t really remember anything specific triggering it, either. Just… started.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s perfectly alright to be specific – it’s important information. Frequent, watery diarrhea coming and going, happening most days. And no clear trigger that you can recall. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Um… blood, no, I don’t think so. I haven’t really… looked, to be honest. Sorry. It’s just… not something I usually do. Fever… maybe a little bit sometimes? Like, I feel warm, but I don’t check my temperature or anything. And no, no vomiting. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, but it doesn’t usually get bad enough to… you know. Just a bit queasy. Does that make sense? I'm really not good at remembering details, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, don't apologize. It's helpful to know what you do notice. No blood in the stool, possible low-grade fever, and occasional nausea. Okay. Let's talk about your diet for a moment. Have you noticed any specific foods that seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s a good question. I honestly eat pretty much everything. I haven't really paid attention to if certain foods bother me. My husband cooks, mostly, and I just eat what he makes. He likes spicy food, so I eat a lot of that… I don’t know if that's relevant? I haven't noticed anything specific making it worse, but then again, I’m not really looking, you know? I just eat. It's probably not helpful, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No, it's okay, you're not being unhelpful at all. Spicy food is good to know – it can definitely irritate the digestive system. Alright. Before we do a quick physical exam, let me ask about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day. And… oh! I occasionally take something for headaches, like ibuprofen, but only when I really need it. Other than that… nothing, I think. I mean, I used to take medicine for my stomach, but that was years ago. I stopped when the doctor said I was okay. I don't really take anything regularly, honestly. I think that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin occasionally and ibuprofen for headaches when needed. Good. Now, I’d like to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Sounds good. Please go ahead. I'm a bit nervous, but… I just want to figure out what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now. Let me know if anything feels painful. …Alright, there’s some mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Your bowel sounds are a little hyperactive, which isn't surprising with the diarrhea. I also want to check your vital signs – just your temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. Okay, your temperature is slightly elevated at 99.8°F, blood pressure is 120/80, and pulse is 88. I'm going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Okay. 99.8… is that bad? I just feel… tired, mostly. And a bit uncomfortable, obviously. I'm glad you're checking everything. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: 99.8°F is a slightly elevated temperature, but it’s not drastically high, and could be from the inflammation in your gut. It's good we have a baseline. Given your history of possible IBD or celiac, your current symptoms, and the findings from the exam, I think we need to do some further testing. I'd like to order a stool sample analysis to check for infection and inflammation, and some blood work to rule out celiac disease and check for anemia. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Anything to figure out what's going on. A stool sample… and blood work. Okay. I can do that. Will the blood work be a lot? I’m not a big fan of needles… but I’ll do it if I have to.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be nervous about needles, many people are. The blood work will be a standard panel - we'll just need a few vials. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, and some specific markers for inflammation and celiac disease. It shouldn’t be too bad. I’ll also give you instructions for collecting the stool sample. It’s a bit unpleasant, but important for a proper diagnosis. Do you have any questions about the tests or the process?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Blood work… a few vials. And a stool sample. Not fun, but I'll do it. Will I need to come back to the clinic for the blood work, or… And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I'm hoping it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: You'll need to come back to the clinic for the blood work – we have a phlebotomist here who will draw the samples. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning if that works for you. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to process everything and send the report to me. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the next steps. I understand you're worried about it being something serious, and it's good to be proactive. We're just gathering information at this point. While we wait for the results, I recommend staying hydrated with electrolyte-rich drinks, and eating bland foods like rice, bananas, and toast. Avoid anything spicy or greasy, which can worsen your symptoms. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Tomorrow morning for the blood work. And stay hydrated, bland foods. I can do that. Rice, bananas, toast… no spicy food. Okay. Thank you, Dr. Hernandez. I feel a little better just knowing what's going on, and what to expect.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. The lab technician will give you detailed instructions for the stool sample, and the front desk can schedule your blood work for tomorrow. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever over 101°F, or blood in your stool before your appointment, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you tomorrow morning, and we’ll take it from there. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Hernandez. You've been very helpful. I'll see you tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're very welcome, Jase. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. I’ll see you tomorrow.
