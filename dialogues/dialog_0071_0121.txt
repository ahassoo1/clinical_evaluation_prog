DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it.
DOCTOR: Hmm, dry eyes. Alright. And how long has this been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Time… time gets away from ya. Maybe… a month? Two? Hard to say for sure. It's not sudden, ya know? Just got worse little by little. I work outside a lot. Concrete work. Dust and all. Could be that.
DOCTOR: Right, concrete work… dust is definitely a factor. Okay. And besides the dryness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… well, sometimes they feel gritty. Like somethin' is in 'em, even when there ain't. And kinda blurry, not all the time. More when I haven't blinked in a bit, I guess. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Gritty and blurry… yes, that's quite common with dry eyes. It’s the cornea getting irritated. Alright. Have you tried anything to help with it so far?
PATIENT: Nah. Never really bothered with nothin'. Just… tried to blink more. Didn't really do much good. Never had trouble with my eyes before. Always just… been okay. What kinda stuff is there to do about it? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're coming in now. It’s rarely serious serious, but it can be very uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can lead to a bit of irritation or even small abrasions. We have a few options. Over-the-counter artificial tears are a good starting point. There are also eye ointments for nighttime use, which provide longer-lasting relief. Let’s do a quick exam, just to see what's going on, alright?
PATIENT: Exam, huh? Okay. Sounds good. I ain't afraid of a little look-see. Just… don't poke 'em too hard, alright? They're kinda sensitive right now. Where do I sit?
DOCTOR: Right this way. And I promise, I'll be gentle. We'll just use a light and a couple of instruments to take a look. Please sit and rest your chin here on the support. Now, just look straight ahead for me. I’m going to start with the light, then I’ll take a closer look at your eyelids and the surface of your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just let me know if it’s gonna be bright, ya? My old eyes ain't what they used to be. And… what exactly are ya lookin’ for? Is somethin’ broken?
DOCTOR: No, nothing broken. I'm checking the surface of your cornea—that's the clear front part of your eye—for any scratches or inflammation. I'm also looking at your tear production, and the oil glands in your eyelids. Hmm… your tear film does seem a bit thin, and your oil glands appear slightly blocked. That could be contributing to the dryness. Now, let me take a closer look at the surface of your eyes with a magnifying instrument. It will be very close, but shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Just focus on a point straight ahead.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Focusin’. Oil glands, huh? Never knew I had oil glands in my eyelids. Everything's gettin' old, I guess. Even my eyelids. Is blockin' 'em… fixable? Can ya unblock 'em? And… how long's this gonna take? I got some concrete to pour this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's quite common for those glands to become blocked, especially with age and exposure to the elements. And yes, we can often help unblock them. Warm compresses and gentle eyelid massage are a good starting point, and there are also procedures we can do in the office if that isn't enough. Okay, all done. It doesn't look like there’s anything serious going on—no abrasions or infections. It appears to be mostly dry eye due to reduced tear production and blocked oil glands. It's fairly common with your work and age, unfortunately. Now, let's talk about some ways to manage this.
PATIENT: Manage it, huh? Okay. Sounds… good. Better than nothin'. What kinda stuff are we talkin'? Pills? Eye drops? I don't like puttin' stuff in my eyes if I can help it. And… how much is all this gonna cost me? I ain't insured, ya know.
DOCTOR: No pills, thankfully. We'll start with artificial tears—over-the-counter drops—to lubricate your eyes throughout the day. There are different brands, some thicker than others. We can try a few to see what works best for you. As for the cost, the artificial tears are relatively inexpensive, usually under $20 a bottle. The warm compresses and eyelid massage are free! If those aren't enough, there are some in-office procedures to help clear the oil glands, but those would be a bit more expensive. We can discuss those options if the drops and compresses aren’t providing enough relief. We’ll start with the simplest, least expensive options first. I'll also give you a handout with instructions on proper eyelid hygiene. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… reasonable. Drops and warm cloths. I can handle that. Handout's good too. I ain't so good rememberin' stuff these days. So… just put drops in my eyes when they feel dry, and rub my eyelids with a warm cloth? How often? And… which drops should I get? There's a whole wall of 'em at the store.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Drops when they feel dry—don't be afraid to use them frequently, especially when you're working outside. And yes, that wall of drops can be overwhelming! I recommend starting with Systane Ultra. It's a good all-around option. Look for the ones in the dark blue bottle. As for the warm compresses, apply them to your closed eyelids for 5-10 minutes, twice a day. Gentle massage—very gentle—after the compress can help stimulate the oil glands. I'll write all of this down for you. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Systane Ultra… twice a day… gentle massage… alright. Sounds… doable. Hmm. Yeah, I got one. What if I forget? I forget a lot, Doc. What if I forget to do all this stuff?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Pipolo. It happens to all of us! Try to tie it to something you already do regularly. For example, apply the warm compresses and drops while you’re having your morning coffee, or before you start your work day. Set a reminder on your phone, maybe?
PATIENT: Phone reminder… yeah, maybe. My grandson set one up for me once, told me when to take my pills. Alright. Systane Ultra, warm cloths, gentle rubbin', and a phone reminder. Think I can manage that. I guess… that’s all? No other magic cures?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, no magic cures, Mr. Pipolo. But consistent care—the drops, the compresses, keeping hydrated—will make a big difference. I want you to come back in a month if you aren't seeing any improvement, or if your symptoms worsen. We can then discuss other options, like a prescription medication or in-office procedures. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that's it. You been real helpful, Doc. Systane Ultra… I gotta remember that. Alright then. Thanks again. I'll see ya in a month… hopefully with better eyes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your follow-up. Have a good day, and try not to let the dust get to you!
