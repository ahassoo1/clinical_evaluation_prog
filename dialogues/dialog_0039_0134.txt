DOCTOR: Hello Raymonde, welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Oh, goodness… where to start? It’s been… well, I just haven’t been feeling right for a bit now. Mostly, I get sick to my stomach a lot. And I don’t… I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's just not like me at all. I used to have a good appetite, especially after working with the animals all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling unwell and changes in appetite can be quite concerning. It is good you came in to get it checked out. “Sick to your stomach” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a sharp pain, Doctor, not really. More like… a queasy feeling. It comes and goes, but it's been happening more often lately. Sometimes it’s right after I eat, even if it’s just a little something. And sometimes it just… happens. I haven't thrown up, thankfully, but I feel like I might a lot of the time. It’s just… unsettling. And makes me not want to eat, you know? Which is… strange for me. I’ve always loved food.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds quite unpleasant. So, more of a nausea, a queasy feeling, coming and going, sometimes related to eating, sometimes not. And it’s impacting your appetite. Okay. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… honestly, Doctor, not that I can recall. I’ve tried to think about it. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. I help my grandson with the garden, so lots of fresh vegetables… and I still make my grandmother’s stew sometimes, though not as often as I used to. It doesn't seem to matter what I eat, really. It just… happens. It's all very confusing. Maybe it's just old age catching up with me?
DOCTOR: It's good you're trying to recall. And no, Raymonde, it’s rarely just “old age.” We want to figure out what’s going on. You mentioned you help your grandson with the garden. Are you having any other symptoms alongside this nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I am seventy-six, so… that could be anything, right? And… I don’t know if this means anything, but my stomach feels… full really quickly. Even if I only eat a small portion. Like, after just a few bites. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable and makes me stop eating. I haven't noticed anything else, not that I can remember. My memory isn't what it used to be. I apologize if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Raymonde. That’s all very helpful information. Fatigue and feeling full quickly – those are definitely things we need to explore. And it’s perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That's a tricky one. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, you see. I used to, but… well, things slip your mind. I suppose my clothes feel a little looser than they did, but I just figured that was… well, the same thing as before. I haven’t been eating much, so I wouldn't be surprised if I’ve lost a little. It hasn't been a conscious effort, you understand. Just… not hungry. I'm sorry I can’t be more precise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Raymonde. We can get a weight here today, and that will give us a good baseline. Now, do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing… no, not really. That hasn't been an issue. Everything goes down alright. It's not like it hurts to swallow, or feels stuck or anything. It’s just… after a few bites, my stomach feels so full I don't want to swallow anymore. It’s not the swallowing itself, more the feeling afterwards. Do you understand what I mean, Doctor? I’m afraid I’m not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly well, Raymonde. It sounds like the issue isn’t with the swallowing itself, but with a feeling of fullness quickly after starting to eat. Okay. Now, thinking about your medical history… do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question… well, I was diagnosed with… let me see… cancer a few years back. Breast cancer, I believe. I had surgery and… treatments. They said it was… contained. I’ve been in remission for a while now, thankfully. I see Doctor Abernathy for check-ups every six months or so. Besides that… I have a little arthritis in my hands, but nothing too serious. And my blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but I take a pill for that. Is that enough information, Doctor? I forget the names of the medications sometimes. It’s awful getting old!
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Raymonde. Thank you for letting me know. History of breast cancer in remission, arthritis, and high blood pressure. We’ll make sure to check with Dr. Abernathy as well. Do you remember what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It's a little white pill… I think it starts with an “A”? No, maybe a “L”? I really can’t remember the name, Doctor. I have a pill organizer, but my grandson usually fills it for me. He’s a good boy. I can ask him when I get home. Would that be alright? I apologize for being so… forgetful. It’s just the way my brain is these days. It’s like trying to hold water in a sieve.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. Don’t worry about it at all. We can get the list from your grandson, or from the pharmacy if necessary. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a little girl, but that didn’t seem to bother me much. Just a little swelling, that’s all. I don't take many medications, so I haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anything! Honestly, I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing! Is there anything else I should be telling you, Doctor? I'm worried I'm forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing great, Raymonde. It sounds like no known allergies, which is good. Now, just one last few questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and she wouldn't allow it in the house. And frankly, the smell always made me cough. I’ve always preferred being outdoors, breathing fresh air. I used to go hiking a lot when I was younger, with my husband. Goodness, that feels like a lifetime ago. Would you like me to tell you about my husband, Doctor? He was a wonderful man. But I’m rambling again, aren’t I? Sorry…
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Raymonde. It’s perfectly alright. We can talk about your husband another time, if you’d like. No smoking, that's excellent. And finally, do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit now and then, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. I used to enjoy a little sherry with my husband, but… it’s not something I do much anymore. I don’t really have much of a taste for it these days. Just a little sip now and then, if someone offers. It's not like I sit and drink every night, you understand. Just a social thing, really. I don't really enjoy it as much anymore. Is that alright, Doctor? I feel like I'm being a bother with all my rambling.
