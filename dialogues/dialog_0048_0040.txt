DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Espinueva, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Clearance Espinueva. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Sink, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sink. Dr. Sink. Though I prefer to just get straight to the point, if you don’t mind. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side, lower down. And… well, I seem to get water infections quite a bit. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s starting to worry me a bit. The doctor back home – Fiji, that is – he said something about my kidneys, but… I didn’t quite understand everything.
DOCTOR: Right. “Kidneys.” Vague, as usual. Okay, so this pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Some days it’s barely there, just a dull ache. Other days… other days it really hurts, you know? Especially if I drink a lot of water. Which is… a bit of a problem, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And you said frequent water infections?
PATIENT: Yes, quite frequent. At least, what the doctors tell me are water infections. I get a burning feeling when I go to the toilet, and it’s uncomfortable, of course. I’ve had a few over the last six months, I think. Maybe four or five? It’s hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Four or five in six months… that is rather frequent. Do you have any fever, chills, or nausea along with these infections?
PATIENT: No, not usually. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, a bit weak, but that could be anything, really. No fever that I've noticed, and definitely no chills. And no… being sick, if that's what you mean by nausea. Just the burning, and the pain in my side.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Sometimes it's a bit cloudy, I think. And occasionally… there's a little bit of blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. That’s why I keep going to the doctor, really. It worries me, the blood.
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine, blood… typical. Have you had any issues with… constipation or diarrhea lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, now you mention it… I’ve been a bit… irregular, shall we say? Mostly constipated, to be honest. It’s not a comfortable topic, but yes, going to the toilet hasn’t been easy lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick examination. Just a simple abdominal check. Lie back on the examination table for me, please.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m not very good with all this medical stuff, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, then I’ll palpate it—feel around. It may be slightly uncomfortable. Try to relax. Normal bowel sounds, somewhat… sluggish. Tenderness in the left flank. No rebound tenderness. Okay. And can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the usual for my age, Doctor. A little something for my blood pressure, but nothing else. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it. The blood pressure one... it's called Amlodipine, I think. A small white pill. I take one every morning. Oh, and sometimes I take something for pain when my side really hurts, but it’s just over-the-counter, you know, like Paracetamol.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine… paracetamol… typical self-medication. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Although… my skin can get a bit itchy sometimes, but I don’t think that’s an allergy. Just dry skin, probably. I'm not very good at remembering these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history of frequent infections, flank pain, and some blood in your urine, I suspect you may have a recurring urinary tract infection, potentially complicated by a kidney issue. We need to rule out a kidney stone or other structural abnormality. I’m going to order a urinalysis, a complete blood count, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… serious. What does that involve, Doctor? And what are you hoping to find? Is it something very bad? I… I'm a bit confused, if you don't mind me saying. And what about this water infection, will the scan show that too?
DOCTOR: A CT scan is an imaging test. It uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your organs. It is more detailed than a simple X-ray, and that's why it's necessary. We need to see what’s going on inside. The water infection, it’s likely we'll see evidence of inflammation on the scan, but it won't specifically show the infection itself. It’s to rule out anything more serious. It is standard procedure. I'll refer you to radiology. They will explain the process in detail. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, it flares up sometimes. And my eyesight isn't very good, I wear glasses, as you can see. And… oh! I had my gallbladder removed years ago, back in Fiji. That was a long time ago though, I don’t think it’s relevant now. Does that help? I'm trying to remember everything. I don’t want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, poor eyesight, cholecystectomy years ago… noted. Alright. I'm going to give you a prescription for a course of antibiotics to start immediately, to address the possible water infection. And I’m sending the referrals for the imaging and bloodwork now. Follow up with me in one week with the results. If you develop a fever, chills, or worsening pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Antibiotics… and the scan. And come back in a week. And if I feel very sick, go to the hospital. That’s… a lot to take in. Will the scan be painful? And… what if they find something bad?
DOCTOR: The scan itself is not painful. You’ll be lying still for a short period. As for “finding something bad,” that’s why we’re doing the scan, to know what we’re dealing with. Worrying won’t help. Follow the instructions you'll receive from radiology. My nurse will give you the antibiotic prescription and the referral information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I do hope it's nothing too serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Right. Next. .
