DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it's… this trouble I’ve been having. With… going to the bathroom. It keeps happening again and again. It’s very… bothersome. I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. It feels like a long time now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some issues with your bladder control, and it's been going on for a while. That is bothersome, and I appreciate you coming in to discuss it. When you say “trouble,” could you tell me a little more specifically what that means?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specifics… yes. It feels like… a burning. When I go. And… the urge. I have to go very often. More than… usual, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. It just… feels uncomfortable. And sometimes, a little pain, lower down. But not always. Is that… helpful? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, Claudene, thank you. It sounds like you're experiencing burning with urination, increased frequency – needing to go more often – and sometimes some lower abdominal discomfort. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and you’re not taking up any of my time at all. Now, when you say “often”, about how many times a day would you say you're going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It feels like… every couple of hours, maybe? Perhaps more when I drink something. I do like my tea, you see. But even when I don't… it’s just… frequent. I don't keep track, I’m afraid. It’s just… a nuisance. Is there a… a normal number? I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Claudene. Most people urinate about 6-8 times in a 24-hour period. It sounds like you may be going more frequently than that. And drinking tea can certainly contribute to increased urination. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, dear. I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen. It’s been a while since I… really looked, if you understand. Sometimes it’s just… cloudy, perhaps? But no, I don’t recall seeing any blood. I would have remembered that, wouldn’t I? It’s just… difficult to say. I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Cloudy urine can sometimes indicate an infection, so that’s something we'll want to investigate. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t believe so. Not recently. And chills… no. Back pain… well, I have a little bit of ache sometimes, but that’s just my age, I think. Old bones, you know? It’s not… sharp or anything. Just a dull ache. It doesn’t really bother me. Is this… important? I’m sorry, I’m just not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining everything just fine, Claudene. It's helpful for me to get a complete picture, and that's exactly what you're doing. The back pain is good to know, as it can sometimes be related to kidney issues, but if it's just a dull ache related to age, that's reassuring. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… that was a long time ago. I had… something with my blood pressure, I think. Years ago. The doctor put me on pills, but I stopped taking them after a while. I didn’t like feeling… sluggish. And… I had a problem with my… gallbladder, I think it was. They took it out. But that was ages and ages ago. Kidney problems… no, I don't think so. Not that I recall. I had a lot of trouble with… my marriage, but that wasn't a medical condition! Sorry. I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Claudene. It's good you mentioned the high blood pressure, even though you stopped taking the medication. And the gallbladder removal is important to know as well. We'll make a note of both of those. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take… this one for my arthritis. Just when it flares up. And… sometimes a little something for my sleep. When I can’t get to sleep, you see. But that’s only now and then. And… that’s it, I think. I used to take something for heartburn, but I stopped. It didn’t seem to do much good. Is that… helpful? I don't take a lot of pills, thankfully. I try to stay natural.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Claudene. Okay, I see you're taking something for arthritis and occasionally something for sleep. It's good you're trying to stay natural. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don't think so. I’ve never really had any trouble with allergies. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle when the pollen is bad in the spring, but nothing serious. I can eat anything, thankfully. I like my food too much to have allergies! Is that… all the questions? I’m getting a little tired.
DOCTOR: Almost, Claudene. Just a few more, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Now, I'm going to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! I’ve never smoked in my life. My husband used to, but I made him stop. It’s a dreadful habit. I wouldn’t dream of it. It’s bad for your health, you know. Is that… alright? I hope I’m not upsetting you with my answers. I just want to be honest.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Claudene! That's perfectly alright, and I appreciate your honesty. It's good you never smoked. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But not much. Just a small glass. Now… not so much. I don’t really care for it anymore. It doesn’t agree with my stomach. Perhaps a sip at Christmas, but that’s about it. Nothing regular, I assure you. Is that… satisfactory? I’m not a big drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly satisfactory, Claudene. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, last question before we move on to a quick exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your living situation?
PATIENT: Living situation… well, I live alone. Have for… quite a while now. My husband passed away, you see. I have a small house, just me and the cat. I manage alright. I keep busy. Gardening, mostly. And… watching television. It’s quiet, but… I’m used to it. Is that… what you wanted to know? It’s a bit lonely sometimes, but I get by.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Claudene. It takes courage to live alone, and it sounds like you’re doing a wonderful job of managing. Okay, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just listen to your abdomen, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological check. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam… Well, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but… if it will help. Just be gentle, please. And… don’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon. Is there anything I need to do? Should I… lie down?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. We’ll take it slow and gentle, and I’ll explain everything as I go. You don’t need to lie down just yet. We'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. It sounds a bit… full. Not alarming, but we'll keep that in mind. Blood pressure is 142/88, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Any pain when I do that?
PATIENT: Oh! A little. Just… a little tenderness. There. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been there for a while now, actually. I just thought it was… old age. Is that… bad? I really don’t want to be ill. I don’t have time for illness.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There’s some mild tenderness there, as you said. It doesn’t seem to be anything acute, but it's good we've noted it. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This won't be uncomfortable at all. Reflexes are normal. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing a urinary tract infection, or a bladder irritation causing frequent urination and discomfort. The mild tenderness in your abdomen could be related. However, the elevated blood pressure and persistent abdominal discomfort warrant further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for infection, and a complete blood count to rule out other possibilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urine analysis… and a blood count? Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? I don’t like the sound of it at all. Will it hurt? I really don’t want to be poked and prodded. And… how long will it take? I have an appointment, you see. Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps some tea? Would that help? I really just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Claudene. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously bad, it’s just a precaution to help us figure out what’s going on. The urine analysis is a simple test – you’ll just need to provide a sample in a cup. It’s painless. The blood count involves a small needle prick in your arm, and it’s usually very quick. It might sting for a moment, but it’s over quickly. The results will help us determine if you have an infection, and if there’s anything else going on that needs attention. As for the tea, while it's comforting, it can actually worsen the frequent urination. I recommend holding off on that for now. I'll have the nurse come in and collect a urine sample from you first, and then we'll take some blood. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes in total. Do you feel comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please, be gentle. And… don’t take too long. I really don’t want to be here all day. And… will I get the results right away? I need to know what’s going on. And… will it cost a lot of money? I don’t have a lot of extra money, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. We’ll take it as quickly and gently as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the urine sample, and then we’ll do the blood draw. The lab results usually take about 15-20 minutes to come back, so we should have them before you leave. I’ll explain everything to you as soon as they’re available. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern. We have a payment plan available if needed, and we'll do our best to work with you. Let's focus on getting the results first, and then we can discuss the financial aspect. In the meantime, I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Let me just call the nurse now. She’ll be right with you.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate your kindness. I just want to go home. And… feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Claudene. We'll get you on your way as soon as we can. Just try to relax, and the nurse will be with you in just a moment. She’s very gentle and experienced. You’re in good hands.
