DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. TKAC, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. My name is Lennie TKAC. I am here today to get a checkup, you see. I am hoping to move into a senior living facility soon, and they require a doctor’s approval first. I want to be certain I am fit enough for the transition.
DOCTOR: A sensible precaution, Mr. TKAC. Senior living facilities do want to be sure their residents are comfortable and safe. A checkup is perfectly reasonable. So, let's start with a little bit of history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. I saw Doctor Reynolds back in Rapid City for many years. He retired last year, and I haven’t found a new physician since then. I’ve been mostly healthy, thankfully, so I didn’t rush to find a replacement. But this senior living place… they are quite thorough.
DOCTOR: “Mostly healthy” is good to hear, but even those who are generally well need periodic assessments. Doctor Reynolds, alright. Do you happen to recall any specific conditions he treated you for, even if it was years ago?
PATIENT: Let me see… Doctor Reynolds… he treated me for high blood pressure, maybe fifteen years ago? We managed it with diet and exercise, thankfully, no medication required. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious enough to keep me from my baking, mind you. I still make a mean loaf of bread.
DOCTOR: Arthritis is hardly "just old age," Mr. TKAC, though I appreciate your…optimism. It can certainly affect quality of life. We’ll need to assess that. And good for you maintaining your activity despite it. Now, regarding that blood pressure – have you had it checked recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not had it checked since Doctor Reynolds retired. It was stable for so long, I just… didn’t prioritize it. I understand it's important, and I apologize for not being more diligent. Perhaps you could check it today? I'd feel better knowing where things stand.
DOCTOR: Yes, we certainly will. It's always best to know. It's a simple procedure, really. Let's start with that, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. Have you had any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: No changes to my medications, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly at all. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache, if needed, but that’s all. I pride myself on staying healthy without relying on too many pills. Is a physical exam just checking my… heart and lungs and such? I hope it won't be too strenuous.
DOCTOR: “Too strenuous”?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, at my age, things don't move quite as smoothly as they once did. I still enjoy a good walk, mind you, but a vigorous examination… I just hope it won't be too demanding. It’s not that I am frail, it’s simply… a matter of respecting my limitations.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. TKAC, it’s a standard assessment, not an obstacle course. We'll proceed at a comfortable pace. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your abdomen. We’ll also take a look at your knees, given your arthritis. Before we begin, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Never had one in my life. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. You may proceed with your examination at your convenience. I trust your judgment. Just… perhaps a gentle touch with the knees?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin. Please lie back on the examination table. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Blood pressure is 148/85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: That is quite alright, Doctor. The abdomen feels fine. No tenderness at all. It may feel a bit firm, if you press hard enough, but that's likely just from a hearty breakfast. I do enjoy my oatmeal.
DOCTOR: No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Tenderness is minimal. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Please bend them for me, as comfortably as you can. There is some crepitus upon flexion and extension. Mild swelling present bilaterally. Range of motion is limited, approximately 90 degrees flexion in both knees. Tenderness to palpation along the medial joint lines. Do you experience any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there is some discomfort when you press there. Not sharp pain, mind you, just a dull ache. It’s been gradually worsening over the past few years, but it hasn’t stopped me from baking. I simply try to take it easy and listen to my body. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: It’s… not unexpected, given your age and activity level. It appears to be osteoarthritis. We can manage the symptoms with physical therapy and possibly some over-the-counter pain relievers. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Do you have any trouble with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: No trouble with balance or coordination, Doctor. I still walk a mile most days, weather permitting. I may be a bit slower than I used to be, and my memory isn’t what it once was, but my legs are still quite steady. I haven’t fallen in years, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, Mr. TKAC, that concludes the physical exam. Given your history and the examination findings, I recommend a baseline set of blood work to assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and complete blood count. We should also check your Vitamin D levels. It’s important to rule out any underlying issues. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work is a good idea. I trust your judgment. As for questions… well, yes, I do. If I am cleared for the senior living facility, what sort of activities do you think I would be able to participate in, given my arthritis? And… is there anything I should be doing now to prepare?
DOCTOR: Well, given the mild to moderate arthritis in your knees, I wouldn't recommend any high-impact activities. Walking is excellent, as you’ve already established. Swimming or water aerobics would be beneficial, as it’s low-impact. Chair yoga could also improve your flexibility and range of motion. As for preparation… continue with your current level of activity, but be mindful of your pain levels. If you experience significant discomfort, rest. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage the pain. I’ll order the blood work now. The results should be available in a few days. Once I have those, we can discuss a more comprehensive plan. In the meantime, I’ll need a detailed list of all your medications, even the occasional aspirin, and any allergies you may have, despite your claim of having none. It's standard procedure. Do you have any family members who assist with your medical care?
PATIENT: That all sounds quite reasonable, Doctor. I will certainly keep that in mind. Chair yoga… that sounds manageable. I’ll avoid any strenuous activities. Regarding medications… I truly do not take anything regularly. Perhaps a few aspirin every few months for a headache, but nothing consistent. And I assure you, I have never had an allergy in my life. It’s a family trait, I suppose. As for family, I have a niece, Sarah, who lives in Billings. She calls occasionally to check on me, but she is quite busy with her own family. She doesn’t actively assist with my medical care, if that’s what you mean. I’ve always been rather independent.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll make a note of that. While you claim no allergies, it’s standard procedure to document a thorough allergy history. I'll simply note "No Known Allergies Reported". I’ll send the blood work order to the lab. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, we can discuss your eligibility for the senior living facility and a plan to manage your arthritis. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I appreciate your thorough examination and your clear explanations. You have put my mind at ease. I will await the results of the blood work and schedule an appointment accordingly. Thank you for your time and consideration.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Mr. TKAC. I’ll have the nurse provide you with the lab order and any necessary paperwork. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. .
