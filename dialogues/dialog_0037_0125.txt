DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. AX. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, it's... it's a bit awkward, honestly. I requested a test for, uh, HIV. Just want to get it checked, you know? Better safe than sorry, and my wife… well, she wants me to. It's probably nothing, but she worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan, thank you for sharing that with me. It's very responsible of you to get tested, and it’s completely understandable that you and your wife want peace of mind. There's absolutely no shame in getting tested, and it's a smart thing to do for your health and your relationship. Just to confirm, you're requesting an HIV test today?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Look, I understand why people get tested, alright? It's just… it feels silly, if that makes sense. I haven’t… well, I haven’t done anything to worry about. But she’s been on my case about it, and honestly, I just want to prove to her it’s a waste of time. A complete waste. So, yeah. The test. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand how you feel, Mr. Belan. It’s not unusual to feel anxious or even embarrassed about getting tested, even if you don't believe you’re at risk. It's good you're doing this for your wife, and also for your own health. To help me understand your situation a little better – and this information is completely confidential – can you tell me a bit about your recent sexual history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Seriously? You have to ask that? Look, I’m a married man. What do you think? It’s… it’s my wife. Always. For the last eight years. And before that, nothing. Absolutely nothing. It’s really quite simple. I don't go around… you know. It's not necessary to delve into this. I just want the test, doctor. Can we just get to the test?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Belan, and I apologize if the question felt intrusive. It's important for me to gather a complete history to ensure I'm providing the best possible care, and to understand any potential risk factors, even if they seem unlikely. However, if you truly prefer not to discuss your sexual history in detail, that is your right. We can proceed with the test request. Before we do, I want to briefly explain the testing process and what a positive result would mean. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it. Quickly, if you please. I’ve got things to do, you know? And frankly, I already know what a positive result means. It means I’d have to explain to my wife that her constant worrying was…well, never mind. Just… explain the test. What’s involved? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan. We can absolutely proceed quickly. The test itself is a simple blood draw. It involves a small needle stick – just like any other blood test. We’ll take a small sample of your blood and send it to the lab for analysis. There are a few different types of HIV tests. We’ll do a fourth-generation test, which looks for both the virus itself and antibodies your body makes to fight the virus. This type of test is very accurate. Results usually take between 1-3 business days to come back. If it’s positive, we’ll discuss the next steps, which would involve confirming the result with a follow-up test and then discussing treatment options. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Treatment options? Look, I told you, it's not going to be positive. It's a waste of everyone's time, honestly. But alright, alright. So, a blood draw, one to three days… and then you tell me if my wife was right. Is there any cost involved? I’ve got Medicare, obviously. And where exactly do you draw the blood? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan, I understand your anxieties. It’s good you have Medicare, which will generally cover the cost of the test. There might be a small co-pay depending on your specific plan, but our billing department can verify that for you after the test. We draw the blood right here in the clinic, in the lab room just down the hall. Our phlebotomist, Maria, is very experienced and gentle. She's excellent at making people comfortable. We use small needles and take every precaution to minimize discomfort. Do you want to sit down while we do the draw?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. Sit down. The sooner this is over, the better. And please tell Maria to be quick. Really quick. I don't have all day. And honestly, if she makes a mess… I don't know what I’ll do. I faint easily, you know. Just a warning. Don't want to cause a scene.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan, I've noted that you dislike needles and are prone to fainting. We will definitely take extra care to make you comfortable and minimize any stress. I’ll let Maria know to be as quick and gentle as possible. Please have a seat right here, and I’ll go get her. We’ll take your blood pressure and pulse before we start, just to make sure everything’s stable. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. Just... proceed. Honestly, the waiting is worse than the actual needle. Get Maria in here already. And tell her to talk me through it, alright? I need to know exactly what she's doing every step of the way. Keeps me… calmer. A bit. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. But my wife…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan, I understand. I’ll let Maria know to explain everything thoroughly as she goes. Maria, could you come in here for a blood draw?
