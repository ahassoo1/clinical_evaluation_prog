DOCTOR: Alright, Noelani Stepno, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it's a bit awkward to talk about, Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Yes, Pehrson. It’s… pain. Down there. In… well, you know. The… testicles. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, but it’s gotten… more noticeable lately. I’m not quite sure why it’s happening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. “Down there.” Testicular pain. Look, let’s not beat around the bush. Pain is pain. How long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a little while… that’s… difficult to say. Weeks, I think? Maybe a month or so? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s barely there, just a dull ache. Other days… it’s sharper. I really haven’t been keeping track, I’m afraid. I just… hoped it would go away on its own. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Silly is…not a medical term. Comes and goes, huh?
PATIENT: No, not silly, I understand. It just feels… embarrassing to talk about, you know? And I don't usually bother doctors with… things like this. It comes in waves, yes. Like a… a tightening, and then a sort of ache. It’s not constant, thankfully. But when it is there, it’s… distracting. Does that make sense? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Distracting. Okay. Any injury?
PATIENT: Injury? No, not that I recall. Nothing I can think of, anyway. I work with wood, you see. Sometimes I… bump things, but nothing serious. Never directly to… there. I’m quite careful, usually. I mean, I have to be, with the tools and all. But no, no specific injury that I can remember. Perhaps a small knock a while back, but it didn’t seem important at the time. I truly don’t know.
DOCTOR: Woodworking. Right. Any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… let me think. No fever, no. And I don't believe I've had any chills. Nausea… sometimes I feel a little queasy, but that's usually just from… well, from being tired. And no, I haven't vomited. No, none of those things. I’m quite sure. It’s mostly just the pain. And the… discomfort. I hope that helps. I’m sorry I’m not very precise.
DOCTOR: Discomfort. Alright. Any changes in urination?
PATIENT: Changes in… urination? Oh… hmm. Let me see… I suppose I have been going to the bathroom a bit more often, maybe? Not a lot more, just… noticeable. And sometimes it feels like… I don’t finish emptying my bladder completely. But I thought that was just… getting older, you know? Is that… related? I really don’t know what’s normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Normal is relative. More frequent urination, incomplete emptying… and the pain. Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I have felt a little more… tired lately. But again, I’ve been working quite a bit, so that could just be exhaustion. And… perhaps a little achy, all over. But nothing specific. Oh! And… sometimes, when I’m sitting for a long time, I feel a… heaviness. A sort of dragging sensation. But it goes away when I stand up and move around. I am probably just listing everything now, aren’t I? I apologize. It’s just… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Heaviness. Right. Okay. Let's do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I… I suppose I should go to the bathroom first, just in case? I just went, but… it’s always better to be safe, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Just lie down on the exam table. We’ll get this over with. I have other patients, you know.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. I understand. Other patients. Here goes… I hope it won’t be too… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Just relax. I’m going to palpate your abdomen and then examine the… area of discomfort. It shouldn’t be too bad. Tell me if anything is particularly tender. Alright… everything seems… normal. No obvious masses or tenderness, but there's slight swelling on the left side. And you do seem a bit… tense. Do you have any history of hernias?
PATIENT: Hernias? Oh goodness… no, I don’t think so. My father had something with his back, a slipped disc maybe, but I don’t think… no. Never been told I had a hernia. I’ve always been quite active, lifting wood and all, but never any pain in my… groin area. Is that what you’re asking about? Is swelling… bad? I apologize, I truly don’t understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Slight swelling isn't necessarily bad, but it does need to be monitored. Given your symptoms – the pain, the increased urination, the heaviness – and the swelling, I’m leaning towards possible epididymitis. It’s an inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle. Could be bacterial. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count. Also, I want you to have a scrotal ultrasound just to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Oh… inflammation? Bacterial? An ultrasound? That sounds… complicated. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I need… medicine? Will I be alright? I just want to get back to my woodworking, you know? I have commissions to finish… and I really don't want anything to… interfere. .
