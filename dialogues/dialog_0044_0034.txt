DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you too. I... just moved here? With my husband. I think that's why I'm here. For, like, a check-up since I'm new and all? I got, uh, Medicare, if that matters. I don’t really remember what they told me to do when I signed up.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. Establishing care with a new primary care physician is exactly the right thing to do when you move, and Medicare is absolutely fine—we’ll get everything sorted. It’s good you’re proactive about this. So, a general check-up is great. Just to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health... hmm. I work with machines, a lot. Like, fixing them. Mechanical stuff. It's... okay? I mean, sometimes my back hurts from bending over, but that's just work, I think. I don't really... get sick often? Not that I remember, anyway. I'm married, if that helps? Does that count as health?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you don't get sick often. And yes, your social situation absolutely counts as part of your overall health – support systems are very important! Working with machines and the physical aspect of that work is good information, especially the back pain. Just to clarify, is this a recent pain, or something you’ve dealt with for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, um... a while, I think? It comes and goes. Like, some days it's fine, and other days I really feel it when I stand up. It's not, like, bad bad, just... annoying? I don't really do anything about it, just try not to bend too much. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Emileigh. Intermittent back pain is very common, and it’s good you’ve been trying to manage it. We should definitely take a closer look. Aside from the back pain, are you experiencing any other aches or pains anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really? Sometimes my hands get a little sore from using tools, but that goes away pretty quick. I don’t think that’s anything. Oh! And sometimes I feel kinda tired, but I work long hours, so that makes sense too, right? It's probably just from being tired.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, working long hours can definitely cause fatigue. Okay, so fatigue and occasional hand soreness, along with the intermittent back pain. Let’s talk a bit more generally. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite… not really. I eat when I'm hungry, I guess? My husband does most of the cooking. And weight… I don't really keep track. I think I'm about the same? I haven't bought any new clothes recently, if that helps. I'm… I'm not good with remembering numbers.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. You don't need to be good with numbers, I can help with that. We can get some basic measurements done shortly. No need to worry about that now. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. I don't remember anyone ever telling me I had anything. I’ve never really been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups when I was a kid, I think. And… my husband said something about me needing a tetanus shot, but I haven't gotten that yet. Does that count as a condition?
DOCTOR: No, a tetanus shot doesn't count as a condition, that's preventative care! That's good your husband reminded you. Okay, so no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, definitely not. And… I don't think I've ever been in the hospital. Not that I remember. I think I had the chickenpox when I was little, but that wasn’t the hospital, just… sick at home. Is that okay to say?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfectly fine to say. Having chickenpox as a child is good to know. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, a little bit about your family… Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any major health problems, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh… that's… a hard question. My mom… she passed away a long time ago. I don't really remember what she died from. And I don't really talk to my dad anymore. He… he wasn't around much when I was growing up. I don’t know anything about his health, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. You shouldn’t feel sorry at all. It's very common for people to not have that information. We can move on if that’s uncomfortable. We'll work with what you do know. How about medications?
PATIENT: Um… just a little painkiller sometimes, for my back. Like, ibuprofen? When it's really bad. But not very often. That's it, I think. I don't take any other pills or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain. And no allergies to any medications or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Not that I know of, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything. I like flowers, if that counts for anything?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know! No known allergies. Okay, Emileigh, we’ve covered a lot. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline understanding of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That's… that's good. I guess. What will you do?
DOCTOR: Just some basic things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your back to assess the pain. It shouldn’t take long, and it’s not usually uncomfortable. I’ll explain everything as I go along, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… I think so. If you tell me what you’re doing. That sounds… okay. My back does feel kinda stiff today, actually.
DOCTOR: Perfect. We'll start with your heart and lungs. If you just take a few deep breaths for me... Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 122/78, which is within the normal range. Now, I’m going to gently feel around your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, about your back... Can you point to where you're feeling the stiffness?
PATIENT: It's kinda all over here, but mostly on the sides. And it feels worse when I bend over. It's not like, sharp pain, just… tight.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling some muscle tightness in your lower back, bilaterally. There's no tenderness to palpation, but it’s definitely tight. Range of motion is slightly limited, and as you mentioned, there's some discomfort with flexion. Now, let’s check your reflexes quickly. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Okay, and finally, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Alright, Emileigh, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, aside from the muscle tightness in your lower back. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing muscle strain, likely related to your work.
PATIENT: Muscle strain? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, muscle strain isn't usually bad, it's very common. It means the muscles in your back have been overstretched or overworked. It's like when you exercise and feel sore the next day, but in this case, it's from your job. Usually it gets better with rest and some simple treatments. To help with that, I'm going to recommend a few things. First, I’d like you to try over-the-counter ibuprofen, as you've already been doing, for the pain. I also recommend gentle stretching exercises, focusing on your back and core muscles. I can provide you with a handout detailing some safe exercises. Finally, applying heat or ice to your lower back can also help relieve the pain. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. I can probably do that. Ibuprofen, stretching, and heat… I think so. A handout would be good. I'm not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Here’s a handout with some gentle stretching exercises for your back and core. It also explains how to apply heat and ice. I’ll also write you a prescription for a slightly stronger anti-inflammatory if the ibuprofen isn't providing enough relief. It’s not something you need to take right away, just keep it on hand if needed. I’d like to see you back in a month to check your progress. If your pain gets worse, doesn't improve with these treatments, or if you develop any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet, please call the office right away. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, a stronger pill if needed, and come back in a month… and call if it gets worse. Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, Dr. Asami.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad we could come up with a plan. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for being patient with me. I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. Don't worry about forgetting things – that's perfectly alright. We're here to help. Please don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a wonderful day, and I'll see you back in a month!
