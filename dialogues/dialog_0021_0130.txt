DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… family. My mother, she… she had a lot of problems with her heart, and my brother, he had… well, he had something with his brain. Not good. I just want to make sure I’m okay. You know? Just peace of mind. I’m getting older, and… well, you worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history is important, absolutely. It’s good you’re being proactive. So, you’re mostly concerned about potentially developing similar issues to your mother and brother, correct?
PATIENT: Yes. That's right. My mother, she… she was always tired, and then her legs… they would swell up. And my brother… he just… forgot things. A lot of things. I don't want that. I’m still working, need to remember things for my job, you know? Sales… gotta keep track of customers.
DOCTOR: Right, sales. That does require a good memory. Okay. Let's start with your mother then. You said she was always tired and had swelling in her legs. Do you remember if she was ever formally diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… formally diagnosed… I don’t think so. Back then, things were different. She just went to the regular doctor, you know? He gave her… water pills, I think. To make her pee more. That's all I remember. And she ate very little salt. My sister, she always worried about her salt. I don’t think they really knew what was wrong. Just… old age, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your brother?
PATIENT: My brother… that was… sad. He started forgetting little things. Where he put his keys, things like that. Then it got worse. He forgot… names of his grandchildren. He got very confused sometimes. He… he had to go live with my sister. She took care of him. The doctor… they said it was… something with his brain. I don’t remember the name. Something about… getting smaller?
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like he may have had some form of dementia. We don't have to dwell on that right now, but it’s helpful information. Now, let’s focus on you. Have you been experiencing any memory problems, or anything else that's concerning you?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I forget things sometimes, but who doesn’t? I’m 73! It's just… little things. Like names. Or where I parked the car. But nothing like my brother. And I don't feel tired all the time. I eat okay, I think. Maybe too much salt. My sister always tells me that. But no, I don't feel sick. Just… worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant memory loss, no fatigue, and you're aware of potentially consuming too much salt. That’s good awareness. Now, just to get a better overall picture, let's go through a quick review of systems. Do you have any problems with your heart – like chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations?
PATIENT: Hmm… palpitations, that means… like a fast heartbeat? No, not really. My heart feels okay. Sometimes, after I walk up a hill, I get a little winded, but I’m not a young man anymore. And no chest pain. Never had any chest pain. I do get a little… puffiness sometimes in my ankles, especially if I stand for a long time. Is that… the swelling you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that could be the swelling. That’s helpful to know. Now, how about your lungs?
PATIENT: My lungs? Never had any trouble with them. I smoked when I was young, a long time ago. Stopped about… 20 years ago. But I never coughed much, never had any shortness of breath unless I’m really pushing myself. I used to hike a lot. Not so much now. My lungs are probably okay. I don't smoke anymore. That's the important thing, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, quitting is excellent. Alright, let's move on. How about your digestive system?
PATIENT: Digestive… um… I eat pretty regularly. Sometimes a little… you know… constipated. But nothing major. I try to drink enough water. And no, no pain, no… bleeding or anything like that. Just old man stuff. Everything goes through, eventually. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, one last thing. Any trouble with your kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Kidneys and… bladder. Hmm. No. I pee fine. No pain when I go. And no, I don’t get up a lot at night. Maybe once, but that’s just… getting old. And no, no blood in my pee. Not that I've noticed. I think everything’s okay down there. I'm still functioning, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good to know. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam then. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your ankles. Then we can discuss some possible next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let's get it over with, eh? I have appointments to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just have a seat here, please. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just try to breathe normally. Your heart sounds… a little irregular, a bit of a murmur. Not overly concerning at this point, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Lungs are clear, good air movement. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Pulse is also a little fast at 88. And yes, I do feel some slight swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. It's mild, but present. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, we have a few things to consider… the irregular heartbeat, slightly elevated blood pressure, and the ankle swelling. I'd like to order a few tests… a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and cholesterol, and an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. Sounds good. As long as it tells us something. I don’t want to run around doing tests for nothing, you know? But if you think it’s important, then do them. What about my brain? Should we check my brain? I don’t want to end up like my brother.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Schwer. Given your family history, it’s wise to think about that. However, at this point, you aren’t exhibiting any significant memory loss or cognitive changes. I wouldn’t recommend a full neurological work-up just yet. We can start with the blood work and EKG, and then, if we see anything concerning, or if you do start to notice changes in your memory or thinking, we can certainly discuss further testing. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable… yes, I suppose so. Start with the heart and blood, see what that says. If something’s wrong there, then we worry about the brain. Alright. What do I have to do for these tests? Do I have to drink anything gross? I hate those things.
DOCTOR: No, nothing gross, I promise. For the blood work, you’ll just need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks besides water. And for the EKG, we’ll just put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all, it's very quick. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so we can get it done right away. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and set you up with the EKG technician. Does that all sound manageable?
PATIENT: Alright. No eating… stickers… I can handle that. Eight hours, huh? I had a big breakfast this morning. But that's okay. I can skip lunch. The nurse will take care of it, you said? And the technician? Good. As long as someone explains what’s going on. I don’t like surprises. When will I get the results? I have appointments next week, gotta know if I can keep ‘em.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. The nurse will explain everything as she goes, and the technician will do the same with the EKG. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. We can call you with the results, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in person. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Call me, please. I don't want to have to come back just for results. I’m a busy man, Doctor. Just call me, tell me what’s going on. That's all I ask. And… make sure it's a nice nurse, okay? Someone who explains things clearly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make a note to have one of our most patient and thorough nurses call you with the results. She’ll explain everything clearly. Alright, let’s get you scheduled with the nurse for the blood draw and the EKG technician. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something about it. It’s the worrying that gets to you, you know? Hopefully, it's nothing serious. Just old age, like you said. And make sure that nurse is nice, okay?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I understand completely about the worrying – it's perfectly natural. I'll personally make sure you're taken care of and that the nurse is… exceptionally nice. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you started. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
