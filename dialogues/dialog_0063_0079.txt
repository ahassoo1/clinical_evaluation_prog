DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me why you’ve come to see me today. Try to be concise; my schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, concise. Okay. It's my bruising. It's just...worse lately. I'm on that blood thinner, you know, Warfarin… and I bump into things normally, but now even little things leave a huge mark. It's worrying me.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, yes. A troublesome medication. And you say this bruising is…newly exacerbated?
PATIENT: Exacerbated? Is that…worse? Yes, that’s it. It’s definitely worse. Like, a week or so ago I just grazed my arm on the doorframe and it looked like someone punched me. Normally it’s just a little color, you know? This is…not normal, even for me being on the stuff.
DOCTOR: “Little things” leaving “huge marks.” Vague descriptions are…unhelpful, Ms. Hainley. Can you quantify this?
PATIENT: Quantify? Um… Okay. Last month, a bump would maybe leave a bruise the size of a quarter. Now? Like…my forearm, almost the whole length of it, turned purple and black after just knocking it against the coffee table. It was…scary. I didn't even feel that hard of a hit, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long have you been on this Warfarin?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... it'll be three years, come November. So, almost three years now. They put me on it after... well, after the blood clot in my leg. It was a bad one, needed surgery and everything. But the bruising didn’t start getting this bad until maybe a month or two ago.
DOCTOR: Three years. A long time to be on this medication. Are you…diligent about your INR checks?
PATIENT: INR checks? I try to be. I go to the lab every…well, they tell me when to go. Usually about once a month. I haven’t missed any, as far as I remember. They call if something’s wrong, right? And they haven’t called lately.
DOCTOR: "As far as you remember." That is… less than reassuring, Ms. Hainley. Let me access your records here. …Ah, yes. Last INR was…July 18th. 2.1. Not ideal. Have you made any changes to your diet or other medications recently?
PATIENT: 2.1? Is that bad? I don't really pay attention to the numbers, just if they tell me to adjust my pills. And no, nothing’s changed. Same foods, same vitamins… I haven't started anything new, I promise. I haven't even been taking any over-the-counter stuff, just my usual multivitamin.
DOCTOR: A suboptimal INR, coupled with unexplained bruising… We need to rule out several possibilities. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. Please, lie back on the examination table. And try to remain still.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Still, you said? How still? I'm not very good at laying still for long.
DOCTOR: Still enough for me to assess your bruising and look for any other abnormalities, Ms. Hainley. Please. Hmm. Extensive bruising, as you stated. No palpable masses. Capillary refill…adequate. Any pain in your calves with dorsiflexion?
PATIENT: Dorsiflexion? Is that like… pointing my toes? No, no pain there. It's just the bruising, like I said. It’s mostly on my arms and legs, but I did notice a little bit on my stomach, too, but that one's small. Ow, that's a little tender, but that's probably just from bumping into things, you know?
DOCTOR: Tender, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Not bad bad, just... sensitive. It's hard to explain. I bruise easily, remember? Everything feels a bit more…intense, I guess. Like, a normal touch feels harder than it should. It's probably just the Warfarin. Is something wrong? You’re looking at my leg like…something’s really bad.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hainley, “just the Warfarin” is not a diagnosis. While it may be contributing, we must explore other possibilities. Given your history and the recent increase in bruising, particularly with tenderness, we need to rule out deep vein thrombosis. I am going to order a D-dimer test and a venous ultrasound of both legs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: D-dimer? Venous…ultrasound? Is that… serious? Are you saying it could be another blood clot? Because I thought the Warfarin was supposed to prevent those. I… I don’t understand. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is serious, Ms. Hainley. It could be another blood clot. Warfarin reduces the risk, but does not eliminate it entirely. The D-dimer is a blood test that can help rule out clotting. The ultrasound…visualizes the veins in your legs. And, frankly, the cost is…not my concern at this moment. Your health is. I will write the orders for these tests. Please go to the lab immediately. And, Ms. Hainley, if you experience any pain, swelling, or redness in your legs, go to the nearest emergency room. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Okay, okay… emergency room if there's pain, swelling, redness. Got it. And go to the lab… right now? Will they…will they need to draw a lot of blood? I get lightheaded, sometimes. And is there anything else I should be doing? Like, should I stop taking my pills? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Do not stop taking your Warfarin. That would be… ill-advised. You will require a standard blood draw for the D-dimer. As for feeling lightheaded, inform the phlebotomist. They are trained to handle such situations. Here are the orders. Go now. And Ms. Hainley, try to…remain calm. Worrying will not improve the situation. I expect you to follow up with me as soon as you have the results. Next!
PATIENT: Okay. Right. Follow up… as soon as the results… Thank you, Doctor. Lightheaded… don’t stop the pills… emergency room… .
