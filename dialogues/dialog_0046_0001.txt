DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as the receptionist explained, I suppose, I’m here about the smoking. I’ve been… at it a long time, and I’m finally thinking it’s time to try and stop. It’s become… rather a nuisance, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knoch. It's excellent that you're considering quitting. It’s never too late to make a positive change for your health. And you're right to call it a nuisance – smoking certainly can be. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a bit more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… I began when I was seventeen, back in Lithuania, actually. Mostly with friends, you understand. Just… social. It wasn’t considered… a big deal then, not like it is now. I suppose. I’ve been smoking… oh, let me calculate… sixty-some years, now. Mostly unfiltered cigarettes, Gauloises, when I can get them. Though lately, any brand will do, I confess. About a pack a day, on average, for… well, most of those sixty years. There were a few times I tried to cut back, during… difficult times. But… it never lasted.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is a long time, Mr. Knoch. Thank you for sharing that with me. A pack a day of Gauloises… that’s a significant smoking history. You mentioned trying to cut back during difficult times. Can you tell me a little more about those attempts?
PATIENT: Yes, well… the first time was when my wife… she passed away, about twenty years ago. I tried to stop then, you see. Thought it would… help with the grief, somehow. But it didn’t. It only made things worse, I think. I lasted… maybe a week. Then I started again. Just one cigarette, at first. Then two. And then… back to a full pack a day. There was another time, when I had some trouble with my… business. A small import shop, you understand. That was… ten years ago, maybe? I managed a few weeks that time, but… the stress, it was too much. I needed something to… calm my nerves. It sounds foolish, I know.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound foolish at all, Mr. Knoch. Smoking is a very addictive habit, and it’s quite common to rely on it during times of stress or emotional difficulty. It’s understandable that you turned to it during those challenging periods. To get a more complete picture of your health, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, I have… a touch of arthritis, in my knees mostly. Makes walking difficult sometimes, especially in the cold. And my doctor, Dr. Petrov, he told me a few years back that my blood pressure is… slightly elevated. He put me on some medication for it, a small white pill, I take it every morning. Aside from that… nothing serious, I believe. I haven't been to see Dr. Petrov in… oh, a year, perhaps. I don’t like going to doctors, if I’m being honest. I find it… unsettling. It reminds me of… well, never mind. It’s just a personal feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling about doctors, Mr. Knoch. Many people share that sentiment. We’ll take things at your pace. You mentioned a small white pill for your blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have the bottle here, actually. Ah, yes. Lisinopril. That’s it. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it… for about five years now, I think. It seems to be working, mostly. My blood pressure hasn’t been… problematic, since I started taking it. Dr. Petrov checks it every time I visit. Which, as I said, isn’t very often. I prefer to manage things myself, when I can. It's just… I feel more in control that way.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear that the Lisinopril is helping to manage your blood pressure, Mr. Knoch. And I appreciate you being proactive about your health. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t believe so, not really. I’ve never had a… a strong reaction to anything, that I recall. Perhaps a bit of… hay fever in the springtime, when the flowers bloom, but nothing serious. Just a bit of a runny nose, a few sneezes. Nothing that requires medication, certainly. My wife… she was allergic to cats, terribly so. But I… I’m fine with them. I even had a cat once, a small grey tabby. Wonderful creature. But that’s beside the point, of course. No allergies to speak of, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And it sounds like you have a soft spot for cats. Now, before we discuss a plan to help you quit smoking, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, well… my father, he had… heart trouble. A weak heart, Dr. Petrov said. He passed away when I was quite young, actually, in his fifties. A sudden heart attack, they said. And my mother, she had… diabetes. She suffered with it for many years, before she passed away. She lost her sight, eventually, from the complications. My wife’s family… they had mostly… arthritis, I think. Nothing too serious. So, heart trouble and diabetes on my side, mostly. And arthritis on my wife’s. It’s not a very… robust history, I’m afraid. But there you have it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knoch. That’s important information, particularly the history of heart trouble and diabetes. Given your family history, and your own health conditions, quitting smoking is even more crucial for your well-being. Now, let's talk a bit about your current smoking habits. How many cigarettes do you smoke each day, on average?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, about a pack a day, Doctor. Though, I confess, it varies a bit. Some days… more. Some days… less. If I am… particularly stressed, or anxious, I tend to smoke more. And if I am… bored, I smoke more as well. It’s a… a habit, you see. A very deeply ingrained habit. I usually have my first cigarette with my breakfast, a small coffee and a Gauloise. And then… throughout the day, whenever I have a spare moment. After meals, mostly. And before bed, to… calm my nerves. It's become… a part of my routine, you understand. A very difficult routine to break, I suspect.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knoch. It sounds like smoking is very integrated into your daily life. It's not surprising it would be difficult to break. Now, do you feel physically addicted to cigarettes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Absolutely. If I go… a few hours without one, I start to feel… restless. Irritable. My hands… they tremble, a bit. I get… headaches, sometimes. And I just… crave one. A terrible craving. It’s not… a pleasant feeling, I assure you. It’s a… physical need, you see. Like… hunger, almost. Or… thirst. I’ve tried to stop before, as I mentioned, and the… withdrawal symptoms were… quite unpleasant. That’s why I started again, you understand. It was too much to bear. I believe it’s a… physical addiction, as well as a… mental one. A very strong addiction, Doctor. Very strong indeed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open about that, Mr. Knoch. It’s good we’ve established that it’s both a physical and mental addiction. Knowing this helps us to tailor a plan that is right for you. Before we discuss specific options, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s… perfectly alright. Though, I confess, I’m not… fond of physical exams. But I understand it’s… necessary, I suppose. I’ve always been… rather delicate, you see. But please, be gentle. I bruise easily. And I don’t… care for surprises. If you are going to… listen to my chest, or… check my reflexes, please let me know beforehand. I just… prefer to be prepared. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Knoch. I completely understand. We’ll take things slowly and I’ll explain everything before I do it. I’ll certainly let you know before each step. We'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Finally, I'll take a quick look at your throat and ears. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable, Doctor. Blood pressure and pulse first, you say? Very well. I suppose it’s as good a place to start as any. Please, don’t be alarmed if my blood pressure is… slightly elevated. Dr. Petrov said it fluctuates, you see. It depends on… my stress levels, mostly. And the… the weather. Yes, the weather. It affects my blood pressure, as well. And please, be gentle with the… the stethoscope. It feels… cold. And… a bit intrusive, if I’m being honest. But proceed, Doctor. I’ll try to… remain calm.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. Just relax your arm for me, please. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm… there we go. Take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That is a bit elevated, as you mentioned. Your pulse is 78, which is within the normal range. As you said, the blood pressure is a little high, but not drastically so. It's good we have a baseline now. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. I’ll let you know what I’m listening for. Take deep breaths for me, please. In through the nose, out through the mouth.
PATIENT: Yes, deep breaths. In… and out… It’s… cold, Doctor. Very cold. And a bit… uncomfortable. But proceed, please. I’m trying to… remain calm. I always find it… difficult to breathe properly when I’m… being examined. It feels… unnatural. But I am trying, Doctor. I am truly trying. In… and out… deeper… deeper… Excuse me. It's… the dust, I suspect. From the… the old furniture. Yes, the dust. It always irritates my lungs, you see.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Knoch. Take your time. A cough is perfectly normal. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing, which could be related to the dust, as you mentioned, or possibly some mild bronchitis. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but we should keep an eye on it. Now, I'd like to quickly look in your throat and ears. Just open your mouth for me, please, and say “Ah.”
PATIENT: Yes, “Ah.” “Ahhhh…” It feels… strange, Doctor. Like… exposing something… vulnerable. And my throat is… a bit dry, you see. From the… the dust, mostly. I always find it… difficult to open my mouth wide. It feels… unnatural. And a bit… embarrassing. But proceed, please. I am trying to… cooperate. Is it… very red in there? Is it… inflamed? Please, be gentle. I bruise easily, you see. And I don’t… care for surprises. But proceed, Doctor. I trust your… expertise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. Just relax your neck for me. Your throat is slightly red, but there are no signs of infection. Your ears look clear as well. No signs of inflammation or fluid buildup. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal, though we will need to monitor your blood pressure and the slight heart murmur. Your lungs sound a bit wheezy, which could be due to the dust, and we can discuss some strategies for that. Now, before we discuss a plan to help you quit smoking, can you tell me if you’ve tried any other methods to stop smoking in the past, besides cutting back?
PATIENT: Yes, well… I tried the… the patches, about ten years ago. The nicotine patches, you see. They were… quite unpleasant, actually. They gave me… terrible nightmares, and a strange rash on my skin. It was… very uncomfortable, and I stopped using them after a week. Then I tried… the gum, about five years ago. The nicotine gum, you see. It tasted… awful, actually. Like… rubber, almost. And it gave me… terrible jaw pain. It was… very distracting, and I stopped using it after a few days. Then, I tried… the vaping. A friend suggested it, you see. But it made me… cough even more. And it tasted… artificial. I confess, Doctor, nothing seems to… work for me. I’ve tried… everything, it seems. And I always… end up back where I started. It’s… rather discouraging, actually. It feels… hopeless. But proceed, Doctor. I’m willing to… try anything, once more. If you believe it… might help. But please, no more patches. And no more gum. It’s… rather unpleasant, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Knoch. It sounds like you've really given several methods a fair try, and it's discouraging that none of them have been successful. It's good that you're willing to try again. Given your experience with the patches, gum, and vaping, and considering your family history, I think we should focus on a combination of behavioral therapy and medication, specifically a non-nicotine medication like bupropion or varenicline. They work by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms, without the unpleasant side effects you experienced with nicotine replacement therapy. However, I want to be upfront - these medications do have potential side effects. We'll need to discuss those in detail before starting anything. Additionally, these medications are most effective when combined with behavioral counseling. Would you be open to exploring both options?
PATIENT: Behavioral therapy… and medication, you say? Yes, I suppose so. As long as the medication doesn't… give me nightmares. Or a rash. And as long as the behavioral therapy isn’t… too intrusive. I'm not… fond of group sessions, you see. I prefer… one-on-one interactions. And I don't… care for surprises. Please, explain the… the potential side effects in detail. I need to… understand what I’m getting myself into. And please, explain the… the behavioral therapy in detail. What will I be… expected to do? And how often will I be… required to attend sessions? I need to… know all the details, Doctor. Before I… commit to anything. It feels… rather daunting, actually. But proceed, Doctor. I’m willing to… listen. But please, be patient. I need to… process everything, slowly. And carefully.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knoch. That’s perfectly reasonable. I understand your concerns, and I’m happy to explain everything in detail. I want you to feel completely comfortable and informed before making any decisions. Let's start with the medications. Bupropion and varenicline are both non-nicotine medications that work on the brain to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Common side effects of bupropion can include dry mouth, insomnia, and, rarely, anxiety or irritability. Varenicline can sometimes cause nausea, vivid dreams, and, rarely, mood changes. The risk of serious side effects is low, but we'll discuss your medical history and monitor you closely if we decide to use either medication. We will start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. We'll also regularly check in to assess how you're feeling. Now, regarding behavioral therapy. We have a counselor here who specializes in smoking cessation, and she offers one-on-one sessions. During these sessions, you'll work with her to develop coping strategies for dealing with cravings, identify triggers that lead to smoking, and create a plan to quit. It’s a collaborative process, and the sessions are tailored to your individual needs. The number of sessions can vary, but typically we recommend about 8-12 sessions over a few months. The goal is to help you develop the skills and support you need to stay smoke-free long-term. The sessions are typically about an hour long and can be scheduled at a time that’s convenient for you. Does that sound manageable, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Eight to twelve sessions… It sounds… rather extensive, actually. But… manageable, perhaps. As long as the… the counselor is… understanding. And as long as the sessions are… confidential. I don’t… care for sharing personal details with… strangers. And as long as the… the sessions are… flexible. I have… commitments, you see. I can’t… commit to a rigid schedule. But… eight to twelve sessions, with a… confidential and understanding counselor, and a flexible schedule… Yes, perhaps. Perhaps that is… doable. But I need to… know more about the… the counselor. What is her… her experience? What are her… her credentials? And… can I… meet with her before… committing to anything? Just… a brief introductory session, to see if… we are a good fit? I need to… feel comfortable, you see. Before I… share my personal details. And before I… commit to such a… lengthy process. But proceed, Doctor. I am willing to… explore the possibility. But please, more information about the… the counselor. And the possibility of an introductory session. That is… essential.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Knoch. Those are very reasonable requests. I completely understand your need to feel comfortable and confident before committing to therapy. Let me tell you a bit about our counselor, Ms. Evelyn Reed. She’s a licensed clinical social worker with over ten years of experience specializing in addiction treatment, particularly smoking cessation. She’s very compassionate and empathetic, and she has a strong track record of helping patients achieve their goals. She’s also experienced in working with patients who have a complex medical history, and she prioritizes patient confidentiality. You can find more information about her on our clinic website, including her qualifications and approach to therapy. And yes, you can absolutely meet with her for a brief introductory session before committing to anything. It's a standard practice, and it’s a great way to see if you feel comfortable working with her. The introductory session is typically about 20 minutes long and it's free of charge. It's a chance for you to ask questions and for her to learn more about your smoking history and your goals. Would you like me to schedule an introductory session for you with Ms. Reed?
PATIENT: Yes, please. An introductory session… with Ms. Reed, you say? That sounds… perfectly acceptable. And… free of charge, you say? Excellent. Yes, please schedule one for me. Perhaps… next week? I have… commitments earlier in the week. But… Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon would be… acceptable. If Ms. Reed is… available, of course. Please, let me know what time slots are… available. And please, let me know if there is… any paperwork I need to… complete beforehand. I prefer to… be prepared. But proceed, Doctor. Schedule the introductory session… with Ms. Reed. And thank you. Thank you for… being so understanding. It feels… rather reassuring, actually. This is… a big step, you see. A very big step. But I… am willing to… try. With Ms. Reed's assistance, perhaps… I can finally… break this habit.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knoch. I'm glad I could help. Taking this step is a significant accomplishment, and I commend you for being so proactive. Let me see… Ms. Reed has availability on Tuesday at 2:00 PM or Wednesday at 3:30 PM. Would either of those times work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday at 3:30 PM… Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Perfectly acceptable. Wednesday at 3:30 PM, with Ms. Reed. Excellent. There is no need to… rush, Doctor. I’m not… accustomed to making decisions so quickly. But Wednesday at 3:30 PM, with Ms. Reed… Yes. That is… settled. Thank you. Thank you for… arranging everything. I believe… that is all for today, isn’t it? Unless there is… something else I need to… know. But I believe… that is all. Wednesday at 3:30 PM. With Ms. Reed. Yes.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Knoch, that is all for today. I have scheduled your introductory session with Ms. Reed for Wednesday at 3:30 PM. Her office is just down the hall, and the receptionist will direct you when you arrive. I want to reiterate how impressed I am with your willingness to take this step. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Knoch. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to hearing about your progress.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… everything. And thank you for… being so patient. I confess, I was… rather apprehensive. But you have… put me at ease. And I appreciate that. Wednesday at 3:30 PM. With Ms. Reed. Yes. I will… remember. And I will… be there. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you… once again.
