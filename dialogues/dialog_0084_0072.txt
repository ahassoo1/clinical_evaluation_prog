DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been…forgetting things. Not huge things, usually. Just…where I put my keys, or what I was about to say mid-sentence. It's been happening more and more lately, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Forgetfulness, you said, and it's been increasing recently. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I think maybe… six months ago? It started with just little things, like not remembering if I locked the door. But in the last three months, it’s definitely gotten worse. I even forgot a patient’s name last week, which is…not good for a dentist, right?
DOCTOR: No, that's definitely concerning if it's impacting your work. So, six months ago, gradual onset, worsening over the last three. Has this been interfering with your daily activities – besides work?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. It’s…small things, but annoying. Like, I’ll start to make dinner and completely forget what I was making halfway through. Or I’ll go to the store for milk and come back with everything but milk. It’s not that I can’t eventually remember, it just…takes a while, and I have to retrace my steps a lot. And I worry about…bigger things, you know? Like, forgetting appointments. I've been writing everything down, but even that feels unreliable sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s impacting your daily routine and causing some anxiety. And you're having to use memory aids – writing things down – but that doesn’t feel completely secure. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My sleep…hasn't been great, actually. I wake up a lot during the night. I don’t know if that’s from the forgetting, or if the forgetting is from the bad sleep. It’s a bit of a chicken-or-egg situation. And…I guess I've been a little more irritable than usual. Mostly with myself, because I can't remember things! It's frustrating. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, but definitely not my usual cheerful self.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sleep disturbance and increased irritability. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes recently?
PATIENT: No, no headaches or dizziness. My vision…actually, now that you mention it, I did need to get a new prescription for my glasses a few months ago. But that was just normal age-related stuff, the eye doctor said. Nothing dramatic. I haven’t noticed any other changes with my vision, like blurriness or double vision. Just needed stronger lenses.
DOCTOR: Alright. No headaches, dizziness, or significant vision changes. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up with antibiotics. My doctor usually tells me my checkups are fine, blood pressure's good, cholesterol's good…I’m pretty healthy, generally. I try to eat well and I walk my dog every day. This forgetting thing is really throwing me for a loop, because it doesn’t feel like something a healthy person would experience.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy with no chronic conditions. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think…I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And I broke my arm once, when I was in college. But nothing major since then. No hospital stays or anything like that. It's been a pretty uneventful medical history, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm in college, otherwise uneventful. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s rare. I really try to avoid taking medication whenever possible. I’m not a fan of pills, to be honest. So, just the multivitamin, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin. And no known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication without problems... well, besides not wanting to take medication! But no actual allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, family history – has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – experienced memory loss or dementia?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she…was a bit forgetful in her later years. But we just chalked it up to old age, you know? She wasn’t officially diagnosed with anything, as far as I know. My mother always said she was “just getting old.” And my father’s side…I don’t really know much about their medical history. They weren't very open about those things. So, I don’t have a clear answer for you, unfortunately. It’s possible, but I don’t have any definite diagnoses to report.
DOCTOR: Okay. Possible family history of memory loss, but nothing definitive. And finally, a few social history questions - do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don’t drink alcohol, never have. And I definitely don’t smoke or do drugs. I'm very health-conscious, as I mentioned. I like to stay active and eat well, so I avoid those things. I'm a bit of a homebody, actually. I enjoy reading and spending time with my dog.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal, thank you for that thorough history. I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. A physical exam sounds good.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6, and your lungs sound clear. Heart sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. I'll be checking your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, squeezing. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Good grip strength, equal on both sides. Now, can you push against my hands with your feet?
PATIENT: Pushing…is that alright?
DOCTOR: Good, equal resistance. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Both reflexes are 2+ and equal, normal. Finally, I’m going to check your balance. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Okay…trying to stay still… Oh! Whoa…that’s harder than I thought. I think I needed to keep my eyes open.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright. A little unsteady, but not concerning. All right, Ms. Heidenthal, thank you for letting me examine you. Based on everything you’ve told me and the physical exam, it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing your memory loss. But it’s good that you’re proactive about getting it checked out. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems, which can sometimes cause memory issues. Also, I recommend a brain MRI to get a better look at your brain structure. That will help us rule out other possibilities. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work and an MRI…okay. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. It's a little scary, thinking about an MRI, but I understand it’s important. So yes, please, let’s do those things.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and imaging center. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and the imaging center will contact you regarding the MRI. It's important to tell them if you have any metal implants. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use memory aids, like writing things down, and getting plenty of sleep. We can also talk about strategies to help improve your concentration and memory. I’ll want to see you back here in about two weeks to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks is fine. I’ll definitely keep writing things down and try to get more sleep, though that might be easier said than done. And I appreciate you talking about strategies to help. That sounds good. So, two weeks to discuss the results…okay. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better just having a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand it’s concerning, but we’re going to work through this. The nurse will give you some informational pamphlets on memory strategies before you leave. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and for listening to me. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Have a good day, Ms. Heidenthal. .
