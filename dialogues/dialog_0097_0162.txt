DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I ain't got all day. It's my stomach, alright? Been… puffy. Bloated. Feels like I swallowed a beach ball. It’s been going on for a bit now. Honestly, I don't really remember when it started, just… is there a quick fix? I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re feeling quite uncomfortable with a lot of bloating. And I appreciate you letting me know you’re on a tight schedule – we’ll definitely try to be efficient. “A bit now” is helpful, but could you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Rough idea? Ugh. Look, weeks, maybe? Months? It all kinda blurs together, you know? Things just... happen. I'm a pile driver operator, not a calendar keeper. It's definitely worse after I eat. That's all I really know for sure. Is that good enough? I really don’t have time to sit here and dissect my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, weeks to months, worse after eating – that’s a good starting point. No worries at all about the calendar keeping – I just need a general timeframe. And I absolutely respect your time. To help me understand what might be going on, can you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: What do I eat? Honestly, whatever’s fast. Sandwiches, mostly. Burgers if I'm lucky. Sometimes takeout, you know, fried chicken, pizza… Not exactly health food, I'll admit. It's hard to pack a lunch when you’re running heavy machinery all day. And I drink a lot of coffee, gotta stay awake. Is this a quiz? I feel like I'm being judged.
DOCTOR: No judgement at all, Lawton, honestly. Knowing what you eat helps me put the pieces together. Coffee is good to know, too. Now, besides the bloating, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think... I get heartburn sometimes. And… gas. A lot of gas. It's embarrassing, honestly. And… I'm tired. Real tired. But, I mean, I do hard work, so maybe that’s just from that. Does that count? Look, I just want this puffiness to go away. It’s making my work clothes tight. That’s the biggest problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn, a lot of gas, and fatigue. Those are all helpful things to know. And it's perfectly valid that it's impacting your comfort at work – that’s a real issue. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Doc, are you fishing for… never mind. Look, I go when I go. Sometimes it’s… loose. Sometimes it’s… not. It varies. It’s not like I’m keeping a logbook or anything. Is this even relevant? I'm starting to regret coming in here. It's just a bit of bloating!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lawton. I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions. It’s just that changes in bowel habits can be relevant, but if it’s variable, that’s good to know. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Ugh. No. Nothing I know of. Tried some allergy pills once, years ago, didn't do anything. Didn’t react or anything. I don’t go around eating weird stuff. I'm pretty basic. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a job to do. And I really don’t like talking about this stuff. It's… private.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies – that’s helpful. And I completely understand your discomfort – this is personal, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. Just a few more quick questions. Do you have any family history of stomach problems, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Family history? Look, my wife… she passed away a few years back. Cancer. Different kind, lung cancer. That's all I really remember. My family… we didn't really talk about health problems. It wasn't something we did. Frankly, I try not to think about it. Is this necessary? This is getting depressing. I just want a pill to fix the bloating and get back to work. .
DOCTOR: I am so sorry to hear about your wife, Lawton. That must have been incredibly difficult. And you’re right, dwelling on the past isn’t helpful right now. Okay, I understand. Given everything you’ve told me – the bloating, the gas, heartburn, fatigue, variable bowel habits, diet, and your wife’s history – it sounds like we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be something simple like dietary changes or stress, but given your wife’s cancer history, and the persistence of your symptoms, I do want to rule out anything more serious. Would you be okay with me doing a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and check for any tenderness?
