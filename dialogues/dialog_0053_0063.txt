DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Back… my back is really hurting. Bad. It started a few weeks ago, but it's gotten much worse now. It’s… hard to even bend over. I know about the cancer, and I was hoping we could talk about the pain.
DOCTOR: Right. “Cancer.” Okay. Well, let's get some details about this back pain. A few weeks ago, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe… four weeks? It was just a little ache at first. Like after working in the garden, you know? But then it started to hurt more, even when I wasn’t doing anything. Now it’s like… a sharp pain, all down my back. And sometimes it goes down my leg a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. Down the leg…which leg, specifically?
PATIENT: My right leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… sort of in the thigh and the back of my knee. It makes it hard to walk sometimes, Doctor. Especially if I stand for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, but it’s… mostly there. Like a dull ache all the time. And then… whoosh… it gets really sharp sometimes, if I move wrong. Or even if I just try to stand up straight. Then it stays sharp for a little while, and then goes back to just being a dull ache. It’s… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand it's difficult to explain. Have you tried anything to relieve the pain already?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I’ve been taking some pills… the ones the last doctor gave me, for the other pain. They don't really help much with the back, though. And I’ve been trying to rest, but it’s hard when you have things to do. I put some heat on it a couple of times, but that didn't really help either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your back, Ms. Meigs. We’ll do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. If you could just lie down on your stomach for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. It's a little hard to move quickly. I'll try to get up there. Is that table… very high?
DOCTOR: It's adjustable. Don’t worry. Just lie flat on your stomach, arms at your sides. Now, let me just palpate your spine and surrounding muscles… tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Is this painful here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right… right there. That's… really sore. And if you push… just a little bit to the left of that, it goes down my leg. Like a… a shooting pain. It’s not a good pain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about when you lift your leg straight up like this?
PATIENT: Oh… Doctor, that really hurts. It’s like a pull, all the way down my leg. I can’t… I can’t get it very high. It feels like something is… stuck. I don’t know how to explain it. It's worse than just the ache, much worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. This suggests some possible nerve involvement. Now, could you please turn over and lie on your back?
PATIENT: Okay. It's hard to move, Doctor. Everything feels… stiff. Is this okay? I hope I'm not making this harder for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just check your reflexes... And what about this?
PATIENT: Ooh! That startled me! It didn't hurt, but it was… surprising. Is that normal, Doctor? It's been a long time since anyone checked my reflexes. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s a normal reflex, yes. However, it’s not as strong as it should be. Given your history… and these findings, I’m concerned about a possible disc herniation. It's a common cause of radicular pain. Now, you mentioned cancer earlier. What kind of cancer were you diagnosed with and what treatment are you currently receiving?
PATIENT: Oh… disc… what now? I don't… I don't understand. I just know it hurts! The doctor said… breast cancer. A few years ago. I had… surgery and some medicine. They said it was… okay for a while, but then it came back. I’m getting medicine now, pills. It makes me tired, mostly. And sometimes sick. But… it’s not the back pain. This is… different. A lot different.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, breast cancer, currently in remission with medication… The medication could contribute to muscle weakness, but doesn’t fully explain this presentation. Look, Ms. Meigs, the fact is, given your age, history, and these physical exam findings, we need to get an MRI to rule out a disc herniation or other structural issue. It’s the most responsible course of action. We can't just dismiss this as a side effect. Do you understand?
PATIENT: MRI? Like… a big machine? Is it going to hurt? And… is it expensive? I don't… I don't have a lot of money, Doctor. My insurance… it's okay, but… they don't always pay for everything. And… what if it is something bad? I just want the pain to go away. Is there anything else we can try before doing a big machine thing?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Meigs, I understand your concerns. But without imaging, we’re just guessing. A proper diagnosis is crucial. Yes, it’s a machine, yes, it can be expensive, and yes, it’s possible it will show something concerning. But not knowing is worse. As for trying other things... we could try a steroid injection, but that’s just a temporary fix and won't address the underlying problem. I'm not going to provide a treatment based on speculation. I'll write you a referral for an MRI, and the insurance company will determine coverage. Do you want me to proceed with that?
PATIENT: …Okay. Yes. Okay, write the thing. The… MRI thing. But… please. Please make sure they know I get scared easily. And… if it’s really bad… can I talk to you about it right away? Before… before I worry myself sick? I trust you, Doctor. But… this is scary.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve written the referral. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the appointment. They’ll explain the procedure. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment with me for one week after your MRI so we can discuss the results. If anything urgent comes up before then, you can contact the clinic and speak with a nurse. Now, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you listening. I'm just… worried. I’ll wait for the phone call. And… I’ll try not to worry too much. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Meigs. .
