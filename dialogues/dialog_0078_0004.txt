DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for my regular shots, I think? Just keeping up with things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. I see here you’re due for your tetanus booster, and it looks like it’s been a few years since your last flu shot. We can definitely get those taken care of today. Before we do, though, I like to ask a few questions just to make sure everything else is going well. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Ask away. I don’t mind at all.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with your general health. Have you been feeling well overall?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty good, actually. No big complaints. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you know? Nothing I can’t handle. I’ve been trying to get out and walk more this summer, which helps.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’re staying active, Ms. Fornes. Walking is excellent. Now, have you noticed any new aches and pains, or anything different from what you usually experience?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, my right shoulder has been a little stiff lately. Not terrible, just… not as free-moving as it used to be. I figured it was just sleeping wrong, or maybe lifting something a bit too heavy when I was helping my son with his shed. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks, maybe? It doesn't hurt all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little stiffness in the right shoulder for a couple of weeks, comes and goes. And it's not associated with any specific injury that you recall besides potentially lifting something?
PATIENT: Nope, no specific injury that I remember. Just general helping-around-the-house stuff. I do a bit of work with building inspections, so I'm always climbing around on roofs and in crawl spaces, but nothing out of the ordinary for me. It just feels a bit… tighter than usual, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And does this stiffness radiate anywhere – down your arm, into your neck, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, it mostly stays in the shoulder itself. Doesn't go down my arm or up into my neck. Just… right there. It's not even constant, like I said. Some days I don't even notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it’s localized and intermittent. Now, outside of the shoulder, have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue recently?
PATIENT: Nope, none of that. I’ve been eating pretty well, thankfully. Maybe gained a little weight over the winter, but nothing drastic! No fever, no chills, no sweating at night, and I haven’t been feeling any more tired than usual. I sleep pretty soundly, actually.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No changes in my appetite at all. I still enjoy a good meal, that’s for sure! And no trouble swallowing. Everything goes down just fine. I’m still making my traditional salmon chowder, so I’m definitely eating!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear! Traditional foods are important. Let's switch gears a little bit. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in the past. I used to get stung by bees a lot when I was a kid, but I haven’t been stung in years. Never had a problem with any medicines, either. Nothing I can think of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything regularly. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, if I need it. That’s about it. No herbal supplements or anything like that. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can. My husband takes a few things for his blood pressure, but that’s his business!
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen. That's good to know. Now, I see here you’re Tlingit. Do you have any significant family medical history that you're aware of – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or other conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my grandmother on my mother's side had diabetes. She lived a long life, but it was a struggle for her towards the end. And I think my uncle had some heart trouble, but I don’t know the details. It's hard to keep track, honestly. A lot of our family history wasn't written down, it was all passed down by word of mouth, and… well, people forget things. It’s not something we talked about a lot, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Fornes. Oral traditions are valuable, but details can be lost over time. Knowing about diabetes in your grandmother is helpful, though. Okay, and finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of that. Never really been interested in smoking. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had any alcohol in a while. And definitely no recreational drugs. I prefer a good cup of tea, thank you very much!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. That’s all very helpful, Ms. Fornes. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a look at that shoulder. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, again… in… and out. Everything sounds clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Now, let's take a look at your shoulder. Can you please lift your arm up as high as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Okay… there. It’s a little uncomfortable right around… here. It doesn't hurt bad, but it's definitely not as smooth as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel a little tenderness here. And I notice some limited range of motion, particularly with outward rotation. It doesn't seem to be any significant swelling or bruising. It sounds like you may have a mild rotator cuff strain or tendinitis. It's common with age and activity. I’d like to rule out other possibilities, though. I'm going to order an X-ray of your shoulder just to make sure there aren't any underlying bone issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Better safe than sorry, right? An X-ray sounds good. I’d feel better knowing what we’re dealing with for sure.
DOCTOR: Exactly. We’ll send you over to radiology right after this, and they’ll get that done for you. In the meantime, I recommend using ice packs on your shoulder for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Also, try to avoid lifting anything heavy or doing any activities that aggravate the pain. We can also discuss some gentle range-of-motion exercises once we have the X-ray results. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Ice packs and taking it easy. I can definitely do that. And I’ll wait to hear about the exercises. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And now, about those shots?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I'm glad I could help. Alright, let’s get those shots taken care of. First, we'll do the tetanus booster. It might feel a little pinch, but it shouldn’t last long. Then, we'll do the flu shot. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay, ready as I'll ever be! Just get it over with, please. I don't love needles, but I know it's important.
DOCTOR: Alright, first one done. Just a little pinch. And now for the flu shot. There we go. All done. You’ll likely feel a little soreness at the injection sites for a day or two. You can take some ibuprofen or acetaminophen if needed. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you head over to radiology?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just a little soreness, got it. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. You’ve been wonderful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I’ll go see the radiology folks now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I'm happy to help. The radiology department is just down the hall to your left. They'll let you know when the doctor has reviewed the images. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after the X-ray. Have a good day, and feel better soon!
PATIENT: Nice to meet you too. You have a good day as well, Doctor.
