DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's… it's my waterworks, you see. Going a bit too often, if you catch my drift. It’s just… bothersome, really. Not a big deal, but my wife keeps nudging me to come get it checked. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: "Waterworks," alright. Frequent urination, you mean?
PATIENT: Frequent… is that what the young people are calling it these days? Yes, yes, that’s a good way to put it. More than usual, anyway. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. Hard to say exactly how long. Time just slips away, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does indeed. And is it just more frequent, or are you experiencing any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: Urgency… well, sometimes. Not every time, mind you. Usually, I get a little warning. But lately… a couple of times now, it’s been… sudden. Like a dam bursting, almost. And then, you know… it’s not much when I get there. Just a little trickle, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. A little discomfort, maybe, a little… strain. But not pain. I’ve had real pain in my life, believe me. This ain’t it. Though it’s unsettling, having to go so often. Makes you wonder what’s going on down there, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. Now you’re asking things. I don’t pay much attention to the color, to be honest. It’s… yellow, usually. Sometimes a bit darker, sometimes a bit lighter. Depends on what I’ve been drinking, I reckon. Smell… I don’t sniff it, Doctor. That’s what wives are for, isn’t it? She hasn't said anything about a bad smell, but then again, she doesn’t volunteer much information.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s move on. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven’t been running a fever. I feel perfectly fine, other than this… waterworks business. Chills… no. And my belly… no pain. It’s a strong belly, you know. Worked hard on this farm all my life. Nothing down there bothers me, usually. Just this… frequent visiting, as you say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now why are you asking me about that? What’s that got to do with my waterworks? Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking a lot of personal questions. I mean, a man has some dignity, you know. Everything’s connected, I suppose… but really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, sometimes changes in bowel habits can indicate a larger issue. It’s standard procedure to ask a thorough medical history. But if you’re truly uncomfortable, we can skip it. But it would be helpful to know if you've experienced any constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool. It's all part of the picture.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. Don't get your knickers in a twist, Doctor. It's just… seems a bit intrusive, that's all. Constipation… sometimes. Old man problems, you know? Things don’t move as freely as they used to. And no, no blood. Never any blood. Just… slow going, is all. And I try to drink plenty of water, though I suppose that just makes the other problem worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. Said I needed to watch my salt. I try to, but my wife makes a good pickle. Can’t say no to a good pickle, you know? Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with sugar. Heart… skipped a beat now and then, but nothing serious. Old age, I figure. Nothing a good nap won’t fix.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. They ache, you know, after all these years of farming. Can’t remember the name of it, something with a “C” maybe? And a little something for my stomach, when it acts up. My wife gets me those. She likes the pharmacy down the street, says they give good advice. That’s about it, I think. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I think it would be best if I conducted a quick physical exam. Just to check a few things. Can you step up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Physical exam, eh? Now you're really getting up close and personal. Still, I suppose it's what doctors do. Alright, alright. Don't mind if I'm a bit slow getting up here, these knees aren't what they used to be. There we go. Easy does it. Just tell me what you want me to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Now I’m going to listen to your stomach. Just breathe normally. I’m going to feel along your spine now. Your abdomen is soft, no masses detected. Bowel sounds are present, though a bit sluggish. Spine is within normal limits. I’d like to check a urine sample to rule out any infection or other abnormalities. Can you provide one for me, please?
PATIENT: A urine sample, eh? Well, that's a bit more reasonable, I suppose. Always have to do that when you go to the doctor. Alright, alright. Where do you want me to… provide it? Hopefully it's not too far, these knees aren't up to a long march.
DOCTOR: There’s a bathroom just over there. I’ll leave you to it. There’s a specimen cup inside, and instructions on how to collect the sample. Just bring it back when you’re finished. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Right. A specimen cup. Sounds… clinical. Alright, alright. Don't mind if I take my time. And try not to think about it too much. Clinical, indeed…
