DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. Now, please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Norval is fine, please. Well, it’s… it’s my stomach, mostly. I get full awful quick these days. Used to be able to put a plate away, you know? Now, just a few bites and I feel like I’ve eaten a feast. It's been going on for a couple months, I'd say.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, you say. And it’s primarily a feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s the big thing. Fullness. And not a good full, like after a nice meal. More like… stuffed. Even if I haven’t eaten much. It’s kinda worrying, to be honest. I still get hungry, mind you, but then just a little food and… boom. Done.
DOCTOR: I see. And is this fullness accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my stomach feels a bit… queasy, I guess. Not sick, exactly. Just unsettled. And sometimes I burp a lot. My wife says I sound like a walrus. But that could just be old age, eh? No pain, though. No heartburn or anything like that.
DOCTOR: No pain, no heartburn. Just fullness and occasional queasiness, with some… increased burping. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – anything different regarding frequency, consistency, or colour?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. I… I suppose things are a little more regular than they used to be. Not a bad thing, really. I’ve always had a bit of trouble that way, if you catch my drift. And no, nothing… different about what comes out, if you don’t mind me being blunt. Just… more of it, maybe? But regular. That’s the key word. Regular.
DOCTOR: Regular is good. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: That’s a good question too. I… I think so, yeah. My wife's been saying my pants are a bit loose. I haven't weighed myself, but I reckon I've lost a few pounds. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. She keeps trying to feed me more, poor woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me a bit about your appetite generally?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I do get hungry. It's just… it doesn't last. I'll feel hungry, start eating, and then after a few bites, I just… lose it. Like there's a switch that flips. It’s frustrating, ‘cause I like my food. Always have. Used to be a big fisherman, you know? Fresh salmon, halibut… But these days, it just doesn't hold the same appeal. I try to eat, but it's not enjoyable anymore, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss of appetite and enjoyment of food can be quite distressing. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Had a bit of trouble with my knees when I was younger, played a lot of sports, you see. Got ‘em fixed up years ago. And the usual things, colds, flu… nothing major, mind you. Never been in hospital, thankfully. And I don’t take any regular medication. Just the occasional painkiller for my knees if they act up. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out maybe twenty years ago now. But that was a long time back, and I recovered fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, knees, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks, though, before I try anything new. She’s a cautious one. Good woman. No allergies. Definitely not. And I haven't had any recent surgeries or hospital stays, like I said. Just the gallbladder years ago.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, concerning your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like stomach cancer, digestive disorders, or any other illnesses that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be 92, healthy as a horse, practically. My father… well, he wasn’t around much. Died young, heart trouble, I think. On my wife’s side… her grandmother had something with her stomach, maybe ulcers. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about it, to be honest. We didn't talk about medical things much in those days. It wasn’t really the done thing. So, not really, no. Nothing major that I’m aware of. A lot of folks just… lived and died of old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, regarding your social history, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no to all of that. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife doesn’t approve, and frankly, I don’t see the point. A little glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe a celebration, but that’s about it. And definitely no drugs. Not my cup of tea at all. Always been a pretty straight-laced fella, I reckon. Fishing and a good book are enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. Primarily, I want to listen to your abdomen and feel for any abnormalities. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm an old man, everything creaks a little. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Try to relax and breathe normally. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, though slightly diminished. There is some mild tenderness in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rigidity. No palpable masses detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Well, Mr. Obarr, physically, there aren't any glaring concerns. However, your symptoms – the early fullness, nausea, weight loss, and diminished appetite – along with the mild tenderness in the epigastric region, are suggestive of several possibilities. Given your age and the lack of any immediate red flags, I’m leaning towards a few things. It could be early signs of gastritis, a mild stomach ulcer, or potentially, something related to reduced stomach capacity. It is also possible that this is related to changes in your digestive function as a result of aging.
PATIENT: Gastritis? Ulcer? Sounds… serious. Is that… bad? What does that even mean? And what do we do about it? I’d rather not be cut open, if you don’t mind. And what about the weight loss? Should I be forcing myself to eat more? My wife will be thrilled if I say yes, but… it doesn’t feel right, you know?
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Obarr, let’s not jump to conclusions. While those possibilities are on the table, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything severe. Gastritis is simply inflammation of the stomach lining, and while it can be uncomfortable, it is often treatable with medication and dietary changes. An ulcer is a sore in the stomach lining, and it also can be treated. However, before we start any treatment, I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I want to run a complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia, which can sometimes occur with gastritis or ulcers. I also want to order a stool test to rule out any infection. And, most importantly, I want to schedule an upper endoscopy – a simple procedure where we insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and take a small biopsy if necessary. The endoscopy will allow us to definitively diagnose the cause of your symptoms and rule out anything more serious, such as stomach cancer. It is the most accurate way to determine what is going on. It is generally well-tolerated, and you would be given sedation to keep you comfortable during the procedure. Regarding the weight loss, I do not recommend forcing yourself to eat if you are not hungry. That can actually make things worse. Instead, let’s focus on eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding foods that aggravate your symptoms. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: An endoscopy… that sounds a bit scary, to be honest. A camera down my throat? And a biopsy? Is that… painful? I’ve never had anything like that before. Look, I’m not opposed to tests, but… is there anything else we can try first? Maybe some medicine to see if that helps? I'm not a fan of invasive procedures if we don't absolutely need them. And what about the stool test? That sounds… less frightening, at least.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Obarr. It’s perfectly natural to feel uneasy about an endoscopy, especially if you’ve never had one before. The procedure itself is quite quick, and the sedation ensures you’ll be comfortable and won't feel any pain. The biopsy is also typically painless – you won’t even notice it happening. We can start with some medication to see if that helps alleviate your symptoms. I’m thinking a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to reduce stomach acid production. This might help with the fullness and nausea. We can also try an antacid to provide some immediate relief. I will write you a prescription for both. However, it's important to understand that medication only treats the symptoms, it doesn't address the underlying cause. If your symptoms don’t improve with medication within a couple of weeks, or if they worsen, we will need to proceed with the endoscopy. We will also proceed with the stool test to rule out any infection. I’ll give you the necessary collection kit and instructions. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better. Medication first, and then the endoscopy if it doesn’t work. And the stool test, yes. That's manageable. Thank goodness. I just don’t like the idea of poking around inside my stomach if we don’t have to. What kind of things should I be eating, or not eating, while I’m on the medication? Should I avoid spicy foods? Coffee? My wife makes a lovely curry, but I suppose I should stay away from that for a while, eh? And what about alcohol? Can I still have a little glass of wine with dinner?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That is a very reasonable approach. Now, regarding diet, while you’re on the medication, it’s best to avoid foods that can irritate the stomach lining. That includes spicy foods, acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomatoes, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty, greasy foods. Coffee, yes, it's best to avoid that for now. As for your wife's lovely curry, unfortunately, it's best to abstain from that for a couple of weeks. Focus on bland, easily digestible foods like rice, toast, boiled potatoes, chicken, and fish. Smaller, more frequent meals are also recommended. As for alcohol, I would recommend avoiding it completely while you're on the medication. It can interfere with the medication's effectiveness and irritate your stomach. Once your symptoms have resolved, you can discuss with me whether a small glass of wine with dinner is permissible. I will also provide you with a written list of dietary recommendations, as well as information about potential side effects of the medication. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Bland food, no spice, no coffee, no alcohol… it sounds like a pretty boring diet, but I suppose it’s better than being poked and prodded. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I guess I’ll go home and start making a grocery list. And try to convince my wife that curry is off the menu for a while. That might be the hardest part.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could reassure you. And yes, convincing your wife might be a challenge, but I’m confident you can manage. Here are the instructions and recommendations. Please read them carefully. If your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact my office immediately. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. Get well soon, Mr. Obarr. And try to enjoy the bland food as much as possible.
