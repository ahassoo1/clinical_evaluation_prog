DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bloating. Look, I don’t have time for a long chat, alright? Just… my stomach’s puffed up. Feels like I swallowed a beach ball. Been happening on and off for a few weeks, I guess. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And it feels like a… beach ball, alright. Can you describe when this bloating occurs?
PATIENT: Ugh, when? Seriously? I eat, sometimes. Or don’t eat. I don’t know! It just… happens. Look, I work hard, okay? Pile driving isn’t exactly a thinking man’s job. I eat when I can, whatever’s quick. It doesn’t matter when I eat, it just… swells up. Is that good enough? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, it’s not reliably linked to specific meals. And it's been happening for a few weeks regardless of what you’ve eaten. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I feel… normal, I guess, besides the stomach thing. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just from the job. I don't go looking for problems, you know? If it ain’t broke... I don't need a list of things to worry about. Is this going to take long? My lunch break doesn't last forever.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other specific symptoms you've noticed. Let's try to be a little more specific, then. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to, alright? What kind of question is that? Is this some kind of joke? I don't track my… output. Seriously. I'm a grown man. I don't need to analyze my… stuff. Can we just get to the part where you tell me what's wrong and how to fix it? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand you're busy, but I need information to determine what's causing your discomfort. Changes in bowel habits—frequency, consistency, any pain or blood—can be very telling. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Look, I told you, I don’t look at my… stuff! Why are you asking me this? This is ridiculous. I’m starting to feel uncomfortable. I just know my stomach gets big and it’s annoying. What am I supposed to do, pull out a microscope after every trip to the bathroom? I work with heavy machinery, not… this. I need a quick answer, not a colonoscopy. Honestly. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Since you're unwilling to provide further details regarding your bowel habits, and you report no other associated symptoms... We'll proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and palpate it to check for any tenderness or masses.
