DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, pleasure’s all mine, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. Military thing. Need to get it done. They said I gotta come here first. Don't really understand why a doctor needs to be involved, but rules are rules, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Often these examinations require a medical professional to ensure a baseline assessment and to document your overall health status. It’s quite standard, even if it seems a bit… roundabout. So, to begin, could you tell me a little more about this military requirement?
PATIENT: It's for the… uh, the Rangers. My boy, Lars, he’s already in. Says it's good work, good money. I thought, why not? Always been strong, always been good with machines. Worked on engines my whole life. But they need this… paper. From a doctor. Says I gotta be… fit. I am fit. I lift things all day. Heavy things.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Hartness. It’s commendable that you’re pursuing this opportunity. And your experience with machinery certainly sounds valuable. To get a clearer picture for the documentation, could you elaborate on what specifically this examination requires us to assess?
PATIENT: Assess? Look, I don't know! They just handed me a form. Says… height, weight, blood pressure, eyesight, hearing. Usual stuff, I reckon. They want to make sure I’m not gonna fall apart after a week of… running around. Honestly, it seems like a waste of time. I know I can handle it. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It does seem redundant when you know your own capabilities. But having a documented baseline is important for their records, and it can be helpful if any issues were to arise during training. We'll certainly try to be as efficient as possible. Let's start with some basic measurements, then we can discuss your medical history a little further. First, I see we have your height and weight recorded as 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Six foot two, and… well, I don't know exactly in those fancy units. But that’s me. Always been lean. Good for working on engines, you see. Need to be able to squeeze into tight spaces. So, what now? You gonna poke me with needles?
DOCTOR: No needles at this stage, Mr. Hartness. We’ll start with your blood pressure and a brief examination of your eyesight and hearing. Just routine checks. If you could just have a seat here, please. We'll take your blood pressure first. It's a simple procedure, and it will only take a moment. Do you have any known history of high blood pressure or any concerns about your heart health?
PATIENT: Nah, never had any trouble with that. My old man had a bit of a dodgy ticker, but I got his build, not his heart. Strong as an ox, I tell ya. Just get on with it, eh? Don't want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Very good. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s within the normal range. Now, let’s check your eyesight. Could you please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Right, right. I can see just fine. Always could. A… P… D… 7… 4… L… F… See? Perfect. Don't need glasses or any of that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Hartness. Your visual acuity is 20/20. Very good indeed. Now, let's quickly check your hearing. I’m going to place these headphones on, and you’ll just let me know when you hear a tone. It will be a simple beep. We'll do it in each ear separately. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Beep away. I work around loud machinery all day, you know. My ears are probably tougher than most. Don't expect much of a reaction. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I’m starting with the right ear. Can you hear the tone?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I hear it. Quiet, but I hear it. What frequency is it? Is it one of those high-pitched ones young people can hear? I bet it’s one of those.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard frequency used for screening, Mr. Hartness. We’ll test a range of frequencies just to get a complete picture. Alright, that’s the hearing test complete. Your hearing appears to be within normal limits in both ears. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Not much to tell, really. Never been one for doctors. Had the usual childhood stuff – measles, mumps, chickenpox. Got over 'em all. Broke my arm once when I was a lad, falling out of a tree. That’s about it. Work hard, eat reasonably, sleep enough. That’s my medical history.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Hartness. No significant medical issues or surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I told ya, I'm a tough Swede. Well… there was that time I pulled a muscle in my back lifting an engine block. But I fixed it myself. Rubbed it with some liniment and got back to work. Doesn't count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, I wouldn’t necessarily consider that a significant medical issue requiring treatment. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah. Don't take anything. Waste of money, mostly. Maybe a painkiller if I really mess something up at work, but that's rare. And it's just… ibuprofen, or something. Whatever’s in the little orange bottle. Healthy as a horse, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. Don't even get hay fever. My wife's always sneezing, poor thing, but I'm fine. Honestly, I think she makes it up sometimes, just to get attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? My old man died of a heart attack, like I said. Worked too hard, I reckon. My mother lived to a good age, but she wasn't very… strong. Always complaining about something. And my brother… he’s alright. Works in an office somewhere. Not much to say about him. Not a particularly exciting family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hartness. Now, finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work. I fix engines. I come home. I eat dinner with the wife. I sleep. Sometimes I watch TV. I don't drink much, maybe a beer or two on the weekend. Don’t smoke. Is this really necessary? Seems like a lot of questions for a simple exam.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. These questions help me get a complete picture of your health status and ensure that you meet the requirements for the examination. Now, just one final question. Do you have any concerns or anything you'd like to discuss with me today?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just want this over with so I can get back to work. I got a customer's engine that needs fixing. So, am I good to go? Can I sign something and be on my way?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Based on the information you’ve provided and the brief examination I’ve conducted, you appear to be in good overall health. I’ll document my findings here. Blood pressure is 130/80, visual acuity is 20/20, and hearing is within normal limits. No significant medical history or allergies reported. If you could just sign here, please. This confirms that you’ve provided accurate information and that I’ve conducted a basic health assessment. However, given your father’s history of heart disease, I would recommend a basic cardiovascular screening with your primary care physician within the next year, just as a precaution. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Nah, that’s alright. I don't need referrals. I'm fine. Just sign it, and let's be done with this. Thanks for your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Here is a copy for your records. You appear to be fit for duty, based on this assessment. I wish you all the best with your training. If you experience any changes in your health or have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to consult with a healthcare professional. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Nope. That's everything. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hartness. Have a good day, and be safe. .
