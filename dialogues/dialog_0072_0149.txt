DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 83 years young. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Eighty-three, is it? Seems like yesterday I was… well, never you mind. Look, I don’t really do doctors, you see. Never have. All that poking and prodding… and for what? I just want to be left alone, mostly. I heard you were new in town, and thought I'd just… get this over with. My niece insisted. Said I needed a check-up. Honestly, I feel fine. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s good you came in, even if it was at the insistence of your niece. Preventative care is important, regardless of how well one feels. And I assure you, I’ll do my best to make this as… efficient as possible. "Perfectly fine" is rather subjective, however. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What's to elaborate on? I get up, I eat, I watch my stories… I don’t go climbing mountains, if that’s what you’re asking. I just… am. I haven’t been sick a day in my life, not really. A little ache here and there, what do you expect at my age? It’s just… I don’t trust all this modern medicine. All those pills and procedures… I prefer my herbal teas, thank you very much. And a good night’s sleep. That’s what keeps a person going. Not poking and prodding! Honestly, it's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: While I respect your preference for natural remedies, Ms. Gunasekara, it's important to rule out any underlying issues that might be contributing to even minor discomforts, or that could become problematic down the line. “A little ache here and there” can sometimes indicate something more significant. To get a clearer picture, I need to ask some questions, if you don’t mind. It’s standard procedure. Let's start with any changes you have noticed, however small, in your daily routine. Anything at all?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, goodness, where do I even begin? Everything changes, darling. The world changes, I change… It’s the nature of things. Let me think… well, I used to be able to get up and down the stairs without… you know, thinking about it. Now I have to… brace myself a little. Does that count? And my stories aren’t quite as good on television anymore. Too much shouting. Honestly, it’s a terrible world these days. But as for me changing… well, I’m just getting older, naturally. Is that what you want to know? Don’t tell me you're going to ask me about my bowels now. I won't answer that.
DOCTOR: Bracing yourself on the stairs is relevant, Ms. Gunasekara. That indicates a potential change in strength or balance, which we should investigate. And I assure you, I will not delve into unnecessary specifics at this time. Let's focus on the stairs for a moment. Has this been a gradual change, or did it happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been… gradual. Very gradual. Like the tide, you know? Slowly creeping in. I didn't even notice it at first. Just a little… hesitation. Then a little more. And now… well, now I use the railing. A lot. It’s not a big deal! People get older! My feet… they aren’t what they used to be either. They ache something awful after I’ve been on them all day. But I’ve always had good feet. I was a podiatrist, you know. For many, many years. Though that was a lifetime ago… I don’t even remember the name of the practice anymore. Honestly, it's all a blur.
DOCTOR: A podiatrist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, darling. A very good one, if I do say so myself. Though that was… well, a long time ago. Before all this… modern nonsense. We used to do things properly. No fancy machines, just… hands and a good eye. Though, I suppose even I had to use some tools. But it was different back then. People took care of their feet. They didn't wear those ridiculous high heels and expect miracles. Honestly, it's a wonder anyone can walk anymore! Though, I suppose you see all that. Being a doctor and all. Are you a good one? I haven’t had much luck with doctors, as I said. Always trying to poke and prod.
DOCTOR: I strive to be, Ms. Gunasekara. And I appreciate your perspective, having been a podiatrist yourself. It gives me a unique understanding of your concerns. Let’s return to your current health. Aside from the aching feet and the difficulty with the stairs, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, your sleep, or your energy levels?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite... well, it comes and goes, doesn't it? I don't eat as much as I used to, truthfully. Not much call for it. Everything tastes… bland, these days. Sleep… that's a bit better. Though I wake up a lot in the night. Thinking. Always thinking. And energy… well, what energy? I mostly sit and watch my stories. It's enough, really. I don't need to be running marathons. Honestly, it’s all just… slowing down. That’s what happens when you get old. You slow down. It’s not a disease, you know. It's just… life. Do you need to write all this down? It seems like a lot of bother, frankly.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, Ms. Gunasekara, but these details are important. Waking up at night can be caused by a variety of factors, and changes in appetite can be… indicative. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, goodness, probably. I haven’t weighed myself in… well, I don't even remember the last time. I suppose I’m thinner than I used to be. My clothes are a bit… looser. But I’m not worried about it. I’ve always been… slender. It's just… aging, naturally. Honestly, I don’t obsess over such things. A little weight loss never hurt anyone. It’s all just… gravity, darling. Taking its toll. Do you really need to know all this? It's making me feel rather… scrutinized.
DOCTOR: It’s my job to ask these questions, Ms. Gunasekara. Even if you don’t feel it’s important, it helps me get a complete picture of your health. Unintentional weight loss, even a small amount, can sometimes be a sign of an underlying issue. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now you're talking. That was a lifetime ago… honestly, I barely remember. I saw doctors, of course. When I was younger. For… things. But chronic conditions? I don’t think so. Maybe… a little high blood pressure, once. But it wasn’t anything serious. They gave me a little pill. I took it for a while. Then I stopped. Honestly, I don't like taking pills. They make me feel… foggy. My niece keeps trying to get me to take all sorts of medications, but I refuse. I prefer my herbal teas, thank you very much. And a good night’s sleep. Honestly, I can't remember the names of any of the conditions. It was all so long ago… and I wasn't paying much attention, truthfully. I was too busy taking care of other people’s feet. Do you really need to know all this? It's making my head spin.
DOCTOR: It’s alright if you don’t remember specifics, Ms. Gunasekara. We can try to obtain your records from your previous physicians, if you're amenable. That might provide some clarity. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Vitamins, yes. I take a little multivitamin every morning. For… general health. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take a little ibuprofen. But not very often. Honestly, I try to avoid medications as much as possible. My niece keeps leaving all sorts of pills on my counter, but I ignore them. She worries too much. Honestly, I think she just wants me to be… more manageable. She thinks she knows what’s best for me. But I’ve been taking care of myself for eighty-three years, thank you very much. Do you really need to know about every little vitamin I take? It seems rather… excessive. I think I'd rather just go home now. Honestly, this is all very tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara, and I respect your independence. However, even seemingly insignificant details, such as vitamin use, can be relevant to your overall health. Now, before we conclude, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick assessment of your reflexes and strength. It will be quick and painless. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. I knew it. I knew it would come to this. Poking and prodding? After all this talking? I told you I don't do doctors. Honestly, it's an invasion of privacy. And I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I don't need anyone listening to my heart or checking my reflexes. I've lived a long life, and I've taken care of myself. I don't need your examination. No, absolutely not. I think I’ll just… leave now. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. I should have known better.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I understand your decision. However, I would strongly encourage you to reconsider. Even a brief examination can provide valuable information. If you change your mind, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Here is my card. It has the clinic’s contact information. I wish you good health. .
