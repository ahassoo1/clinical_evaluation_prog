DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re kinda painful, and red. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins, red and painful. And you said it’s been going on for a “little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little while. Maybe… three, four weeks now? It's hard to say exactly. Time flies when you’re getting old, you know? It didn’t start all at once, either. Just a couple at first, and then more kept popping up.
DOCTOR: Right, so starting slowly, over the last three or four weeks. Any specific activities that you were doing around the time they first appeared?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific activities? Not that I can think of, really. I do a bit of gardening, but I’ve been doing that for years. And I help my wife with some things around the house, you know, moving boxes and stuff. Nothing too strenuous. I don’t recall doing anything different around when they started. Maybe just… the usual.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are the bumps getting bigger?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. They were smaller at first, like little pimples almost. Now they're… well, they’re definitely noticeable. Not huge, but you can see ‘em. And they hurt more now too, if I bump them or something. They're kinda sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no chills. My legs don’t feel warm to the touch, just the bumps are sore. No swelling, either. I haven’t felt sick or anything like that. Just the pain from these… things. I’m not sure if this matters, but my wife says they look kinda itchy. But I don’t really feel itchy, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no systemic symptoms like fever or chills, no warmth or swelling, and your wife has noted they look itchy, though you don’t personally experience itchiness. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions, like diabetes or circulatory problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see… I don’t have diabetes, no. And my circulation’s alright, I think. I walk every morning with my wife, if that counts for anything. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got that under control with some medicine years ago. I take a pill for it, every day. Aside from that… not much, really. I'm a pretty healthy guy for my age, I think. Medicare covers everything, so I see the doctor when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so controlled hypertension, managed with medication. Good. And are you taking any other medications besides that one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one. A little white pill. I think it’s… amlodipine, is that right? My wife helps me keep track of things. I just take that one every morning with breakfast. No creams, no supplements, nothing else. I try to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife is allergic to shellfish, but that's her problem, not mine! I can eat just about anything. I don't have any problems with poison ivy or bee stings or anything like that, either. I think I'm pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to take a quick look at your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go right ahead. They’re probably not a pretty sight, but you're the doctor!
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a cluster of erythematous papules and nodules on your bilateral shins. They appear somewhat tender to the touch. There's no significant warmth or edema. No broken skin or signs of infection at this time. Based on what you've told me and my examination, this could be a number of things, but given the appearance and your history, it’s most likely stasis dermatitis. Are you aware of any history of venous insufficiency or swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: Stasis… what now? Venous insuf… you’re losing me a little, Doctor. Swelling? Not really. My legs maybe get a little tired after a long walk, but no real swelling. My wife always tells me to put my feet up after walking, says it’ll help, but I never really thought much of it. Is that… bad? Does that mean something is wrong with my legs?
DOCTOR: It means your veins might not be working as efficiently as they used to, which can cause some fluid to build up in your legs. It's very common as we get older, Mr. Aluia, and not necessarily a serious concern, but it can lead to these kinds of skin changes. The tiredness you feel and your wife suggesting elevating your feet is a good sign she's observant! To be sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a simple ultrasound of your legs to check the blood flow. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… okay. If you think it’s best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Yes, go ahead and do that. It doesn’t sound… painful, does it? And will Medicare cover that? I just don't want to get stuck with a big bill.
DOCTOR: No, it's completely painless, Mr. Aluia. It uses sound waves to create an image of the veins, so there's no radiation or needles involved. And yes, Medicare should cover it, but we’ll double-check with your insurance just to be certain. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you elevate your legs whenever possible, especially after walking, and we can try a topical corticosteroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and itching. We’ll see how that goes, and once we have the ultrasound results, we’ll discuss further treatment options if needed. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Elevate my legs, cream… I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear I'm finally listening to her! So, just the cream and the ultrasound for now? No need for anything stronger until we see the results?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Let’s start with the cream and the ultrasound. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse get you set up with a prescription for the cream and schedule you for the ultrasound. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
