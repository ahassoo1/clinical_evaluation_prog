DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Pfennig, you say? Lovely name. Well, now… what did bring me in… Hmm. It's my ears, I think. They just don’t… hear so good anymore. It’s been gettin’ worse, slowly, you know? Not sure how long, exactly. Everything sounds a bit muffled.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty, I understand. You've noticed a gradual decrease in your hearing, and things sound muffled. That’s a very common concern, especially as we get older. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me, is it both ears, or is it worse in one than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a good question. Let me think… I think… both, maybe? Hard to say. Sometimes the left one feels a bit quieter, but then again, maybe not. It changes, you know? It’s not constant. I mostly notice it when people aren’t speakin’ so loud. Or when there’s a lot of… background noise. Like the television.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it affects both ears, but it’s fluctuating and seems worse with softer sounds or when there’s a lot of noise around. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now that’s a thought. Sometimes, yeah. A little bit. Not all the time, mind you. More like… a faint hum, I suppose. Like… an old refrigerator, maybe? It comes and goes. Doesn't bother me too much, but it’s there sometimes, especially when it’s quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright, a faint humming sound, especially in quiet environments. Good to know. Now, has anything specific happened that you can think of that might have triggered this, or has it just come on gradually?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Triggered… That’s a tough one. I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, a long, long time. Lots of machines. Very noisy. Maybe that had something to do with it? But it was so long ago. I couldn’t say for sure. It just… slowly got worse, as far as I can remember. Nothing sudden, nothin' like a bang or anything. Just… faded.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of working in a noisy environment – a shoe factory – which is definitely something we should consider. And it sounds like it was a gradual decline in hearing, not related to a specific incident. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you had any ear infections, pain in your ears, or any drainage from your ears recently or in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Oh, dear… when I was a little girl, maybe? I think so. But it was a long time ago. Not as an adult, no. No pain or drainin’ or anything like that. Just… the hearin’ gettin’ worse. I’ve never had any trouble with ear pain, not that I recall. I get a bit of wax build up now and then, but that’s about it. My sister used to try and clean ‘em for me with those little cotton swabs, but I didn’t like that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent ear infections, pain, or drainage. Just some wax buildup. That’s good information. And you prefer to avoid cleaning your ears with cotton swabs, which is smart, as they can sometimes push the wax further in. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy a few times, and it was a bit high, they said. They wanted me to watch my salt, but I don't always remember. And… my knees are bad. Arthritis, the doctor said. Makes it hard to get around sometimes. Other than that… I don’t really know. I don’t go to the doctor much. I mostly just take a few pills for my knees, and somethin’ for my water. That’s about it. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, arthritis in your knees, and you take medication for both. And you have Medicare, thank you for letting me know. Now, what medications are you currently taking for your knees and water, if you happen to know the names?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… the names… Let me see… this one is… Aleve, for my knees. Two of them every morning. And this one… Furosemide. That’s for the water, the doctor said. One of those every day too. Little white pill. I take ‘em with my breakfast. That’s all I can remember right now. I used to have a list, but I can’t find it anywhere. It’s probably lost.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aleve for arthritis and Furosemide for water retention. That's very helpful. Now, just a few more quick questions before I do a quick exam of your ears. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh, goodness. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin’, not that I recall. I eat most things, and I haven't had any trouble with pills or anything like that. My sister was allergic to bee stings, but that’s not me. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Never been bothered by cats or dogs either. I used to have a little poodle, and he was lovely.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, Betty, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope. It won't hurt. I just need you to sit still and let me take a peek. Can you tell me if you've had any dizziness or balance problems recently?
PATIENT: Dizziness… Oh, now that is a good question. Not really, no. Not lately. I get a bit unsteady sometimes, especially when I stand up too fast, but I just put that down to my age. And my knees, of course. They make me a bit wobbly. But not proper dizziness, not like spinnin’ or anything. Just a bit unsteady sometimes. Mostly when I get up quick. I haven’t fallen or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional unsteadiness when standing up quickly, but no true dizziness or falls. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Betty, I’m looking in your ears now. I see some wax buildup in both ears, which is common. The ear canals themselves look normal, no signs of infection or inflammation. The eardrums… appear a little dull, which can be a sign of fluid behind the ear. It's hard to tell definitively without a hearing test, but it could be contributing to your hearing loss. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a general picture. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your reflexes. Those are normal as well.
PATIENT: Oh, my. You're very thorough, dear. Fluid behind the ear, you say? Is that bad? I always feel a bit foolish when people listen to my heart and lungs. Makes me feel like I’m a little boy again, gettin’ checked up by the school nurse. Dull eardrums… what does that mean, exactly? Is it somethin’ serious? I just want to hear again, you know? It’s hard to hear my grandkids when they come to visit.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Betty. It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit anxious when you’re not sure what’s going on. “Dull” eardrums can mean a few things. In your case, it suggests there might be a small amount of fluid buildup in the middle ear, which can happen with age or sometimes with minor congestion. It’s not necessarily serious, but it can affect your hearing. It’s the reason I’d like to recommend a hearing test, just to get a clearer picture of the extent of your hearing loss and where the problem lies. We can also discuss options for wax removal if you’d like. Sometimes, removing the wax can improve hearing on its own. Do you have any questions about the hearing test?
PATIENT: A hearing test… That sounds sensible, dear. If it helps to know what’s goin’ on, then I’m happy to do it. Where would I go for that? And how long does it take? I don’t want to be gone all day. And… will it hurt? I don’t like things pokin’ around in my ears. I’m a bit sensitive, you see. And what about the wax? Is it something you can do here, at the clinic?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Betty. I'm happy to answer all your questions. The hearing test is done at the audiology department, which is just down the hall. It usually takes about an hour, maybe a little longer, depending on how much testing we need to do. It’s a completely painless test. They’ll have you wear headphones and listen for beeps at different volumes. They won’t poke anything in your ears, just place small earplugs to block out external noise. As for the wax, yes, we can remove it here at the clinic. We can use a special irrigation system to gently flush it out, or I can use a small instrument to carefully remove it. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. It can be a little uncomfortable, but not painful. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule both the hearing test and a wax removal appointment for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright, dear. No pokin’ is good. And 15-20 minutes for the wax, that’s not too bad. Yes, please. Go ahead and schedule both appointments. Whatever day is easiest, I’m pretty flexible. I just want to hear again, you know? It’s hard to follow conversations, and I don't want to miss anything my grandkids say. They grow up so fast. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I’m happy to help. Okay, I’ve scheduled you for a hearing test next Tuesday at 10:00 AM with the audiologist, and a wax removal appointment for Thursday at 2:00 PM here at the clinic. The audiologist will give you specific instructions when they call to confirm the appointment, but generally, you just need to arrive a few minutes early to fill out some paperwork. Here’s a printout with the appointment details and the audiologist’s phone number. In the meantime, try to avoid getting water in your ears. If you experience any sudden pain, drainage, or dizziness, please call us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, dear. Thank you again for bein’ so patient and explainin’ everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old woman like me. I’ll see you next Tuesday, then. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Betty. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointments. Have a good day, and I'll see you next Tuesday.
