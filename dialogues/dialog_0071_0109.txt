DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Or, is it Mitchell?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor... Galena, yes? Mitchell is fine. Please, call me Mitchell. It’s nice to meet you. I have… a bad headache, in the back of my head. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mitchell. Galena is right. A headache, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. In the back. Right… here. Not a… throbbing headache. More like a… heavy weight. It doesn’t go away, you see? Even when I lie down. It just… is there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant pressure at the base of your skull. And it doesn’t ease with rest?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Maybe… a little bit when I’m sleeping, but not much. I used to work with the trains, you know. Rail yard. Lots of… shaking. Maybe it’s from that? I don’t know. I'm old, now. Things break.
DOCTOR: You worked on the trains… I see. A lot of vibration, you're right. We should explore that possibility, certainly. And you are absolutely right to get it checked out. Now, has anything else changed since this headache started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, I don’t think. No… dizziness. Eating is… okay. A little less hungry, maybe. But I don't have a big appetite these days, anyway. And… no blurry vision. Oh! My wife… she always said I snore. Maybe I’m snoring more now? She passed last year, so I don’t know for sure. But I remember her complaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no dizziness, appetite a bit reduced… and a possible increase in snoring. Thank you, Mitchell. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the headache. Not in my neck, not in my shoulders. Not anywhere. It’s just… back here. Sometimes, when I bend over to tie my shoes, it feels… worse for a moment. But it goes away quick. Just a little… whoosh of pain. Not a big pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any issues with your balance lately?
PATIENT: Balance? Hmm… Not really, I guess. I walk a little slower than I used to, but that's just getting old, right? No falling, no… spinning feelings. I go to church every Sunday, and I haven’t tripped over anything yet! But… sometimes, when I turn my head very quickly, I feel a little… off. Just for a second. But maybe that's just me being old, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a brief sensation with quick head turns. Thank you. Now, Mitchell, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Doctor, I was a railroad man! We got checked up all the time. High blood pressure, yes, a long time ago. They gave me pills for it, for many years. I stopped taking them… maybe five years ago? The doctor… the one before this one… he said it was okay. Said my numbers were good enough. Diabetes? No, never. Heart problems… they did some tests once, said my heart was a little… big. But nothing bad, they said. Just big. Like everything else on a railroad man!
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you recall what kind of tests they did for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. They… made me walk on a… a moving belt. A fast belt. And they stuck things on my chest. And they took pictures. Lots of pictures. And they… listened to my heart with… that thing. The cold metal thing. It wasn’t painful, just… a lot of poking and prodding. I was young then. A long time ago. I don’t remember much else, honestly. Just that they said it was okay. They said my heart was… strong, for a big heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. And currently, Mitchell, do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations – a racing or fluttering heart?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No chest pain. Not even a little bit. Shortness of breath… well, I get tired walking up hills. But that’s just old age, right? And… palpitations? I don’t know what that means. My heart… beats normally, I think. Sometimes it feels… a little fast when I’m nervous. But I get nervous easy these days! But no fluttering, no racing. Just… a regular, old man’s heart. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just a look in your ears, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Anything you need to do. I trust you. Go ahead. Just… try not to poke too hard! My skin is… thin these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mitchell. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit of a murmur. Not concerning at this point, but something we should keep an eye on. Lungs are clear. Ears look good, no wax buildup. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are… a little diminished, which is common at your age. No tenderness or swelling in your neck. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. This is just to check your eye movements.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. It’s a little hard… sometimes my vision gets blurry. Especially when I’m tired. But I’m following it, yes? I used to have good eyes… when I was a railroad man, I could spot a broken rail from a mile away! But… that was a long time ago. This headache is getting worse, you know. Just a little bit. A heavy, dull ache. It's… always there.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mitchell. I've noticed you mentioning the headache is getting worse. And you said your vision is a bit blurry?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s just… it comes and goes. Mostly when I’m tired, or when I look at something up close. Like… reading the newspaper. It’s all blurry then. And the headache… it’s like a weight on the back of my head. It doesn’t throb, it just… is. And it’s getting heavier. Just a little bit. I don’t like it, you know. It worries me. It’s… different than the headaches I used to get.
DOCTOR: Mitchell, given your headache worsening, the blurry vision, and your history of high blood pressure… I'm going to recommend a CT scan of your head. It's a quick scan, and it will help us to see if there's anything causing the headache, like bleeding or swelling. It’s important to rule out anything serious. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… serious, Doctor. But… if you think it’s important, then yes. Do what you need to do. Allergies? No, I don’t think so. Never had any problems with… medicine. I took pills for my blood pressure for years. And… they gave me shots when I was a railroad man. All sorts of shots! Never had a reaction. But… I haven’t had a lot of medicine lately. My wife… she always took care of that. Now, it’s just me. So, a CT scan. Yes. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. That’s good to know about the allergies. And I’m so sorry for your loss. It's understandable that things feel different now. We'll get you scheduled for the CT scan as soon as possible. It will take about 20-30 minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a medication to help with the headache. It’s not a long-term solution, but it will hopefully give you some relief while we wait for the scan results. We also need to follow up with a neurologist to discuss the results and what to do next. I will give you a referral to a good one in the area. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. A neurologist… yes. Anything you think is best. A prescription for the headache… that would be good. Thank you. I just want it to stop. This… heavy weight. It’s always there. And the blurry vision… it scares me, you know. I like to read the newspaper. It’s… how I keep up with things. You think it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: Mitchell, it's good we're getting this checked out. The headache and blurry vision could be caused by many things, some are more serious than others. That’s why we need to do the CT scan and see a neurologist. I don’t want to worry you unnecessarily, but it's important to rule out anything serious. For now, let’s focus on getting you the medication for the headache and scheduling the scan. We'll have more information once we get the results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes sense. Rule out… anything serious. That’s good. Just… tell me if it’s something bad. I’d rather know, you know? Even if it’s… not good. Okay. Medication… and the scan. Let’s do it. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. Is there… anything else I need to do? Any special preparation for the scan?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mitchell. You've been very brave through all of this. For the CT scan, you don’t need to do any special preparation. Just come as you are. You might be asked to remove any jewelry or metal objects. And they may give you a contrast dye through an IV to help get a clearer picture. It’s a quick process. I’m writing down the name of the radiology center and the neurologist’s office here for you. Do you have any questions about anything we've discussed today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… you explained everything very clearly. The radiology center… and the neurologist. I’ll make the appointments. Thank you again. For everything. You’re a good doctor. I just… hope it’s nothing serious. I think… that’s all. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mitchell, you can go now. Please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, we’re here to help you. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
