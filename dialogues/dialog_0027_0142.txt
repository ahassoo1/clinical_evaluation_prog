DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Good to meet you too. Right… well, I've been getting these headaches. Pretty bad ones, actually. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart kinda races. It’s been happening on and off for… I don't know exactly how long. A while, I guess. I just figured it was stress, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, with sweating and a racing heart… I see. And you said “on and off for a while.” Could you try to be a little more specific about that “while”?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that's the thing. It’s hard to remember. Maybe… a few months? Or longer? It's not constant, like, every day. More like… a couple times a month, maybe? Sometimes a week goes by and I'm fine, then suddenly bam. It’s really frustrating ‘cause it just kinda… happens. I don't really know what sets it off, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few months, a couple times a month… intermittent headaches. And no clear triggers you’ve noticed. Okay. Now, when these headaches happen, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. It's not like a normal headache, you know? It’s… throbbing, mostly. Like, really bad pulsing in my head. It usually starts behind my eyes, I think, then spreads all over. And it feels… intense. Like, I really have to lie down. And it’s not just my head, either. My neck gets stiff, too. It's just… awful, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, throbbing, starts behind the eyes, spreads, neck stiffness… I’m writing all this down. Do you experience any other symptoms with the headache?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Thinking about it… sometimes I feel kinda sick to my stomach when it starts. Not always, but often enough. And I definitely get sensitive to light. Really sensitive. I have to close the curtains and just lie in the dark. And… I don't know if this makes sense, but everything just feels… off. Like blurry vision maybe? Not completely blurry, but not right. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, sensitivity to light, and some visual disturbances... that's helpful. Now, have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Ugh… nothing really makes it better, to be honest. Lying down in a dark room helps a little, but it still takes a while to go away. I've tried taking some over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don't really touch it. As for worse… I don't know. I haven’t noticed anything specific. Stress, maybe? But I’m always a little stressed, so it’s hard to say. I did have one really bad one after… well, after my divorce. But I don’t know if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dark rooms provide some relief, but not a full solution. Over-the-counter medications aren’t effective. And a particularly bad headache following your divorce… we’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you had any other medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I had the flu a couple times, normal stuff. I don't really go to the doctor much. I mostly just try to tough things out. I haven’t got insurance, so… you know. Nothing major, though. I can’t think of anything else.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history… I understand about the insurance situation. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Like I said, I don’t really do doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family?
