DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I wish I didn’t have to be here. It started… well, a couple of days ago, I suppose. Woke up and couldn't hear out of my left ear. And my face… it feels sort of droopy on that side. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes, I understand. But we need to figure out why it's inconvenient. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… that's not something we want to ignore. A couple of days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Tuesday, I believe. Though, truthfully, I don't keep meticulous track of these things. I was preparing for a conference call – very important people, you understand – and noticed I couldn’t hear properly on the left side. I initially thought it was the headset, but then… well, it didn’t go away. And then I looked in the mirror and saw… this. It’s not a good look.
DOCTOR: Right. And you haven’t had any head trauma, recent illnesses – cold, flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Trauma? Heavens, no. I lead a very… structured life. As for illnesses, a slight sniffle maybe, a week or so ago. Barely noticeable. Certainly nothing that would cause this. I assure you, I am quite careful about my health. It’s probably just… a nerve. It’ll pass. I haven't got time for a full work-up.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, with respect, dismissing something like this as “just a nerve” is… unwise. Sudden onset hearing loss and facial weakness raise concerns about something potentially serious – specifically, a stroke or Bell’s palsy. We need to investigate. Now, let's do a quick exam. Can you close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: A stroke? Really? I’m 59, not 90. And Bell’s… what even is Bell’s palsy? Look, Doctor, I have a very busy schedule. I travel frequently. I simply don’t have time for… tests and scans and all that. Can’t you just give me something for it? An antibiotic, perhaps? Or a steroid? Something quick? But make it fast.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm going to need you to try and smile for me. And then, puff out your cheeks. Try to hold it for a few seconds. Okay, and now try to close your eyes tightly. Do both eyes close equally?
PATIENT: There. Done. It's… harder than it looks, you know. And no, they probably don’t close equally. It’s always been… slightly asymmetrical, my face. I’ve had comments on it for years. Are we almost finished? I have a call in half an hour. A very important call.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, the asymmetry you're describing is new. And it's significant. While I appreciate your busy schedule, delaying a proper diagnosis could have serious consequences. I’m concerned about possible facial nerve paralysis. I need to order an MRI, and I'm referring you to a neurologist immediately. We need to rule out a stroke or other neurological issue. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? This is… preposterous. Look, Doctor, I'm a radiologist. I understand imaging. I've seen thousands of scans. I can practically diagnose myself. And I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. This is probably just… a temporary glitch. A pinched nerve. I will not be disrupting my schedule for unnecessary tests. I simply don’t have the time, or frankly, the inclination. Are you suggesting I am… imagining things? Because that is rather insulting. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I respect your profession, but your self-diagnosis is… not a substitute for a thorough medical evaluation. I strongly advise you to reconsider. Refusing necessary medical care is your right, but I must document your informed refusal. Given your insistence, I will provide you with a referral to a neurologist and instructions on recognizing stroke symptoms. However, I cannot ethically discharge you without emphasizing the potential risks of delaying treatment. .
