DOCTOR: Hi Liza, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, I’ve been thinking lately… about just feeling a bit more… centered, I guess. I was hoping to talk about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I keep hearing good things, but I don’t really know where to start.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a great thing to explore! It's wonderful you’re thinking about your well-being. It's becoming more and more clear how important mental wellness is, and mindfulness and meditation can be really helpful tools. Just to get a better understanding, when you say "centered," can you tell me a little more about what that feels like not being centered?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… Well, it’s like… a lot of little things bother me more easily than they used to. I work with the railways, repairing signals and switches – it can be a bit stressful, you know? And sometimes I find myself worrying about things that haven’t even happened yet. It’s not bad, exactly, just… a bit much sometimes. It makes it hard to relax in the evenings. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Liza. Railway work is stressful – a lot of responsibility! And that feeling of being easily bothered and worrying about the future... those are common experiences with stress and anxiety. So, it sounds like you’re noticing increased stress impacting your ability to relax. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My sleep… it’s not terrible, but it’s definitely not as restful as it used to be. I wake up a couple of times a night, usually with just… thoughts running through my head. And my appetite… well, I still eat, but I don’t really enjoy food as much. I find myself reaching for something sweet more often than I used to, even when I'm not hungry. Energy levels are… okay during the day, but I’m usually pretty tired by the evening. It’s not debilitating, but it’s noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a clearer picture. Changes in sleep, appetite, and a tendency towards sweets when stressed are all things we often see with increased stress levels. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with anything like anxiety or depression in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been… pretty resilient, I think. I mean, life throws things at you, right? And I’ve always just… dealt with them. This is just… different. It’s more of a constant feeling, like a low hum of worry. It's not a specific event causing it, just… everything, I suppose. I’ve never really needed to see a doctor for my mental health before, so this is a bit new for me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Liza. It's very common for things to feel different over time, and it takes courage to come in and talk about it, especially when it’s new territory. And you’re right, sometimes it is just a general feeling, not tied to a specific event. We call that generalized anxiety. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No major illnesses, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager – that was a bit unpleasant, but it was many years ago and I recovered completely. Other than that… just the usual colds and flu. I don't take any regular medications, just over-the-counter pain relievers if I need them. And I’m generally pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well when I can, and I walk quite a bit at work. It's a physical job, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No major medical history, appendix removed years ago, no current medications. That’s helpful. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he was always a bit of a worrier, actually. He didn’t really talk about it, but you could just tell. He wasn’t ever diagnosed with anything, but he was always anxious about something or other. My sister is fine, as far as I know, pretty healthy, lives in Sofia. We don’t see each other very often, unfortunately. But I don’t think anyone else in the family has had any major health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure and a father who experienced anxiety. That’s good information to have. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits… well, I live alone. I don’t have a partner. I have a few close friends at work, we sometimes go for coffee after our shift, or go to the cinema. I don’t really have a large social circle, but I’m not lonely. I enjoy my own company, and I like to read. I used to go dancing more often, but I haven’t had much time lately. Mostly, I just try to keep busy and stay active. I don’t drink alcohol very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense of things. You have a few close friendships, enjoy your own company, stay active, and don't smoke or drink excessively. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or have any other allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I don’t have any food allergies. Nothing like that. I can eat pretty much anything. I'm pretty boring in that respect, I suppose. Everything seems to work alright!
DOCTOR: That's great, Liza. No allergies, which is good. Okay, so to summarize, you're a 47-year-old female presenting with increased stress, difficulty relaxing, some changes in sleep and appetite, and a low hum of worry. You've noticed these symptoms recently, without a specific trigger. You have no significant medical history, no medications, no allergies, and a family history of high blood pressure and anxiety. You’ve got a good social support system and stay active. Now, before we talk about potential options, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Absolutely, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again, so whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. It's just a standard check-up. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Pulse is good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me... and another... Okay, heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look in your ears and throat. Everything looks normal so far. Now, I'm just going to do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes and balance. Okay, everything seems physically normal. Which, honestly, is good. It suggests that these symptoms are likely related to stress and anxiety. Now, let's talk about some options.
PATIENT: That's… a relief, actually. I was worried it might be something physical. Options… yes, please. I'm open to anything, really. I've heard good things about mindfulness, but I don't know where to begin. Are there any classes nearby, perhaps? Or maybe something I can do at home? I'm willing to try whatever you recommend.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Since the physical exam didn't reveal any underlying issues, and given your history and symptoms, I agree that we can explore strategies for managing stress and anxiety. Mindfulness and meditation are excellent starting points, and you’re right to be interested in those. There are several options. First, there are some mindfulness classes offered at the community center – I can give you a brochure with the schedule. They’re beginner-friendly. Second, there are a lot of excellent apps and online resources – Headspace and Calm are popular, but there are many others. They offer guided meditations and exercises you can do at home, at your own pace. Third, and this is something to consider, we could talk about short-term therapy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is very effective for anxiety. It teaches you practical skills to manage your thoughts and behaviors. Now, before we jump into any of those, let's talk about what's causing you stress right now. Is it primarily work-related, or are there other factors contributing to it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… a combination, I think. Work is stressful, as I mentioned, the responsibility… sometimes it feels like a lot. But it’s not just that. It’s… life, I suppose. Being alone, worrying about the future… just the general feeling of things being uncertain. The classes sound good, actually. Maybe starting with something structured would be helpful. And the apps… I’m not very tech-savvy, but I suppose I could try. Therapy… that feels a bit intimidating, to be honest. But I’m willing to consider it if you think it would be beneficial.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly understandable. It's good that you're willing to explore different options. So, let's start with the mindfulness classes. I'll give you the brochure, and you can see if the schedule works for you. And I can also recommend a few beginner-friendly apps – Headspace is a good starting point, it’s very user-friendly. Now, regarding therapy, we don't have to jump into it right away. It's always an option if you feel like you need more support, or if the classes and apps aren't enough. There’s no shame in seeking help, and it can be very beneficial. For now, let’s focus on getting you started with the classes and apps. I'll also give you a handout with some basic relaxation techniques – deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation – things you can do at home, whenever you’re feeling stressed. And I'm going to recommend a vitamin D supplement – low levels can sometimes contribute to anxiety. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, actually. Classes, apps, relaxation techniques, and the vitamin D… it feels manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much better just having a plan, and knowing I’m not alone in this. And if the vitamin D doesn’t agree with me, or if I have any questions, I can call the clinic, right?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. And yes, absolutely, please call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns at all. We're here to support you. The vitamin D is just a general recommendation, it doesn’t interact with any medications you’re taking, but if you experience any side effects, stop taking it and give us a call. Now, I'm going to print out a summary of our conversation and the recommendations, and a prescription for the vitamin D. I’ll also include the number for a local mental health support line, just in case. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. I really appreciate your time and patience. I’m looking forward to trying these things. Have a good day! And thank you for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day as well, and I hope to hear from you soon. .
