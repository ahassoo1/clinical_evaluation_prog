DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Kilton, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Margret Kilton. It is nice to meet you, Doctor… Batara, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Batara. And you can call me Pinky, if you must. Though I generally prefer Dr. Batara. Now, what brings you in today, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Well, Pinky… or Doctor Batara, I am having some trouble breathing. It is like a whistling sound when I try to take a deep breath. It has been happening for… maybe a week now? Not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. About a week. It is worse when I walk, I think. Or when I try to do my exercises. I like to keep active, you see. I used to be a trainer, a long time ago. But this whistling… it makes me stop. It is tiring.
DOCTOR: A trainer, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. Athletic trainer. For many years. With the school teams, mostly. Football, basketball… everything. But that was a long time ago now. I still like to walk and do some stretching, but this breathing… it is making it difficult. Do you… need to know what kind of exercises I do now?
DOCTOR: Well, it's good you were active. Though what you do now is relevant, yes. Please, be specific. Don't tell me "exercises," tell me what exercises. And how often you do them. Also, is this whistling constant when you're exercising, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Specific… yes, of course. Well, I usually walk for about thirty minutes, most days of the week. Sometimes I do some stretching, just simple things. Reaching for my toes, bending my knees… nothing too hard. And maybe ten push-ups against the wall. I used to do many more, but… not anymore. The whistling doesn't happen every time I exercise. Mostly when I walk uphill, or if I try to walk too fast. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it is just a few whistles, and then it stops. Other times it goes on for a little while. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. It's… something. Any coughing?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not a bad cough, mostly just a little tickle in my throat. It happens more at night, I think. When I am lying down. And it is not a productive cough, if you know what I mean. Nothing comes up. Just a tickle. It doesn’t usually happen with the whistling, though. It is separate. I hope I am not confusing you.
DOCTOR: No, you're... providing information. Do you have any history of asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies, yes. I think I am allergic to dust, maybe. I sneeze a lot when I clean. But asthma… no, I don’t think so. My mother had some trouble breathing when she was very old, but I don’t think it was asthma. She just… got weak. I never had any trouble breathing like this before. Until this week, of course. Is dust a problem? Should I be cleaning less?
DOCTOR: Dust is always a problem. But we'll get to that. Let’s move on. Any chest pain with this whistling?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Just… tight. Sometimes my chest feels a little tight when I am trying to breathe, especially when the whistling is bad. But it is not pain. It is more like… pressure. Like someone is squeezing my chest a little. It goes away when I stop and rest. Is that… bad? I worry I am explaining this all wrong. It is hard to describe.
DOCTOR: You're... getting there. Alright. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Now that you mention it, yes. A little bit. Not much, but my ankles do feel a little puffy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just from being on my feet too long. I used to tell my students to elevate their feet, you see. I didn’t realize it could be a… a sign of something. Is that also bad? Everything seems to be bad! I am sorry. I am probably just a nervous patient.
DOCTOR: Nervous patients are the most difficult. Okay. I'm going to listen to your lungs now. Please, sit back and breathe normally. Try not to overthink it.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I will try. It is hard not to overthink it when I am already worrying! But I will try to just breathe normally.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Hmm. I hear some… wheezing. And some diminished breath sounds, particularly on the lower lobes. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Wheezing… that is what I hear when I am trying to breathe, isn’t it? That is not good. Diminished… I do not understand what that means. I suppose if you hear wheezing, something is not right. Yes, of course. My heart. I hope everything is alright. I have a long trip home after this.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… normal. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. But your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. And your pulse is 88. I'm going to check your oxygen saturation now. It's 93%. That's a little low. I suspect we're dealing with either early COPD, or… possibly some mild heart failure contributing to fluid retention. But we need to rule out other things. I’m going to order a chest x-ray and an EKG.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. COPD? Heart failure? I thought it was just a little bit of trouble breathing. I don’t understand… I am not a smoker, and my father lived to be ninety! Fluid retention… is that why my ankles are puffy? An x-ray and… an EKG? Will those tell you what is wrong? I hope it is not too serious. I just want to be able to walk again without whistling. Is there anything I can do right now?
DOCTOR: There are things you can do. But first, let’s be clear. COPD isn’t only caused by smoking. Exposure to pollutants can contribute. And the fluid retention is consistent with possible heart failure. The x-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart. The EKG will check your heart's electrical activity. Right now… try to rest. Avoid strenuous activity. And I’m going to prescribe you a diuretic, a water pill, to help with the fluid retention. Take it as directed. I'll also order a pulmonary function test for next week, to assess your lung capacity. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A diuretic… a water pill. So I should drink less water? I am always told to drink more water. And pulmonary… that sounds complicated. I suppose… is this something I can fix? Will the water pill and the tests… make me better? I am a little scared, Doctor Batara. This is all very overwhelming. And… what if it is heart failure? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Kilton, you’re getting ahead of yourself. “Fix” isn’t the right word. We’re going to manage this. The diuretic will help remove excess fluid, which is causing some of your symptoms. It doesn't mean you need to drastically change your water intake, just be mindful of it. And heart failure doesn't mean your heart is going to stop tomorrow. It means it's not pumping as efficiently as it should, and we need to find out why. The tests will help us determine the severity and the best course of treatment. Now, I'm going to have the nurse take your blood pressure again, and then we'll get you scheduled for the x-ray. Try to remain calm. Worrying won't help. And frankly, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Very well, Doctor Batara. I will try to remain calm. And I will let the nurse take my blood pressure. Thank you for… trying to explain everything. .
