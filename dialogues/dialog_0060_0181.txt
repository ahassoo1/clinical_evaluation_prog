DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Nooruddin. Thank you. I requested this general wellness panel, you see. Just wanted to get a good look at how things are holding up. At my age, one likes to be… proactive, shall we say? It’s been a few years since my last thorough check-up, and my wife, Elena, insisted. A very sensible woman, my Elena.
DOCTOR: Right. A wellness panel. Yes, sensible. Though, frankly, at your age, you’re just looking for things to be wrong, aren’t you?
PATIENT: Perhaps a little of both, Doctor. One does become more aware of one’s mortality with the passing of years, naturally. But truly, I simply wish to ensure I remain… capable. I still enjoy my work – construction, you know – and I’d like to continue doing so for as long as possible. Elena and I also enjoy tending our garden, and that requires a bit of strength, too. It’s not about finding problems, it’s about… maintaining the quality of life, you see?
DOCTOR: Construction work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ve been a laborer for… well, nearly fifty years now. Started right after I came to this country. Mostly framing and roofing these days. It keeps me active, out in the fresh air. Though, admittedly, the sun can be rather strong. Not that I’m complaining. It’s honest work, and I’m good at it. Do you need to know specifics? The type of work, the duration each day… I can provide that information if it’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Relevant enough. Do you experience any pain, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Pain, Doctor? Well… a bit of stiffness in the mornings, particularly in my lower back. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just the usual aches and creaks that come with age and hard work. It eases up after I get moving, usually within an hour or so. And sometimes, if I’ve been lifting something particularly heavy, I’ll feel a twinge in my shoulder. But it’s fleeting, quickly subsides. I wouldn’t characterize it as pain so much as… discomfort. Do you require a more detailed description? Perhaps a rating on a scale of one to ten?
DOCTOR: A scale, yes. Let's hear it. And be honest, Mr. Mombrun. We’re not here for a competition in stoicism.
PATIENT: A fair point, Doctor. No competition at all. On a scale of one to ten, with one being no discomfort and ten being the worst pain imaginable… the morning stiffness, I’d say a two, maybe a three on a bad day. The twinge in my shoulder, when it occurs, is perhaps a four. It doesn't interfere with my work, doesn’t keep me from sleeping, and I can manage it with a little stretching. Truly, it’s rarely an issue. Is that… satisfactory? Perhaps Elena exaggerates when she speaks of my resilience. She has a dramatic flair, my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other complaints?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My appetite is good, perhaps a little too good, Elena teases. I sleep soundly, usually seven or eight hours a night. No trouble with… digestion, shall we say. My vision isn’t what it used to be, requires reading glasses for close work, but I’ve had those for years. And… occasionally, I feel a little lightheaded when I stand up quickly, but that’s been happening sporadically for as long as I can remember. Nothing alarming, I don't believe. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor? Perhaps you have a checklist of common concerns for men of my… vintage? I wouldn’t want to overlook something important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I’ve always found a thorough examination reassuring, regardless of the outcome. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'm quite comfortable. Although, if you don't mind, perhaps you could tell me a little about the panel itself? What exactly does it measure, and what are you looking for? It's just… Elena always encourages me to be informed. She says it’s my right as a patient. A very sensible woman, my Elena.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood test. Cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function. Basic things. We're looking for anything out of the ordinary. Don’t worry about the details. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish. I understand. A baseline, then. To identify any… potential issues. It’s good to know things are being checked, even if I’m not entirely certain what all the numbers mean. Elena would be pleased to hear you're so proactive. She’s quite meticulous about preventative care. Do you foresee any particular concerns based on my… self-reported symptoms? Perhaps the construction work impacts kidney function, or the sun exposure affects cholesterol levels? I understand if you prefer to wait until the results are available, of course. I simply… like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: The sun exposure is… a possibility. We’ll check your vitamin D levels. And frankly, Mr. Mombrun, construction work at your age is a risk factor for… almost everything. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. A risk factor for everything, you say? Elena warned me as much, but a man needs to stay active, you know? It’s good for the soul. Though, perhaps I should consider taking up gardening full-time. It might be a safer option. Do you need me to do anything specific? Balance on one leg? Follow your finger with my eyes? I’m ready for whatever tests you have planned.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger. Don't move your head.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is this to check… reflexes, perhaps? Or assess muscle control? I'm attempting to maintain a steady gaze, as instructed. Is the speed acceptable? Perhaps a slightly slower pace would be more accurate?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Relax your arm.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. Is that… satisfactory? A normal reaction, I presume? I've always had rather… responsive reflexes, if I recall correctly. Elena always said I was quick on my feet. Do you need me to repeat the test on the other side?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. Is that sufficient? I’m attempting to apply equal pressure with both hands. Do you require a specific level of force? Perhaps a numerical scale, again? I can consciously adjust my grip if needed.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s enough for now. We’ll get the blood work done, and we can discuss the results next week. Don’t worry about it too much, Mr. Mombrun. Just try to get some rest. And maybe… less construction work.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish. I appreciate your thoroughness. I shall endeavor to heed your advice regarding rest, though reducing the construction work entirely may prove… challenging. It’s a difficult habit to break. I look forward to discussing the results next week. And thank you again for your time and attention. Elena will be pleased to hear everything went smoothly. She always worries, you know. A sensible woman, my Elena. .
