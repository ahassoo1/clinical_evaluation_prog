DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s… concerning. I don’t recall when it started exactly, but it feels like several weeks, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Several weeks, you say. Hmm. And can you describe what you mean by "unsteady"?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to put into words. It’s not a dizziness, not spinning, exactly. More like my feet aren’t quite… cooperating with my brain, if that makes sense? I feel off-balance, like I’m walking on a boat, even when I’m standing on solid ground. Sometimes it's worse than others. I haven’t fallen yet, thankfully, but I worry I will.
DOCTOR: Walking on a boat… I see. And is this constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. Some days I feel perfectly normal, and other days… well, like today, it’s more noticeable. It seems to be worse when I’ve been on my feet for a long time, perhaps? Or after… a busy day at work. But I’m not certain. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see. It’s difficult to pinpoint specific triggers.
DOCTOR: You mention a busy day at work exacerbates it. What sort of work do you do, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I operate a rotary drill. For oil and gas. It’s… physical work. A lot of standing, and… well, moving around heavy equipment. It's demanding, certainly. I've been doing it for… a little while now. Though, truthfully, the details are a bit hazy. It's… not a job one easily forgets, but… things feel distant lately. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: Rotary drill… that is demanding. And you’ve been doing this for some time?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I believe so. Several years, at least. Though, after… everything, time feels… blurred. My husband… he passed away a few years ago, and… things haven’t been the same since. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to… become emotional. It’s just… difficult to recall specifics sometimes. It’s not that I’m trying to be evasive, it’s simply… a fog.
DOCTOR: Grief can certainly affect one's memory. Though, we should focus on the present issue, Ms. Snerling. We can address the… emotional aspects later, if necessary. Let's move on. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. You are quite right to refocus me. Um… let me think. Sometimes, I feel a little… faint, though not often. And my vision… it occasionally blurs, but I thought that was just needing new glasses. It’s hard to say what’s related and what isn’t, honestly. It’s… subtle, mostly. Not debilitating, but… worrisome, all the same. I do have private insurance, if that is relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, insurance is relevant. And you mentioned blurred vision and occasional faintness. Have you noticed any headaches accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Not severe, more like a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go, like everything else. It’s… difficult to connect them to the unsteadiness, or anything else, for that matter. I’ve always been prone to headaches, I suppose. Though, perhaps they are more frequent lately. It’s… hard to be certain. My husband used to keep track of such things… but that was before.
DOCTOR: Before. Right. Now, Ms. Snerling, I'm going to need to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I believe I had a bout of… bronchitis, a few years ago. And… I think my doctor mentioned my cholesterol was slightly elevated once, but it wasn’t anything alarming. As for anything diagnosed… no, not that I recall. My husband handled most of the medical appointments, and… I wasn't always attentive to the details. I apologize for my lack of thoroughness. I do have a general physician, though I haven't seen him regularly since… well, since my husband passed. I’m unsure if he has my complete records.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Surgeries… um… let me think very carefully. I believe I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, many years ago. That’s all I can recall, truthfully. Nothing major, certainly. And… no hospitalizations, that I remember. I’m terribly sorry for being so vague, Doctor. It’s just… everything feels so distant lately. It’s as if… a part of my memory is simply… missing. It's a rather unsettling feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… just the occasional ibuprofen for headaches, when needed. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I haven't been taking anything consistently since… well, truthfully, I don't recall ever needing regular medication. My husband always took care of… everything. It’s difficult to be certain, though. He was very meticulous about such things, and… I wasn’t always paying close attention. I apologize for the inconvenience, Doctor. It’s just… my mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has experienced similar symptoms – unsteadiness, dizziness, memory problems – or any neurological conditions like stroke or Parkinson's disease?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My family is… rather large, and spread out. I haven’t kept in close contact with many of them since moving here. I know my grandmother had some… heart problems, I believe, but I don’t recall anything specific about neurological conditions. And my mother… she passed away when I was young. I’m afraid I don’t have much information about my family’s medical history. It’s… a bit of a blur, truthfully. I apologize for my inability to provide a more detailed answer. It’s just… I wasn’t very close to my family, and I wasn’t involved in their medical matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, Ms. Snerling, do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion. I try to… maintain a healthy lifestyle, despite the demands of my work. Though, admittedly, it's been more difficult since… everything. I apologize for my rambling. I’m afraid I’m not being very helpful. It’s just… my mind feels rather foggy these days. It’s… unsettling, to say the least. Is there anything else I can provide?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Snerling, I'm going to conduct a brief physical examination. It will involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, reflexes, and balance. If you'll please follow my instructions. First, I'd like you to stand up slowly.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. I’m… a little wobbly, I’m afraid. Please excuse me. I do hope this examination will provide some answers. It’s… rather worrying, this unsteadiness. I’m trying to remain calm, but… it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72, regular. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, can you extend your arms in front of you, close your eyes, and try to touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Um… I’m… struggling a little, Doctor. It’s… harder than it looks. My finger… it’s not quite reaching. Is that… normal? I do hope this isn't a sign of something serious. I’m rather anxious about all of this, I must confess. I’m trying to focus, but my mind keeps… wandering.
DOCTOR: And now, the other side. Hmm. Now, can you walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I can’t seem to manage it, Doctor. I’m terribly unsteady. It’s as if my feet have a mind of their own. I do apologize for the trouble. Is there anything else I can try? I’m rather embarrassed, I must confess. This is… quite concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling, that is sufficient for now. Based on this brief examination, and your history, there are several possibilities. It could be a vestibular issue, affecting your inner ear balance, or possibly some early neurological decline. However, without further testing, it is impossible to say for certain. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation, including an MRI of the brain. I will also order blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a neurologist? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Are you saying… it could be something… grave? I confess, I’m quite frightened. I was hoping it was merely a minor imbalance, something easily remedied. An MRI… and a neurologist… I… I don’t know what to say. What sort of blood work are you ordering, specifically? And… how long will it take to schedule these appointments? I feel… rather overwhelmed at the moment. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Perhaps avoiding strenuous activity?
DOCTOR: It does not necessarily indicate anything grave, Ms. Snerling. It is simply a precautionary measure to rule out potential issues. The blood work will include a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. As for avoiding strenuous activity, yes, I advise you to refrain from any activities that exacerbate your unsteadiness. I will have my assistant schedule the appointments for you. It may take a few days to get everything arranged. And I suggest you find someone to accompany you to these appointments, given your… difficulties with recall. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Um… the assistant, will they contact me directly? And… regarding the recall difficulties… is there anything that can be done for that? Perhaps a medication? Or… a specialist I could see? I'm… increasingly concerned about my cognitive function. It's… unsettling to feel one's mind slipping away. And… how long will the results take to come back? It’s just… I feel rather anxious about waiting. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you for your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The assistant will contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule the appointments. As for your recall difficulties, those could be related to the stress you’re under, or simply a natural part of aging. I am not convinced it warrants further investigation at this time. The results typically take 5-7 business days to return. I suggest you focus on getting adequate rest and reducing stress. I do not want you to become overly concerned until we have the results of the tests. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I believe that is all for now. Thank you for your time and… your assessment. I do hope the results are… favorable. I shall try to remain calm, as you suggest. And… I shall await the assistant’s call. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Snerling. .
