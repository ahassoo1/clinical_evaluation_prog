DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s just…well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just thought… a little encouragement from a real doctor would be nice. You know? My daughter keeps saying I need to “think positive” but she doesn’t understand. It’s not the same. I was hoping for one of those cards you give people when they’re not feeling well. A “Get Well” card, maybe?
DOCTOR: A “Get Well” card?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. It's not that I’m sick sick, you understand. It’s just… life. Getting older isn't easy, and a little note from someone… professional… would be very uplifting. My arthritis is acting up, and the weather hasn't been helping. But it's mostly just… a feeling. A gloomy feeling. A card would show I’m being taken seriously, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, this clinic provides medical care. While I appreciate your daughter’s concern, and understand getting older presents challenges, a “Get Well” card isn’t a standard component of internal medicine. Perhaps a support group would be more beneficial for addressing a "gloomy feeling"?
PATIENT: A support group? Oh, goodness no. Those are full of complainers! I don’t want to listen to other people’s problems, I just want a little… validation. Honestly, Doctor, it’s not that much to ask. It’s a card. You write a nice little message, maybe something about staying strong, and… well, it would mean a lot. Are you telling me you can’t write me a card? Because that seems rather… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I am a physician, not a greeting card writer. My expertise lies in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. If you are experiencing emotional distress, I can certainly document that, and perhaps refer you to a qualified therapist. But I will not be providing a “Get Well” card. Let’s focus on any physical symptoms you are experiencing. You mentioned your arthritis is acting up. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, so you can document it! See, that’s something. It just feels…dismissive, Doctor, to act like this is nothing. Fine, fine, arthritis. It’s in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to do my work, you know? I assemble little parts, very precise work. And when the weather is damp, like it has been, it swells up something awful. And it aches. It aches all the time, but worse when it rains. Is that something you can… write down? So I have proof?
DOCTOR: “Patient reports worsening arthritis in hands, exacerbates by damp weather, interfering with fine motor skills required for work.” Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It comes and goes, you see? The worst spells… maybe six months now? But the arthritis itself… well, I've had it for years. My mother had it, so I always knew I would. It just flares up more now. Especially in the winter. And like I said, with this weather. It’s not just the rain, it's the humidity. Makes everything stiff and…creaky. Like an old door. Do you understand what I mean? You must understand creaky.
DOCTOR: “Chronic arthritis, family history positive, reports flares with damp weather and increased humidity.” Have you tried any medications for it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, a doctor gave me something… a little white pill. It made me feel… fuzzy. And my stomach didn't like it. So I stopped. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. My daughter keeps telling me about these new creams, but they’re expensive, and honestly, I don’t think they'd make much difference. I just… try to manage it. Warm water, gentle exercises… and hoping for sunshine. Is that good enough for your notes? Sunshine is very therapeutic, you know.
DOCTOR: “Patient reports previous medication trial, discontinued due to side effects. Currently managing with conservative measures: warm water, exercise. No current medication use.” And are you experiencing any pain other than in your hands?
PATIENT: Well… my knees bother me sometimes. Not all the time, but when I walk too much. Or climb stairs. They feel…grindy. Like bones rubbing together. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And my back… it gets stiff in the mornings. But I just stretch it out. You get old, you get aches, that’s just how it is, isn’t it? Don’t you think? It’s not like I expect you to fix it, just… acknowledge it. Is that too much to ask? Perhaps a small note about the knees and back…for my records, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Patient reports intermittent knee and back pain, exacerbated by activity. Denies sharp pain.” Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have a bit of trouble sleeping, sometimes. Just… lying awake at night. My mind races. And my blood pressure… the nurse always says it’s a little high. But it goes down when I relax. And I suppose I’m a little overweight, but who isn’t these days? It’s hard to keep the weight off when you can’t move about much, isn’t it? Are you writing all this down? It’s good to have everything documented. Perhaps a little note about the sleep…and the blood pressure. For completeness, you understand.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, we’re listing an extensive collection of age-related complaints. While I understand your concerns, this isn’t a comprehensive medical evaluation. It sounds like you’re experiencing typical symptoms of osteoarthritis and age-related changes. I can document these complaints, and we can discuss some lifestyle modifications. But I don’t believe a “Get Well” card is the appropriate course of action. Do you have any specific concerns that you would like me to address, or are you primarily seeking validation?
PATIENT: Validation? Oh, Doctor, that’s a… rather blunt way to put it. It’s just… it’s nice to feel heard, don’t you think? I come here, I tell you my troubles, and you just write them down. It’s not the same as someone… acknowledging that life is difficult. Fine, fine, no card. But perhaps a little… reassurance? That I’m not just being… fussy? And maybe a referral to someone who could help with the sleeping? Just a little help…is that too much to ask? You’re a doctor, aren’t you supposed to help people?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. I can document your concerns about sleep disturbance and will provide a referral to a sleep specialist. As for “reassurance,” I can state that your symptoms are consistent with age-related changes and are common in patients your age. However, I won’t be providing a “Get Well” card. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A sleep specialist… fine. That’s something, I suppose. And you’ll write that it’s…normal? That I’m not just… imagining things? Very well. Yes, that’s acceptable. But don’t expect me to be thrilled about it. It’s just… a bit disappointing. A little kindness goes a long way, you know. But fine. Document it. And the sleep specialist. That’s all. I think.
DOCTOR: “Patient reports chronic arthritic pain, sleep disturbance, and age-related changes. Referral to sleep specialist ordered. Patient understands symptoms consistent with age-related changes. No acute concerns identified.” Anything else, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… thank you, I suppose. Though I’m not entirely sure what I’m thanking you for. Perhaps just for listening. But don’t expect me to sing your praises to my daughter. She’d just say I was being silly. I’ll…see myself out, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Micucci. And please follow up with the sleep specialist. .
