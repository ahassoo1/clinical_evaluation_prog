DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman, welcome. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, doctor, I am just… tired. Very tired. Always tired, even when I sleep good. It's been… a long time now. My wife, she says I need to come. She worries too much, that woman. But I am tired. It's not like normal tired, you know? It's… in my bones, maybe?
DOCTOR: "In your bones," you say. Hmm. That's… descriptive. And how long exactly is a long time, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Let me think… maybe six months? More? It's hard to say. Time… it just goes, you know? I work, I eat, I sleep. Not much else. My liver… the other doctor, he said something about my liver not working right. That was… last year, maybe? Before that, everything was okay. Mostly. I don’t remember all the details. Old doctors, they always talk fast.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue for at least six months, potentially longer. And a previous issue with your liver, about a year ago. Do you remember what the other doctor said about your liver, even generally?
PATIENT: Generally… he said it was… swollen, maybe? And not cleaning things like it should. Something about… tests. Lots of tests. I didn't feel sick then, not really. Just tired sometimes. He gave me pills, I think. I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't seem to do much. And I don't like taking pills, doctor. They taste bad. My wife keeps telling me I should have followed up, but… I felt fine. Until now, this tiredness is really getting to me.
DOCTOR: “Felt fine.” Right. Well, stopping medication without following up is… not ideal, Mr. Grumman. It makes things much harder to figure out. Now, this tiredness… is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Yes, maybe afternoon. After I work. I work with the fabrics, you know? Cutting, sewing. It takes… everything out of me. Then I sit, and I just… want to sleep. Evenings are bad too. I try to watch the television, but I fall asleep before anything good happens. My wife gets upset, says I miss all the news. She likes the news. I just want to rest. It's not a good tired, doctor. It's a… heavy tired.
DOCTOR: “Heavy tired.” Alright. And aside from the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. My stomach… it feels funny sometimes. Not pain, exactly. More like… full, even when I haven’t eaten much. And I… I've lost weight, I think. My pants feel looser. My wife says I’m looking thin. She worries too much, that woman. But yes, I think I am thinner. And sometimes… my skin, it feels itchy. All over. It's annoying. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fullness despite not eating much, unintentional weight loss, and generalized itching. These are all… relevant things, Mr. Grumman. Now, do you have any history of liver disease, or any family history of liver problems or jaundice?
PATIENT: Jaundice? What is that? I don't think so. Nobody in my family… my mother, she was strong. My father… he worked hard. Nobody got sick, not really. Just normal things, you know? Colds, flu. Nothing like… this. My wife's family… they have diabetes, I think. She worries about that too. But liver… no. I don't think so. I've never heard of anyone in my family having liver problems. We eat good food, mostly. Ethiopian food. Very healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known family history of liver disease. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything right now, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, doctor. I told you, I don't like taking pills. I stopped the ones the other doctor gave me. Nothing. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing. Just… food and water. And sleep, when I can get it. My wife tries to give me something for the itching sometimes, a lotion. But it doesn't really help. She means well. She always means well. But I don't like taking things. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your skin. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Physical exam… yes, I suppose so. If you must. Just… be gentle, doctor. My wife says I'm getting old and fragile. I don't feel fragile, but… she worries. And I don't like being poked and prodded. But if it helps… yes, go ahead. Just be quick, alright? I have things to do. Not much, but… things.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. And I'll do my best to be quick. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is… soft, but there's some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And I do notice some mild jaundice, particularly in your sclera – the whites of your eyes. Your skin is slightly itchy and dry. I’m also noting some spider angiomas on your chest. Do you know what those are?
PATIENT: Spider… what? No, I do not. What are those? Sounds like something bad. I don't like the sound of that. And tenderness… what does that mean? Am I sick? My wife is going to be very upset. She told me I should have gone to the doctor sooner. Is it serious, doctor? Tell me the truth. Don't beat around the bush. Just tell me what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Spider angiomas are small, spider-web-like blood vessels that can appear on the skin, and tenderness in your abdomen means it's uncomfortable to the touch. These findings, along with the jaundice and fatigue you've been experiencing, are concerning. It could indicate a problem with your liver. Now, I'm not going to give you a definitive diagnosis just yet, but we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a liver function panel, and a few other tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We may also need to do an ultrasound or other imaging of your liver. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Always tests. Yes, alright. If you must. Just… try to make it quick, doctor. And explain everything, alright? I don’t like being kept in the dark. What are these tests for, exactly? And what are you looking for? Is it… serious? Tell me honestly, doctor. Don’t sugarcoat it. My wife… she’s going to want to know everything. She worries too much, but… she deserves to know the truth. And I… I just want to know what’s wrong. What am I facing?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. The blood tests will give us a snapshot of how your liver is functioning – checking for inflammation, damage, and whether it’s processing things correctly. The imaging – the ultrasound, if we decide to do one – will allow us to see your liver, check for any blockages or abnormalities in its size or shape. It could be a number of things, ranging from a simple infection to something more chronic. The symptoms you're describing, along with the physical findings, raise the possibility of liver disease, potentially cirrhosis or hepatitis. But we need the tests to confirm that and determine the exact cause. I’m being upfront with you, because you deserve to know. We are not at the point where we can make a definitive diagnosis, and many conditions are treatable, even manageable. The important thing is that we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on and get you the appropriate care. I’ll have the lab technician draw some blood now, and then we’ll schedule an appointment for you to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Cirrhosis… hepatitis… those sound like bad words, doctor. Very bad words. I don't want those. I just want to feel normal again. Tired is bad enough. I don't want… more. Blood tests… yes, alright. Do it. Get it over with. But promise me… promise me you'll explain everything clearly. No medical jargon, alright? Just… plain English. And tell me what my options are. If it is… bad, what can we do? And… please, doctor. Try to be quick. I have things to do. Not much, but… things.
