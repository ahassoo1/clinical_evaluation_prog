DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Oh… well, it’s a bit… difficult to explain. It’s about… pain. Down there. Yes, that’s right. Testicular pain, you said? I… I think so. It’s been… bothering me. I’m not quite sure how long, to be honest. Everything feels a little… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, testicular pain. It's alright if it’s difficult to explain, and it’s very common for things to feel a bit unclear sometimes. We'll take our time. You mentioned it’s been bothering you for a while, but you're unsure of exactly how long?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A while. Perhaps… a few weeks? Maybe longer. It comes and goes, you see. Not constant, thankfully. But when it is there… it’s quite unpleasant. A dull ache, mostly. Sometimes a sharper pain, but not often. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I truly don’t remember specifics very well these days. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It’s perfectly alright. We can work with what you do remember. A dull ache with occasional sharper pains, coming and going over a few weeks… that gives us something to start with. To help me understand a little better, could you describe where exactly you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, it’s… in the scrotum, of course. That’s where… everything is. But… it’s hard to pinpoint. Sometimes it feels like it’s in one… testicle more than the other. Or maybe it’s both? I apologize again. It’s difficult to be precise. Is it alright if I… perhaps gesture? I feel a bit silly even asking.
DOCTOR: Please, feel free to gesture. It’s perfectly alright, and it often helps me understand what's going on. There’s no need to feel silly; we’re here to figure this out together. Showing me where the pain is concentrated, even approximately, will be very helpful. Take your time.
PATIENT: It’s… around here, mostly. It’s not in my stomach, of course, but it radiates… outwards. And sometimes, it feels like it’s pulling… upwards, a little. It’s hard to describe. And as I said, it shifts. Some days it’s more on the left side, other days on the right. I truly hope this is helpful, Doctor. I feel a bit foolish explaining all of this.
DOCTOR: This is helpful, thank you. Radiating pain, shifting sides… that gives me a clearer picture. Now, aside from the pain itself, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, I don’t believe so. No nausea, thankfully. Oh… wait. Yes. Sometimes… a bit of heaviness. A feeling of… fullness, perhaps. In that area. And… occasionally, a slight ache in my lower back. But I have back problems sometimes anyway, so I wasn’t sure if it was related. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all relevant, thank you for sharing. Heaviness, fullness, and the occasional lower back ache – even with your existing back problems, it's good to know. Now, have you noticed any swelling or any changes in the size or shape of either testicle?
PATIENT: Swelling… that’s a good question. I haven’t… specifically looked, if I’m honest. I suppose I should have. No, I don’t think so. But I haven’t been regularly examining myself, if you know what I mean. And changes in size… that’s even harder to say. Everything feels… normal, I suppose. But again, I haven’t been paying close attention. I apologize, Doctor. I feel like I’m not being very helpful. It’s just… I don’t think about these things very often.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It’s perfectly understandable. Many people don’t regularly examine themselves, and it's perfectly fine to not be aware of those details. We’ll proceed as best we can with the information you’ve given me. Now, I’d like to conduct a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve me gently examining your abdomen and, yes, your scrotum. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I… I do feel a little embarrassed, but I understand it’s part of the examination. Just… please be gentle? And perhaps explain what you’re doing as you go? That might help me feel a little less… anxious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I’ll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or masses. Then, I'll examine your scrotum. It will involve me feeling the testicles, epididymis, and surrounding structures. Please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. Your abdomen sounds normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Just tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. No tenderness noted on abdominal palpation. Now, we’ll move onto the scrotal exam. Please lie back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright… yes, I’m ready, I think. Please… just let me know what you’re doing as you go. And… if it becomes too uncomfortable, please stop. I apologize for being such a… worry. I hope this examination doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Noelani. I'm gently feeling your scrotum now, checking the size, shape, and consistency of your testicles and epididymis. Your left testicle feels normal in size and consistency. There’s no palpable tenderness. Now, examining the right testicle… I’m feeling a small, firm lump on the upper portion of your right testicle. It’s approximately one centimeter in diameter. It doesn’t appear to be causing you immediate pain upon palpation, but it is definitely present. The epididymis also feels slightly enlarged on that side. Okay, I’m finished with the physical exam. Now, this small lump and the enlarged epididymis on your right side are concerning. It could be a number of things, but we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: A lump…? Oh dear. That… that doesn’t sound good, does it? What… what could it be, Doctor? Is it… serious? I… I’m getting quite frightened now. Is it… cancer? Please, tell me honestly. I need to know what’s happening. I apologize for being so dramatic, but… this is very upsetting. What do we do now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani, take a deep breath. It’s completely understandable that you’re frightened. Finding a lump is always concerning, and it's good you're voicing your concerns. Let me be clear: finding a lump does not automatically mean it’s cancer. There are many possible causes, including infection, inflammation, or a benign cyst. However, we need to determine the cause definitively. The most important thing we can do now is to get some imaging done. I’m going to order a scrotal ultrasound. This will give us a much clearer picture of the lump and the surrounding tissues. It’s a painless procedure. Depending on the results of the ultrasound, we may also need to consider a blood test to check for certain markers. In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary, but we'll cross that bridge if we come to it. I want to emphasize that we’re taking this seriously and will work through this step-by-step. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… alright. That sounds… less frightening than a biopsy, at least. And a blood test… yes, alright. Step-by-step… that’s what I need. How long will it take to get the results of the ultrasound? And… if it is something serious… what are the treatment options? I… I don’t want to think about it, but I need to be prepared. And… will I need to see a specialist? A… a urologist, perhaps? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor, but I’m… very anxious. Everything feels so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Noelani. In fact, I encourage it. It's important you understand everything that’s happening. Typically, the results of the ultrasound are available within 24 to 48 hours. The radiology department will send the report directly to me, and I will review it carefully and contact you immediately to discuss the findings. If the ultrasound reveals a concerning mass, the treatment options will depend on the type and stage of the mass. Options can range from observation to medication, surgery, or, in some cases, radiation therapy. We’ll discuss all of those options in detail if it comes to that. And yes, I will absolutely refer you to a urologist for further evaluation and management. A urologist is a specialist in the male reproductive system and will be best equipped to guide you through the next steps. I will send the ultrasound report and my notes directly to them. For now, let’s focus on getting the ultrasound scheduled. I have a referral form ready, and my nurse will help you set up the appointment before you leave. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this moment?
PATIENT: That… that sounds like a plan. A urologist… yes, that makes sense. And scheduling the ultrasound… alright. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and reassuring. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I… I’m a little scared, but knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s happening… that helps. Thank you again. I'll trust your nurse to help with the appointment. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. It’s perfectly normal to be scared, and I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. My nurse will be in touch shortly to help you schedule the ultrasound. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much until we have more information. .
