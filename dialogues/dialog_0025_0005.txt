DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Fourney. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here today to get myself cleared for a stay at the Willow Creek Senior Living Facility. I believe they requested a doctor’s assessment before I can move in, and I’m happy to oblige. I’ve been looking forward to a bit more…assistance, you could say.
DOCTOR: Willow Creek, alright. Yes, that's a fairly common request. They want to be certain you're able to safely transition. Well, let’s get some information down. Now, you said "a bit more assistance." Can you elaborate on what kind of assistance you’re looking for?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s not that I need assistance, mind you. I am still quite capable, thank you very much. But…housekeeping has become a bit much for these old bones, and cooking every meal…well, it's just easier to let someone else handle it, if you understand. And the company would be nice. I live alone, you see. A bit of socialization never hurt anyone. Mostly, I just want to simplify things. It’s a good facility, I visited it several times. Very pleasant staff.
DOCTOR: Right. Simplify things. Understandable. So, you’re fairly independent at this point, just looking for some help with daily tasks. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do. Years ago – about fifteen years now – I had a bout with pneumonia. Recovered fully, but my lungs aren’t what they used to be. I get a bit winded with strenuous activity, but it’s manageable. And…oh, yes. My knees. They ache something fierce when the weather changes. Arthritis, the doctor told me. Nothing serious, just…uncomfortable. I take a little something for the pain when it flares up. Otherwise, I’m as healthy as an eighty-one-year-old Lakota man can be, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, pneumonia fifteen years ago, arthritis in the knees. Do you recall what medication you take for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s a little white pill. Now, the name… the name escapes me at the moment. I’ve been taking it for…well, for quite a while now. I believe it begins with a “N”… Naproxen, perhaps? Yes, that’s it. Naproxen. I take one twice a day when my knees are bothering me, and sometimes just one if it’s not too bad. I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street. A small, family-owned place. Very helpful folks.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, good. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, and never had a reaction. I have a rather strong constitution, you see. My grandmother used to say I could eat rocks and not be bothered. A bit of an exaggeration, of course, but I’ve never had any trouble with allergies. Not to pills, not to foods, not to…well, anything, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the Naproxen?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just a little something for my blood pressure. It gets a bit high sometimes, though it’s usually well-controlled. The name is… Lisinopril, I believe. A small, pink pill. I take one every morning. It was prescribed by my previous doctor, Dr. Henderson. He retired last year, a very good man. I’ve been taking it for…oh, maybe five years now? It helps keep things regular, you see. Nothing major, just a little insurance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just the one. Many years ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix removed. A rather unpleasant experience, I must say. But it healed well, and never bothered me since. It was…oh, let me think… 1968, I believe. It was during the Vietnam War. A simpler time, in some ways. Otherwise, no. Just the appendix. Nothing else. A clean record, you might say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a bit of a long story, Doctor. My family... well, we have a long line of strong people. My mother lived to be ninety-five, a very robust woman. She never complained a day in her life. My father... he passed away when I was young, but he was a strong man as well. As for illnesses... there’s been some heart trouble on my mother’s side, and a bit of diabetes. Nothing major, but it runs in the family. My brother... he had some issues with his knees, similar to mine. Arthritis, I believe. It seems to be a common ailment in our family. Perhaps it’s the weather. We lived on the plains for many generations, you see. Harsh winters, unforgiving summers. It takes a toll on the body.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask about some lifestyle questions. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Never will. My grandmother always said tobacco was the devil’s weed, and I took her seriously. I've always preferred fresh air, you see. And I’ve always been careful with my health. A strong body is a gift, and one must take care of it. Besides, my lungs aren’t what they used to be, and I wouldn’t dare risk further damage. No, no tobacco for me. Never have, never will. A healthy life is a good life.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Just a small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week. Nothing excessive, you understand. It helps me relax, and it goes well with my food. A bit of red wine, usually. Cabernet Sauvignon, if I have it. But it’s not a habit, mind you. Just a little something to enjoy. I've never been one for strong spirits. Wine is civilized, you see. And in moderation, it can be quite pleasant. But I wouldn’t say I need it. Just a little something to savor now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a bit about your current physical state. Are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As I mentioned earlier, my knees ache something fierce when the weather changes. It’s a dull, throbbing pain, mostly in the evenings. And sometimes, my lower back gets a bit stiff, especially after I’ve been sitting for too long. But it’s manageable, mind you. I take some Naproxen when it flares up, and it usually helps. Otherwise, I’m fairly comfortable. But the knees…they’re a constant reminder of my age. It’s a small price to pay, I suppose. But it’s there. A dull ache, mostly in the evenings. And the stiffness in my back. Nothing debilitating, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to conduct a brief physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of your overall condition. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I want to be sure I am in good shape for this move. I want to be able to enjoy my time at Willow Creek, and I need to be as healthy as possible. Do as you need to do. I am at your service. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. Not new, I suspect. Lungs are clear, but with diminished breath sounds, as expected. Now, let's check your reflexes… Your reflexes are a bit slow, but within normal limits for your age. And finally, let me just gently palpate your knees… There is some mild tenderness on both knees, with no significant swelling. Overall, your physical exam is consistent with your age and reported history. Okay, Mr. Tkac. That concludes the physical exam. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at the moment. That was a very thorough examination, thank you. You have answered all of my unspoken questions, I believe. The slight murmur…it never bothered me, as you said. And the knees…well, I already knew about those. You have put my mind at ease. I believe you have everything you need to clear me for Willow Creek. I appreciate your time and expertise, Doctor Fourney. You have been most kind and attentive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on my examination and your medical history, I do not see any reason why you would not be a suitable candidate for assisted living at Willow Creek. Your conditions are stable, and you appear to be in good overall health for your age. However, I recommend continued monitoring of your blood pressure, and I suggest you continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed. And if your knee pain worsens, please don’t hesitate to consult with an orthopedist. I will send a summary of our consultation to Willow Creek, and they will be in touch to finalize the arrangements. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is wonderful news. Thank you. I am relieved and very much looking forward to this next chapter. Your advice is sound, and I will certainly follow it. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I have no further concerns. You have been most helpful. Thank you again, Doctor Fourney. I wish you a pleasant day. And thank you for your kindness. I believe my grandmother would have approved of your gentle demeanor. She was a very discerning woman, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. I wish you all the best at Willow Creek. And thank you for your kind words. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day as well.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor. I am certain Willow Creek will be a wonderful place. .
