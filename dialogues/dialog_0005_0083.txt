DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Well, Doctor… it’s… a little thing. Not a real sickness, you understand. Just… feeling a bit low. I was hoping you might write me one of those… get well cards. You know, with the flowers? My niece, she always sends them when I’m… under the weather. A little encouragement, that’s all. Not asking for pills or anything. Just a card.
DOCTOR: A card, sir?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Is that… unusual? I mean, I work hard, you know? Boilers don’t run themselves. It’s… mentally taxing. And sometimes, a fella just needs a little… boost. My ex-wife… she never understood that. Always said I was being silly. But a card… it’s a nice gesture. Shows you care.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, this is a medical clinic. We address health concerns. While I appreciate you explaining your… emotional needs, a “get well card” isn’t exactly within the scope of medical practice. Are you experiencing any actual physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Well… I get tired. A lot. But that’s the boilers, you see. Long hours, hot work. And my back… it aches sometimes. But what old man doesn't have a bad back? I just thought… a little something cheerful might help with the… the spirit, you understand? It's hard to keep going when nobody… acknowledges the work.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness and back pain. And you attribute this solely to your… boiler work?
PATIENT: Well, mostly. I mean, I don’t go running marathons or anything. And like I said, my ex-wife… she wasn’t very supportive. Always complaining about something. It's a strain, you know? On a man. But the boilers, they’re constant. Always needing attention. It’s a… demanding job. Not everyone can do it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, your records show a history of… let’s just say, frequent visits with vague complaints. Fatigue, aches, “feeling low.” And a noted reluctance to discuss… lifestyle factors. We need to determine if this is simply a matter of needing to find better coping mechanisms, or if there's an underlying medical issue. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Hmm. I think… maybe a few years ago? Doctor Ramirez, he retired. Good man, Doctor Ramirez. He always listened. But he didn't… send cards. Look, I’m not trying to be difficult. I just… I don’t see the point of poking and prodding if it’s not going to fix anything. A card… a card is something. It shows you care.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, dismissing potential medical issues because you prefer a symbolic gesture is… frankly, irresponsible. I need to assess your overall health. Let's start with some basic vitals. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature. And then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. We’ll check your reflexes, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. Can we at least start with that?
PATIENT: Palpate my… abdomen? Now hold on a minute. I’m not… I don’t need anyone poking around in my stomach. I told you, it’s not a real sickness! It’s just… a little down. A card would do wonders. Really. A nice, colorful card with maybe a… a sailboat on it. Or flowers. Anything cheerful. I don't understand why this is so complicated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am a physician. My job is to diagnose and treat medical conditions, not to provide emotional support through stationary. Your insistence on a “card” instead of allowing a basic medical evaluation is… concerning. I'm starting to suspect there may be more going on than you are letting on. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, unexplained weight loss, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in my… bowel habits? Now you’re just being… personal! Look, I came here for a card, not a… a medical interrogation! I work hard, I take care of my boilers, and sometimes I just need a little… acknowledgement. Is that so much to ask? You're making me nervous, Doctor. And when I get nervous, my back really aches. You’re not listening to me!
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I've given you ample opportunity to discuss your health concerns. Your refusal to cooperate with a basic examination, coupled with your insistence on a non-medical request, leads me to believe you may not be presenting a full and accurate account of your condition. I’m going to be frank with you. I'm concerned about your well-being, and I strongly recommend you seek a second opinion. Perhaps a physician who specializes in… holistic care. I cannot, in good conscience, provide a “get well card” in lieu of a medical evaluation. .
PATIENT: Holistic… what? Look, you’re being… rude! I came here for help, and all you’ve done is… interrogate me about my bowels and tell me I'm making things up! A card! That’s all I asked for! Fine. Fine! I’ll go somewhere else. Somewhere where they understand the importance of… manners! And a little bit of kindness! This is ridiculous!
