DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, I suppose you could say I’m looking for a little…boost. I’m getting on in years, you see, and I just don’t feel quite as springy as I used to. I want to get back to feeling more like myself, if that makes sense. A bit of a reset, perhaps? I've been hearing things…about getting a "jumpstart" to health.
DOCTOR: A "jumpstart," you say. I see. And when did you start noticing this…lack of springiness, as you put it?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It didn’t happen all at once, you know? I’d say…maybe the last six months or so. It’s little things, really. I used to walk the neighborhood every morning, no problem at all. Now, I find myself…pausing a bit more often. And I don't have the energy for gardening like I used to. It's just…not as easy. It's not painful, mind you, just…tiring.
DOCTOR: So, over the last six months, a gradual decrease in your energy levels and endurance. Walking and gardening have become more difficult, but without any specific pain. Anything else you've noticed?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be, either. I don’t crave things like I once did. And I find myself sleeping… a little too much during the day. Not all the time, just…napping here and there. I used to be a very active person, always something to do, and now I feel…content to just sit. It’s not a bad thing, exactly, but it’s not me, you know? I worry about losing my independence, if I keep feeling this way.
DOCTOR: A decrease in appetite and increased daytime sleepiness… and a feeling of being less motivated, even. And you’re concerned about maintaining your independence. That's understandable. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. I hadn't thought to mention it, but my clothes are a bit looser than they used to be. I haven't weighed myself in… oh, goodness, I don’t even remember. But I’d say I’ve probably lost a few pounds. Not a lot, but noticeable. My daughter keeps offering to buy me new outfits, which is sweet, but… I’d rather feel good in the ones I have.
DOCTOR: Weight loss… that's good to know. And it sounds like it’s been unintentional. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, years ago – oh, maybe thirty years ago now – I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, but that was managed with medication for a while. The doctor took me off of it eventually, said it was under control with diet and exercise. Other than that… I had the usual childhood things, chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. No big surgeries, no chronic illnesses. I’ve been very fortunate, really. I do have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it doesn’t bother me too much. Just a little stiffness sometimes.
DOCTOR: History of controlled hypertension in the past, now managed with diet and exercise. Some arthritis in the hands. Good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Not a one. I’ve always been lucky that things haven't come to that. I did have all my teeth pulled when I was younger – a very long story involving a lot of sugar and a less-than-stellar dentist, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… no hospitals, no operating rooms for me. I always figured a good life and fresh air was the best medicine.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family. Let me see. My husband passed away about ten years ago now, God rest his soul. We had three children - two daughters and a son. They all live on the mainland, you see, so I don't see them as often as I'd like. They all seem to be healthy, thankfully. My mother lived to be 95, so I suppose good genes are on my side. She was a strong woman, always working in the garden. My father… he had some heart trouble when he was older. But that was a long time ago. Is that the sort of thing you're looking for?
DOCTOR: General family history is sufficient for now. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My daughter always asks when I go to the doctor, and I always say no. I used to be able to eat anything, but my stomach isn't quite as robust these days. Still, it's not an allergy, just… a little sensitivity. I can't eat spicy food anymore, but that's a personal preference, not a medical problem.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Well… just a little something for my arthritis, a cream that my daughter sends me. It doesn’t do much, really, just makes my hands smell nice. And sometimes I take a little bit of Tylenol if my joints are really bothering me, but not very often. Other than that… no, I don't take anything regularly. I believe in letting nature do its work as much as possible. I used to make my own herbal remedies, but my hands aren't steady enough anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. McNabb, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your hands. It won't take long. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A physical exam sounds sensible. I always liked my doctor when I was younger, he always listened to my heart and said it was strong. Lead the way, Doctor. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if I’m moving too slowly. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Please, just sit. I'll examine your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds… regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, clicks, or gallops noted. Lungs… clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Respiratory effort normal. Now, let me check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s reassuring about my heart. My mother always said I had a strong ticker. I always liked the sound of a good stethoscope, makes me feel like a proper patient. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try to keep very still. And please, don’t mind if I ask questions. I’m a curious person, you see.
DOCTOR: Reflexes… diminished, but present bilaterally. Not particularly strong. Now, let me examine your hands. Some mild tenderness and slight swelling in the metacarpophalangeal joints. No significant deformity. Range of motion… slightly limited. Findings consistent with mild osteoarthritis. As you mentioned. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and a complete blood count.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s…a little startling. Yes, my hands aren't what they used to be, but I’ve managed. Blood work, you say? That sounds sensible. Is it a lot of poking and prodding? I always feel a bit faint around needles. I suppose it's necessary, though, if it will help figure things out. What sort of things are you looking for with the blood work, Doctor? You don’t have to get too technical, just a general idea would be fine. I do appreciate you explaining things.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood draw, Ms. McNabb. A small amount of blood will be taken from your arm. It is necessary to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and weight loss. We’ll check your thyroid function, as an underactive thyroid can cause these symptoms. We'll also check your vitamin D levels – a deficiency can cause fatigue and muscle weakness. And a complete blood count will help us look for any signs of anemia or infection. It’s fairly routine, and the phlebotomist is very good. It shouldn’t take long. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Thyroid and Vitamin D…that makes sense. My daughter has always said I don't get enough sunshine. And a complete blood count… just to make sure everything is working properly, you mean? No, I don’t think I have any more questions, Doctor. You’ve explained it very clearly. It just…doesn’t sound very pleasant, but if it’s necessary, then I suppose I can manage. When would I need to go for the blood work? And will I need to fast beforehand? I do enjoy my breakfast, you see.
DOCTOR: You'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food or drink, except for water. The lab is just down the hall. You can go anytime tomorrow morning. They’ll give you specific instructions. Here's a requisition form and the lab's address. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Eight hours…that will be a challenge. But I suppose I can manage. Very well. This is all very organized. No, I don’t think there’s anything else at the moment, Doctor. I suppose we’ll just wait for the blood work results, then. Thank you for your time and your patience. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit, knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Very well. You're welcome. I'll see you for your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
