DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, a trip I’m planning. It feels a bit silly coming here just for that, but they require it.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sayar. It’s quite common to need a medical clearance for air travel, especially with recent health concerns or if you have any underlying conditions. We want to ensure you have a safe and comfortable journey. To write this letter for you, I’ll need to gather some information. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all – and if so, can you tell me about them?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Um… let me think. I had pneumonia a few years back, maybe 2020? It wasn’t too bad, I recovered fully. And… my husband, he passed away last year. It was… sudden. Heart attack. That caused some stress, obviously, but I’ve been seeing a therapist regularly since then. Other than that… honestly, not much. I’m usually quite healthy. I’m 33, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Sayar. I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Grief can certainly impact one's health, and I commend you for seeking support through therapy. Regarding the pneumonia, do you recall if you required hospitalization or were treated as an outpatient?
PATIENT: I was hospitalized for about three days, I think. It was bad enough they wanted to keep me in, but I was released pretty quickly once I started responding to the antibiotics. No lasting effects, though. I haven’t had any trouble breathing or anything since then.
DOCTOR: Good. And since that hospitalization, have you had any other significant illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the usual colds and flu, but nothing that required a doctor’s visit, really. I’ve been pretty careful, especially with everything going around the last few years. Do you need a list of medications I've taken? I don't really take anything regularly. Just occasional ibuprofen for headaches.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Let's confirm that information in the system. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any vitamins, herbal supplements, or over-the-counter medications on a regular basis?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I tried a multivitamin for a while, but I honestly forgot to take it most days. Now I just try to eat healthy. It’s not very exciting, is it? My medical history.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sayar. A straightforward medical history is often a very good thing. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, lung problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, I think. And his mother, my grandmother, she had… arthritis, I believe. Badly, towards the end of her life. My mother’s side… honestly, I don’t know much about their medical history. They’re from Mongolia, and we didn’t really talk about those things much growing up. There weren’t many doctors around where they were from. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Sayar. Family medical history can be difficult to obtain, especially with cultural or geographical barriers. Knowing about your father's high blood pressure is helpful. And it’s perfectly fine that you don’t have a lot of information about your mother’s side. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very careful about my health. My husband… he smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. Sorry. Old habits.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Sayar. It’s understandable. And that’s good to know about the smoking. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe on the weekends. Nothing excessive. I don’t really like the taste of beer, and I don’t drink hard liquor. It's not a habit, honestly. Mostly just social.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. I remember being worried about that when I was a kid, but I've never had a reaction to anything. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? It’s all pretty boring, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sayar. A lack of significant medical issues is a very good thing. And thank you for being so thorough. Just to confirm, you’re 33 years old, generally healthy, with a history of pneumonia several years ago, no known allergies, and occasional social alcohol use. Now, to assess your current physical condition, I’d like to do a brief examination. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I just want to get this letter and be on my way, if that’s alright? I have a flight to catch, eventually.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Sayar. We’ll keep it as quick and efficient as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Blood pressure is 122/78. Within normal limits. Throat looks clear. Ears are also clear. No signs of infection. Everything sounds good, Ms. Sayar. Based on our conversation and the examination, there are no apparent contraindications to air travel. I can certainly write a letter confirming your fitness to fly. Do you have any specific concerns or requirements I should mention in the letter?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just that I’m able to fly, generally. That’s all they asked for, really. Thank you, Doctor. That’s a big weight off my mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just one moment while I finalize this. Here you are. This letter states that you are generally fit for air travel, based on our examination today. It also includes the date of the examination for validity. Please be sure to keep this with your travel documents. Do you have any questions about the letter or anything we discussed today?
PATIENT: No, it looks perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor Rakosky. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you fitting me in.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I'm glad I could assist you. If you experience any changes in your health, or have any concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a safe and pleasant trip! .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
