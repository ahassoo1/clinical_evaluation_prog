DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's difficult to explain precisely. I've been feeling rather unsteady, a bit off-balance. It’s been happening… for a little while now, I think. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady and off-balance. And you said this has been happening for a little while – can you try to be a little more specific about how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is difficult. It feels like… several weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month or two? It's not constant, you see. Some days are better than others. I work out in the oil fields, with the drills… and it’s been… noticeable there. I don’t want to cause any trouble, or… accidents. It just comes and goes. I truly can’t recall a precise date, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, several weeks to a couple of months, intermittent. And you mentioned working in the oil fields. That’s good to know. Just to clarify, when you say unsteady, can you describe how it feels?
PATIENT: Well… it's not a dizziness, exactly. Not like spinning. It’s more like… my feet don't feel quite connected to the ground, if that makes any sense? Like I could… wobble. Or stumble. It’s… disconcerting. And sometimes it’s worse when I walk quickly, or turn my head. Though, even just standing can be… precarious on a bad day. I hope that’s… a clear explanation. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful, Lilyanna, thank you. Not spinning, more like a loss of stability, especially with quick movements or turning your head, and even sometimes just standing. So, it sounds like it's impacting your balance. Before we go further, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me see. I’ve been rather tired lately, more so than usual. And… occasionally, a bit of a headache. Nothing severe, just a dull ache. I haven't noticed anything else… specifically. My appetite hasn’t been great, but I just assumed that was from the stress of… everything. Oh, and… my vision seems a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so I thought that might be related. Is that… useful information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very useful, thank you. Fatigue, occasional dull headache, decreased appetite, and blurry vision. Since you wear glasses, is the blurriness different than usual, or just your normal vision with your current prescription?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… think it’s a little worse than usual. Not dramatically so, but… it takes me a bit longer to focus sometimes, even with my glasses on. And occasionally, things seem… slightly distorted, like a wavering. It's hard to describe. It’s not constant, just… a fleeting sensation. I haven’t gotten my eyes checked in… well, it’s been a while, I confess. Life gets… busy.
DOCTOR: It does. Okay, so increased blurriness, occasional distortion. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Past medical history… That’s another thing my memory struggles with. I… believe I was perfectly healthy, up until… well, until my husband passed away. After that, everything became… rather hazy. I don’t recall any specific diagnoses. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing major. I did have a surgery once, years ago, to remove my appendix, but that was… decades ago. And I take a daily multivitamin, if that’s relevant. I truly apologize for being so unhelpful. I wish I could provide more information.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly understandable. Losing someone is… significant, and it's common for things to feel a little less clear afterward. Appendix removed, daily multivitamin – that's helpful to know. Let's talk about your family history. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, neurological problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a difficult one. My parents both passed away when I was quite young, so I didn’t know much about their medical backgrounds. I had an aunt, on my mother’s side, who suffered from… I believe it was some sort of nerve issue, later in life. She was often unsteady on her feet, and eventually needed a wheelchair. I don’t know the specifics, unfortunately. And my father’s side of the family… I wasn’t very close to them, so I have very little information. I apologize again for my lack of… details. It feels like I'm grasping at shadows.
DOCTOR: Okay, aunt with a nerve issue causing instability. That's good to know, even without a specific diagnosis. Now, let’s talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. I don't smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine at a special occasion, but that's it. And I certainly don’t use any… recreational drugs. I work long hours out in the oil fields, and I need to be completely alert and focused. That’s always been my priority. I take pride in being responsible and dependable.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Lilyanna. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I've had the usual vaccinations, of course, but no adverse reactions. I did have a bit of a rash once, when I was a child, from poison ivy, but that wasn't an allergy to medication. I’m quite fortunate, I think, in that regard. I rarely get sick, and I’ve never had any serious health issues… until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Lilyanna, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also do a neurological exam to assess your balance, coordination, and reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. I understand it’s necessary. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I just hope it… doesn’t take too long. I have a rather early shift tomorrow, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 135 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Okay, please walk a few steps forward and backward. I'm noticing a slightly wider gait than usual and a little unsteadiness. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Okay, please open your eyes. And now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay, last, I'm going to do some eye movements. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Okay, that concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… was a bit more challenging than I anticipated. Is everything alright? My balance feels… particularly off now. Is that to be expected? What did you find? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, it's understandable to feel a little more off after the exam, especially since you mentioned your balance has been a concern. Based on what I’ve found, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but the more concerning findings are the mild unsteadiness in your gait, difficulty with balance, and mild dysmetria—that’s a slight lack of coordination—on your left side. Your reflexes are normal, and your eye movements are good, which is reassuring. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. There are several possibilities, including an inner ear problem, a neurological issue, or even a vitamin deficiency. Given your memory concerns, it's also important to consider other factors. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions. I also recommend a referral to an audiologist to assess your inner ear function. And given the neurological findings, I'd also like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… rather extensive. An MRI… and blood tests… and an audiologist. It feels like a great deal. I suppose if it’s necessary to determine the cause, I should agree. But honestly, the thought of all those tests… it’s a bit daunting. Are these tests… expensive? And will they take long? I do have to work, you see. And… what if they find something… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilyanna. It does feel like a lot, and I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were necessary to get a clear understanding of what's going on. Let’s address your questions. Regarding cost, I'll write the orders with your insurance information, and the billing department will determine your out-of-pocket expenses. They can also discuss payment options if needed. As for the tests themselves, the blood tests will take about 15-20 minutes, and the results usually come back in a few days. The MRI will take about 30-45 minutes, and the radiologist will interpret the results within a week. We can schedule these tests around your work schedule as much as possible. Regarding finding something serious, it’s important to remember that these tests are just to gather information. While there’s always a possibility of finding something unexpected, it’s more likely that we’ll identify a treatable condition. We'll discuss the results thoroughly, and I’ll explain all your options. I want to assure you that I'm here to support you throughout this process. We'll take things one step at a time. Would you like me to go ahead and write the orders for the blood tests, MRI, and a referral to the audiologist?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead and write the orders. And… could you perhaps explain the process for the MRI? I've never had one before, and I'm a little… apprehensive. What exactly does it involve? And is it painful?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your brain. It's a very safe procedure, although there are a few things to be aware of. First, you'll need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, hairpins, even clothing with metal zippers – as these can interfere with the magnetic field. You’ll receive a questionnaire asking about any implanted medical devices, like pacemakers or metal implants. During the scan, you'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It’s important to remain very still during the scan, as any movement can blur the images. You’ll be given earplugs or headphones to protect your ears from the loud noises the machine makes. The scan itself usually lasts about 30-45 minutes. You will be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure, and you can press a button if you feel uncomfortable at any time. It’s not painful, but some people feel claustrophobic inside the tunnel. If you're prone to claustrophobia, we can discuss options for managing your anxiety, such as medication or an open MRI machine. Do you have any other questions about the MRI, or anything else I can clarify?
PATIENT: Claustrophobic… yes, that’s… a concern. I don't like small spaces, to be honest. Is there an open MRI machine nearby? And if I were to feel… panicky during the scan, could I stop it? I understand it’s important, but the thought of being enclosed in a tunnel… it’s quite unsettling. Is there anything I can do to prepare? Perhaps some medication to help me relax?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Lilyanna, and it's good you're bringing it up now. Yes, there is an open MRI machine available at Valley Imaging, about 30 minutes from here. It’s not quite as high-resolution as a closed MRI, but it should be sufficient for our purposes, especially given your anxiety. We can schedule your scan there instead. And absolutely, you can stop the scan at any time if you feel uncomfortable. The technician will be monitoring you throughout the procedure, and you’ll be able to communicate with them via intercom. Regarding medication, yes, we can prescribe an anti-anxiety medication, such as lorazepam, to help you relax before the scan. It’s a short-acting medication that can help reduce your anxiety without causing significant drowsiness. We’ll discuss the potential side effects and ensure it doesn’t interact with any other medications you're taking. Would you like me to schedule your scan at Valley Imaging and write a prescription for lorazepam?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… wonderful. Scheduling it at Valley Imaging and the medication… yes, that would make me feel much more comfortable. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking my concerns so seriously. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing that there are options available. What are the next steps? How long will it take to schedule the scan, and when should I take the medication?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad we could find a solution that works for you. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, contact you shortly to schedule the MRI appointment at Valley Imaging. She’ll coordinate the best time based on your availability. As for the lorazepam, I'll send the prescription electronically to your pharmacy. The instructions will be on the bottle, but generally, you'll take one tablet about an hour before your scheduled appointment. It's important to have someone drive you to and from the scan, as the medication can cause drowsiness. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. We’ll review the MRI results as soon as they’re available and discuss the next steps based on the findings. Do you have any questions for me at this time, or is there anything else I can assist you with?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Truly. I appreciate your patience and understanding, especially with my… vagueness. I’ll contact Sarah about scheduling the scan, and I’ll pick up the prescription. Thank you again for everything. I believe I'll be on my way now. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day as well. .
