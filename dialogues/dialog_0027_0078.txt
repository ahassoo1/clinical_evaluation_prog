DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It's...nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping you can help me feel… better. I feel like I need a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, if you will. I just haven’t been feeling quite myself lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, "not feeling myself." That's…vague, but we can definitely work with that. Can you tell me a bit more specifically what that means for you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s hard to explain… It’s not one specific thing, really. Just… low energy, mostly. And a bit of trouble sleeping, even when I’m tired. My joints ache a little more than they used to, especially in the mornings. And I just don't have the… zest for things, you know? I used to love gardening, but lately, it feels like a chore. It’s all very…deflating.
DOCTOR: Low energy, sleep trouble, joint aches…and a loss of interest in activities you enjoy. Okay. And when did you start noticing these changes, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. It’s been…gradual. I’d say, maybe six months ago? It started with the sleep, I think. Just…not as restful. Then the energy started to fade, and the aches…well, those came later. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, it all sort of blurred together, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Six months…gradual onset. Alright. Have you noticed any fever, any unintentional weight loss or gain, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And my weight has been pretty stable, thankfully. I haven’t lost or gained anything significant. My appetite…it’s been a little off, perhaps. Not much, but sometimes I just don’t feel hungry. But I make myself eat, you know? I know I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight, slightly decreased appetite. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere specifically, besides the joint aches?
PATIENT: No, not really. The aches are mostly in my knees and hips, and sometimes my lower back. They aren’t sharp pains, more of a dull ache, really. It's not debilitating, mind you, but it’s…there. It’s constant, just varying in intensity. And it’s worse in the mornings, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Dull ache in knees, hips, and lower back, worse in the mornings… Alright. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history, if that’s okay. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ask away. Let’s see… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about ten years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication ever since. And I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago, but other than that… nothing major. Oh! And I do have some mild arthritis in my hands, but the doctor said it was nothing to worry about, just normal wear and tear.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, well-controlled, hysterectomy fifteen years ago, and mild arthritis in your hands…Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for my blood pressure. And I take a multivitamin, but that’s it, really. Just the standard, over-the-counter kind. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily, multivitamin… Alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I’m very fortunate that way. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing at all. My husband always jokes that I could eat anything! Though, he’s the one with all the sensitivities, not me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother had arthritis, quite severe towards the end of her life. And my father had heart disease, he passed away from a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And…oh, my aunt on my father’s side had diabetes. That’s about the major health concerns on both sides of the family, I believe.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes… Alright. And just a few more questions about your lifestyle, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a month, but that's it. And I wouldn't dream of using any recreational drugs. I keep a very healthy lifestyle, I do.
DOCTOR: That’s… good. Very good. Alright, Ms. Pitzel, I think it's time for a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here… Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 138 over 82. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your joints… Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. That feels a little stiff, you know? Not painful, exactly, but definitely not as smooth as it used to be. And…perhaps a bit of a creaking sound? I don't know if you can hear it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do hear some crepitus, and there's mild tenderness upon palpation. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no significant swelling. And your hips are a bit stiff as well, with some discomfort with internal rotation. Now, can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? I still have a good grip, I think. I do a lot of gardening, you see. It keeps my hands strong.
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip strength is good. No noticeable weakness. Alright, Ms. Pitzel, thank you. That will be all for the physical exam. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of osteoarthritis, possibly exacerbated by some mild hypertension. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll also do some X-rays of your knees and hips to assess the joint damage.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. Blood work and X-rays… alright. And what happens after that? When will I know the results? I’m not wanting to worry unnecessarily, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. The lab results should be back in about three to five business days, and the X-ray results will take a bit longer, perhaps a week. Once I have those results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your Lisinopril as prescribed and to try some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re experiencing discomfort. It’s also important to stay active, but to avoid activities that aggravate your joint pain. And if you’re concerned about your energy levels, make sure you’re getting enough sleep and eating a healthy diet. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Lisinopril, over-the-counter pain relief, stay active but avoid aggravation, enough sleep and a healthy diet… I can do all of that. And if I have any questions before my follow-up appointment, I should call the office, correct?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything very clearly. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. Thank you for your time and your attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I'm glad I could help. We'll get those tests scheduled and go from there. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you the lab order and schedule the X-rays. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
