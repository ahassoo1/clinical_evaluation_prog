DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's my waterworks, really. I'm having a bit of trouble… going. It just takes me ages, and it's not a strong stream, if you know what I mean. It's been going on for… oh, maybe a month now? Not getting any better.
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty with urination – taking a long time to start, a weak stream… that can certainly be bothersome. About a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer, now that I think about it. It started gradually, not all at once. I didn't think much of it at first, just thought it was… well, getting older, you know? But it hasn't improved, and sometimes I feel like I don’t empty everything out, either.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's understandable. It’s good you're bringing it to my attention now. Feeling like you don’t fully empty your bladder is important information. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you describe a typical time you urinate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I usually go to the bathroom when I feel the urge, of course. But it takes a while to start. I have to… push a little, sometimes wait a minute or two. And then it’s just… slow. Not like it used to be. And it sputters a bit, if that makes sense. It’s just… not a smooth flow. I usually have to go back in five minutes and try again to make sure I'm really done. It’s quite annoying, really. Especially when I'm out and about.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Ms. Yadao. That gives me a much better picture. So, it takes effort to initiate the stream, it's slow and intermittent, and you often feel the need to return shortly after to complete emptying. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. Not at all. It's just… frustrating. And a bit embarrassing, if I'm honest. It doesn’t hurt, it just… doesn't work properly. No fever or anything like that either. Just the slow stream and having to go back. It's more of an inconvenience than anything, but it is starting to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. The absence of pain or fever is helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh… well, no, not really. They're pretty much the same as always, if I'm honest. A little… irregular sometimes, but that's nothing new. I’ve always had a bit of trouble with that, to be fair. But no major changes recently, no. Why do you ask? Is that connected to… this problem?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Yadao. The bladder and bowel are closely connected, and sometimes issues with one can affect the other. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or any neurological issues?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I have a bit of arthritis, mostly in my knees. And the doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a little high, so I take a pill for that. Otherwise… no, nothing major. No diabetes, no high blood pressure. And certainly no neurological issues. I’m still quite sharp, you know! I remember everything. Mostly. I have Medicare, so they keep an eye on things, usually. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Yadao. Knowing about the arthritis and high cholesterol is good. And it's wonderful to hear you're feeling mentally sharp. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the pill for your cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, just a Vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was a bit low on that. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees if they're acting up, but not regularly. That's it, I think. Nothing else. I try to keep it simple, you know. I don’t like taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a young woman, a long, long time ago. And I had a hysterectomy when I was in my forties. But that was decades ago. No other surgeries, no. Nothing recent, anyway. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I've avoided the operating table for a good long while.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my mother had heart trouble, I believe. And my father had… well, he had a bit of everything, to be honest. He wasn’t a very healthy man. My sister has arthritis, like me. Nothing else springs to mind, really. It wasn't a very talkative family, you see. We didn't really discuss health problems much. I don't think anyone had problems with… well, with waterworks, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Yadao. Alright. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and I listened to her. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And I don’t drink every day. Just a little something to relax me. I'm not a big drinker, never have been. I prefer a good cup of tea, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I'm not allergic to penicillin, or any of those common things, I don’t think. I haven't had any trouble with anything, really. I’m pretty sturdy, if I do say so myself. Though I did have a bit of a rash once from a plant, a long time ago. But that wasn't an allergy, just a bit of poison ivy, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao, thank you for providing all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and, if you’re comfortable, a gentle neurological exam. And I would also like to do a quick digital rectal exam to assess the tone of your sphincter and check for any abnormalities. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh… a rectal exam? Goodness. Well… I suppose it’s necessary, if you think it’s important. I’m not terribly fond of the idea, but I trust your judgement, Doctor. I haven't had one of those in… well, a very long time. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. I’m a bit of a delicate flower, you know. But yes, go ahead, I suppose. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I understand your apprehension, and I assure you I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. We’ll take it slow, and you can let me know at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. First, I’d like you to lie down on the examination table. I will start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, if you're comfortable, we can proceed with the rectal exam. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up.
PATIENT: Alright. Here goes, then. Just… be quick, if you could, Doctor. I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. I'll try to relax, but it's not my favorite thing. And do tell me if you see anything… concerning. I'd rather know, even if it's bad news.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m applying a small amount of lubricant now. I’m checking the tone of your sphincter muscles, and assessing the rectal walls. The tone is slightly diminished, but not significantly. The rectal walls are smooth, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. I didn't feel any concerning abnormalities, Ms. Yadao. The exam was within normal limits, although the tone is slightly weaker than expected. We'll need to consider further testing to investigate the cause of your urinary symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… good to hear. Slightly weaker tone, you say? What does that mean, exactly? Is that… serious? Is it something I should be worried about? What kind of testing are we talking about? I really don’t like tests, you know. They always make me anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s good that we didn’t find anything acutely concerning, Ms. Yadao. A slightly diminished tone could be normal for someone your age, but it can also contribute to urinary difficulties. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities, and a postvoid residual measurement to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. A PVR is a non-invasive test done with a bladder scan. We might also consider a prostate-specific antigen test if you haven’t had one recently, although that’s more commonly done in men. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and guide our treatment plan. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. More tests. Alright. Urinalysis… I can understand that. And the bladder scan… is that the one where they wave a machine over your tummy? That doesn’t sound too bad. But a PSA test… isn’t that for men? I’m a woman, you know. And what if the tests show something… bad? I really don't want to think about that right now. Could we just try something simple first? Maybe some exercises, or… I don’t know… something to strengthen things up? I don’t want to go jumping to conclusions, or getting all worked up over nothing.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask those questions, Ms. Yadao. It’s important to be informed and feel comfortable with our plan. The PSA test is typically used for men to screen for prostate cancer, and it is not routinely recommended for women. My apologies for mentioning it, it was an oversight. We can absolutely start with more conservative measures before jumping to more invasive testing. Kegel exercises, also known as pelvic floor exercises, can help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and improve urinary control. I can provide you with instructions on how to perform them correctly. We can also try timed voiding, which involves urinating on a regular schedule, even if you don't feel the urge. I still recommend the urinalysis to rule out infection, as that would need to be treated promptly. If the symptoms persist despite these measures, then we can discuss further investigations, like a bladder scan to check for residual urine. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Doctor. Exercises and timed voiding… I can try that. I’m not very good at remembering things, but I’ll do my best. And the urinalysis… alright, if you think it’s important. But no more poking and prodding, please. And if it turns out to be something serious… well, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. It’s just… getting older isn’t easy, you know. Everything starts to… wear out.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I understand completely. Getting older does come with changes, and it’s perfectly normal to experience concerns like these. I’m happy to work with you to find a solution that’s comfortable and effective. I’ll write you a prescription for a urine sample container, and instructions for how to collect a clean sample. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss your progress and review the results of the urinalysis. In the meantime, please start the exercises and timed voiding, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here is a handout with instructions on Kegel exercises. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. You’ve put my mind at ease. I'll try my best with the exercises, and I'll get that urine sample taken as soon as possible. Two weeks… alright. Thank you. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Goodbye, and take care.
