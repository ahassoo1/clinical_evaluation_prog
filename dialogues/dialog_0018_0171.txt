DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Umm… hi. Yeah, it's the nails. They just… look funny. I don't really know why I'm here, to be honest. Just thought I should get them checked. They’re not… pretty.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always best to get things checked out if you have any concerns, even if you're not sure what's causing them. “Not pretty” is a perfectly valid reason to seek medical attention, Ms. Thut. Could you describe what you mean by “funny”?
PATIENT: Well… they're kinda… thick. And yellowish. Not like a nice yellow, more like… old. Like old, dirty plastic, you know? And one of them… it feels kinda loose. Not falling off, but… wiggly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe I understand. Thickening, discoloration, and a feeling of looseness… those are all important details. Ms. Thut, to help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me when you first noticed these changes to your nails?
PATIENT: Umm… oh geez. Honestly? I don't remember. A while, definitely. Maybe… last fall? Or was it winter? Everything kinda blends together, you know? I don’t pay much attention to my hands. I work, I eat, I sleep. That's about it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Thut. It’s very common not to notice small changes gradually occurring. “A while ago” is a helpful starting point. And to clarify, you’ve noticed these changes on all of your nails, or just one or a few?
PATIENT: Just… most of them. Not the little pinky ones, usually. They seem fine. But the big ones, and the ones next to them… yeah, those are the bad ones. I don't know why they're bad. Maybe I just don't wash my hands enough? Though I do use hand sanitizer, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily affecting the larger nails, with the smaller ones appearing normal. And you’ve noticed this along with periods of hand sanitizing. Ms. Thut, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these nail changes?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not really. I mean, I get a little tired, but who doesn't? And sometimes my feet hurt after work, but that's just 'cause I'm on them all day. I don’t really get… other symptoms. Just… the nails. And the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. No associated illness, just the nail changes and occasional fatigue. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Um, I had something with my… gallbladder? A long time ago. They took it out. That was… a while back. And I think my blood pressure is a little high, but I don’t take anything for it. The doctor just tells me to watch the salt. That's about it, I think. I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of gallbladder removal and elevated blood pressure, currently managed with dietary restrictions. Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Thut. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for my head, if it’s really bad. But it’s just… ibuprofen, I think. The regular kind. And maybe a vitamin D in the winter, but I forget most of the time. It's just… stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional ibuprofen for headaches and sporadic vitamin D supplementation. Ms. Thut, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Umm… allergies? Not that I know of. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but that's just the weather. And dust. Dust makes me sneeze. But that's not an allergy, is it? I don't swell up or anything. No, I don't think I have any real allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known drug or food allergies. Now, regarding your family history—are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh boy. That’s… complicated. My mother… she had… something with her heart. A long time ago. And my brother… he had trouble with his… lungs? I don’t really remember the details. Everyone on my side is a little… sickly. It's just… how it is. We don't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: I understand. A family history of heart and lung issues. It’s alright if you don’t know all the specifics, Ms. Thut. Any information you can recall is helpful. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not! Never. I don't like any of that stuff. It's bad for you. Just… work. That's all I do. And eat. And sleep. That's my lifestyle. Perfectly boring, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Thut. A healthy lifestyle is what matters. Now, I'd like to take a closer look at your nails. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. Go ahead. Just… don't take too long. I have things to do. Though I can’t remember what they are…
DOCTOR: Alright. As you described, the larger nails do appear significantly thicker and have a yellowish discoloration. There’s a slight ridging to the surface, and I notice some subungual debris—a build-up under the nails. The texture feels somewhat brittle. The looseness you mentioned is present on several nails, particularly at the distal end. I’m noting some mild onycholysis—separation of the nail plate from the nail bed. It doesn't appear acutely inflamed, which is reassuring. Based on your history and this examination, the most likely cause is onychomycosis—a fungal infection of the nails. However, other conditions can mimic this, such as psoriasis or trauma. To confirm the diagnosis, we’ll need to send a sample to the lab for microscopic examination and fungal culture.
PATIENT: Fungus? Like… in my nails? That sounds… gross. Is it… contagious? Will I have to throw away all my shoes?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Thut. It can be unsettling to think about a fungal infection. Yes, onychomycosis is caused by a fungus. It’s not usually dangerous, but it can be persistent and, as you rightly point out, unpleasant. Regarding contagiousness, it can spread, but it’s not highly contagious. It typically spreads through direct contact or by sharing contaminated nail care tools. You do not need to throw away your shoes. Good hygiene practices—keeping your feet clean and dry, wearing breathable socks—can help prevent its spread. We will discuss preventative measures after the diagnosis is confirmed. To confirm the diagnosis, I’m going to order a nail clipping culture. It will involve taking a small sample from several affected nails and sending it to the lab. It usually takes about two weeks to get the results back. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Oh geez. I hope I don't forget about it. Well, I guess so. If you think it's necessary. Just… don't make it painful. I don't like pain. And can you tell me… what do I do if it is fungus? Is there a cream or something?
DOCTOR: It won’t be painful at all, Ms. Thut. It’s a very quick and simple procedure. I’ll just carefully clip a small piece from under the nail—enough for the lab to analyze. If the culture confirms onychomycosis, the treatment options depend on the severity of the infection. Topical antifungal medications are sometimes effective for mild cases, but they often require a long course of treatment—several months—and have a lower success rate. For more severe cases, oral antifungal medications are typically recommended. These are more effective but require monitoring by your doctor, as they can have potential side effects. We would discuss the risks and benefits of each option if it is confirmed. I’ll send this to the lab today. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails trimmed short and dry. Avoid sharing nail clippers or files with others. I’ll also give you a handout with information about onychomycosis and proper nail hygiene. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… a handout sounds good. Maybe it’ll help me remember things. No… I don't think so. Just… thank you. I guess. It's just… nice to know what's going on. Even if it's something gross.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Thut. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the handout. It has information on symptoms, prevention, and treatment options. I’ll contact you as soon as the lab results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any significant pain, redness, or swelling around your nails, please contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Honestly, I'm a little tired of talking about my nails. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll… try to remember everything you said.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. It's perfectly understandable. I'll be in touch when the lab results return. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions in the meantime. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
