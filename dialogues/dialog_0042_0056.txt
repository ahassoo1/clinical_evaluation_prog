DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Schlatterer is fine. Honestly, I haven’t the time for pleasantries. It’s… the university, you see. The students. The… paperwork. It’s all rather dreadful. I believe it’s causing… a bit of strain. Though what a doctor such as yourself could do about it, I’m not entirely certain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're experiencing stress related to your work at the university. While I can't remove the stress, we can certainly explore how it's affecting you physically and emotionally, and discuss ways to manage it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about what this “strain” feels like?
PATIENT: “Feels like?” Really, Doctor, must we delve into such… subjective matters? It feels… unpleasant. Exhausting. I find myself… irritable. And the paperwork! Mountains of it. It's simply… demoralizing. I used to have such bright students, now it's all… well, never mind. It's a waste of good stationery, that's what it is. Is there a quicker way to get this over with? I have a lecture to prepare, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Schlatterer. It is frustrating when work feels overwhelming, and I apologize for asking you to describe something difficult. Even describing it can sometimes be helpful. Let's try to be a bit more specific. When did you start noticing this increased irritability and exhaustion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult to say precisely. Some time ago, I suppose. Months, certainly. Perhaps… a year? It's all a blur, to be frank. The semesters run together, the students change, the paperwork… never ends. It’s not as if I’ve been meticulously tracking my… emotional state, Doctor. I have scholarly pursuits, you see. Important things.
DOCTOR: I understand. A year, roughly. And has anything specific happened around that time that might have contributed to this increasing stress?
PATIENT: Specific…? Well, there was that… administrative restructuring. A complete mess, if you ask me. Young Mr. Petrov was put in charge. No experience, absolutely none. Implemented all sorts of… new policies. Digital forms, online submissions… utterly ridiculous. The students couldn’t manage it, and frankly, neither could I. It was a disaster. Though whether that's the cause of my… discomfort, I couldn't say with certainty. It certainly didn’t help. Honestly, it’s all rather… chaotic.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful. It sounds like the changes with Mr. Petrov’s restructuring caused a significant disruption and added to your workload. Beyond the irritability and exhaustion, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Though that could simply be a matter of age, couldn’t it? And I sleep… fitfully. Wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about… essays, grading, the endless… bureaucracy. It's not a restful existence, Doctor. And I've been… less inclined to socialize. All rather dreadful, really. But I assure you, I’m perfectly capable. Just… a bit worn down, perhaps. Though I don’t need a diagnosis to tell me that. Is there a point to all these questions?
DOCTOR: There is a point, Mr. Schlatterer. We're building a complete picture of how this stress is affecting you, which helps determine the best course of action. The changes in appetite and sleep, along with the decreased socializing, are all things we need to consider. Now, have you experienced any physical symptoms, such as headaches, muscle tension, or stomach problems?
PATIENT: Headaches, yes. Occasionally. A dull ache, mostly. And my shoulders… they feel rather tense. I blame the poor posture, all those years bent over books. And, yes, my stomach… it’s not entirely reliable. Though I suspect that’s simply the… quality of the cafeteria food. Honestly, Doctor, are we going to discuss my diet now? This is becoming rather… tedious. I'm a scholar, not a medical case study. Is there anything practical you can offer? A pill, perhaps? Something to get me through the semester? I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, and I apologize if the questions feel tedious. We are getting closer to understanding the best course of action for you. A pill may be an option, but it's important to rule out other potential causes and consider a holistic approach. Before we discuss medication, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? Is that necessary? I assure you, my physical health is perfectly… adequate. I walk, I breathe, I function. I haven’t the time for such… procedures. Frankly, it seems rather… excessive. I came here to discuss stress, not to be poked and prodded like some… common ailment. Though, if you insist… but I expect it to be brief. Very brief. I have a lecture to prepare, you know. A rather important one. And frankly, I'm starting to feel… agitated. Perhaps we should just skip to the… remedy? A small dosage, just to get me through.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Schlatterer. It truly is a quick exam, just to get a baseline and rule out any underlying physical causes that could be contributing to your symptoms. It will only take a few minutes. I promise to be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. If you could just relax your arm for me…
PATIENT: Very well. But I must insist – be quick about it. And please, avoid any unnecessary… conversation. My nerves are already quite frayed. Honestly, the indignity of it all… a professor subjected to a routine physical exam. It’s simply… appalling. But proceed, I suppose. Though I assure you, the results will be entirely… normal. Perfectly normal. Just get it over with. And then… the remedy, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm… good. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148/92. That's not drastically high, but it’s something we should be aware of, especially given your stress levels. Heart sounds are regular, but a slightly fast rhythm. 88 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear. Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your heart rate is a bit fast. Everything else seems normal. Now, before we discuss medication, would you be open to discussing some lifestyle changes that might help manage your stress?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting I take up gardening? Or perhaps join a yoga class? I assure you, my lifestyle is perfectly… adequate. I read, I write, I lecture. These are the pursuits of a scholar. I haven’t the time for frivolous activities. And frankly, the idea of discussing “lifestyle changes” with a doctor is… insulting. I came here for a solution, a remedy. Not a lecture on proper breathing techniques. Honestly, this is becoming quite… tiresome. If you have a pill that will get me through the semester, I would be grateful. If not… well, I suppose I shall have to endure. But please, spare me the platitudes. I’m a professor, not a… patient.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. I certainly wasn’t suggesting anything frivolous, and I apologize if it came across that way. I respect your dedication to your work. However, given your elevated blood pressure and heart rate, simply masking the symptoms with medication without addressing the underlying stress may not be the best long-term solution. I am hesitant to prescribe medication without further investigation. Would you be open to having some basic blood work done to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms?
PATIENT: Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, are you attempting to prolong this ordeal? I assure you, my blood is perfectly… ordinary. I eat a reasonable diet, I sleep , and I do not engage in any… illicit activities. The idea of subjecting myself to a laboratory examination is… appalling. It’s a complete waste of time, and frankly, it’s insulting to my intelligence. I came here for a solution, a remedy. Not a medical inquisition. If you are unwilling to provide me with a simple pill to get through the semester, then I see no point in continuing this… charade. I shall simply have to endure. Though I assure you, my performance will suffer. And frankly, the university will be the one to pay the price. I think… I think I’ve had enough. Are we finished here? I have a lecture to prepare, you know. And I’m starting to feel… quite unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s clear you’re not comfortable with further testing or medication at this time. I respect your decision. Given your reluctance, I won’t push the issue. However, I strongly encourage you to consider some stress management techniques, even if it’s just taking a few moments each day to relax and disconnect. Here's a summary of our consultation: you're experiencing stress related to your work at the university, which is manifesting as irritability, exhaustion, sleep disturbances, and a decreased appetite. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your heart rate is a bit fast. I'll document everything in your chart. If you change your mind about further investigation or medication, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Thank you for your time, Mr. Schlatterer. I wish you all the best. .
