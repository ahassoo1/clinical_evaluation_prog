DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's right. Um... well, it's my... going to the bathroom. It's been a little hard lately. Not painful, just... hard to start. You know? Like it takes a long time. I don't really remember when it started, though. My husband, he says it's been a few weeks, maybe?
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And you said it's not painful, just difficult to initiate urination?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not pain. Just… takes a bit. And sometimes, after I do go, it doesn't feel like all of it comes out, if that makes sense? I have to... try again a little later. It's a bother, mostly. I don't know if that's normal, at my age. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a rather subjective term, Ms. Stoffregen. It can be common to experience changes in urinary function with age, but that doesn't mean it should be dismissed. The incomplete emptying you describe is something we should investigate further. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain accompanying this difficulty?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. Not that I know of. My daughter checks on me, she would know. Chills… maybe sometimes I feel a little cold, but that’s just the house, you know? It gets drafty. Abdominal pain… hmm. Not really pain, exactly. Just… a little uncomfortable sometimes, down low. Like a… fullness. Does that make sense? It's not sharp, it's just... there. I don't pay it much mind, usually.
DOCTOR: "Fullness," alright. And this discomfort, does it come and go, or is it fairly constant?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, definitely. Some days I don’t notice it at all. Other days… well, other days it feels like I need to go, even if I just went. It’s funny, really. Old age, I suppose. Everything starts to… wobble a bit. My memory is the worst, though! I forget what I had for breakfast half the time. Do you think… is this just old age, Doctor?
DOCTOR: While some changes are common with age, Ms. Stoffregen, we can't simply attribute everything to that. It's my responsibility to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Have you experienced any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness. I… I don't think so. Not that I recall. I always just assume it’s something I ate, you know? Sometimes beets make things look a little funny. My daughter would notice if there was blood, wouldn’t she? She's very good about checking things. I really don't think there's been blood, though. It just sounds awful, thinking about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Oh dear. Well, you know, getting old means everything changes a bit. Sometimes things are a little… loose. Sometimes a little… stuck. It goes back and forth. Nothing major, though. Not like it's keeping me up at night or anything. My husband makes a lot of prune juice, which helps. Is that what you’re asking about? Prune juice? Is that important?
DOCTOR: Prune juice can be helpful, yes. I was simply trying to get a complete picture of your overall health. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. Let me think… Doctor Miller, a long time ago, said my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a little pill, but I stopped taking it. It made me feel dizzy, and my husband didn't like it. And… I think I had a little bit of the sugar, you know, a little while back. Not bad sugar, just a little bit high, the nurse said. I don’t really keep track of all that. It was all so long ago. And I had a bad fall last year, broke my wrist. That’s about all I can remember, really. Everything’s a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. You mentioned a fall last year and a broken wrist. Were you hospitalized for that?
PATIENT: Oh yes, dear. I was in the hospital for a few days. They had to set the wrist, you see. And I had some therapy afterwards. It still aches sometimes, especially when it's cold. They gave me something for the pain, but I didn't like how it made me feel, so I stopped taking that too. Everything has side effects, doesn’t it? My husband wasn’t happy about me stopping the pain pills either. He worries a lot. I think he remembers more than I do, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to medications. Aside from the pills you stopped taking, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... My daughter brings me a little pill every morning, for my heart, she says. And I take a little something for my bones, calcium, I think. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for that, but I forget what it’s called. It’s a little white pill. I can’t really remember much about it, though. It just helps the ache a little bit. My daughter mostly keeps track of all that. I just take what she gives me. It's all a bit confusing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies... Hmm. Not that I know of. I like flowers, I have a garden. Never had any trouble with those. I think I was a little itchy once after eating shrimp, a long time ago, but I couldn’t really say it was an allergy. I just didn't eat shrimp again. My husband says I’m not allergic to anything, he's very sure about that. He always knows best. I don't really remember having any bad reactions to anything, come to think of it. It’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. That includes checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, of course. My blood pressure is probably high, my husband keeps telling me. And my heart… well, it skips a beat sometimes. I’ve gotten used to it. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I’m ready. Just try not to poke too hard, my bones are a little sore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. 160 over 90. As expected. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart rate is regular, but slightly fast. I hear some mild crackling in the lower lungs. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no masses or significant distension. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal, though we'll need to investigate the crackling in your lungs and the difficulty you're having with urination.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? Crackling in my lungs? I do cough a little bit sometimes, especially in the mornings. My husband says it's just a little bit of phlegm. But is it bad? Should I be worried? And the urination… is that serious? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. It's very bothersome. Is it something you can fix, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, Ms. Stoffregen, but it does warrant further investigation. The crackling in your lungs could be indicative of some fluid buildup, possibly related to a mild infection or early congestive heart failure. To determine the cause, I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a urine analysis. The urine analysis will help us rule out an infection and check for any abnormalities. As for the difficulty with urination, it could be a sign of an enlarged prostate – though that’s less common in women – or a weakened bladder. We'll also need to check your kidney function with a blood test. I want to be thorough, so we'll get all the necessary information before making a diagnosis.
PATIENT: Oh dear. All those tests… it sounds like a lot. Blood tests and X-rays… will it hurt? My daughter always says I’m a bit of a worrywart. And what if it is something bad? I don't want to be stuck in the hospital again. My husband would be so worried. Can’t you just give me something for the urination, Doctor? Maybe a little pill? I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Stoffregen. The tests are relatively simple and shouldn’t cause any significant discomfort. The blood test involves a small needle prick, and the X-ray is painless – you’ll simply stand or sit while the image is taken. While I appreciate your desire for a quick fix, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible. We need to identify the underlying cause of your urinary difficulties before determining the appropriate treatment. A pill might mask the symptoms temporarily, but it won’t address the root of the problem. It's possible the cause is benign, such as a simple urinary tract infection, or a medication side effect, but we need to be sure. I assure you, my goal is to get you feeling better as quickly and safely as possible. We'll review the test results as soon as they’re available, and I’ll explain everything clearly and discuss the best course of action. Now, do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. You're right, I suppose. I don't want to just cover up the problem. My husband always says I need to be sensible. The tests… will they take long? I have a bridge club meeting on Thursday. And what if the results are… bad? Will you tell me everything? I don't want to be kept in the dark. My daughter is very good at understanding medical things, maybe I should bring her along next time? She’s much better at asking questions than I am. I always forget what I want to ask. Is it alright if she comes with me to the next appointment?
DOCTOR: The tests shouldn’t take long – the blood test will take about 15-20 minutes, and the X-ray will be even quicker. We should have the results back within a few days. As for your concerns about the results, I assure you I will be completely transparent and explain everything in detail. You have every right to know. And absolutely, please feel free to bring your daughter to your next appointment. Having someone with you to help remember details and ask questions is perfectly acceptable. In fact, I encourage it. Now, while we're waiting for the test results, I'm going to recommend increasing your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water a day. This can help flush out your system and may alleviate some of the urinary discomfort. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. Do you have any difficulty drinking that much water?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear about the daughter. She’s very organized, bless her heart. And the water… well, yes, a little bit. I don’t always remember to drink enough. My husband tries to get me to, but I get distracted easily. I like a little bit of tea with my biscuits, is that alright? It's not coffee, is it? I don't really like coffee. And I always have a little bit of sherry before dinner, does that count as fluid? It’s good for the digestion, you know. I don’t want to upset my stomach, I’m a bit sensitive. Perhaps I can have a little bit of water with my sherry? Is that alright, Doctor? You look a bit concerned. Are eight glasses too much?
DOCTOR: While tea and sherry do contain fluids, they don't provide the same benefits as water. Caffeine in tea can actually dehydrate you, and alcohol can irritate the bladder. I understand your fondness for these beverages, but for the next week, while we await the results, I’d like you to focus on increasing your plain water intake. If you find it difficult to drink eight glasses, start with six and gradually increase it. It's about minimizing bladder irritation and maximizing hydration. And yes, six glasses is a perfectly reasonable goal. Ms. Stoffregen, I understand that change can be difficult, but adhering to these simple recommendations will help us get a clearer picture of your condition and determine the best course of action. I want to work with you, but it’s essential to be honest about your habits and follow the guidelines as closely as possible. Do you think you can commit to increasing your water intake and minimizing caffeine and alcohol for the next week?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, dear. You’re right. I should be more sensible. I can try. Six glasses of water… I can manage that. And I’ll try to cut back on the tea and sherry. My husband will be pleased. He always says I worry too much and don’t take care of myself. He's a good man, bless him. But it’s so hard to remember everything! Perhaps my daughter can help me with a schedule? She's very good at organizing things. And maybe I’ll try to keep a little notebook, to remind me to drink the water. Yes, that’s a good idea. Yes, I can commit to that. Six glasses of water, less tea and sherry, and a little notebook. Will that do, Doctor? Is that enough? I don’t want to disappoint you.
DOCTOR: That is absolutely perfect, Ms. Stoffregen. That's all I ask. We’ll review the test results next week and discuss the next steps. And don't worry about disappointing me—I understand that making changes can be challenging. Just do your best. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very patient with me, thank you. You explained everything so clearly. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what to expect. And I'm glad my daughter can come with me next time. She’ll ask all the right questions, I'm sure. Oh, but one thing... will the tests hurt my bridge club meeting? I don't want to miss it. It's on Thursday, and I'm playing with Mrs. Gable, and she's very competitive. Will the tests take long enough to ruin my bridge meeting?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Stoffregen, the tests will not interfere with your bridge meeting. The blood test and X-ray will take approximately 30-45 minutes total, and we can schedule them for earlier in the week to ensure you’re free for Thursday. It shouldn't disrupt your plans at all. Alright then. I’ll have the receptionist schedule your tests, and please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Stoffregen. And enjoy your bridge game.
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful! Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease. I'm so glad it won’t interfere with my bridge meeting. Mrs. Gable would be very upset if I missed it.
