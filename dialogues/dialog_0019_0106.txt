DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about my foot. It’s just… awful. A sore, really. A bad one. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better with what I’ve been trying. I suppose that's why I’m here. You’d think at my age, things would stop falling apart, wouldn’t you?
DOCTOR: You’d think so, wouldn’t you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Don’t I know it. Everything aches, everything breaks… and this foot is just the latest nuisance. It’s on my left foot, by the way. Near my toes. And it smells… well, it’s not pleasant, if I’m honest. I’ve been putting ointment on it, the kind they sell at the store, but it doesn't seem to be doing much good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a sore on your left foot, near your toes, that’s been bothering you for weeks despite using over-the-counter ointment. And you’ve noticed a smell?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A bad smell. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been fastidious about my hygiene. Always. So, for it to smell like that… it’s concerning. And it’s painful, too. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache that throbs sometimes, especially if I try to walk too much. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Now… just getting to the market is an ordeal.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull, throbbing ache, worse with walking, and a concerning odor despite good hygiene… Okay. Louine, I’d like to take a closer look. Would you mind if we examined your foot?
PATIENT: Well, of course. That's what I came here for, isn't it? Just… be gentle, please. My skin is rather thin these days. And don’t be surprised if it’s a bit… unsightly. I assure you, I used to take very good care of myself. Not like some people I know.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. And don't worry about a thing. We'll just take a look and see what's going on. Okay… I see some redness and swelling around your toes, and a small open area. It does seem a bit tender to the touch. And I can see some discharge. Do you have any diabetes, Louine?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Why do you ask? I eat a perfectly healthy diet. Mostly fish and taro. Although my daughter keeps trying to get me to eat those… what are they called… quinoa? But no, I haven’t been told I have anything like that. Are you suggesting I have something? Because my late husband, God rest his soul, he was a very healthy man. Never a sick day in his life.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I caused any concern, Louine. I ask because diabetes can sometimes cause foot problems and slow healing, which is why I always want to rule it out. It doesn’t mean you have it, just that we need to consider it. Now, back to your foot. Have you noticed any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven’t. Not a bit. I take my temperature every morning, always have. Good habit, you know. And it’s been perfectly normal. I haven’t been feeling sick, just… uncomfortable. This foot is a constant nuisance, that’s all. And I really do wish people wouldn't make such a fuss over quinoa. It's just… grainy. Is this foot going to require a lot of… fuss? Because I really don't have the energy for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: No fuss is my aim, Louine. We'll take things one step at a time. So, no fever, and you’re feeling generally okay, just uncomfortable with the foot. Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think… I used to have a bit of a reaction to some cream my mother used to give me for eczema when I was a child. Made my skin itch something awful. But that was decades ago. And I don't recall anything else. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Except perhaps to quinoa. Really, Doctor, it’s a terrible grain. Why anyone would want to eat it is beyond me. Now, what about this foot? Are you going to give me something for it?
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings about quinoa, Louine. We can certainly agree to disagree. Now, regarding your foot. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m seeing, it seems you may have an infection. The redness, swelling, discharge, and odor are all consistent with that. To be sure, I’d like to send a sample of the discharge to the lab for a culture. This will tell us exactly what kind of infection it is, and what antibiotic will be most effective. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An infection? Goodness. That sounds… unpleasant. So you're going to take a bit of this sore and… send it away? Like a letter? To who? And what sort of antibiotic? I don't want anything too strong. I get a bit… delicate, you know. And I certainly don’t want anything that will interfere with my fish. I need my protein. Is this going to be expensive? Because Medicare… well, they don’t cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll take a small sample of the discharge – it’s a very quick and usually painless procedure, like a tiny scrape. We’ll send it to the lab; it’s not like sending a letter, but more like sending it for analysis. This will help us identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. As for the antibiotic, we’ll choose one that’s gentle yet effective, and one that won’t interfere with your diet. We’ll definitely discuss all options before starting anything. And regarding the cost, let me check with Medicare to see what’s covered. We’ll have a billing specialist help you with that, so you don't have to worry about a thing. Would you like me to proceed with the sample collection?
PATIENT: Well… if you’re going to be gentle. And if you promise it won’t interfere with my fish. And if someone is really going to check with Medicare. Alright, go ahead. But if it hurts, I’m warning you. I have a very low tolerance for pain these days. And I don't want any fuss. Just a quick scrape, you said? And then we’ll talk about Medicare?
DOCTOR: Yes, a quick and gentle scrape. I promise. And we’ll definitely talk about Medicare afterwards. Okay, all done. That was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Hmph. Quick, perhaps. But not entirely painless. Still… it’s over now. What happens next? Do I have to wait a long time for these… results? And what about this Medicare? Because I have a doctor’s appointment next week, and I really don’t want to be worrying about bills when I should be resting. And can we please stop talking about quinoa? It’s giving me a headache.
DOCTOR: Yes, it shouldn't take too long for the results – usually a couple of days. I'll have my assistant contact you as soon as they’re available. And I’ll also have the billing specialist reach out to you today regarding Medicare coverage – they’ll be able to give you a clearer picture of the costs. And absolutely, no more quinoa talk. I promise. In the meantime, I'm going to clean and dress the sore to help keep it protected. Then I’ll give you some instructions on how to care for it at home. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it doesn’t involve quinoa. Cleaning and dressing sounds… sensible. And I do like sensible. I used to be very good at dressing wounds, you know. During the war, I volunteered at the hospital. A very useful skill. But my eyesight isn't what it used to be. Just make sure it’s covered properly. I don’t want to get any dirt in it. And tell me… is this serious? Am I going to have to have my foot… amputated?
DOCTOR: It's good you have that experience, Louine. And I'm happy to help with the dressing today. Now, regarding your question… No, you are not going to have your foot amputated. It’s important to address this infection promptly, and that's what we’re doing. The vast majority of foot infections are treated successfully with antibiotics and proper wound care. We'll monitor your progress closely, and if things aren't improving, we'll explore other options, but amputation is not on the table at this time. I want to be honest with you, Louine. Since you are older, and might not heal as quickly, it’s important to be diligent with the care instructions, and to watch for any signs of worsening infection – increased redness, swelling, pain, or fever. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Increased redness… swelling… fever… Oh dear. It sounds… alarming. So I have to watch it? Like a hawk? I don’t have the eyesight for that anymore. And what if I do notice something? Who do I call? Do I have to go to the hospital? I really hate hospitals. They’re so… cold. And the food is dreadful. This is all very stressful. I just wanted someone to fix my foot, not give me a list of things to worry about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. It can feel overwhelming, but we'll make sure you feel supported every step of the way. You don't have to watch it like a hawk, but simply be aware of any changes. If you notice increased redness, swelling, pain, or develop a fever, please call my office immediately. We have a nurse on call 24/7 who can advise you. And no, you likely won't need to go to the hospital. We can manage this infection in the office. If things were to worsen significantly, then we might consider a hospital visit, but that's not our expectation right now. I’m going to give you a written set of instructions with all of this information – how to care for the wound, what to watch for, and the phone number to call. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Written instructions… Yes, that would be very helpful. I’m terrible at remembering things these days. And please, make sure the phone number is large and clear. My eyesight, you know. And… is it alright if I ask my daughter to help me with this? She's very organized. A bit bossy, perhaps, but she means well. She’s always telling me what I should be doing. But she's good at reading small print. And… will this infection affect my fish? I’m rather fond of my fish.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make sure the instructions are clear and easy to read, with a large phone number. And absolutely, please ask your daughter to help you – having someone assist you is a great idea. And don’t worry, this infection will not affect your fish. There's no reason why you can't continue to enjoy your meals. Here are the instructions. Please don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve been very patient with me. And you haven't mentioned quinoa once. That’s a definite plus. I suppose I should get going. My daughter will be expecting me. She’s probably already making a list of all the things I need to do. Thank you, Doctor. I hope this infection clears up quickly. And I hope my fish is safe.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Louine. I'm glad I could help. And don’t worry about your fish – it's perfectly safe. Please, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be checking in with you soon. Have a good day, Louine. And give your daughter my best.
