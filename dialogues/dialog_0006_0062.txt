DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Gorga. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here regarding the requirements for masks at my place of work. It’s…causing a bit of a difficulty, and I was advised to seek an exemption, if possible. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and the masks are…uncomfortable, and I've been having some trouble with them.
DOCTOR: Right, masks…okay. Protective Service Worker, that's…demanding work. And you're saying they're causing discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Discomfort is…a mild way to put it. They make it difficult to breathe, particularly when I’m needing to be…active. It impacts my ability to do the job safely, both for myself and those I assist. I didn’t realize they would be such a hindrance. It wasn't discussed during hiring, you see.
DOCTOR: Hm. Okay. And when did this start becoming a problem?
PATIENT: It began approximately two weeks ago, Doctor. The clinic implemented the new policy then, requiring all staff to wear them at all times while on the premises, and during client visits. Before that, it was only when directly interacting with someone who was unwell. The change was…sudden. It’s not that I am opposed to safety measures, mind you. It’s just…this feels excessive.
DOCTOR: Excessive… right. Okay. Have you tried different types of masks?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. My employer provided us with the standard surgical masks, and also some of the cloth ones. I've also purchased a few of the N95 types, hoping they might be better. Unfortunately, they all cause the same difficulty with breathing, and they become quite warm and…claustrophobic. I tried adjusting the straps, but it doesn’t seem to alleviate the problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any underlying medical conditions – anything at all – that might make wearing a mask more difficult?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question, Doctor. I do not have any diagnosed conditions, no. I’m generally a healthy man, I believe. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in…well, some time, to be honest. I lead an active life, and have always been strong. It’s only this mask situation that’s causing me concern. I have no shortness of breath normally, no asthma, no heart trouble…nothing of that nature.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known conditions…Alright. Have you ever had issues with anxiety or panic attacks?
PATIENT: That’s a thoughtful question. I’ve never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, no. However, I do admit to feeling…a bit confined when wearing the mask. It’s not a full panic, mind you, but a sense of unease and…difficulty focusing. It’s a strange sensation, honestly. It’s like my breathing is restricted, and it makes me more aware of my surroundings, and…a little on edge. It doesn't happen all the time, only when I'm wearing it for extended periods.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some feelings of confinement, more awareness of your surroundings. Right. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs just to be sure everything sounds clear. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds prudent. I have no objection at all. I want to assure you, Doctor, I am not attempting to avoid following safety protocols. I simply wish to ensure I can perform my duties effectively and safely, without undue hindrance. I will cooperate fully with whatever you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally through your mouth, please. Deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Okay, lungs sound clear. Heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from talking. Nothing concerning there either. Do you feel any chest pain or dizziness currently?
PATIENT: No, sir, I do not. No chest pain, and no dizziness. I appreciate you listening, and checking. My heart does tend to race a bit when I'm…stressed, you see. It’s a common occurrence for me. The deep breathing exercise is actually quite calming, if I may say so. It’s a useful technique. Is there anything else you’d like to check, Doctor? Perhaps my oxygen levels? I’m willing to do whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s check your oxygen saturation. Just a quick pulse oximeter reading. Okay, 98 percent. That’s good. Normal. It sounds like you’re otherwise healthy, and your oxygen levels are fine. This is…unusual. It sounds like it could be related to anxiety or a feeling of claustrophobia, but we need to be careful about issuing an exemption without exploring all possibilities. I’d like to refer you to a specialist – a pulmonologist, just to be sure there isn’t something underlying we’re missing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds…sensible, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. A pulmonologist, you say? I am perfectly willing to consult with a specialist. I want to rule out any potential medical reasons for this discomfort, and I understand the importance of caution. May I ask what the next steps would be? Would you handle the referral, or would I need to contact someone myself? And, if you don’t mind my asking, approximately how long would such a consultation typically take? I have a demanding schedule, you see, and I need to make arrangements accordingly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll handle the referral for you. I’ll send it to Dr. Eleanor Vance – she’s excellent. A good pulmonologist. It usually takes a week or two to get an appointment, sometimes longer. The consultation itself will probably take about an hour – maybe a little longer, depending on what tests she wants to run. It will involve some breathing tests, possibly a chest X-ray. Here's the referral information. The receptionist will help you schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if things get significantly worse – if you feel dizzy, or experience chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Don’t wait. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is perfectly clear. Dr. Vance, you say? I will certainly make an appointment with her as soon as possible. I appreciate you handling the referral, and for providing such a detailed explanation. The warning regarding the emergency room is also well-received. I will heed your advice. I believe that covers all my questions for now. Thank you for your time, Doctor Gorga, and for your thorough examination. I feel much better knowing we are taking a systematic approach to this issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. Glad I could help, Mr. Knabenshue. If you have any issues scheduling the appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. And please, don't delay getting it done. Have a good day. Next patient…
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have my word. I will schedule the appointment promptly. I wish you a pleasant day as well.
