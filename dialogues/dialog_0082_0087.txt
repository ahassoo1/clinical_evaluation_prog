DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think? The lady on the phone said something about it. Honestly, I don't really remember all the details. Been a bit fuzzy lately. Just want to get it done, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We do have some routine lab work scheduled for you. Let's see… the notes here say a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Does that ring any bells?
PATIENT: Comprehensive… metabolic… sounds important. No, it doesn't really. I told you, Doctor, I don't recall specifics. Is it… painful? I hate needles. Though, to be fair, I don't remember having blood work done recently. Maybe it's been a while.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not painful, Mr. Croonquist. Just a quick pinch. A very quick pinch, and then it’s over. We try to be as gentle as possible. And you are right to question – it's good to be thorough. Let me pull up your records on the computer here… Ah, it looks like this is your first blood work with us, actually. It was recommended by Dr. Anya Sharma, during your new patient visit last month. She wanted to get a baseline for your overall health. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Sharma… that name is familiar. Last month, you say? Hmm… I see a lot of doctors, you know? Or, I think I do. It's all a bit of a blur. A baseline… alright, that makes sense. If Dr. Sharma said so, it must be important. Just… how long will this take? I have… things to do. Not that I remember what those things are, exactly. But still.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. We'll get through this as quickly as we can. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes, and then the lab usually takes about a week to get the results back to us. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, let's just get the blood work done, and then we'll see what Dr. Sharma had in mind. Before we do that, though, I just want to quickly go over a few things, just to be sure. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Though, again, my memory isn't what it used to be. Latex… is that in gloves? The doctors wear gloves, right? I suppose I haven't noticed. If I was allergic, they'd have told me by now, wouldn't they? Just get it over with, please. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, latex is in gloves. And you are right to think they would have noticed if you had a reaction before. Good. Alright, then. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few quick questions about your current health. Have you been experiencing any unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms… hmm. Well, I'm tired a lot. But I'm 73, Doctor. Isn't that just… normal? My joints ache, too. And I forget things. Like I’ve already told you. Everything feels… slow. I don't know if that's a symptom. It just is. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Croonquist. It’s good to know what you’re experiencing, even if it seems normal for your age. Fatigue, joint aches, and memory concerns are all things we want to investigate further. It's good you mentioned them. Could you tell me a little more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: It's just… constant. I wake up tired. I stay tired all day. Even if I don't do anything. I used to have more energy. Used to… well, I don't remember what I used to do, actually. But I know I wasn't always this… drained. It's not like a sudden thing, it's just been getting worse, slowly. Is that… enough detail? I really don't like talking about this. Can we just get the blood drawn now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Croonquist. And I completely understand if you'd prefer to get the blood work done. We can certainly do that now. Just a quick pinch, as I said. Before we do, just one more quick question. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… weight… I eat… sometimes. Not as much as I used to, maybe. I don’t really keep track. And I certainly haven’t been weighing myself. My clothes… I don’t know. They feel the same. Look, Doctor, I’m getting a headache. Can we please just get this over with? I feel like I'm answering a quiz. And I’m failing. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, you're absolutely right. Let’s get the blood work done. No more questions, I promise. My nurse, Sarah, will be right in to take a few vials. She's very good, and very gentle. Just relax, and it will be over before you know it. I’ll be here, if you need anything.
