DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it’s…family history, mostly. My mom’s side, specifically. Lots of…problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And cancer. It’s just…it feels like a ticking time bomb, you know? I want to make sure I don’t end up like them. I'm trying to be proactive, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Proactive” is…a choice of words. Alright. Family history is certainly relevant. Let’s try to be specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Fine. My maternal grandmother died of a heart attack, I think it was in her early seventies. My aunt…Aunt Priya, she had breast cancer. She’s…was treated, but it wasn’t good. And my uncle, Uncle Rajesh, he had some kind of…stroke? Look, I don’t remember exactly the details, my mom doesn't like talking about it. It was all very…dramatic. But it’s a lot, okay? A lot. And I’m…fairly certain there’s more.
DOCTOR: “A lot” isn’t a medical finding, Mr. Theriot. We need details. Approximate ages when these events occurred would be helpful. "Some kind of stroke"—what kind of deficits did your uncle experience?
PATIENT: Look, I'm telling you, my mom doesn’t go into details. It was always very…emotional. She'd just say "He wasn't himself anymore" or “She suffered terribly.” I was a kid! I didn't ask for specifics. As for ages… Grandma was…old. Early seventies, I think. Aunt Priya…maybe fifties? I honestly don't know. It was years ago. And Uncle Rajesh…I want to say around sixty? Is this really necessary? I just want to know if I’m going to drop dead before I hit fifty. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, vague recollections are not particularly useful for risk assessment. We are attempting to establish a pattern, not conduct a therapy session. However, since you are concerned, we will proceed. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing major. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, that sort of thing. No broken bones, no surgeries. I'm generally…healthy. I eat reasonably well, I exercise occasionally. I mean, I try to. I’m a teacher, so I spend a lot of time sitting. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink much. Honestly, I’m probably healthier than half my family was. That’s the frustrating part, you know? Why bother even coming if I’m already doing better than them?
DOCTOR: “Reasonably well” and “occasionally” are subjective terms, Mr. Theriot. Let's quantify this. How many times per week do you exercise, and for how long?
PATIENT: Look, are you trying to grill me? It's…it varies. Some weeks it's three times, sometimes it's zero. It depends on my workload, how much grading I have to do. I go for a run when I can, maybe an hour or so. I’m a busy person! I don’t have time to meticulously track my exercise habits. And frankly, it feels a bit…demeaning. I came here because I’m worried about my genetics, not to be interrogated about my jogging schedule.
DOCTOR: “Demeaning”?
PATIENT: Yes! It’s…look, I get that you need information. But to act like my exercise habits are the key to preventing a family history of serious illness feels…dismissive. My mom smoked for twenty years, and she lived until seventy-five! So clearly, lifestyle isn’t everything. It's the genes, okay? I want to know what tests I need to see if I’m carrying some kind of…predisposition. Is that so unreasonable?
DOCTOR: Very well. We can discuss genetic testing. However, it’s not a simple matter. There are multiple genes associated with both cardiovascular disease and cancer. Which specific tests are appropriate depends on a thorough understanding of your family history, which, frankly, remains incomplete. And even a positive result does not guarantee you will develop these conditions. It simply indicates an increased risk, which may or may not warrant preventative measures. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So it's not a magic answer? Wonderful. Look, I figured as much. But…what can we do? What tests are even worth considering, given that I can’t exactly provide a detailed family tree? And if it’s just about “increased risk,” what does that even mean? Are we talking about a slightly higher chance, or…something more significant? I need something concrete, not just vague probabilities. This is…frustrating.
DOCTOR: “Frustrating” is an appropriate descriptor of attempting to obtain a useful medical history from a patient who provides vague and emotionally-driven recollections. However, we can proceed with a basic lipid panel to assess your cardiovascular risk factors. And we can discuss BRCA gene testing, given your aunt's history of breast cancer. But understand, these are just screening tests. They do not provide a definitive answer. Would you like me to order these tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes. Order the tests. The…lipid panel and the BRCA thing. But if they come back inconclusive, I’m not spending another hour recounting my mom's melodramatic stories. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. I thought you'd…I don't know. Take this seriously. Not treat me like I'm inventing things.
DOCTOR: The tests are ordered. A phlebotomist will be with you shortly to draw the necessary blood samples. I will review the results with you when they are available, and we can discuss further steps if indicated. And, Mr. Theriot, it is my professional obligation to gather a complete and accurate medical history. Your…emotional investment in this matter does not negate the need for factual information. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No. That's…that's enough for now. Just let me know when the results are in. And please, try not to make me relive my childhood trauma again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You may leave.
