DOCTOR: Right, Josie Altine. 67. Look, I’m quite busy today, so let’s get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this… burning. And stuff comes up, you know? Like after I eat. It’s just… unpleasant. I don’t have time for this, frankly. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: “Burning” and “stuff coming up”…right. Vague, but alright. After you eat, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, after I eat! What part of that is unclear? Especially if I have anything…rich. You know, good food. Not this…rabbit food everyone’s pushing these days. It happens usually within a couple of hours, maybe less. Look, I'm a director, I don’t have time to dissect every bite I take. Is there a quick fix for this or not?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be dramatic. “Rich” food… okay. And how often is this happening?
PATIENT: Most nights, if I’m being honest. Like, if I have a proper dinner – a nice steak, some pierogi, anything with flavor – it happens. I just…deal with it. Until it gets really bad, and then my wife nags me to come here. It’s a whole ordeal. Look, I’m not a complainer, but it’s annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I told you, it burns. And things come up. Is that not enough? Look, I don't get heartburn, I get…discomfort. And regurgitation. Is that what you want to hear? I don't have chest pain or anything, if that’s what you’re fishing for. I'm a perfectly healthy man for my age, this is just…a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just get through this. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! Absolutely not. If anything, I’ve probably gained a little. My wife keeps telling me I need to watch my portions, but honestly, a man needs his food. Look, I'm a big guy. Always have been. Weight loss is the last thing I'm worried about. This whole thing is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, and any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No! I eat just fine. Big meals, small meals, doesn’t matter. I'm not choking or anything, if that’s what you’re implying. Look, I’m a director, I have to be able to eat at functions. It’s part of the job! This is just…a little unpleasantness after a good meal. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. Can we just get this over with? I have a meeting in an hour.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's do a quick exam, then. Lie down on the table, please. I need to listen to your abdomen. Don't talk unless I ask you a question.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this for a little bit of burning? Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. I’m telling you, it's probably just something I ate. Don’t waste my time with anything complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay. Abdomen is…soft. No obvious masses. Some…mild tenderness in the epigastric region. I'm not hearing anything particularly alarming, but given your symptoms and the fact that this is happening frequently, I suspect…gastritis. Likely aggravated by your diet.
PATIENT: Gastritis? What’s that? Some fancy word? Look, just tell me what I need to do to make it stop. Do I need pills? A special diet? Because if it involves rabbit food, I’m walking out right now. I’m a director, I don't have time for all this nonsense. Just give me a solution, quickly.
DOCTOR: It’s inflammation of the stomach lining. And yes, it’s often related to diet. I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor. It will reduce stomach acid. But—and listen carefully—you really need to modify your diet. Less rich food. Less steak. Less pierogi. Smaller portions. Avoid late-night eating. And if it doesn’t improve within two weeks, then you come back. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So, pills and…rabbit food. Wonderful. Just what I needed. Look, I’ll try to eat a little less of the good stuff, alright? But don't expect miracles. I have a very important job, and it requires me to…maintain a certain level of energy. And steak is a significant part of that energy. Fine. Just give me the paper. And make it quick, alright? I have a meeting.
DOCTOR: Here. And if you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions—and I mean, actually important questions—before I move on to my next patient?
PATIENT: No, no. I think that’s all. Just…try not to make me come back. It’s a waste of both our time. Good day. .
