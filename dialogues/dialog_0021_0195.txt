DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not really a problem, you know? More… a little something to cheer me up. My daughter, she thinks I should get a card. From you. A “get well” card. Even though I’m perfectly fine. Honestly, all this fuss…
DOCTOR: A card, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, a card! You’re a doctor, aren’t you? You write prescriptions, you… you do things with your hands. It’s not a difficult request. She says it would mean a lot. My daughter, she worries too much. But still… a little note from a professional…
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I do write prescriptions, yes. And I use my hands to…examine patients. Not to compose Hallmark sentiments. But…let's just get this over with. It's August 2nd. Are you experiencing any actual health concerns?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Goodness, no! That’s what I’m trying to tell you. I feel… perfectly normal. A little tired, maybe. But who isn't? I’m sixty years old, you know. Things… settle. It’s just, my daughter insisted. She said it would be nice. She’s very… modern. All this needing emotional validation…
DOCTOR: "Tired." Okay. And is this tiredness new?
PATIENT: New? Well… not new new. It comes and goes. It’s…seasonal, I suppose. Summer makes me a bit sluggish. The heat, you know? And all the tourists. They track dirt everywhere. It’s very draining, honestly. I used to have much more energy. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Before...everything?
PATIENT: Oh, you know. Life. Things happen. My husband, he retired five years ago and it’s… different. He putters around the garden all day. It's not a bad life, mind you, but it’s… quieter. And all the neighborhood children… they've grown up. No more shouting, no more running around. It's just… less.
DOCTOR: So, to clarify, you’re feeling… a general sense of… less energy, perhaps some sadness related to life changes?
PATIENT: Sadness? Oh, don’t put it like that! It’s not sadness. It’s… wistfulness. A gentle melancholy. I’m not ill, doctor. I just… I thought a nice card from a professional might cheer things up a bit. A little acknowledgement, you know?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m a physician. I address medical concerns. Not…emotional needs. But, since we’re here…have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite is fine. I enjoy my food. My husband makes a lovely dal bhat. And sleep… well, sometimes I wake up in the night. Thinking. You know, about things. About the children, about the garden, about… everything. It’s not trouble sleeping, just… occasionally not sleeping. Who doesn't wake up at night sometimes?
DOCTOR: And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It comes and goes, like I said. But… if I had to put a number on it… perhaps six months? Since the weather turned colder last winter, really. It's always worse in the winter. Less sunshine, you know? It affects everything.
DOCTOR: So, fatigue, occasional insomnia, and… a general sense of… less energy, worse in the winter. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, no, nothing like that. No aches, no pains, no… things. Just… a bit tired, a bit quiet. And my daughter thinks a card would help. She's very insistent. Perhaps if you had a nice floral design… something cheerful?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write a card. But I also want to check your vitamin D levels. It's common for people to be deficient in the winter, and that can cause fatigue and mood changes. It's a simple blood test. And frankly, it's more useful than a floral design.
PATIENT: A blood test? Oh, goodness. Is it necessary? I don’t like needles, you know. And all that… poking and prodding. My daughter will be so pleased about the card, though. She’s always saying I need to take better care of myself. But a blood test… Perhaps we could just skip the blood test and focus on the card? A nice blue hydrangea, maybe?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm offering a basic medical assessment. Fatigue can be a symptom of many things, and a vitamin D deficiency is a common and easily treatable cause. It's not about "pleasing your daughter," it’s about ruling out potential medical issues. A simple blood test. That’s it. Do you want the test or not?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. But I don't like needles, you know. And please, no hydrangeas on the card. They remind me of my aunt Mildred. She had a terrible garden. Just… a simple flower will do. And quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Fine. Follow me. We'll get it over with. And I’ll see what I can do about a simple flower. Don't expect anything elaborate.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Lead the way. But do be gentle with the needle, won’t you? And perhaps a yellow rose? They’re quite cheerful.
DOCTOR: Sit. And try to relax. It’ll be quicker if you do. .
PATIENT: Oh, relax, you say? Easier said than done. Just… be quick, please. And don’t poke too much. My daughter is going to be so proud. .
