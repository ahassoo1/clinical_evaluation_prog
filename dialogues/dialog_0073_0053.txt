DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been having trouble going to the bathroom. Not… not completely unable, but it’s hard to start, you know? And it takes a long time. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a month now? A little longer, perhaps.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty initiating urination, and a prolonged time to empty. A month or so… alright. Is it painful when you do go, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: No, not painful, exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything. More like… a strain. Like I have to push a little bit, harder than I used to. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Straining, a sense of incomplete emptying… alright. And how frequent are you needing to go, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… normal, I think. Maybe three or four times a day? I drink a fair bit of water, you see. Always have. Not more than usual, I don't think. But I do get up once or twice during the night, which I didn’t used to. That's probably the biggest change, really. Waking up to go.
DOCTOR: Nocturia… waking up to urinate. Right. And are you experiencing any urgency, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Urgency? You mean like… having to go right away? Not usually, no. It's not a sudden, desperate need. It's just… difficult to start when I need to go, you see? It doesn’t come on fast. It's just… stubborn. Does that make any sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Yadao. It sounds like you’re describing a hesitancy and straining to void. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. It looks… normal, I suppose. The color is usual. No blood, no… funny smells. I haven’t seen anything different about it, not that I’ve noticed. Though I don’t always look, if I’m being honest. Just… goes down the drain, you know? Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. No hematuria, no dysuria… good. Now, let’s move on to a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years now? And I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but it doesn’t bother me too much. Mostly just stiff in the mornings. Other than that… I’ve been pretty healthy, thank goodness. My mother lived to be ninety-five, you see. Good genes, I think. I take a little bit of ibuprofen for the knees sometimes. And vitamins, of course. A, D, and a multivitamin. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Cholecystectomy thirty years ago, osteoarthritis… alright. And any family history of bladder problems or prostate issues, if you know?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. My father… he didn’t talk about things like that much. Very private man. And my mother, she never mentioned anything about bladder problems. But my uncle, on my father’s side… he had trouble with his kidneys, I think. Not sure if it was his bladder, though. He was always a bit sickly. He died young, unfortunately. Does that help? It's all a bit hazy, you see. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of renal issues in a male relative. Now, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh my. Well… no, Doctor. Not for… a very long time. Not since my husband passed, I mean. It’s… it’s not something I think about much. It’s been over twenty years now. Is that… is that relevant? It feels a bit personal, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: It’s simply part of the standard assessment, Ms. Yadao. Now, let's proceed with a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with abdominal palpation and then I'll listen to your abdomen. Afterwards, I'll do a quick neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Though I must say, I’m a bit nervous. I don’t like doctors poking around, if you know what I mean. But if you think it’s necessary… yes. I'll lie down. Is there anything I need to do beforehand? Take off my shoes, perhaps? Or… anything else? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing special. Just lie down comfortably. I’ll need you to relax your abdomen. Go ahead whenever you’re ready.
PATIENT: Alright. Here. Is this… is this good? I'm trying to relax, Doctor, but it’s hard. It’s a bit cold, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally, Ms. Yadao. I'm checking for any tenderness or masses. No acute tenderness to palpation. The abdomen is soft, non-distended. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. Normal peristalsis. Alright. Now I’m going to check your reflexes briefly. Please keep your legs relaxed.
PATIENT: Okay. Reflexes… yes. I haven’t had those checked in years. I’m trying to relax, Doctor. It’s just… a bit unsettling. Please be gentle. My legs tend to twitch, you know. I always have. It’s a nervous habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. No Clonus noted. Sensation intact to light touch in all extremities. Alright. Neurologically intact. Everything appears normal, Ms. Yadao. Based on the history and examination, it sounds like you may have benign prostatic hyperplasia, although you are female.
PATIENT: Benign… what now? And hyperplasia? I’m a woman, Doctor. I thought… I thought that was a men’s problem. I’m very confused. Are you sure? I’ve never heard of a woman having… that. I'm starting to feel a bit anxious, if I'm being honest. Could you explain that to me, please? In plain English?
DOCTOR: It's a slightly misleading term, Ms. Yadao. While BPH is primarily associated with men, women can experience similar symptoms due to a weakened pelvic floor and changes in bladder function with age. It’s not prostate enlargement, obviously. It's more of a functional issue, a lack of support for the bladder leading to incomplete emptying and straining. We'll need to run a few tests to confirm, of course. A urine analysis to rule out infection, and a postvoid residual volume test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you empty it. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Oh. A weakened pelvic floor… I see. That… that makes a little bit more sense, actually. After having children… yes, I suppose that’s possible. A postvoid residual volume test? That sounds… uncomfortable. Do you have to… I don't know… Is it painful? And what if it is a lot of urine left over? What does that mean? I'm still a bit worried, Doctor. This is all very new to me. Perhaps I should have just lived with it?
DOCTOR: The postvoid residual volume test is not painful, Ms. Yadao. It simply involves a catheter to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after urination. If a significant amount remains, it could indicate bladder dysfunction and the need for further intervention, such as pelvic floor exercises or medication. However, let's not jump to conclusions. We'll start with the test and then discuss the results. I'll order the urine analysis and schedule the postvoid residual volume test for you now. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: Latex? Hmm. Not that I know of. I've had a few rubber gloves on over the years, but I never had a reaction. I did have a bit of a rash once, a long time ago, but that was from poison ivy, I think. No, no allergies to latex. Though… if it causes a rash, please let me know. I have sensitive skin, you see. And… are these tests expensive? I’m on Medicare, of course, but I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known latex allergy. I'll make a note of that. As for the cost, Medicare typically covers these tests, Ms. Yadao, but there may be a copay or deductible. The billing department will contact you with specifics. Now, I’m going to write you a prescription for a cranberry supplement. It’s not a cure, but it may help prevent future urinary tract infections. Take one capsule daily with water. Do you have any questions before I finish?
PATIENT: Cranberry supplement… yes, I’ve heard of those. My mother used to take those. One capsule daily… okay. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… when will I hear about the test results? And where will the billing department contact me? I don’t want to miss anything. I'm a bit forgetful, you see. Though, I remember everything I want to! It’s just… details. Can they call me? My number is 555-123-4567.
DOCTOR: Here's the prescription for the cranberry supplement. The lab will contact you directly to schedule the postvoid residual volume test, and they’ll send the results to my office. My office will then contact you with the results in approximately five to seven business days. The billing department can call you at 555-123-4567. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. I appreciate you explaining things, even if it’s a bit scary. I'll try not to worry too much, and I'll wait for the lab to call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Yadao.
