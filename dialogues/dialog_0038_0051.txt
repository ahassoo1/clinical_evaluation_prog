DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Auelua, you say? A nice name. Let me see… well, my… my niece, she said I should come. Something about… my blood. I need to know what… what kind it is, I think? It’s all a bit fuzzy, you understand. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It’s perfectly normal for things to be a little fuzzy sometimes. So, your niece suggested you come in to have your blood type checked?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She’s a very sensible girl, my niece, Elena. Always looking out for me. She said it was important, just in case… in case something happens. I don’t quite recall what happens, but she seemed quite worried about it. Do you… do you need me to tell you anything specific? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Not at all, you’re not a bother at all. Elena sounds very thoughtful. Just so I understand, she was concerned about knowing your blood type for general preparedness, is that right?
PATIENT: Preparedness… yes, I suppose so. She’s always been one for being ready for anything. Honestly, I mostly just want to get it done and not worry about it anymore. It's been hanging over my head, you see? I used to… I think I used to know it, back when I was working. Rigging, you know? A lot of scrapes and bruises in that line of work. But that was a long time ago. Now my memory… it’s like trying to hold water in your hands.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked now, then. Knowing your blood type is helpful for many reasons, and it’s good to have that information on file. Rigging, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, rigging. For the ships, mostly. Though I did some work on the bridges, too, back in Valencia. It was… a good life, hard work, but good. Always felt safer up high than down low, funny enough. A lot of teamwork, a lot of trusting your mates. Though it’s all just… bits and pieces now, in my head. I can feel the ropes in my hands, but remembering the details… that’s the hard part. Did I ever tell you about the time we had a storm…? Oh, never mind. I’m rambling again, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, you’re not rambling. It sounds like you’ve had a very interesting life, and it’s lovely to hear about it. We can talk more about it later if you’d like. But for now, let’s focus on getting this blood type checked for you. Have you ever had any issues with transfusions before, or known if you had a reaction to any blood products?
PATIENT: Transfusions…? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I had a few stitches here and there, lots of bumps and bruises as I said, but never… never a transfusion. I always felt pretty healthy, you know? Strong as an ox, my grandfather used to say. Though he also said I was stubborn as one, so perhaps you shouldn’t take everything he said too seriously. I really don’t know about blood products, Doctor. Sorry to be so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You’re not unhelpful at all. It’s perfectly normal not to remember details like that, especially if you’ve never needed a transfusion before. Okay, and do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me see. I used to get a bit of a rash from… from poison ivy, I think? When I was a child. And I don't care for shellfish, makes my stomach upset, but I don’t know if that’s an allergy exactly. Nothing serious, really. Oh! And I can’t take penicillin. My mother always warned me, said it made me terribly sick. A bad reaction, she called it. That's about all I can think of, Doctor. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, no penicillin, shellfish sensitivity, and a history of a rash from poison ivy. Good to know. Now, just to get a bit of a broader picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor gave me something for my knees, a little white pill. Helps with the ache, you see? I take one every morning. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of those… those nighttime things, with the… with the chamomile, I think. Not every night, just when I'm really restless. And sometimes a vitamin… a vitamin D, I think. My niece brings them, says I need them because I don’t get enough sun. That’s about it, I think. I try not to take too much, you know? Don’t want to overload my system.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, a medication for your knees, a sleep aid occasionally, and Vitamin D. Do you know the names of the medication for your knees and the sleep aid?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re asking me something difficult! The little white pill… I have no idea what it’s called. I just ask Elena to get it for me. She knows everything. And the nighttime thing… it comes in a little blue box, I think? With… with sheep on it? It’s very fuzzy, Doctor. I’m sorry to be so useless. I really wish I could remember these things. My brain just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re not useless at all, Darl. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble remembering medication names. We can look them up on your records if you’ve been getting them from the same pharmacy. And no worries, we can figure it out. Now, before we proceed with the blood test, let's quickly go over your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… High blood pressure, the doctor mentioned that a few years ago. He put me on a little pink pill for it, I think. I take it every day. But other than that… no, not that I recall. I’ve always been pretty sturdy, you know? A bit of arthritis in my knees, as I said, but nothing major. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Always kept busy, always moving. Never sat still for too long, that's my secret. Does that help? I really hope I’m not making this difficult for you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, you're doing just fine. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young girl, a very long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a tree – a very silly thing to do, I know. Other than that… no, not that I recall. No major hospital stays, thankfully. I always tried to avoid doctors as much as possible, if I’m honest. A bit of a stubborn streak, you see. Always thought I could handle things myself.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It sounds like you’ve lived a full and active life. Now, lastly regarding your medical history, do you have any family members with any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a difficult one. My mother, she had… something with her heart, I think. She was very frail. And my brother… he had trouble with his stomach, a long time ago. But other than that… it’s all a bit fuzzy, Doctor. My family wasn’t one for talking about these things, if you know what I mean. Always kept everything bottled up. I wish I could be more helpful, but my memory… it’s like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. It’s understandable that memories can be hazy, and it’s not essential to recall every detail. We can proceed without a complete family history for now. Now, before we get to the blood test itself, I just want to confirm a few things. Are you allergic to latex?
PATIENT: Latex… hmm. That’s a new one. I don’t think so, not that I know of. I’ve never paid much attention to it. What is it used for? I’ve always just let the nurses do whatever they need to do. Is it something I should be worried about? Oh dear, I feel so helpless not knowing these things! I really should pay more attention. Is it in those gloves they wear?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Darl. Many people aren’t aware of latex allergies. Latex is a material used in things like gloves, bandages, and some medical equipment. If you've never had a reaction to gloves before, it's unlikely you're allergic. But it's good to check. Have you ever noticed any rash or irritation after having gloves worn, or after using a bandage?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rash… let me think. No, not that I recall. I’ve had a few scrapes and bruises, as I said, but the nurses always just put a bandage on it, and I never noticed anything unusual. No itching, no redness, nothing like that. I suppose that means I’m probably alright then? It’s just… my mind isn’t what it used to be. I always used to be so sharp, so quick to remember things. Now, it’s like trying to catch water in a sieve.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It sounds like you’re likely not allergic to latex. And please don’t worry about your memory; it's perfectly normal for things to become less clear with age. Alright, now let's move on to the blood test itself. I’m going to take a small sample of blood from your arm. It should only take a few minutes, and it might sting a little. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Oh, a little sting… yes, yes, I suppose so. I’ve had worse. Rigging, you know? Lots of scrapes and bruises, as I said. And a few stitches here and there. A little sting won’t bother me. Just… try to be quick, if you could, dear? I don’t like sitting still for too long. And please tell me if it's going to hurt a lot. I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick as possible. And I will let you know every step of the way. Here we go. I’m just going to clean the area with an alcohol wipe. This might feel a little cold. Okay, and now I’m just going to insert the needle. It will be a quick pinch. Alright, you’re doing great. Just relax your arm. It will only take a moment. And there we go. All done. Just apply a little pressure to this bandage for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh! That was a little pinch, wasn’t it? But not too bad, not too bad at all. Just a little… sharp. Thank you, dear, you were very gentle. And thank you for telling me what you were doing. I always like to know what’s going on. Yes, just a little pressure… like you said. It feels… warm. How long do I have to keep this on? And what will you do with the blood? Will it tell you everything? I hope it tells you what kind it is, so I can finally stop worrying about it. It’s been hanging over my head for so long.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. You were very brave. You can keep the bandage on for about fifteen minutes, and then you can remove it. If there’s any bleeding, just apply a little more pressure. As for the blood, it will go to the lab where they’ll analyze it to determine your blood type and check some other basic values. It will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health. It should give us the answer to your question about your blood type, so you can finally stop worrying. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. I will call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. A couple of days… I can wait. I’ve waited this long, haven’t I? You'll call me, you say? That’s very kind of you. I always worry about forgetting things, so a call is much better than me trying to remember to check back. No, I don’t think so. I think you’ve answered all my questions, dear. You’ve been very patient with an old woman like me. Thank you again for everything. It’s a relief to finally have this done, even if I have to wait for the results. It’s nice to know someone is taking care of it. Is there anything I can do to help you with anything? Or pay for anything? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Darl. It was my pleasure to help you. You don’t need to worry about anything; the billing department will take care of everything. Now, is there anyone who usually accompanies you to your appointments?
PATIENT: Oh, my niece, Elena. She's a good girl, always looking out for me. She usually drives me, and makes sure I don’t forget anything. Though I did manage to remember to bring my insurance card today, so I'm quite proud of myself! She’s probably wondering where I am now. I told her it wouldn't be long, but I do tend to ramble on. She worries about me, you know? She’s a very sensible girl. Would it be alright if she called to check on the results with you? I'm not very good with technology, and I always get confused on the phone.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfectly fine. Elena is more than welcome to call and check on the results. Just have her mention your name and date of birth, and we’ll be happy to provide her with the information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Darl?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been wonderful, truly. So patient and kind. It’s a relief to finally have this sorted, even if it takes a couple of days. I suppose I should be getting home now. Elena will be wondering where I am. Thank you again, dear. And thank you for not laughing at my rambling. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Darl. It was my pleasure to meet you. Don't worry about rambling at all; I enjoy hearing your stories. You have a good day as well, and please take care. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Goodbye, Darl.
PATIENT: .
