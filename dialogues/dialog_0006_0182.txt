DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin, good to see you. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I suppose you have my file. I’m here for… this surgery thing. My daughter insisted. Said I needed a “clearance.” Honestly, a waste of time, but here I am. Just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Right, right… surgery. Yes. Your daughter is… very proactive, it seems. And you’re looking for pre-operative clearance. Okay. Just to be sure… what kind of surgery are you scheduled for, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: A facelift. Honestly, it's not that complicated. Just tightening things up a bit. My daughter says I look… “tired.” As if she knows anything about hard work. It’s a simple cosmetic thing, really. Don’t tell me you need a whole life story about it.
DOCTOR: A facelift… alright. And you said your daughter scheduled this?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. She handles all this nonsense. She's…efficient. Too efficient, if you ask me. Keeps fussing over everything. But she pays for it, so I let her. Now, are we getting somewhere with this, or are you going to ask me about my childhood next?
DOCTOR: No childhood stories, I promise. Just need a bit of information to make sure everything's safe for the procedure. Do you have any medical conditions – anything at all – that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? At my age? Honestly. Well, I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but what old man doesn’t? And my blood pressure… sometimes it’s a little high. But nothing the doctor back home hasn't seen before. I don't go around collapsing or anything, if that's what you're implying. Mostly just aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and occasional high blood pressure… alright. Are you currently taking any medications for either of those, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Medications... hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I take something for the arthritis when it flares up, something my wife used to get for me. Can’t recall the name… little white pill. As for the blood pressure... not regularly. Only if it gets really bad. My daughter usually reminds me then. I think it's a water pill. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. She handles the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem. Bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes, but that’s just from enjoying a good meal. No, no allergies. Let’s get this over with, doctor. I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a quick physical exam then, to make sure everything looks good. Nothing extensive, I promise. Can you step up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Though I highly doubt poking and prodding is necessary for a little face tightening. Honestly… Just be quick about it, doctor. This isn't very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are… regular, a little fast, but not alarming. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, as you mentioned. And you said your daughter handles your medications?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, she handles everything. Always has. Honestly, I don’t even think about these things until she tells me to take something. She's very organized. Overly so, if you ask me, but that's daughters for you. Now, is that all? Because frankly, this is starting to feel like a complete waste of time. I could be enjoying a nice herring sandwich right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on this quick exam, you seem generally healthy, but your blood pressure is a little high, and it's important we get a better handle on that before surgery. And because you don't have a clear list of your current medications, I'd like to speak with your daughter, if possible, to get a more accurate picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Speak with my daughter? Absolutely not! She’ll lecture me for an hour about my lifestyle! No, doctor. Absolutely not. I told you, she handles it. You can write whatever you need to write, but don’t bother her. This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly fine. Just get this paperwork done so I can go home. Honestly, the whole thing is unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your reluctance. However, given your blood pressure and the lack of a clear medication list, I’m not comfortable signing off on the pre-operative clearance without further information. For your safety, I strongly recommend postponing the surgery until we can get a better handle on those issues. I can refer you to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation, and perhaps a primary care physician to help manage your blood pressure. What do you say?
