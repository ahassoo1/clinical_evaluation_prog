DOCTOR: Right, Margret Kilton. 76 years old. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Overgaard, yes? It is nice to meet you too. I am having some trouble… with my breathing. It makes a whistling sound, sometimes. Especially when I try to do… my exercises. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Overgaard. And it's good to meet you as well, Margret. A whistling sound with your breathing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a whistling. Like… a little bird, maybe? But inside my chest. And it’s not all the time. Mostly when I… push myself a bit. I like to keep active, you see. I used to be a trainer, many years ago. But this… this makes me stop.
DOCTOR: A trainer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Athletic trainer. For many years. I helped young people… with their sports. Football, mostly. But also… running, and… jumping. It was good work. Very good. But now… I just worry about this whistling. It is new, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this "whistling" been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think… It started… maybe two weeks ago? At first, it was just a little bit. I thought it was just… being out of practice. But it has gotten worse, I think. Now I have to stop exercising. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Two weeks. And does anything else happen when you're breathing, besides the whistling?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my chest feels… tight. Like a band around it. Not very strong, but… noticeable. And I get a little… tired after I try to do too much. But I am an old woman, so maybe that is just… old age! I am not sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath outside of exercise?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, sometimes. Not much coughing, but… the shortness of breath. When I walk up the stairs, maybe. Or if I try to carry something heavy. It is not every time, but… it happens. The whistling is not there all the time then, just… the feeling of not getting enough air. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a better listen to your lungs. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I hope it is not too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, breathe deeply in through your mouth… and out. Again… and out. Deeper… and out. I'm hearing some wheezing, as you described. And a slightly prolonged expiratory phase. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or COPD?
PATIENT: Oh my… that sounds… serious. No, Doctor, I do not. Not that I know of. My mother… she had a cough sometimes, when she was old. But she never went to the doctor much. She said it was just… old age! I was always very healthy. I played sports all my life. I have never had any trouble breathing before, not until now.
DOCTOR: Right. Any allergies to medications, or any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. And I do not take any medications regularly. Just… sometimes, a little something for my arthritis. But that is all. Just when it gets very bad. It is a small white pill… I get it from the pharmacy. I do not remember the name. I am sorry. I have a bad memory sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some bronchospasm. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to get it under control. I'm going to order a peak flow meter for you to use at home, and I want you to monitor your breathing daily. If it gets worse, or if you experience any chest pain or difficulty breathing, go to the emergency room immediately. I'll also order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a lot. A peak flow… what does that do? And a chest X-ray… is that… safe? I am a little worried now, Doctor. I do not want anything… serious. But if you think it is best, I will do whatever you say. I trust you. But could you… explain it a little more slowly, please? I want to make sure I understand. This whistling… is it because of my age? Or something else?
DOCTOR: Alright. A peak flow meter is a small device you blow into. It measures how fast you can exhale, which tells us how open your airways are. It’s simple. As for the X-ray, it uses a very small amount of radiation, it's perfectly safe and helps us rule out things like pneumonia or other issues. The whistling could be age-related, but it’s more likely caused by some inflammation in your airways. It’s common in people who have been active their whole lives, the airways can become a bit sensitive. We're just being cautious. I'll have the nurse explain the procedure for the peak flow meter and schedule the X-ray for you. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. A little bit like blowing up a balloon? Okay, that sounds… manageable. And the X-ray… very little radiation, you say? That is good. I always worry about those things. So, the whistling is probably because I used to be so active? That is… reassuring, a little. Yes, I think I understand. Will I need… medicine? To stop the whistling? Or just the peak flow meter and the X-ray? And… how long will it take to get better? I have a grand-daughter visiting next week, and I do not want to be… unwell then.
DOCTOR: We'll see what the X-ray and peak flow meter show. Then we'll discuss medication. Right now, it's too early to say. As for getting better, it depends on what's causing it. It could resolve on its own, or it might require treatment. As for your granddaughter, I can't guarantee anything. I'll write a note to excuse you from strenuous activity, but you need to take it easy regardless. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you for… explaining everything. And for the note. I will take it easy, and I will try the peak flow meter. I hope it does not take too long to figure out what is wrong. I just want to be… well. For my grand-daughter.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to go over instructions and schedule the X-ray. Try not to worry. It’s likely nothing serious. .
