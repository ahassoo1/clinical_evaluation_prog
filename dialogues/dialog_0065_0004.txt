DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for my shots, like we talked about. Routine stuff, you know? Keepin’ up with things.
DOCTOR: “Routine,” you say. While I appreciate preventative care, it's important we establish which shots are needed, and why. To clarify, are you referring to specific vaccines recommended by a previous physician, or are you simply maintaining a general vaccination schedule?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, that’s where my memory gets a little fuzzy. I think it was the nurse at the tribal health center last year who mentioned a few boosters…tetanus, maybe? And…something else? I honestly don’t remember her sayin' exactly which ones, just that I was due for some. Sorry, I should’ve written it down. Is there a list somewhere?
DOCTOR: It’s…less than ideal to rely on vague recollections for medical interventions, Ms. Fornes. Fortunately, we have your records from the tribal health center. Let’s see… Aha. It appears you received a Tdap booster – that’s Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis – in July of last year. There’s no mention of any other recommended boosters at that time. Do you have any allergies to vaccines, or have you experienced any adverse reactions to vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know about the Tdap. No allergies, not that I’m aware of. And no, never had a bad reaction to a shot. Just a little soreness, like everyone else. It's just…things slip my mind these days, you know? I try to stay on top of it, but… life gets busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, proactive health maintenance requires a certain level of diligence. According to your age and vaccination history – or rather, the documented portion of it – the CDC recommends an annual influenza vaccine and a pneumococcal vaccine, given the… circumstances. And have you had your shingles vaccine yet?
PATIENT: Influenza and…pneumo-what-now? See, this is what I mean! I get lost in all the names. I definitely had the flu shot last year, I always get that one. Shingles…hmm. I don’t think so. I feel like I would remember somethin’ like that. Is that one important? My husband, Earl, he got it a few years back, said it wasn't pleasant.
DOCTOR: "Not pleasant" is…an understatement, Ms. Fornes. Shinglevax is highly recommended for individuals over 50 to prevent shingles, and the complications associated with it can be quite severe – nerve damage, chronic pain, even vision loss. Your age puts you squarely in the recommended age group. Now, before we proceed, let’s briefly review your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – diabetes, heart disease, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. A little arthritis in my knees, but that's just gettin’ old, I reckon. Earl always says I'm too active for my own good. No heart trouble, no diabetes…just the regular aches and pains of livin’. So, shingles vaccine… you really think I should get it? Is it a bad one? I hate needles, you know. Just a little squeamish.
DOCTOR: “Squeamishness” is a rather…subjective assessment, Ms. Fornes. The benefits of Shinglevax far outweigh the minimal risk of side effects – typically mild soreness and fatigue. You are at increased risk of developing shingles, and subsequently postherpetic neuralgia, as you age. It is a two-dose series, administered six to twelve months apart. Now, regarding the influenza vaccine, are you planning on receiving that today as well?
PATIENT: Well, if it’ll really help, I guess I should do it. I don’t want to end up with that awful nerve pain Earl had. Six months apart… that sounds like a lot of needles. Okay, let's do the shingles vaccine, I suppose. And yeah, go ahead and give me the flu shot too, while we're at it. Get it all over with. Just… be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will administer both vaccines today. Please be aware that you may experience some localized discomfort and mild systemic symptoms – fatigue, muscle aches – for a few days following vaccination. I will document these administrations and schedule your second dose of Shinglevax. Please roll up your sleeve. It is vital you inform me immediately if you experience any unusual or severe reactions.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Here you go. Just…try not to dig too deep, alright? I always feel like they’re goin' all the way to the bone. And… just tell me when it’s done, okay? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Influenza administered. Shinglevax administered. Both arms. Please remain seated for fifteen minutes to monitor for any immediate adverse reactions. It is not uncommon to experience mild discomfort. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Ooh, that stung a bit. Not too bad, though. Fifteen minutes…okay. No, I don’t think so. Just… how long 'til I start feelin' normal again? And is there somethin' I should avoid doin’? Like, can I still garden tomorrow? I promised Earl I’d help him with the tomatoes.
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a rather subjective term, Ms. Fornes. Expect mild soreness and fatigue for up to a week. As for your gardening… strenuous activity should be avoided for the first 24 hours. Light activity is permissible, but listen to your body. If you experience any high fever, severe headache, or rash, contact your primary care physician immediately. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. No heavy liftin' for a day. Light gardenin’ is okay. And call if I get a bad fever or somethin'. I always get a little achy after shots, anyway. Just old age, I reckon. Thank you, Doctor. That was…efficient.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Here is your vaccination record, and a pamphlet outlining potential side effects. Your second dose of Shinglevax is scheduled for February 2nd. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. February 2nd… I’ll put it on the calendar. Thank you again, Doctor Duplichan. I guess I'll be careful with those tomatoes. .
