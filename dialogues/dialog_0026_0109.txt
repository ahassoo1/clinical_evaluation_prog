DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not real bad all the time, but it's there. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head for about three days now. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it doesn't feel like a regular headache. Not like when I was younger and would get one from working too hard in the sun. This feels… deeper. And sometimes, when I turn my head just right… it feels a little bit… sharp. Not a lot, but enough to notice. I used to work with the trains, you know? Rail yard. Lots of bending and twisting. Maybe that has something to do with it? I'm old now, though. Ninety years old. Things break, I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. A deeper ache, and a sharp pain with certain movements... and your history of work in the rail yard is good information, thank you. It is common for things to ache a little as we get older, but we want to make sure we understand what's going on. Just to clarify, when you say turning your head, which direction brings on the sharper pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… when I look to the left. If I turn my head to look left, that's when it stings a bit. Not every time, mind you. Just… sometimes. And it doesn’t last long. Just a quick… zing. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharper pain on turning your head to the left. A quick “zing,” as you say. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Not really. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe a little trouble getting to sleep sometimes, but that's just old age, I reckon. And my appetite is… well, it's not what it used to be, but I eat enough. No blurry vision, no feeling sick, no dizziness… nothing like that. Just the headache. Oh! And my wife… she passed away a few years back, and sometimes I just feel… sad. But that's not a symptom, is it?
DOCTOR: No, feeling sad is perfectly natural, especially after losing your wife. That’s not what I was asking about, but it’s good you shared that. So, no dizziness, no vision changes, no nausea… just the headache and some trouble sleeping. Have you tried anything to relieve the headache yourself?
PATIENT: I took some aspirin, a couple of days ago. Didn't do much, honestly. And my daughter… she gave me some cream for my neck, said it was for sore muscles. I rubbed it on the back of my head, but didn’t help much either. Not a miracle cure, anyway. I usually just try to rest. That's what my mama always told me. "Rest and a good cup of tea," she'd say.
DOCTOR: Rest and a good cup of tea... sounds like good advice. Aspirin didn't help much, and the cream didn’t make a difference either. Alright, Mr. Brum. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your neck and head, just to get a better understanding of what might be causing the pain. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Been needing a good check-up anyway, I suppose. Old body gets creaky. Just be gentle, if you could.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m just feeling around your neck and head. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I do notice some mild tenderness in the muscles on the left side of your neck, and a little bit of stiffness. Your range of motion is slightly limited, especially when looking to the left. I’m also hearing some very subtle crepitus – a sort of crackling sound – when you move your neck. It's not necessarily concerning, but I want to document it.
PATIENT: Crepitus… sounds serious. Is that bad, Doctor? I always worry when they start using big words. And the stiffness… I haven’t been doing much gardening lately. Maybe that's it? I used to love tending my roses.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to worry when you hear medical terms, Mr. Brum. Crepitus can simply be the sound of gas bubbles in the joint fluid, which is common with age and decreased activity. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it’s important to note. The stiffness could certainly be from not gardening lately. Gardening is good exercise. Based on what you’ve told me and what I've found during the exam, it’s likely you’re experiencing some muscle strain or tension in your neck, possibly with some mild arthritis contributing to the stiffness. It's difficult to say for sure without further testing, but it doesn't sound like anything immediately alarming.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… good to hear. Muscle strain… I can live with muscle strain. Arthritis… my mama had that. Is there anything I can do about it? Besides resting and tea, of course.
DOCTOR: Yes, definitely more than just rest and tea, although those can certainly help. There are a number of things we can try. We could start with some gentle stretching exercises to improve your range of motion and reduce stiffness. I can show you a few to do at home. We could also consider a topical cream with a mild anti-inflammatory to help with any pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also be helpful, but we’d need to discuss those in light of any other medical conditions you may have. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that hasn't bothered me in ages. And my blood pressure… the nurse at the doctor’s office said it was a little high last time, but they didn’t say anything about medicine. Other than that… no, not really. Just the aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. I don't take any regular pills, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Gallbladder removal years ago, slightly elevated blood pressure, and no regular medications. Given your age and overall health, I think we can start conservatively with the stretching exercises and a topical cream. I'll write down the stretches for you, and recommend a cream you can get over-the-counter. If the pain doesn't improve within a couple of weeks, or if it gets worse, we can discuss other options, perhaps including a referral to a physical therapist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… sensible, Doctor. Stretching and a cream… I can manage that. I like having something to do. Just sitting around isn’t good for the soul. Can you write those stretches down big enough for me to read? My eyes aren't what they used to be, you know. And what kind of cream should I look for?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. I'll write them down nice and large for you. Here you go. These are gentle stretches you can do a few times a day. Start slowly and don't push yourself too hard. As for the cream, look for one containing menthol or capsaicin. They both help with muscle pain. Something like BenGay or a similar product would work. Do you have any questions about the stretches or the cream?
PATIENT: Let me see… . These don't look too complicated. Menthol… BenGay… I think my daughter uses something like that. This all seems pretty straightforward, Doctor. I think I can manage. Thank you for taking the time to listen to an old man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was my pleasure. And please, don't ever hesitate to come back if you have any concerns or if things don’t improve. I’ll document everything we discussed today, and we can always reassess if needed. I’m glad we could come up with a plan that works for you. Do you have a work or school note that I can fill out for you?
PATIENT: A note? No, no. I'm retired. Been retired for… oh, twenty years now? No need for a note. Just wanted to get this headache checked out. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. You've been very kind. I think I'll go home and make myself a cup of tea now. And maybe try one of those stretches.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a lovely plan, Mr. Brum. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again. Goodbye. .
