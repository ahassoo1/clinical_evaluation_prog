DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you here?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this pain… it’s been bothering me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Could you elaborate on that pain for me, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s mostly in my lower back, kinda wraps around to my hip a little. It’s not like a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you know? It comes and goes, but lately it's been… more often than not there. Especially when I'm standing for a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache in the lower back that radiates to the hip, and it's been increasing in frequency, particularly with prolonged standing. That gives us a starting point. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me when this pain initially started?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… it probably started… maybe six, seven months ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little stiffness after gardening. I figured I just pulled something. But it hasn’t really gone away completely, and now, like I said, it’s more consistent.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months ago, initially related to gardening and perceived as a muscle strain. And it's progressed to a more consistent ache. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Well, sitting usually helps. And lying down, definitely. When I’m resting, it’s not too bad. Also, sometimes if I take a warm shower, it feels a little better for a while. But it always comes back, you know? It doesn’t really go away.
DOCTOR: So, sitting and lying down provide relief, and warm showers offer temporary improvement. That's helpful to know. Now, besides gardening, are there any other activities that seem to worsen the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Definitely walking a lot. And bending over… that’s a killer. Even just reaching for things on the lower shelves at the grocery store. My wife has to help me with that now, which is… humbling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: I understand. Walking, bending, and reaching exacerbate the discomfort. It’s good you have a supportive wife, and it’s sensible to acknowledge your limitations. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… sometimes my left leg feels a little… heavy, you know? Not like completely numb, but a little bit like it’s harder to lift. It doesn’t happen all the time, just occasionally. And I don’t think I’ve had any tingling.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional heaviness in the left leg, but no tingling. That’s good to note. Now, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a bit, years ago, but the doctor said I got it under control with diet and exercise. Nothing major, though. And no arthritis or anything like that, as far as I know. I try to stay active, even with this back thing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Controlled hypertension in the past, but currently no other significant medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, up until this back pain. I’ve always just tried to tough things out, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries. A history of managing health issues independently. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had some problems with her hips when she got older, needed a replacement eventually. And my father, he had a bad back too, but I don’t know much about it. He didn’t really talk about his health much. Mostly just grumbled about it.
DOCTOR: A family history of hip and back problems. That's relevant information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can take most things without any trouble. My wife always double-checks when I get a new prescription, just in case, but I’ve never had a reaction.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known medication allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like pain relievers?
PATIENT: I’ve been taking ibuprofen, when it gets really bad. Just the regular kind you buy at the drugstore. Doesn’t always help, though. And sometimes, if I’m really hurting, I’ll take a muscle relaxant my brother gave me, but I don't like taking that stuff, makes me feel kinda groggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and occasionally a muscle relaxant obtained from your brother. We’ll discuss those in more detail later. Now, with your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your range of motion, reflexes, and muscle strength in your lower back and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on your back, that would be wonderful. First, I’m just going to gently palpate your lower back to assess for tenderness or muscle spasms. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay. I’m noting some mild tenderness to the left of your spine, around the L4-L5 vertebrae. Nothing acutely severe, but that correlates with your reported pain. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, here goes… Oof. That’s… not easy. I can get down a little bit, but it’s tight. It’s more uncomfortable than painful, really. I can’t quite reach my toes. I haven’t been able to for a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Limited range of motion with forward flexion, associated with discomfort. Now, I’m going to ask you to lie on your side and lift your leg straight up. This will help me assess the nerve function in your leg. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Which leg first?
DOCTOR: Let’s start with your left leg, the one you mentioned feeling heavy at times. Please keep your leg straight as you lift it, and let me know if you experience any pain or numbness as you do so.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… getting tight. I can lift it up a bit, but it's not easy. There's a bit of a pulling sensation in my hip… and a little bit of that ache in my lower back. No numbness, though. Just uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited left leg raise with discomfort in the hip and lower back, but no numbness. Now, let’s try the right leg.
PATIENT: Alright. That’s a little easier… I can get it up pretty high. Still feel it in my back a little, but not as bad as the other side.
DOCTOR: Good. Greater range of motion with right leg raise, and less discomfort. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. We’ll start with the patellar reflex. Please relax your legs and I’ll gently tap your kneecap with a small hammer. Okay. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical on both sides. Based on this brief examination, your strength is intact, and your sensation is normal. However, your range of motion is limited, and you have some tenderness in your lower back. Given your history and the findings of the physical examination, it appears you may be experiencing lumbar strain with possible radiculopathy affecting the left leg. The muscle strain likely contributes to the pain, while the radiculopathy could explain the heaviness you’ve described. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, I would like to order some imaging. Would you be agreeable to an MRI of your lower back?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. Sounds… thorough. I guess so. If it’ll help figure out what’s going on, then yes, that’s fine. I just… I’m not insured, so I’m a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Way. I will discuss options with the imaging center to see if they have any financial assistance programs available. We can also explore less expensive alternatives if the MRI proves to be unaffordable. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasms, and I recommend continuing with over-the-counter ibuprofen. I will also give you some instructions on how to properly stretch and exercise your back muscles. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, one. You said stretching and exercise… is there anything I shouldn’t do? I don’t want to make it worse, you know? I’ve always just tried to take it easy when my back hurts, but maybe that’s the wrong approach? And… how long does this usually take to get better?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Way. Avoiding prolonged inactivity is generally a good idea, as complete rest can actually weaken your back muscles. However, there are certain movements you should avoid. Specifically, try to avoid heavy lifting, twisting motions, and bending forward repeatedly. When lifting something, bend at your knees and keep your back straight. When sitting, make sure you have good lumbar support. As for how long it typically takes to get better, that varies depending on the severity of the strain and your individual response to treatment. In many cases, lumbar strain improves within a few weeks with conservative management, such as medication, stretching, and exercise. However, if your symptoms don't improve after a few weeks, or if they worsen, we may need to consider other treatment options. Here is a handout with some specific stretching exercises you can try. Start slowly and gently, and listen to your body. If you feel any pain, stop immediately. I’m also prescribing a short course of cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant, to help alleviate the muscle spasms. Please take it as directed and be aware of the potential side effects, such as drowsiness. I will also send a referral to a physical therapist. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I guess I’ll see you after the MRI? Hopefully it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI appointment. We will review the results together and formulate a treatment plan based on our findings. And yes, we'll see you after the MRI. Take care, and I wish you a speedy recovery. .
