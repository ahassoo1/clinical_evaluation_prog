DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me crazy, honestly. Just…all over, really. Not like a rash, just…itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carla, itchy skin… That certainly can be very bothersome. And you said all over?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. My arms, my legs, even my back…it’s hard to reach some spots, but even there it itches. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? It comes and goes, but it’s been getting worse the last week or so.
DOCTOR: A month ago, gradually worsening… Alright. And would you describe it as more of a constant itch, or does it come in waves?
PATIENT: Hmm…it's more waves, I think. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and then other days, like today, I can't stop scratching. It's especially bad at night, keeps me awake.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse at night… That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it better?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific. I thought maybe it was the laundry detergent, so I switched brands, but it didn't help. And I haven't used any new soaps or lotions. Honestly, it just seems to come and go on its own. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carla. It is perplexing when it doesn't seem to be related to anything obvious. Let’s see…Have you had any other symptoms along with the itch?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm…let me think. No fever, no weight loss. I haven’t noticed any changes in my…bowel movements, if you don’t mind me saying. Just the itch, really. Though now that you mention it, my skin does feel a little dry, even when it's not itchy.
DOCTOR: No fever, no weight loss, normal bowel habits…skin feels dry…Alright. And have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, not like this. I’ve had dry skin in the winter, of course, living up north for so long…but never this widespread itching. This is new. And it’s really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, new onset, widespread… Alright. Now, I'm going to ask some general health questions, if that’s alright. Do you have any known allergies, Carla?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Allergies…well, I’m allergic to penicillin, I found that out years ago. Aside from that, not really. No food allergies that I know of. And no allergies to plants or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy…good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes, for my arthritis. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me to. Other than that, no. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, vitamin D supplement...Alright. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Well, the arthritis, of course. And I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with diet and exercise. No diabetes, no thyroid problems that I know of. My regular doctor usually does bloodwork every year, and everything is usually fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, arthritis… Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe twenty years ago? And I had a knee replacement about ten years ago, on my right knee. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholecystectomy twenty years ago, right knee replacement ten years ago. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... Family history. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my father had heart problems. My brother has diabetes, but I don’t. As far as skin conditions, not really. No one in my family has ever had anything like this itching, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension, heart problems, and diabetes. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven’t had a drink in years. Just doesn't appeal to me anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol. All right. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I'll just need you to change into a gown, and we’ll take a look at your skin. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. A physical exam sounds good. I'll go change now. Where’s the restroom?
DOCTOR: Right down that hallway, on the left. And I'll be right back when you're ready.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carla, let's take a look. If you could lie down on the exam table, that would be great. I'm just going to take a look at your skin, and feel for anything unusual. I don’t see any obvious rash or lesions. Your skin is a little dry, as you mentioned. And it doesn't appear to be inflamed, which is good. No visible signs of anything significant... I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Alright, everything seems to be within normal limits on the physical exam. However, given the persistent itching, we need to investigate a bit further.
PATIENT: That's good to know, even if you didn't find anything obvious. What kind of investigation? Blood tests? Because I don’t really like needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Carla. We can certainly minimize the tests if possible. I'd like to start with a complete blood count, or CBC, and a metabolic panel. These will help rule out a lot of common causes for itching, like liver or kidney problems, or thyroid issues. We may also want to check your vitamin D levels, just to be sure. The blood tests will give us a better idea of what's going on internally. If those don't reveal anything, we could consider allergy testing, or a referral to a dermatologist, a skin specialist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds...okay. Blood tests first, then maybe the specialist if we have to. I'd really prefer to avoid a lot of extra tests if possible. And are these tests expensive? I don't have insurance, and I'm on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Carla. Cost is a very valid concern. I will write the order for the CBC and metabolic panel, and we can discuss the costs with the lab beforehand, so you know what to expect. They often have payment plans or assistance programs for patients without insurance. We can also prioritize the most essential tests first, and see if those give us enough information. I'm also going to prescribe a topical cream, a mild corticosteroid, to help relieve the itching in the meantime. It won't cure the problem, but it may provide some temporary relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A cream sounds good, yes. Anything to stop the scratching. And thank you for being so understanding about the cost, Doctor. It's a big worry. What kind of cream is it? And how long do I use it for?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. I'm glad I can help ease your worries. This is a low-potency corticosteroid cream – hydrocortisone 2.5%. It’s available over the counter, but I'm prescribing it so you don’t have to worry about purchasing it. Apply a thin layer to the itchy areas twice a day, after bathing, for up to two weeks. If the itching doesn't improve after two weeks, or if it gets worse, stop using the cream and let me know. I'll also give you a lab order for the blood tests. The lab is located just across the parking lot. They’ll be able to draw the blood and send the results to me. We should have them back within a few days. And I'll call you as soon as I have them, to discuss the results and next steps. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear. Hydrocortisone twice a day for two weeks, and blood tests across the lot. And you'll call me with the results. Thank you so much, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and help me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. I'm happy to help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call with the results. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
