DOCTOR: Hi Ronnald, good to see you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too, I think. My wife, she… she said something about papers. For work, maybe? Something about needing time off. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I think it has to do with my… activities at the church? Or maybe with the school… Honestly, I don’t rightly recall what she said exactly. She’s very organized, my wife, but I… well, I forget things easily these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It sounds like you're here for some paperwork, potentially related to time off from work or school, and maybe connected to your involvement with the church?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds about right. Time off… yes. And the church, definitely the church. I help out with a lot of things there, and at the school too. I run some programs. I just… need the papers, whatever they are, so I can get back to it all. My wife said I need you for them. Is that… FMLA? She mentioned something like that. It doesn’t mean much to me, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, it sounds like your wife is thinking about a Family and Medical Leave Act form, or FMLA. That's something we can definitely help with. Before we get to the paperwork though, let’s talk a little bit about why you might need this leave. Is there something going on health-wise, or with a family member, that's making it difficult for you to continue your activities at the church and school as usual?
PATIENT: Health-wise… hmm. Well, I’ve been… feeling a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And a little… forgetful, naturally. But that’s just getting older, isn’t it? No, I don’t think it’s anything serious. Though… my back’s been bothering me. Acts up sometimes when I’m lifting things at the church, setting up for events. But I manage. I take some things for it, but… honestly, it’s hard to keep track of everything. Is that what you need to know? What kind of health problems do they need to know about for these papers?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, some forgetfulness, and back pain that flares up when lifting. That’s helpful. Let's try to get a little more specific about each of those. First, the fatigue – how long have you been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a good question. It’s been… creeping up on me, I think. Maybe… a few months now? It’s hard to say exactly. It’s not like I wake up exhausted every day, but I get tired faster doing things. Things I used to do without a second thought. Running the programs at the school… it just takes more out of me now. It’s… subtle. My wife notices it more than I do, probably. She’s always telling me to slow down. But I have things to do!
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of gradually increasing fatigue. And you said it affects things like running the programs at the school. Does this fatigue come and go, or is it pretty constant?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, I think. Though some days are better than others. If I get a good night’s sleep, I feel a bit more… spry. But even then, it’s still there, lurking in the background. It’s not like I’m bedridden or anything, Doctor. It's just… I don’t have the same energy I used to. And then the back pain… that makes it worse, of course. It’s a vicious cycle, I suppose. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ronnald. Constant fatigue for a few months, with some variation depending on sleep, and back pain contributing to it. Let’s talk about that back pain a bit more. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. Lower back. It's mostly when I lift things, like boxes of supplies for the church events. Or helping the kids with things at the school. Sometimes it just aches even when I’m sitting, but that's not too bad. It flares up, though, when I move wrong or try to lift something heavy. Then it’s… well, it’s painful. Not debilitating, but definitely noticeable. I try to be careful, but… things happen. I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain that's triggered by lifting and sometimes just an ache when sitting. And it flares up with certain movements. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I recall. Sometimes my legs feel a bit tired after a long day, but that’s just from being on my feet, I think. No, I haven’t noticed any… shooting pains or anything like that. Just the ache in my back. And the occasional stiffness. I do stretch sometimes, when I remember. My wife reminds me to stretch. She's good at keeping me in line.
DOCTOR: Alright, no radiating pain, numbness, or tingling. Just back pain and occasional stiffness. Now, let’s quickly go over some other things. Have you had any fever, chills, weight loss, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven’t lost any weight, as far as I know. My wife would definitely notice that! She's very observant. And my appetite… well, it's been normal. I still enjoy a good meal. No, nothing like that. Just the fatigue and the back pain. And, of course, the forgetfulness. It's probably just old age creeping up on me, Doctor. I'm not as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, weight loss, or appetite changes. Just fatigue, back pain, and forgetfulness. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not as flexible as I used to be, you know. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now… everything sounds clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon with age. Now I'm going to have you stand and bend forward and backward, and side to side. Just let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Okay, a bit of stiffness, but no sharp pain with bending. Palpating your spine now… a little tenderness in the lower back, consistent with what you’ve described. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72. Overall, your exam is fairly unremarkable, but the tenderness in your lower back and the diminished reflexes are worth noting. So, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some chronic fatigue and lower back pain. The forgetfulness is also something to consider. Given your age and these symptoms, I want to rule out a few potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. I also want to get an X-ray of your lower back to see if there's any structural issue contributing to your pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an X-ray… Yes, that sounds… thorough. I suppose it’s best to be safe. My wife always says I should get things checked out. She’s probably right. Yes, go ahead and order those tests, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Will these tests tell me what’s causing all this… tiredness and aches? And… will they help me get the papers for work?
DOCTOR: Yes, those tests will help us get a better understanding of what's going on. The blood tests can rule out things like anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies, all of which can cause fatigue. The X-ray will help us see if there's any arthritis, disc issues, or other structural problems in your lower back. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. And yes, understanding the cause of your symptoms is an important part of completing the paperwork for your work leave. We'll need documentation of your medical condition to support your request. I’m ordering the blood tests and the X-ray now. You can get the blood drawn at the lab across the hall. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center down the street. I’ll give you the requisitions. Once you've had those tests done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Across the hall… and down the street… Yes, that sounds… manageable. I think I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. So, I just take these papers to the lab and the imaging center, and then schedule another appointment with you? Is there anything I need to do before the tests? Like… not eat anything? My wife always tells me to fast for blood tests…
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. You take these papers to the lab and imaging center, and then schedule a follow-up appointment with me. And you are correct, your wife is very astute. For the blood tests, please fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks other than water. The imaging center doesn’t require any special preparation for the X-ray. I’ve also printed out these instructions for you, just in case. It has all the details about the fasting and the location of the lab and imaging center. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: 8 hours… no food… yes, I can remember that. My wife will be happy to hear I’m taking notes. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you again for your help. You've put my mind at ease. I should probably go get these tests done before I forget. It’s easy to lose track of things these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ronnald. You’re very welcome. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this together. And please, don't worry about forgetting things – that's what we're here for. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’re a good man. I appreciate your patience. Have a good day to you too. And… remind me, was it 8 hours… no food? Just to be sure.
