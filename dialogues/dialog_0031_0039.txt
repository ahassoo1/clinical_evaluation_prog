DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter, you see. Said my cholesterol was a bit high. Thought I should get it checked out, just to be sure. Been feeling alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but who doesn't get tired at my age, eh?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bohnett. It’s wise to follow up on those things. A little fatigue can have many causes, and it’s good you're being proactive. Just to clarify, this letter came from a recent blood test your primary care physician ordered, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Old Dr. Abernathy. Good man, but retired last year. New lady doctor now, Dr. Chen. She’s the one who ordered the blood work. Said something about numbers being too high… I don't really remember all the details, honestly. Numbers just aren't my strong suit.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bohnett. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall the specifics. We can certainly review the results together. Let me pull up your records from Dr. Chen… Ah, here we are. Okay, it looks like your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL – that’s the "bad" cholesterol – is 160, your HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 180. Do any of those numbers ring a bell at all?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no, not a one. Numbers are just a blur to me these days. I used to be good with figures, back when I was supervising at the home… payroll and all that. But that was years ago. Is… is that bad, Doctor? Should I be worried? My wife, bless her soul, she always kept track of things like that. I miss her a lot, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bohnett. It’s completely alright to feel overwhelmed by numbers, and I'm very sorry for your loss. It sounds like you and your wife had a good partnership. Regarding your cholesterol, those numbers are a little elevated, yes. A total cholesterol over 200 is generally considered high. Your LDL is also a bit high, and your HDL is on the lower side. We want to see LDL lower than 100, ideally. These levels do increase your risk for heart disease and stroke, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop those conditions. We have many ways to manage cholesterol, and we can discuss those options. Before we get to that, though, let’s get a little more information. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. Blood pressure’s always been a little on the low side, if anything. Dr. Abernathy used to joke I had a “young man’s blood pressure.” And no diabetes either. Always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to walk a lot, you know, when I was working. All that going back and forth in the home. Haven’t done much walking since I retired. Mostly just sit and read these days.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Bohnett. A history of normal blood pressure is certainly encouraging. And being active previously is also a positive. Do you have a family history of heart disease, stroke, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father… he had a heart attack when he was in his late sixties, I think. But he smoked, you know. Heavy smoker. And my mother, she had high blood pressure towards the end of her life. Other than that… not that I recall. My brother was always very healthy, but we haven’t seen much of each other since we were kids.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A family history of heart disease and high blood pressure does increase your risk, but it doesn't mean you're destined to have the same issues. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I don't take any medications regularly, either. Just an aspirin now and then for a headache. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies or regular medications. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she tried it once, back when she was a young woman, but didn’t like it. Always said it smelled awful.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Bohnett. Avoiding smoking is a significant factor in protecting your heart health. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a little glass of sherry with dinner sometimes. Just one. Not much of a drinker, never was. Mostly just to relax. My wife liked a little glass of sherry too. We used to sit together and chat over our sherry. Good times.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Bohnett. A single glass of sherry isn't likely to be a significant risk factor. Now, let’s talk about your diet. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly eat simple things. Breakfast is usually oatmeal with a little fruit. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe some soup. And dinner… well, I try to have something with vegetables and a little protein. Fish if I can, but mostly chicken or sometimes a little bit of beef. I try not to eat too much red meat, you know. Used to cook for my wife, she liked a good roast. I’m not much of a cook these days, just simple things. I do like a little dessert sometimes, maybe a piece of pie or some ice cream.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fairly healthy diet overall, Mr. Bohnett. It's good you include fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. A little dessert now and then is perfectly fine. Finally, do you do any regular exercise at all?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Like I said, I used to walk a lot when I was working. But since I retired, I mostly just sit and read. Sometimes I’ll do a little bit of gardening, but that’s about it. My back isn’t what it used to be, you know. Can’t bend over for too long.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bohnett. It’s common for activity levels to decrease with retirement and as we get older. And back pain can certainly limit your options. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, that gives me a good overview. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Just a routine check to get a better sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I don't mind at all. Always good to check things out, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please take a deep breath for me... and let it out slowly. Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That's a little elevated, but not significantly so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything sounds and feels good, Mr. Bohnett. No obvious concerns from the physical exam. Okay, so based on your history and the physical exam, it does appear your cholesterol is elevated. Your LDL cholesterol is higher than we’d like, and your HDL is a bit low. We also have slightly elevated blood pressure. Now, we have a few options for managing this. We could start with lifestyle modifications - diet and exercise - and see if that improves your numbers. Or, we could consider medication to help lower your cholesterol. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Well, I’d rather not take medication if I can avoid it, Doctor. I always thought those things had too many side effects. I’d be willing to try changing my diet and maybe doing a little bit of walking, if my back allows. Just don’t want to get too ambitious, you know. I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bohnett. Avoiding medication is a reasonable goal, especially if we can achieve good results with lifestyle changes. And it’s wise to be cautious about being too ambitious. Okay, let’s start with a trial of lifestyle modifications. I’d like you to focus on a heart-healthy diet – lots of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Reduce your intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. And aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week, if your back allows. Even short walks can be beneficial. I’m going to give you a handout with more detailed information about a heart-healthy diet and exercise recommendations. I’d like you to follow these recommendations for three months, and then we’ll repeat your blood work to see if your numbers have improved. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Three months is a good amount of time. And I’ll do my best to follow those recommendations. I might need a little help with the cooking part, but I think I can manage. What about the sherry? Should I cut that out too?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Bohnett. A single glass of sherry with dinner is unlikely to significantly impact your cholesterol levels. I wouldn’t recommend completely eliminating it, especially if you enjoy it. However, moderation is key. If your numbers don’t improve after three months, we may need to revisit that. So, to summarize: We're starting with lifestyle modifications – a heart-healthy diet and regular exercise – and we’ll repeat your blood work in three months. We’ll continue to monitor your blood pressure as well. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for not immediately putting me on a bunch of pills. Is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any symptoms or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I’m glad I could help. And you’re right to ask about symptoms. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness on one side of your body, or slurred speech, seek immediate medical attention. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. But, generally, if you’re feeling well and following the lifestyle recommendations, there's no need to worry. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three months to repeat the blood work. The nurse will come in shortly to review some educational materials with you and schedule that appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
