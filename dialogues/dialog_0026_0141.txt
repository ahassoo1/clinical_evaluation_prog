DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. I haven't changed anything in my routine, not that I can recall, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, itching for a few weeks now, and it seems to be all over. That does sound quite bothersome. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the itching a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not like a rash, there's no bumps or anything. Just… constant. Sometimes it’s more intense, other times it’s just… there. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t really matter what I'm wearing, or if I've been outside or inside. And it doesn't seem to get worse at night, thankfully. I've tried some lotions, just regular ones, but they don’t really do much.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant itching, no rash, and lotions haven’t provided relief. And it isn’t worse at night, that’s good to know. Do you recall if anything started around the time the itching began?
PATIENT: That's a good question... Let me think. Hmm… around the time it started… Well, my wife, bless her soul, passed away about a month and a half ago. It started maybe a week or two after that. I don’t know if that… if that could be something? It's just been a stressful time, you know? Everything feels a bit off.
DOCTOR: Oh, Brendan. I am so very sorry for your loss. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult. Yes, absolutely, stress can absolutely manifest physically, and itching can be one way it does that. To be thorough, though, we should also rule out any other potential causes. Have you noticed any changes in your skin texture?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… it’s hard, still. But I appreciate you asking. Skin texture… hmm. Let me think. Not really, I don’t think. It feels normal, just… itchy. Maybe a little dry sometimes, but that could be from scratching, I suppose. I haven't noticed any scales or anything like that. No redness, either. Just… itchiness. It's a very frustrating itch, if that makes sense. Like it's just under the skin.
DOCTOR: It does sound frustrating, Brendan, and I understand. No rash, no scales, no redness, just persistent itchiness with no obvious skin changes. And you mentioned it feels like it's under the skin. Okay. Would you mind if I just took a quick look at your skin?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need me to. I just want this itching to stop, honestly. It's keeping me up at night sometimes, even if it's not terrible, it’s just… constantly there.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just looking for any visual clues, anything subtle. Hmm. Your skin does appear normal. No visible rash, no lesions, no signs of infection. It's not particularly dry, either. Given what you've told me, and what I'm seeing here, it’s possible this is related to stress, as you suspected. However, we can't rule out other possibilities completely. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've never been much of an allergy sufferer. I used to have hay fever when I was a kid, but that went away years ago. Nothing food-related, no reactions to medications… I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. I did start using a new laundry detergent a few months ago, though. A friend recommended it, said it was good for sensitive skin. But I started using it before the itching started, so I doubt that’s it. It’s a hypoallergenic one, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you started the new detergent before the itching began. Hypoallergenic detergents are usually well-tolerated, but it’s still good to rule things out. Just to be thorough, I'd like to order a complete blood count – CBC – just to check for any underlying inflammation or other abnormalities. It’s a routine test, and it’ll help us get a better overall picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A complete blood count… that’s fine. Anything that might help me figure this out is good with me. I just want to feel normal again, you know? It’s hard to enjoy anything when you’re constantly itchy. When would I need to go to get that done? And how long does it usually take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Brendan. Feeling normal again is the goal. There’s a lab just down the street here at the medical center. They can usually fit you in right away. I'll send an electronic order over to them now, and they’ll just need your insurance card. Results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. We'll give you a call as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin, even if it doesn’t seem to be helping much. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents. And, if possible, try to manage your stress levels. I know that’s easier said than done, especially after such a loss, but even small things like gentle exercise or spending time with loved ones can make a difference. Would you like me to write down some resources for grief counseling, just in case?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you for the resources. I’ve been trying to keep busy, mostly with gardening, but it's hard. And yes, the grief… it comes in waves. Gardening is nice, though. Keeps my hands busy, if nothing else. I'll get the blood work done tomorrow. And I appreciate you sending the order to the lab. It's one less thing to worry about. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any creams or lotions you recommend specifically, even if it’s just something over the counter?
DOCTOR: Given that your skin doesn’t appear inflamed, a strong steroid cream isn’t warranted at this point. However, a simple emollient – something like Cetaphil or Eucerin – can help soothe the itch by hydrating the skin. Look for fragrance-free options, as fragrances can sometimes irritate the skin. I'm also going to write you a prescription for an antihistamine – just a basic, over-the-counter one like loratadine. It may help reduce the itch, even if it isn't an allergic reaction. We’ll review the blood work results when they come back, and we can decide on the next steps from there. If the itch becomes unbearable, or if you develop any new symptoms – like a rash, fever, or swelling – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That's very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. I think I understand everything. A simple emollient, and the antihistamine. I’ll get those tomorrow. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You’ve covered everything beautifully. Thank you for your time, and for listening. It's… nice to feel like someone is taking it seriously, you know? I’ll call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. It’s my job, and I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Losing your wife is a tremendous loss, and I want you to know that we're here to support you, both medically and emotionally. Take care of yourself, Brendan. And remember, it’s okay to not be okay. .
