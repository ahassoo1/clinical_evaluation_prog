DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… satisfactory to meet you as well. I understand you have forms regarding… end-of-life wishes? My husband suggested I look into these things. He’s rather insistent, you see. I’d like to get this done, if possible, though frankly, I find the whole topic rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It is a difficult topic to consider, and it's very responsible of you to be proactive about this, and thoughtful of your husband to bring it to your attention. We have several forms related to advance care planning, covering things like a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. Before we dive into the paperwork, perhaps we could discuss your general wishes and preferences regarding medical care, should you ever find yourself unable to communicate them directly?
PATIENT: Generally? Well, I expect competent care, naturally. I’ve always taken good care of my health. I eat well, I exercise… within reason, of course. I simply don’t wish to be a burden. And I certainly don’t want… extreme measures taken if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery. I’ve seen… things. Prolonging suffering for the sake of… a few extra days? It’s undignified. But I confess, I haven't given much thought beyond that. I assume my husband knows my preferences. He’s a practical man.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Marija. "Competent care" and avoiding "extreme measures" with no hope of recovery are excellent starting points. It's good that you have a practical husband as well. However, even with a close relationship, it’s important to clearly document your wishes, to ensure they’re honored as you intend. To be more specific, let's consider a few scenarios. If you were to experience a severe illness or injury, would you want artificial life support, such as a ventilator, used to keep you breathing?
PATIENT: A ventilator? Goodness. That sounds… unpleasant. No, Doctor, absolutely not. I have seen the… indignity of that. Unless there is a clear and demonstrable chance of full recovery, I would not wish to be kept alive artificially. It is simply prolonging the inevitable. I believe in a dignified exit. I trust my husband understands that. He’s a doctor himself, you know. Though a different specialty, of course. Much more… practical.
DOCTOR: That’s very clear, Marija. No artificial life support without a reasonable chance of full recovery. And yes, it’s helpful to know your husband is a physician; that often facilitates these conversations. Now, let's consider CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If your heart were to stop beating, would you want us to attempt to restart it with chest compressions and medications?
PATIENT: CPR… Honestly, Doctor, is this truly necessary? I mean, if my time has come, my time has come. I don’t wish to be… jolted back to life only to suffer more. Unless there is a genuine possibility of a full recovery, no. Please, no CPR. I want to be allowed to… pass peacefully. It seems rather barbaric, frankly. I’ve always believed in accepting the natural order of things.
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings completely, Marija. It's perfectly reasonable to decline CPR if you feel it wouldn't align with your wishes. We want to respect your autonomy and ensure your end-of-life care reflects your values. So, to summarize, you do not want artificial life support, such as a ventilator, nor do you want CPR attempted unless there's a reasonable chance of full recovery. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly accurate, Doctor. Though I do wish we didn’t have to dwell on such… morbid details. It’s rather unsettling, as I mentioned. Perhaps we can move on to the paperwork now? I'd like to get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have a faculty meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I apologize if this has been unsettling. It is a difficult conversation, and we can absolutely move on to the paperwork. We have a few different forms, including a Living Will, which outlines your wishes regarding specific medical treatments, and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which designates someone to make medical decisions on your behalf if you're unable to do so yourself. Before we start, would you like me to explain each form in more detail, or would you prefer to review them yourself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, please. My husband will explain everything, I’m sure. He’s very thorough. Just give me the forms. I trust his judgment implicitly. I simply want to sign them and be done with it. And if you could just point me to where I should sign, that would be appreciated. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. Here you are. The Living Will is this document, and the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare is this one. The signature lines are at the bottom of each page. Please let me know if you have any difficulty locating them. I can also witness your signature if needed. Just so we have everything documented, could you please confirm your date of birth and your husband’s full name for me?
PATIENT: My date of birth is October 14, 1981. And my husband’s name is Dr. Omar Chilla. C-H-I-L-L-A. Though, honestly, Doctor, you should have this information already. It seems rather inefficient. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija. My apologies. The information is in the system; I am still becoming familiar with the new EHR interface. Dr. Omar Chilla, noted. Please take your time. I'm here if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: There. Done. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. I have a very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Thank you. I have documented that you have completed your advance directives and have designated Dr. Omar Chilla as your healthcare proxy. I will place these documents in your chart. We’ve addressed your wishes regarding artificial life support and CPR. Just to reiterate, these directives will only be enacted if you are unable to communicate your wishes directly. Here is a copy for your records. Please keep it in a safe place and inform your healthcare proxy of its location. I wish you all the best with your meeting, Marija. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions in the future. .
