DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Courtnye is fine. Look, I don't really have a lot of time, so I’ll get straight to it. I’ve been bruising… a lot. Like, way more than usual, and it's kinda worrying me. I’m on a blood thinner, and I’m just… concerned.
DOCTOR: Okay, Courtnye, I understand. Bruising easily, especially when you're on a blood thinner, is definitely something we need to look into. It's good you're bringing it to my attention. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Um… they just appear. Not like I bumped into anything, you know? A couple on my arms, one on my leg… just popped up. And they’re… bigger than normal. Usually it’s just a little mark, but these are like, proper bruises. Dark purple, kinda sore. It started maybe a week ago, but it seems to be getting worse each day. I haven’t changed anything about my routine or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, they’re appearing spontaneously, getting larger than usual, and are dark purple and somewhat sore. And this has been progressing over the past week, despite no changes to your routine. Can you recall exactly where these bruises are located?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Okay, there's one on the inside of my left forearm, kinda near my elbow. Another one on the back of my right hand, not a big one, but noticeable. And the biggest one is on my left thigh, kinda on the side, not directly on the front. Oh! And a small one just above my knee on the same leg. I can show you, if you want? It's easier than trying to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Seeing them will be very helpful. While you're getting comfortable, can you tell me a bit about the blood thinner you’re taking?
PATIENT: Okay, one sec… Here. You can see. It's… Rivaroxaban, I think? That's what the bottle says. The doctor put me on it about six months ago, after… well, after I had a blood clot in my leg. It's supposed to stop me getting another one, obviously. I take one pill every day, like the doctor told me. I haven’t missed any doses, I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see them. They do appear quite prominent. The one on your thigh is approximately 5 centimeters in diameter. And they are tender to the touch, as you mentioned. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I just thought that was because of work. Nothing major. And… oh! I did have a nosebleed a couple of days ago. Not a bad one, just a little trickle that wouldn't stop for a bit. But I get those sometimes, so I didn’t think anything of it. No bleeding gums or anything like that. Definitely no dizziness or anything. Just the tiredness and the nosebleed, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and a recent nosebleed. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask you some more general health questions, if that’s alright. Have you had any recent infections – like a cold, the flu, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, go ahead. No, nothing like that. I managed to avoid getting sick all winter, which is a miracle. Last time I had a cold was… honestly, I can't remember. Probably last year, maybe? Definitely nothing recent. I work from home, so I don't really get exposed to much. I'm usually pretty good at keeping bugs away.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat the same stuff pretty much every day. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of fruit and vegetables. I haven’t started taking any new vitamins or supplements, either. Just the usual. I’m pretty boring when it comes to food, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Just paracetamol, if I get a headache. But I haven’t taken any in weeks. And sometimes I take something for indigestion, but that’s it. Nothing regular. Definitely no herbal remedies or anything fancy like that. I'm not really into all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, just paracetamol occasionally and something for indigestion. That’s good to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the blood clot?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the clot. And high blood pressure, but that's managed with medication. Been stable for years, though. The doctor checks it every six months, and it's always good. Honestly, I'm pretty healthy for my age. This bruising thing is really worrying me, because I don't usually have problems like this.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Courtnye. It’s helpful to have that background information. And you said you've been taking medication for your high blood pressure for years, and it’s well controlled?
PATIENT: Yep. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, but it keeps everything in check. No side effects, thankfully. Doctor says I need to stay on it for life, which is fine. It's better than having a stroke or something. Look, is this bruising thing serious? I've got a lot on, and I really don't have time to be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril for high blood pressure. I understand your concern, Courtnye. It’s good that your blood pressure is well-controlled. The bruising, especially in the context of being on Rivaroxaban, does warrant investigation. It’s not necessarily serious, but we need to rule out any underlying causes. To do that, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count, your clotting factors, and your liver function. That will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, blood tests are fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I can get it done whenever, really. Just… let me know where to go, and how long it will take to get the results. And can you explain what you’re looking for, exactly? I don't really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll send you to the lab just across the street here at the medical center. They're very efficient; it shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. They’ll take a sample of your blood and send it off to be analyzed. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. What we're looking for is primarily to rule out any issues with your blood cell counts – like a low platelet count, which can cause bruising. We'll also check your clotting factors to make sure Rivaroxaban isn’t interfering with your body’s ability to clot properly. And finally, we’ll look at your liver function, because the liver plays a role in blood clotting as well. While we wait for the results, I'd like you to keep an eye out for any other signs of bleeding – like blood in your urine or stool, or excessive bleeding from cuts. And if you experience any sudden, severe headaches, dizziness, or weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. Platelets, clotting factors, liver… got it. No blood in anything, and watch out for headaches. I can do that. And… is there anything I need to do before the blood tests? Like, fast or anything? I really don't want to have to come back again.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to fast. You can eat and drink as usual before the blood tests. Just try to drink plenty of water. And please avoid any strenuous activity for the next 24 hours. I’ll have the lab technician draw a requisition for you. Once the results are back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you have any concerns or notice any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, good. No fasting, drink water, no exercise. Got it. And no, I think that’s everything for now. Thanks, Doctor. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. I really appreciate you fitting me in.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. My nurse will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. .
