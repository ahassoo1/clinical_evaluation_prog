DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Right, um… something about a check-up? For… work, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They said something about needing to be cleared for… performances? I usher at the theatre, mostly. Ticket taking sometimes. It’s… a lot of standing, you know?
DOCTOR: Performances… right. A physical for work requirements. Yes, I see a note here. Okay. And how long have you been doing this ushering work, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Decades, probably. I… lost track, really. Since before my divorce, certainly. That was… a while ago now. Maybe thirty years? More? I don’t keep good track of dates. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Thirty years… alright. And during those thirty years, have you noticed any changes in your ability to… stand for long periods?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… well, it gets harder, naturally. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And my back… aches sometimes. Not constantly, but… yeah. It’s not as easy as it once was, that’s for sure. I try to stretch, but… it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: I understand. Aches and pains are common with prolonged standing, especially as we get older. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Have you experienced any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating…? Down my legs… you mean, like… shooting pain? Sometimes, yes. Not often, but when it happens it’s…uncomfortable. It usually goes away if I sit down and rest for a bit. It’s hard to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a… throbbing, dull ache.
DOCTOR: Throbbing, dull ache… alright. And is that ache constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. Mostly when I’ve been on my feet all day. Or if I’ve bent over too much. Sometimes I wake up with a little stiffness, but that usually works itself out after I move around for a bit. I don’t… spend a lot of time thinking about it, if that makes sense. I just try to ignore it and keep working.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ignoring it can sometimes make things worse in the long run. Okay. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling…? Hmm. Not… regularly, no. Sometimes my fingers get a little cold, especially in the winter, but that's just the cold, I think. I haven't really noticed any… pins and needles or anything like that. No, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult. It was a long time ago, and I don’t have a very good memory. I had… the usual childhood things, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. As an adult… I had my appendix out, years and years ago. And… I think I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. But other than that… I can't really recall anything major. I don't go to the doctor very often.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal… bicycle accident… alright. Any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve taken… aspirin, for headaches, over the years. Never had a reaction. And… I think I had a penicillin shot once, a long time ago. Nothing happened then either. I really don’t take much medication. Mostly just… whatever I can get over the counter.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Anything to get this over with, really. I have a show to get to later. Not performing, mind you, just… ushering. But still.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step onto the table here, please. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your range of motion. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Okay, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been a while since I was on one of these. Ugh… that’s… not as easy as it used to be. Getting old, I suppose. It feels a bit stiff in my lower back, you know? Not painful, just… tight.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Some limited range of motion, and some tightness in the lower back. Now, can you stand up straight and I’ll check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Alright. Reflexes… goodness. I haven’t thought about my reflexes in years. I hope they’re still working!
DOCTOR: Okay. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are present, but a little diminished. Now, let’s just take a look at your feet. No significant swelling. Tenderness is minimal on palpation. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some age-related wear and tear, likely contributing to lower back tightness and some reduced range of motion. The diminished reflexes could be normal for your age, but it’s worth keeping an eye on.
PATIENT: Wear and tear… that sounds about right. Everything is just… getting old. I suppose that’s to be expected. So… does that mean I can go back to ushering?
DOCTOR: Yes, I don’t see any reason why you can’t continue ushering, Mr. Krahn. However, I would recommend a few things. First, gentle stretching before and after your shifts. Second, try to avoid prolonged bending or twisting. And third, if you experience any sharp or worsening pain, please see a doctor immediately. We could consider a referral to a physical therapist for some targeted exercises. Or, if the pain worsens, an X-ray to rule out any underlying issues. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds like a lot of work. And X-rays… well, I try to avoid those if I can. I’m not really one for… fuss. Stretching, I can manage, I suppose. I’ve been trying to do a little bit already. And I’ll be careful about bending and twisting. Honestly, I just want to keep working. It keeps me busy, you know? So, if I just stretch and be careful… is that enough?
DOCTOR: For now, yes. Stretching and careful attention to your body should be a good starting point. We can monitor your symptoms. If they worsen, or don't improve after a few weeks, we can re-evaluate and consider other options. I’ll write down some basic stretching exercises for you. Do you have any other concerns today, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. That’s very kind of you. No, I don’t think so. Just… getting old, I suppose. It’s a bit of a nuisance, but… I can manage. I really appreciate you seeing me today, Doctor. I think that’s everything. I suppose I should get going then. That show isn’t going to usher itself, you know?
DOCTOR: Very good. Just remember to listen to your body. If anything changes, don't hesitate to come back. Here’s a note for your work, stating you’ve been evaluated. Have a good day, Mr. Krahn. And enjoy the show. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. It’s… been a pleasure. Even if it was about getting old. .
