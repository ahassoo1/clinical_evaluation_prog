DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me over and said I needed to come by the clinic to get everything official. Nothing’s wrong, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Forms, yes. Though typically Medicare sends those after an initial consultation, to establish medical necessity. Still, we can certainly proceed. It’s standard procedure for me to at least get a brief medical history, even if it's just to document your overall health. It helps with coordinating your care, should anything arise in the future. So, let’s start with that. Have you been experiencing any health issues recently – even minor ones?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, I understand. That makes sense, wanting to have everything on record. No, not really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I guess. Nothing I’d bother a doctor with, honestly. I’ve been pretty lucky so far.
DOCTOR: “Pretty lucky” is good to hear, but aches and pains are relevant. Location, duration, severity… these details matter. And frankly, dismissing symptoms is…unwise. So, let’s be specific. Where are you experiencing these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Well, mostly in my lower back. It comes and goes, you know? Worse after I've been working, bending and lifting things all day. I install valves and stuff, so it's part of the job. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. Doesn’t keep me from working, but I notice it at the end of the day, and sometimes when I wake up.
DOCTOR: Valves, you say. Physically demanding work, then. And it’s been… how long have you been experiencing this lower back discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It comes and goes so much, it’s hard to say exactly. Probably… a few years, on and off. It used to be just after a really hard job, but lately it seems to bother me more consistently, even after easier work. I just thought it was getting old.
DOCTOR: “Getting old” is a simplistic explanation, Ms. Fabing. While age is a factor, we need to rule out other potential causes. Have you noticed any radiating pain – does it go down your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. It stays mostly in my lower back. Sometimes it feels a little stiff in my hips, but no pain down my legs or anything like that. I did pull something a couple of months ago, lifting a really heavy valve… but that got better pretty quickly, with some rest. This is more… persistent, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Everything feels normal there. I can walk and stand just fine, no problems at all. It’s just… uncomfortable. More annoying than anything, really. I just need to get these forms done so Medicare doesn’t hassle me.
DOCTOR: Medicare's requirements, while… tedious, are in place for a reason. Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam, just to document the extent of this “discomfort.” Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Hopefully it won’t take too long. I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat on your back, Ms. Fabing. I’ll start with palpating your lower back. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. …Okay, a little to the left here… and here… Any discomfort with this pressure?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit right there. Not awful, just… sensitive. Like a bruise, almost. It’s definitely worse when you press on it, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about range of motion?
PATIENT: Range of motion? You mean, like, bending over and stuff? I can do that, I guess. I do it all day at work. But it'll probably be a little stiff.
DOCTOR: Precisely. Please bend forward at the waist as far as you comfortably can, and then slowly return to an upright position. I’m observing your movement. …Alright. Now, bend backward, gently. …And finally, rotate your torso to the left and right, as far as you comfortably can. …Okay, stop there. Limited range of motion noted in flexion and extension, with mild discomfort reported. Palpation reveals tenderness to the left paraspinous muscles.
PATIENT: Okay. That's not as bad as I thought it would be, but it’s definitely not comfortable. So, what does that mean? Is it something serious? I just want to get back to work, if possible.
DOCTOR: Based on the limited physical exam, Ms. Fabing, it appears you are experiencing a musculoskeletal strain, likely exacerbated by the physical demands of your profession. It's not an emergency, no. However, simply "getting back to work" is not advisable without addressing the underlying issue. We need to rule out other possibilities. I will order some imaging – a lumbar X-ray to assess for any structural abnormalities. Also, I'm prescribing a mild anti-inflammatory medication and recommending physical therapy. I'll also need a detailed history of any previous back injuries or treatments. Do you have that information readily available?
PATIENT: Okay, imaging and therapy. That sounds… a lot. I guess it’s better than ignoring it. I don’t really have a detailed history, no. I pulled something a few years back, but I just rested it for a bit and it got better. Never went to the doctor for it. My grandpa used to have bad back problems, though. He saw a chiropractor for years. Does that count?
DOCTOR: “Chiropractor” is… not the same as a medical diagnosis, Ms. Fabing. And while rest may have provided temporary relief, it doesn’t address the underlying cause of your current discomfort. I'm noting the family history. I’ll send the X-ray order to the radiology department. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m prescribing naproxen 500mg twice daily for seven days. Avoid strenuous activity and continue to use proper lifting techniques at work. Here is the prescription. And I’m providing you with a referral to a physical therapist specializing in musculoskeletal conditions. I expect you to follow these instructions diligently. And please, return with the X-ray results for a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, naproxen and physical therapy. Got it. I think that’s everything? Just…try not to lift anything too heavy until I get the X-rays done, right? And call if something feels really bad? I appreciate you taking the time to look at this, Doctor. Hopefully it’s not something serious. I really just need those forms filled out for Medicare, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fabing, avoid heavy lifting. And yes, contact the clinic immediately if your pain worsens, or if you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs. I have completed the necessary Medicare forms based on your current presentation. I must reiterate, however, that this evaluation is preliminary, pending the results of the imaging. Are there any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Versace. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow the instructions provided. .
