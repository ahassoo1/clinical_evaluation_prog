DOCTOR: Alright, Jaxston, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, sure. It’s… my head. It's been giving me trouble. Real bad trouble, sometimes. And my heart races, feels like it's gonna jump outta my chest. I get all sweaty too, when it happens. It's… hard to explain, exactly. It just comes on. I don’t really… remember what triggers it, if anything does.
DOCTOR: Okay, "real bad trouble" with your head and your heart racing…and sweating. That's helpful to start. When you say trouble with your head, are we talking about pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, pain, definitely pain. It's not like a constant thing, more like… waves. Really intense when they hit. Feels like somethin's squeezing my brain, kinda. And it usually comes with a bunch of other stuff, like I said – the heart thing, the sweat… sometimes I feel a bit sick to my stomach too. But the pain is the worst part, for sure. I don't really know how long they last, to be honest. Everything gets a bit blurry when it happens.
DOCTOR: Blurry, okay. And these “waves”... how often would you say they happen?
PATIENT: Ugh, that's a good question. I wish I knew. It’s not like clockwork, that’s for sure. Sometimes it'll be weeks, maybe even a month or so, where I feel alright. And then… bam. A few times in a week, maybe. Or just once. It's really random. Hard to plan anything, if that makes sense. I haven't really been keepin' track, I just… deal with it when it happens. I don't even know if there's anything to track, really. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Right. Random, unpredictable…and debilitating enough that you're having trouble with planning things. That's important. Have you noticed anything that seems to precede these episodes?
PATIENT: See, that's the thing. No, not really. I've tried to think about it, but… I can't put my finger on anything. Sometimes I'm stressed, work's been a bit hectic lately, but other times I'm just… chillin'. It's happened when I'm tired, when I'm not, when I've eaten a good meal, when I haven't. Honestly, it feels completely… out of the blue. Which is kinda scary, ya know? I just wake up, or I'm goin' about my day, and then wham. It hits. I wish I could tell you somethin' set it off, but I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No clear triggers. Okay. Now, just to get a full picture…and don't worry if this sounds silly, have you had any changes in vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? Uh… not that I’ve noticed. Everything looks… normal, I guess. I mean, I don’t wear glasses or anything, never have. I don’t really pay that much attention to it, to be honest. I haven't seen any spots or blurry vision during an episode, if that’s what you mean. But… I don’t really sit there starin’ at walls, checkin’ for changes, ya know? Is that somethin' I should be doin’?
DOCTOR: No, no, you shouldn’t be actively checking. Just a routine question. And you haven’t noticed anything different overall – no double vision, things appearing dimmer, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. Everything seems pretty normal, like I said. Maybe… sometimes my eyes feel a bit strained after a long day at work, but that’s just from lookin' at screens all day, I reckon. I do a lot of assembly, gotta focus on small parts. But nothin’ weird, nothin’ out of the ordinary. Honestly, I'm startin' to feel a bit silly talkin' about this. It just happens, and I don't know why, and I don’t know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, it’s not silly to talk about it, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. I appreciate that. It just… feels a bit hopeless, ya know? I’ve had this happenin’ on and off for… I don’t know, maybe a year now? Longer? It's hard to keep track. And I just… deal with it. Take some paracetamol, lie down, try to sleep it off. It usually goes away eventually. But it keeps comin' back. And I’m just… tired of it, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. A year, on and off. Paracetamol helps temporarily…Okay, let's talk about other things then. Any family history of headaches, migraines, anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh… that's a tough one. My mum, she used to get headaches sometimes, yeah. Real bad ones, she'd have to lie down in a dark room. But she never really talked about it much, and I don't know if they were like my headaches. And my dad… he was pretty stoic, didn't really complain about much of anything. I don’t remember him ever mentionin’ headaches, but he wasn’t one for sharin’ feelings, ya know? I have a brother, he seems alright, never heard him complainin’ about headaches either. So… not really, I don’t think. It’s not like it runs in the family or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, not a strong family history. Let’s move on. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just the paracetamol when I need it. I used to take somethin' for… never mind. It was years ago, and I stopped takin' it. I don’t really like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. I try to just tough things out, ya know? And I don't really see the point in goin' to the doctor unless it's somethin' serious. Which is why I've been puttin’ this off for so long, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. So, paracetamol as needed, and that’s it. What about allergies?
PATIENT: Uh… nothin’ major, I don't think. I get a bit of hay fever in the summer, sneezin' and a runny nose, but that’s about it. Never had any serious allergic reactions, like trouble breathin’ or anything. And I don’t have any food allergies, as far as I know. I eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. No major allergies. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Is everything alright? Are you lookin' for somethin' specific?
DOCTOR: Just a standard exam, Jaxston. Nothing to worry about. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Heart rate is a bit fast, but that could be from the anxiety of being here, or something else. Neck muscles are a little tense. Any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. It's always a bit stiff, to be honest. I spend a lot of time hunched over at work, doin' assembly. And I reckon I sleep in a funny position sometimes. It's just… general tightness, I suppose. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, general tightness. Now, could you open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Ahhhh. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal so far. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. I need you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head, just your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm followin’ it. Is this to see if I'm… goin’ crazy or somethin’?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Just assessing your eye movements. Everything looks good there. Now, squeeze my hands.
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay? I try not to be too rough.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Both sides seem equal. Now, I need you to push your feet against my hands. I'm testing your reflexes.
PATIENT: Is everything alright? You’re not pullin' anythin' funny, are ya?
DOCTOR: No, nothing funny. Just testing. Your reflexes seem normal. Okay, Jaxston. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like tension headaches, possibly with some element of anxiety contributing. The fast heart rate, the sweating... it all fits. But we need to rule out other possibilities. I want to order a basic blood test – just to check your thyroid function and rule out any infection. And I'd like you to keep a headache diary for the next two weeks. Record when you get headaches, how severe they are , what you were doing beforehand, and anything that seems to make them better or worse.
PATIENT: A blood test, huh? And a diary? Sounds… alright, I guess. I don't really like needles, but if it's gonna rule stuff out, then okay. And a diary… that’s gonna be a pain, but I can try. I'm just… worried it's somethin' serious, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Jaxston. It’s good you're concerned, and that’s why we're doing these tests. The blood test and the diary will give us more information. If the blood work comes back normal, and the diary shows a pattern consistent with tension headaches, then we can focus on managing those. We can discuss some simple strategies – relaxation techniques, stretching exercises, and possibly some over-the-counter pain relievers. If things don’t improve, or if the blood work shows something else, then we can consider other possibilities and refer you to a specialist. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… sounds reasonable. A step-by-step approach. It’s just… I don’t want it to be somethin’ serious. I’ve got enough goin’ on, ya know? Okay. So, blood test, diary… and then we see what happens? Where do I get the blood test done?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Blood test, diary, then we re-evaluate. You can get the blood test done at the lab just across the street. I’ll give you a requisition form. They’ll take a small sample of blood, and the results will be sent back to me within a few days. I’ll also print out a headache diary template for you. Here are a few things to keep in mind while you’re keeping the diary: Date and time of headache Severity Location of pain What you were doing beforehand Any triggers you can identify Anything that makes it better or worse Any medications you took Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Right. Okay. Hmm… No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything pretty clearly. I guess… just try not to stress too much while I’m keepin’ the diary? It’s kinda ironic, ya know? I’ll get the blood test done tomorrow. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's a fair point – worrying about the diary while trying not to stress! Try to view it as gathering information, not as something to stress about. If you start to feel overwhelmed, just take a break from it. Here's my direct line if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up. Don't hesitate to call. Take care, Jaxston. And try to get some rest. We’ll figure this out. .
