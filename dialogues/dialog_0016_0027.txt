DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming back up. Really unpleasant, you know? It’s been happening for a few weeks now, especially after I eat. It’s just… reflux, I guess. My wife said I should come in. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A few weeks of… coming back up after eating, that sounds uncomfortable. And it’s good your wife encouraged you to come in – it’s always good to get these things checked out, even if it is just reflux. When you say “coming back up,” can you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean? It’s… food. Partially digested food. Sometimes it’s just liquid, sour stuff. Honestly, it’s not a pleasant topic. It happens when I lie down mostly. Or bend over. It's common sense, really. Don't doctors usually know these things?
DOCTOR: You're right, it's not a pleasant topic, and yes, it does sound like classic acid reflux. But it's my job to gather all the details, even the ones that seem obvious, to make sure we're not missing anything. It’s good you noticed it’s worse when lying down or bending over – that’s helpful information. When you say a few weeks, has it been consistently happening, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Consistently. Pretty much after every meal, if I eat too much. And don't tell me to eat less. I like my food! My wife keeps saying I need to slow down, smaller portions, but… I've always eaten like this. Never bothered me before. It's just now it’s coming back up. And it’s disgusting. Really. Is that all you need to know? Because frankly, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I won't lecture you about your diet. It’s good to know this is a recent change, and it's happening consistently after meals. It helps us rule things out. Now, aside from the coming back up, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don't have a fever, if that’s what you’re asking. And I haven't coughed up a lung. Look, it's just this… indigestion. It burns a little sometimes, in my chest. But it's not terrible. Honestly, I just want it to stop happening. Is there a pill for this? A quick fix? I don't need a whole lecture on lifestyle changes. I need something to make it go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no coughing. A burning sensation in your chest – that’s helpful to know, it sounds like heartburn. We can certainly talk about medications to help manage this, and there are several effective options. Before we jump to medications, though, I just want to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of the situation. Have you noticed any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Trouble swallowing? No. I eat just fine. Steak, chicken, whatever. I told you, I eat everything. It’s the after-effects that are the problem, not the eating itself. I don’t choke, I don’t feel like anything’s stuck. Are you writing all this down? Because it’s a waste of my time to repeat myself. Look, I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Mr. Altine. And I apologize if I’m repeating things; I want to be thorough. No trouble swallowing, good. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I wish I could lose a little weight, actually. My wife keeps nagging me about that too. But no, I haven’t lost any weight. Quite the opposite, probably. I enjoy my food too much. This is getting ridiculous. You're asking me about my weight now? Are you a doctor or a… a food critic? Just give me a pill. A strong one. And let me go.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Altine. I understand your frustration, and I’m not trying to be difficult. These questions are simply part of a standard assessment to rule out any underlying causes. Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I take a statin for cholesterol, but no reactions. My wife gives me all sorts of over-the-counter stuff for my knees when they bother me, and I haven’t died yet, so… I guess I'm fine. Honestly, I don't keep track of all that stuff. She handles the medication. Just… can we please get to the pill already? This is a complete waste of my time. And frankly, it's insulting. I know my body. I need something to stop the reflux. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re on a statin for cholesterol, no known allergies, and your wife manages your medications. I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I assure you I’m not trying to waste your time. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll gently feel your abdomen. It’ll just take a minute. This helps me get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to hold still for long. I have things to do. And be quick about it. Honestly, this is ridiculous. A physical exam for a little reflux? My wife is going to hear about this. She's the one who wanted me to come in, anyway. It's probably all in my head. Stress, she says. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No tenderness to palpation. No masses appreciated. Okay, everything sounds and feels normal so far. No immediate concerns. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it does sound like acid reflux, also known as GERD. It's very common. However, given your age, we want to make sure it's not something more serious. I'd like to order a simple blood test to check for any anemia or infection, and potentially a stool test to rule out any bacterial overgrowth. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood test? Stool test? Now you want to take my blood and look at my… Never mind. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just get it over with. But I expect results quickly. I don't want to spend another afternoon in a doctor's office. This is all very inconvenient. And expensive, I'm sure. My wife is going to be furious when she sees the bill. Honestly, this is… ridiculous. Can I at least get a prescription for something now? Something to stop the burning? I'm practically a medical case study at this point.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. We'll get the tests ordered right away, and we’ll do our best to get the results back quickly. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. It’s a medication that reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. It should help relieve your symptoms. We'll start with a low dose and see how you respond. I’m also going to recommend some lifestyle adjustments, but I promise not to lecture. Avoiding large meals, eating slowly, and elevating the head of your bed can make a big difference. Here’s the prescription for omeprazole, and these pamphlets provide more information about GERD and lifestyle modifications. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the test results and see how you’re doing on the medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Two weeks. Whatever. Omeprazole, you said? I'll try it. But if it doesn't work, I'm not coming back. My time is valuable, you know. And don't expect me to read all this. My wife can handle it. Honestly, this whole experience has been… a waste of my afternoon. Can I go now? I have things to do. And tell the billing department to send the bill to my wife. She handles all this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. Here's my card in case you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. We’ll send the bill to your wife. I hope the omeprazole provides some relief, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Thank you for coming in today. Have a better afternoon. .
