DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um... well, it’s my stomach. It's been… not great, lately. Lots of diarrhea. It's been going on for a bit, I think. I have trouble remembering exactly when it started, to be honest. It just feels… constant, almost.
DOCTOR: Constant, you say. Right. Well, “a bit” isn't terribly helpful, unfortunately. Let’s try to narrow it down. Would you say it's been a week?
PATIENT: Hmm… a week? Maybe more? It feels like it’s been going on for a couple of weeks, definitely. I just… things are a bit of a blur lately. Sorry. It’s hard to keep track. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: It’s… fine. Though precise recollection is always helpful for diagnosis, we'll do our best. So, a couple of weeks of diarrhea. Anything else accompany it?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes I feel really tired. Just… worn out, you know? And a little crampy, but not always. Mostly just tired, I guess. Oh! And I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot. More than usual, even for… this. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things. Frequent bowel movements and fatigue… Right. Are these bowel movements watery?
PATIENT: Yeah, they’re pretty watery. Like… really watery. Not solid at all. Sometimes they're... almost liquid, I guess. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining this. It's embarrassing, too.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. It’s my job to ask these sorts of questions. We need to be specific. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… um… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I try not to look too closely, to be honest. It's… unpleasant. Is that bad? Should I be looking? I’m really sorry, I’m not sure I’m being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s… alright. We're getting there. No visible blood is good. And no, you're not expected to look for it, just answer truthfully if you happen to notice. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And I haven’t been sick to my stomach, thankfully. Just… the constant running. It’s exhausting. I haven't really had much of an appetite either, if that matters. I just feel… drained.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of appetite along with fatigue and diarrhea. Have you experienced any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet… Hmm. Not really, I don't think. My husband does most of the cooking. We usually have… well, typical Pakistani food. Rice, curry… things like that. Nothing new, as far as I know. Maybe a bit more takeout lately, but that’s just because I haven’t been feeling up to it. Does takeout make a difference?
DOCTOR: It can. Food preparation standards vary, you see. But let's not dwell on takeout right now. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, no traveling. I haven’t left town in months. We mostly just stay home. My husband works a lot, and I… well, I don’t really go anywhere on my own much. It’s just been… quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Um… just the normal stuff, I think. For my blood pressure, a small pill every morning. And… oh, sometimes I take something for a headache, but not very often. That’s it, I think. Oh! And Medicare covers it, of course. I’m not sure if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: It’s… noted. What is the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh… uh… I’m so bad with names. I just take the little white pill, you know? My husband refills it for me. I honestly have no idea what it’s called. I’m really sorry. Is that… bad? I just let him handle all of that. I'm not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: It would be extremely helpful to know the name of your blood pressure medication, Jase. Do you have any idea where we might find it?
PATIENT: Oh! Wait… maybe. I think… I think there’s a bottle in the kitchen. With all the pills. My husband keeps them organized. If you wait a minute, I can go check. Would that be okay? I feel terrible not knowing! I just… I rely on him for these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be ideal. Please, go ahead. I'll be here. And don't feel bad, we’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you! I’ll be right back. I really appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Honestly… it’s difficult to diagnose anything when you have no information. No medication list, vague symptoms… It’s like pulling teeth.
PATIENT: Here! I found it. It says… Losartan. That’s L-O-S-A-R-T-A-N. Is that… helpful? I hope I read it right. My husband usually handles this, so I’m a bit lost.
DOCTOR: Losartan. Yes, that’s… more helpful. It’s a common blood pressure medication. Now, let’s move on to a physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. It’s just… my stomach’s been a bit sore, as I said. But if you need to listen, go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathe deeply for me. There's some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rigidity. Your bowel sounds are… hyperactive. No masses palpable. Okay. We’ll need to run some tests to rule out any infections or other potential causes. I'm ordering a stool sample, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. I'll also need to check your electrolytes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. A stool sample? Oh dear. That doesn't sound very pleasant, but if you think it's necessary… then yes. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you need to do to figure out what’s wrong. Just… please, be quick? This has been going on for so long, I just want it to be over.
DOCTOR: It's a standard procedure, Jase. And relatively quick. The lab will provide you with the necessary collection kit and instructions. They'll explain everything thoroughly. I'm also going to prescribe you an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage the symptoms in the meantime. It’s loperamide, available over-the-counter, but I'm writing you a prescription just in case. Take two tablets initially, then one after each loose stool, but not exceeding eight tablets in 24 hours. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Two to start, then one after each time… but no more than eight in a day. Loperamide… okay, I think I remember seeing that in the shops. Yes, that’s clear. Thank you. Will that… will that help? I’m just so tired of being stuck inside.
DOCTOR: It should help alleviate the symptoms, yes. However, it's important to remember this is just symptom management. We need to identify the cause of the diarrhea to provide a more definitive treatment. Once we have the lab results, we’ll have a clearer picture. I'd also recommend staying hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids – water, electrolyte solutions, broth. And try to stick to bland foods for the next few days – rice, toast, bananas. Is there anything else I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Hydrate, bland food… and wait for the tests. You've been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s just… it’s been a long few weeks. I really hope we find out what’s wrong soon. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab will contact you to schedule the tests. And we'll follow up once the results are available. Do try to get some rest, Jase. And don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen.
