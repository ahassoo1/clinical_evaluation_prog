DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Baken. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Baken, you say? A… Dutch name, yes? Well, I’m here because, frankly, I just need a little… boost. A card, you see. A “Get Well” card. My daughter, she thinks I need one. Says it’ll… cheer me up. It’s silly, I know, but she insisted.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mr. Kammer. A thoughtful gesture from your daughter. It’s good to have such caring family. So, if I understand correctly, you’re not experiencing any specific medical complaints, but you’re feeling perhaps a bit low in spirits?
PATIENT: Low spirits is… putting it nicely, Doctor. It’s just… things. Life, you know? Getting older. Everything aches, everyone is busy, nobody calls… It’s not something I need fixed, mind you. Just… a little encouragement. A card from a doctor… carries some weight, you understand? People take notice.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of… discouragement, perhaps some feelings of loneliness and the general challenges that come with age. While a "Get Well" card is a lovely idea, I believe it’s important to explore what’s contributing to these feelings, even if you don’t perceive them as a specific illness. It’s quite common for changes in life circumstances to affect one's well-being. To get a better understanding of your overall health, would you mind if I asked a few questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… I suppose. But don’t expect any long stories, Doctor. I’m a simple man. I operate boilers, you see. Things are either working or they’re not. Not much in between. And I don’t really talk about… feelings. But go ahead. Just… keep it brief, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will keep it as concise as possible. We can certainly focus on the practical aspects. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. The doctor put me on a pill. I took it for a while, then I… forgot about it. It didn’t feel bad, you see? And I don’t like taking pills. Besides, my Medicare covers it, so I figured it wasn’t important. Boilers are more important. They break, you fix them. Simple. Everything else… I leave it. No diabetes, though. I like a sweet pastry now and then, but I don’t have that problem.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Kammer. However, even if you don’t feel any symptoms, uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious complications over time. It’s good that you’re aware of it. Regarding the medication, do you recall the name of the pill you were taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… No. No, I don’t. It was a little white one, I think. Or maybe it was beige? Small, that's all I remember. They all look the same to me. The pharmacist always gave me a new bottle, and I just… took them. I don’t make a habit of remembering pill names, Doctor. That’s what doctors are for, isn’t it? You keep track of these things. I just operate the boilers.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Kammer. That is what I am here for. Let me access your electronic health record to see if we can identify the medication you were previously prescribed. Ah, yes. It appears you were taking Lisinopril. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason in the past?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… That sounds… familiar. Maybe. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Everything’s a blur after a while. Surgeries… Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. That needed a cast. Other than that… no. Nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises from working with machinery. Boilers aren't always forgiving, you understand. They’re hot. Very hot.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and a wrist fracture. Noted. Now, I'd like to briefly ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father… he had a bad heart. Passed away when I was young. A heart attack, they said. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, I think. Lots of aches and pains. And my sister… she had some kind of cancer, years ago. Didn't go well. Other than that… not really. We weren't a family that talked much about… health. It was just… understood. If someone felt bad, they stayed quiet and dealt with it. Boilers don’t ask for sick days, you see. You just keep working.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like there's a history of heart disease and cancer in your family. It’s good to be aware of these factors. Now, let's talk a bit about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, though. A lot. Probably killed him, that habit. I always thought so. I prefer a good cup of coffee, strong and black. And maybe a sweet pastry now and then. But smoking… no. Absolutely not. Boilers have enough fumes already, thank you very much. I don't need to add to them.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Kammer. Avoiding tobacco is a very positive choice. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A little wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy. Just a glass or two. Helps me relax after a long day working with those boilers, you see? They're… demanding. But I don’t drink to excess. Never have. I need to be sharp, you understand? Boilers don’t forgive mistakes. It's… a responsibility. I don’t go out to bars or anything like that. Just a quiet glass at home. That's all.
DOCTOR: That sounds reasonable, Mr. Kammer. Now, to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Well… like I said before, I was taking that pill for the blood pressure, but I stopped. I don't like taking pills, you understand? Other than that… no. Just coffee. Strong and black. And sometimes, a little something for my aches and pains. A cream, you see? Rub it on my joints. Nothing serious. Just to help me move. It’s… a winter thing, mostly. It gets cold working in that boiler room. But it’s nothing a doctor would need to know about. Just… a little cream. Like lotion.
DOCTOR: I understand you prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, Mr. Kammer. However, it’s important for me to have a complete understanding of everything you’re using, even over-the-counter remedies and topical creams. What is the name of the cream you use for your aches and pains?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. You’re persistent, I’ll give you that. It’s… BenGay, I think. Or maybe it’s Icy Hot? They all smell the same, you see? It’s… the red one. The one in the jar. My daughter buys it for me. She worries, you understand? Says I need to take care of myself. I just rub it on my knees and my back. It helps a little. But it’s… nothing serious. Just an old man’s aches and pains. Boilers are hard on the body, you understand? It's a demanding job.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. I appreciate you sharing that information with me. It’s helpful to know you’re using BenGay for your aches and pains. Now, before we move on, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, such as foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a problem with food. Dust bothers me a little, but what old man doesn’t have a problem with dust? The boiler room isn’t exactly known for being spotless, you understand? But… no. No allergies. Not that I'm aware of. My daughter always asks, but I always tell her no. It's just… not something I worry about. Boilers are a bigger concern. They break down, you fix them. Allergies… seem less important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. That completes our review of your medical history and current lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you must. But don’t expect miracles. I’m an old boiler operator, not a… a specimen. Just… get it over with quickly, if you would. Boilers don’t wait for doctors, you understand? And neither does my wife… I mean, my daughter. She wants me back home. Quickly. Just… check your things and get it over with. I’ll try to be still. But don't expect too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will be as efficient as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Your blood pressure is 152 over 88. That’s a bit elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear, but there is some diminished breath sound on the lower lobes. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your pulses are a bit weak in your lower extremities. Overall, your findings suggest some mild cardiovascular changes, which are not uncommon given your age and blood pressure. It is worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Weak pulses? Cardiovascular changes? What does that mean, Doctor? Is something… broken? Like a boiler? Look, I operate those things for a living. I know when something’s not right. Is my heart… going to stop? My daughter will be worried sick. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it serious? And can I still operate my boilers? That's the important question. They rely on me, you understand? They can't just shut down.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, please try not to worry. Your heart is not going to stop. The findings I’ve observed are not immediately life-threatening, but they do warrant further investigation. The murmur is likely a benign age-related change, but we need to rule out any underlying structural heart problems. The diminished breath sounds and weak pulses could indicate some peripheral artery disease, which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your legs. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests: an electrocardiogram to check your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and an ankle-brachial index to assess blood flow in your legs. These tests will help us determine the best course of action. Regarding your ability to operate your boilers, I’m not going to recommend any restrictions at this time. However, it’s important to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests. We can discuss this further once we have more information. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. An EKG, a chest X-ray, an… ankle-brachial… whatever that is. It sounds… complicated. And expensive, probably. My Medicare… will it cover all this? And what if they find something bad? Will I have to… stop operating the boilers? That's my livelihood, Doctor. That's all I know. Look, I appreciate you checking things, I really do. But I'm not sure I want to know if I'm falling apart. Maybe I'm just getting old. Maybe that's all it is. Can’t I just… take it easy? And maybe get that card from my daughter? Is that so much to ask? The card was the whole point of coming here, you know. Not all these… tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your concerns completely. It’s natural to feel anxious about tests and potential findings. And you are right to prioritize what’s important to you – your livelihood and maintaining your quality of life. Let me assure you, Medicare will cover these tests. I will handle all the necessary paperwork and ensure that you don’t incur any unexpected expenses. Regarding the tests themselves, they are relatively simple and non-invasive. The EKG involves placing electrodes on your chest, the chest X-ray takes just a few minutes, and the ABI involves measuring blood pressure in your arms and legs. And you are right, the goal isn't to scare you, but to get a clearer picture of your overall health and ensure you can continue doing what you enjoy. If we identify any issues, we can explore treatment options that allow you to maintain your independence and continue operating your boilers safely. I won’t push you into anything you’re not comfortable with. But I strongly recommend getting these tests done, just to be on the safe side. They will give us the information we need to make informed decisions about your care. Would you be willing to schedule these tests for next week?
PATIENT: Next week… Alright. Alright, fine. Next week. But… promise me you won't take away my boilers. That's all I ask. And if it's something… serious, just tell me straight. No beating around the bush. I'm an old man, Doctor. I've seen things. I can handle the truth. And… could you write me a note for that card? Just something to tell my daughter I’m getting checked out? That I'm taking care of myself? She worries so much. It’s… exhausting. Alright. Next week. Schedule the tests. And the note for my daughter. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I promise you, I will do everything I can to ensure you continue doing what you love. And I will be completely honest with you about any findings. We will discuss all your options and make decisions together. Let me schedule those tests for you now. We can get you in for an EKG and chest X-ray on Tuesday morning, and the ABI on Wednesday afternoon. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday and Wednesday… yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t interfere with the boilers. They're… unforgiving. And the note… you’ll write a note for my daughter? What should it say? Just… that I’m getting checked out? That I’m listening to her? Alright. Tuesday and Wednesday. And the note. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. You’re a… thorough man. Even if it means more tests.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. Here you go. "To my dear daughter, I am following up with Dr. Baken to ensure I am in good health and taking care of myself. I appreciate your concern and love. Love, Dad." Is that satisfactory?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s perfect. She’ll… she’ll like that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve put my mind at ease. A little. Alright. I think that’s all. Tests on Tuesday and Wednesday. And the note is safe. I should get back to the boilers. They won’t fix themselves, you know. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been… very patient. Even if it means more tests. And… maybe, just maybe, I’ll get that card after all.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Kammer. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, taking care of yourself is the most important thing. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday. Take care, and get back to those boilers. .
