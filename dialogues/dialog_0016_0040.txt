DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Espinueva, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain I keep getting in my side… my flank, I believe you call it. And, truthfully, I seem to be getting urinary tract infections rather often these days. It’s been… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Okay, troublesome is a good way to put it. Let’s talk about this flank pain and the frequent UTIs. To start with the flank pain, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It comes and goes, Doctor. Not constant, thankfully. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it’s sharper, feels like a cramp, but that doesn't last long. It’s always on my right side, as far as I can tell. And it seems to get worse if I… well, if I’m moving around a lot, or if I lift something heavy. Not very heavy, mind you, just… normal things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache on your right side, sometimes sharper cramping, worsened with activity. That’s helpful. And when did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s been… a while. I suppose it started maybe six months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little niggle, I ignored it. But it's been getting more frequent, and a bit more… noticeable, these past few months. About the same time, really, as these… water infections. I keep getting them, one after the other.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, gradually worsening, and coinciding with the UTIs. Alright. And can you tell me a little more about these UTIs?
PATIENT: They’re… uncomfortable, Doctor. Burning when I go to the toilet, that’s the main thing. And I have to go all the time. Even when I haven’t had much to drink. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a bit shaky, like a mild fever, but nothing too serious. I go to the chemist, get some tablets, and it clears up, but it always comes back. I feel like I’m constantly on antibiotics.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, frequent urge to urinate, and occasional mild shakiness. You said you’ve been getting tablets from the chemist – do you know what those tablets are?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. They’re… small, white pills. I believe the man at the chemist said something about… Trimethoprim? Is that right? I’m not very good with names, I’m afraid. He says it's for infections. I just tell him what’s wrong, and he gives me the pills, and usually they fix it for a bit. But like I said, it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Trimethoprim. That's an antibiotic, as you know. And it’s good you’re aware of that. Frequent UTIs requiring antibiotics are definitely something we need to investigate further. Let’s move on to some other things. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. A few times. Not a lot, mind you. Just a little bit of pink, mostly. It scares me a little, that. It doesn’t happen every time I go, just sometimes. And it’s not… a flood, like. Just enough to notice it. It’s why I keep going back to the chemist, you see. I thought it was just a bad infection.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me that. Seeing blood in your urine, even a little, is important. And the fact that it’s recurring despite the antibiotics is also concerning. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. It’s… unsettling, worrying about it all the time. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll gently press on your flanks and lower abdomen to see if anything feels tender. Just let me know if anything feels painful. And I'll also check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature—just as a baseline. Okay, breathing normally... I'm listening to your abdomen now. ...And now I'm gently pressing on your flanks... Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… a little bit there, on the right side. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. A dull ache, really. Like the pain I get normally, but a bit more noticeable when you press on it. It’s… hard to explain. Not horrible, just… there. Is that… bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. A bit of tenderness on your right flank is consistent with what you’ve been describing. Now, I'm going to check your lower abdomen. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not really there. A little bit of pressure, of course, but not pain. It’s just my side that bothers me. The right side. It’s always the right side. Is it… something serious, Doctor? I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. I’ve never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Your vital signs are stable—blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Based on what you’ve told me, and the tenderness on your right flank, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a kidney infection, a stone in your kidney, or something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urinalysis—to check for infection and blood—and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The CT scan will help us visualize your kidneys, ureters, and bladder, and see if there are any stones or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… serious. But if it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, please. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing all this pain and keep getting these infections. Will the scan… will it be uncomfortable? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I don’t like to worry, but it's hard not to, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Espinueva. A CT scan is a painless procedure—you’ll lie on a table, and a scanner will take images of your abdomen. You may be asked to drink some contrast dye beforehand to help visualize the structures better. It typically takes about 30 minutes. As for the results, the radiologist will interpret the images, and I should have them within 24 to 48 hours. I will call you as soon as I have them and we can discuss the findings and a plan of treatment. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics to start treating the potential infection while we wait for the scan results. We’ll use a different antibiotic than the one you’ve been taking from the chemist, to broaden the coverage. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Doctor. To have something started, to be doing something… that eases my mind. A different antibiotic, yes, that sounds sensible. And 24 to 48 hours for the results… I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It's my job. Okay, I'm writing a prescription for Nitrofurantoin, 100mg twice a day for seven days. Please take it with food, as it can sometimes cause nausea. And it’s very important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better. Here's a requisition form for the CT scan. You can take this to the radiology department at [Name of Hospital/Imaging Center]. And here's a printout of instructions on how to prepare for the scan—mostly just drinking plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Nitrofurantoin… I’ll remember that. And finish the whole course, yes, I understand. Plenty of fluids, too. No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and explanation. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and what needs to be done. Hopefully, the scan will show something clear. I will go to the radiology department as soon as I can. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Okay, you too, Mr. Espinueva. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your scan, or if your symptoms worsen. And we will speak as soon as I have the results. Take care and I hope you feel better soon.
