DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's good to meet you too. I... just moved here. I think this is like, a check-up? My husband said I needed to find a doctor when we got here. I don't really... remember why exactly. Just new to the area and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A general check-up is a great place to start when you’re new to an area. We can definitely do that. Just to get a better idea of things, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with your health lately?
PATIENT: Um… not much, I don't think? I mean, I feel okay. I work… with machines? Fixing them. It’s kinda hard work, sometimes my back gets sore. But that’s just… work. Nothing wrong, wrong. Does that make sense? I forget things easy, too. Like, why I’m here sometimes, haha.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Emileigh. Back soreness from physical work is common, and forgetting things happens to everyone. It’s good you mentioned both of those things. Just to clarify, is the back soreness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Worse when I’m… bending a lot. Or lifting stuff. Like, really heavy parts. Not every day, though. Some days it’s fine. And… I usually just take some time to rest and it gets better. I don’t really… do anything special for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you said you sometimes forget things easily… Is this a new thing, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh… a while, I think. Like… always, kinda? My husband says I repeat myself sometimes. And I forget where I put things. Little things, mostly. Like my keys or… what I was going to say. It doesn't really… bother me, usually. Just annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll definitely make a note of that. Just to get a more complete picture, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not that I can remember. I sleep okay, I guess. Eat… regular. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s probably just from work. Oh! Sometimes my hands get kinda numb when I’m… working on small parts. But it goes away pretty quick. Is that… something?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s definitely something worth mentioning, Emileigh. Numbness in your hands could be related to a few things. Do you notice it in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Usually both, I think. Or maybe just… the tips of my fingers. It doesn't hurt, just… feels kinda tingly and… not really there? It goes away when I move my hands around, or… stop working for a bit. It's not super bad, though. I just thought I'd mention it since you asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's always better to mention everything, even if it seems small. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Uhm… I… honestly, I don’t really remember. I was pretty young when I… moved around a lot, so I don’t know what happened before. My husband might know, but he’s not here. I think I broke my arm once, when I was little? But that’s all I can really think of. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's very common to not remember details from childhood, especially if there was a lot of movement. We can work with what you do remember. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My husband always makes sure I don’t eat anything weird. He’s really careful. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I mean, he’d know if I was allergic to something, right? He's always asking if I feel okay after I eat something new.
DOCTOR: He sounds very supportive. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t really… like taking pills. My husband tried to get me to take something for… something, but I didn't like it. Just… nothing. He says I should probably take something for my back, but I haven't yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Okay, Emileigh, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. It'll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and feeling your back and hands. It’ll help me get a better sense of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I… have to get back to work later. Whatever you need to do. Just… gentle, please? My back gets sore easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you could sit up here for me, that would be great. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. There’s some mild tenderness along the lower lumbar spine, particularly on the left side. No signs of acute inflammation. Grip strength is good bilaterally. Sensation is intact. However, I do notice some mild decreased strength when I ask you to oppose your thumb to your fingers… and some slight tingling in your fingertips when I hold your wrist in this position.
PATIENT: Oh… yeah, that feels kinda funny. It tingles. Like… pins and needles? I didn’t really notice it before, but… yeah, that feels weird. Does that mean something’s wrong? My husband said I should probably get a brace for my hands, but I told him it was probably nothing.
DOCTOR: It could mean something, Emileigh. It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s good we’re looking into it. What you’re describing, along with the numbness and tingling, is consistent with possible carpal tunnel syndrome. It happens when the nerve in your wrist gets compressed, often from repetitive hand movements. It's common in people who do a lot of manual work. We can do a simple test to help confirm it, or, if you'd prefer, I can refer you to a specialist for more thorough testing. They can do a nerve conduction study to see how well the nerve is functioning. Would you like to discuss those options?
PATIENT: Uhm… a specialist? That sounds… scary. A test sounds… bad. Is it… serious? Does that mean I can’t work anymore? My husband will be so worried. I just want to feel normal again. What does the test do?
DOCTOR: It's okay to be worried, Emileigh. It's completely understandable. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious, and it definitely doesn't mean you can't work anymore. A lot of people with carpal tunnel syndrome are still able to work with treatment. The test, a nerve conduction study, is pretty quick and doesn't hurt too badly. They’ll attach small electrodes to your skin and send a mild electrical impulse to your hand. It might feel like a little zap, but it's not dangerous. It just measures how quickly the nerve signals are traveling. Before we jump to a test, we could try some conservative treatments first. Things like wrist braces, especially when you're working, can make a big difference. We could also try some exercises to strengthen your hands and wrists. And I can show you some stretches to do throughout the day. If those don't help after a few weeks, then we can consider a referral to a specialist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… better. Not scary-sounding, like the test. Braces and exercises… I can probably do that. My husband would like that too, he always tells me to be careful. Show me the exercises? And the stretches? And where do I get the braces? He's good at finding things online, maybe he can get them.
DOCTOR: Great! I'm glad we can start with something less invasive. Okay, so this one is a wrist flexion stretch. Gently bend your wrist down, like you're waving goodbye. Hold it for 15-30 seconds, and repeat 10 times. And then, do the same thing, bending your wrist up. And then, this is a fist exercise. Make a tight fist, and then slowly open your hand, spreading your fingers wide. Repeat that 10 times. Do these throughout the day, whenever you feel any discomfort. And as for the braces, you can find them at most pharmacies, or online, like your husband mentioned. Look for ones that support your wrist and keep it in a neutral position. I’m going to write these down for you, and I’ll give you a handout with some information about carpal tunnel syndrome. Let's also talk about managing your back soreness. Are you doing anything to prevent it, like proper lifting techniques?
PATIENT: Uhm… no, not really. I just… pick things up. I don’t think about it. My husband tells me to lift with my legs, but I forget. It's hard when things are heavy! I just want to get the job done. Maybe I should pay more attention, but… it’s just hard to remember.
DOCTOR: It is hard to remember, especially when you’re focused on the task at hand. Proper lifting technique is really important to protect your back. So, you want to keep your back straight, bend your knees, and lift with your legs, not your back. Keep the object close to your body. And avoid twisting while lifting. I’m going to give you a handout with some information about safe lifting techniques, as well. And I’m going to write a note recommending you take breaks throughout the day to stretch and rest your back. So, to summarize, we’re going to try wrist braces and exercises for the carpal tunnel syndrome, focus on safe lifting techniques for your back, and I’m going to give you some handouts with more information. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you’re doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A follow-up… in a few weeks. Thank you. You’ve been really helpful. I feel… better now. I think I can remember this stuff… with the handouts. My husband will be happy too. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Just remember to take it easy, listen to your body, and don’t push yourself too hard. And good luck! Have a good day, Emileigh.
