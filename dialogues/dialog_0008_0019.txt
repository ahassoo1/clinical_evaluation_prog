DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what bring me? My wife, she want… baby. We… old now, you see? She think maybe need help to… make baby happen. I forget all the… words. Something about planning? For… before? She do much of the talking, I think. I just… come with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, your wife is interested in exploring options for starting a family, and you're here to discuss that with me. It sounds like she's interested in family planning, specifically assistance with conception. That's perfectly alright. Before we get into specifics, could you tell me a little bit about both of your medical histories?
PATIENT: Medical… histories? Oh, dear. I… not remember much. I have… usual things, you know? Old man problems. A little trouble with… bones sometimes. And… blood pressure, maybe? I take pills. Small white pills. My wife, she… stronger than me. Very healthy, always walk. I think she had… something with her tummy long time ago, but all fixed now. She go to the doctor regular. I… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s helpful to know that you take medication for blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication, or the dosage?
PATIENT: Hmm… name… no. I just take them. Every morning. Small, white… round ones. Doctor give them to me long time ago. I… forget the doctor’s name too, I’m sorry. He… not here anymore, I think. My wife, she keep the… bottle. Maybe she remember. I just… do what she say, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can try to figure it out. It's good your wife is so involved in your healthcare. Let's talk about you for a moment, Mr. Carlotta. Besides the “old man problems” and the pills, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Serious… illnesses? Let me think. When I was young… very young, in Somalia, I had… fever. Very bad fever. But all gone now. And… I break my arm once, falling from tree. When I was boy. They… put it in cast. That’s all, I think. No… nothing serious. I always work hard, you see? Model maker. Metal and plastic. Good strong hands. No time for… getting sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a childhood illness with a high fever, and a broken arm when you were young. And you've generally been healthy and active throughout your life, working as a model maker. That’s good to hear. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any major medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father, he… heart trouble. When he was old. Very sad. He… just stop working. Stop eating. Gone quick. My mother, she… strong woman. Live long life. No… I don't think so. No big sickness in her family. Lots of… children, though! Big family. Mostly everyone healthy. In Somalia, you see? Life… hard. Only strong ones live.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And what about on your wife’s side of the family?
PATIENT: Wife's side… she from here, you see? America. Lots of… doctors in her family, I think. Her mother, very healthy, still walk every day. Her father… he had… sugar trouble. Diabetes, she say. And… her sister, she had… tummy trouble, long time ago. But all fixed now. They talk about it a lot. She remind me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so on your wife’s side, we have a healthy mother, a father with diabetes, and a sister with a history of resolved tummy trouble. Now, just to be thorough, are either of you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I… don't think so. Never had trouble with… anything. I eat everything. My wife, she… maybe little trouble with… shellfish. Sometimes make her… itchy. But not bad. She just… don't eat it. I… never had trouble. Strong man, remember? Nothing bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Finally, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any other medications besides the small white pills for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think very hard. Sometimes… when my bones ache, I take… little brown pills. For the pain. Only when it bad, though. Not every day. My wife, she give them to me. I forget the name. She knows all the names. I just… take them when she say.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. It sounds like you take small white pills for blood pressure and occasionally little brown pills for bone pain, but you're unsure of the specific names or dosages of either. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That fine. Physical… exam. Okay. I… strong man, you will see! But… old man. Maybe not so strong anymore. Do what you need to do, Doctor. My wife… she always tell me to listen to the doctor. She very smart woman.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Your wife sounds very wise. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, we’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. It will just take a few moments. First, let’s get your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Extend arm. Here. Old man problems, you know. Not so quick anymore. But… strong arm! Still can make good models. You try to break it, you will see!
DOCTOR: I'm not trying to break anything, Mr. Carlotta. Just checking your vitals. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 152 over 88. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 76, which is fairly normal. And your temperature is 98.6. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Deep breath. Yes. Old lungs. Worked hard all my life, you see. Metal dust, plastic fumes… not so good for lungs. But… still working!
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds good, regular and strong. Your lungs have some mild wheezing, and the breath sounds are a little decreased, which could be related to your history of working with metal dust and plastic fumes. It might be something called mild COPD, but we'd need further testing to confirm that. Now, let’s take a look at your joints. Do you have any pain in your hands, wrists, or knees?
PATIENT: Joints… hmm. Sometimes. Especially in the morning. When it cold. Fingers… stiff. And knees… when I walk too much. Like… old man problems, you know? Not so bad, though. I can still make good models. Need strong hands for that! But… they ache sometimes.
DOCTOR: I notice some tenderness and decreased range of motion in your hands, especially in the knuckles, and some crepitus – that’s a crackling sound – in your knees when you move them. No swelling is visible, which is good. Now, one final question. Are you having any problems with urination, such as frequency, urgency, or pain?
PATIENT: Urination? Hmm. No… no problems. Go normal. Sometimes… little more often at night. But… old man problems, you know? Have to get up a few times. My wife… she complain sometimes. But… nothing serious. Just… old man.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you’re generally in stable condition for your age, but you have some manageable issues, including slightly elevated blood pressure, mild wheezing in your lungs, and some joint pain. Given your wife’s desire to start a family, we need to consider the potential impact of any underlying health conditions and ensure both of you are healthy enough to pursue that goal. And we should investigate the wheezing a little further. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm. My wife… she always ask the questions. I just… come with. But… you think we can… make baby happen? Even old like this? And… is my lungs… bad? Will I… not be able to play with the baby if it comes? That important to me. Playing… and making models, of course.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Mr. Carlotta. Let’s address them one at a time. Regarding your wife’s desire to start a family, it's certainly possible to conceive at your age, although it may require some assistance. We’ll need to do some blood tests to assess your overall health and hormone levels, and we’ll also want to evaluate your wife’s health. A referral to a fertility specialist might be beneficial. As for your lungs, the wheezing suggests some mild airway obstruction, potentially related to your occupational history. It's not immediately life-threatening, but we should investigate it further with a pulmonary function test to determine the severity and rule out any other underlying conditions. If it’s mild COPD, as I suspect, we can manage it with medication and lifestyle changes. And importantly, with proper management, you should absolutely be able to play with your grandchild if you’re blessed with one. Staying active and continuing to enjoy your hobbies, like model making, are both important for your physical and mental health. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that good. That good to hear. My wife… she will be happy. She worry a lot. Blood tests… and see specialist… okay. We trust you, Doctor. You… very good doctor. And… playing with baby… that very important. Maybe I teach baby to make models! So… what next? More tests? When? And… how much cost? My wife… she handle the money. I just… make the models.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Yes, the next step is to order some blood tests for both you and your wife. I'll also write a referral for a pulmonary function test to evaluate your lung function. And a referral to a fertility specialist for a consult to discuss options for conception. The lab and specialist will contact you to schedule appointments. Regarding the cost, I understand your wife handles the finances. I’ll have the clinic’s billing department contact her directly to provide a breakdown of the estimated costs for the tests and consultations. They can also discuss payment options and insurance coverage. Medicare should cover a significant portion of the tests, but it’s always best to confirm with them directly. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle. If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or other concerning symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that all. Thank you, Doctor. You… very kind. And… helpful. You listen to old man. That good. My wife… she be happy to hear all this. We go home now. Make some tea… and make models. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I wish you and your wife all the best. Have a good day, and enjoy your tea and model making.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
