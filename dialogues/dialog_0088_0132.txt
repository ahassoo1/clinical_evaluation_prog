DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this heat, really. Can’t stand it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Painting, you know? Construction work. Now? I get…well, just awful. Feel faint, dizzy. It’s ridiculous. Makes a man feel useless.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like the heat is really affecting you. Feeling faint and dizzy is definitely concerning. Just to clarify, when you say “awful,” can you describe those symptoms a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Well, it’s not like a proper sickness, if you follow. More…weak. Like all the strength’s just…leached out of me. And the head, feels like it's stuffed with cotton wool, makes it hard to think straight. Sometimes I get a bit of a tremor too, in the hands. Not bad, but noticeable. And I sweat, a lot, even when I'm just sitting still. It’s…unpleasant. I've always been a strong man, you see. This isn’t normal for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, weak, cotton wool feeling in the head, a tremor in your hands, and excessive sweating…and this is a change from how you normally feel. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. Started maybe…springtime? Not too bad at first, just a bit more tired than usual after a long day. Thought it was just getting old, to be honest. But it’s gotten worse with every hot spell. This last week… unbearable. I had to stop work on old Mrs. Henderson's fence. Couldn't concentrate, kept nearly falling off the ladder. She wasn’t pleased.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradual onset starting in the spring, worsening with the heat…and impacting your ability to work safely. Do you feel thirsty more often than usual?
PATIENT: Thirsty? Not particularly. I drink when I feel like it, same as always. Never been one for carrying water bottles around. Seems a bit…fussy, if you ask me. Proper Nepalese men don’t need constant hydration, we’re made of stronger stuff. But, now that you mention it, maybe I should be drinking more. Still, don’t feel particularly parched.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t feel particularly thirsty, but acknowledge you might need to drink more. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? What do you mean? Going to the toilet? It’s…normal. Same as always. Look, Doctor, I’m a practical man. I build things, I paint things, I fix things. I don't spend much time analyzing my…well, you know. Is this relevant? Are you looking for something specific?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am trying to gather information, Mr. Coby. Changes in urination can sometimes be helpful. Just thinking about whether you're going more or less often than usual, or if the color or amount has changed. If not, that's fine too. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No, nothing like that. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. Bit of arthritis in the knees, what you'd expect for a man my age doing manual work. The doctor back home – in Nepal – always said I was strong as an ox. Medicare covers the arthritis, just a bit of ointment and some pills. That’s it. Honestly, I think this heat’s just…weakening me. Not used to this sort of weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees, managed with ointment and pills, otherwise generally healthy. And you haven’t been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Look, I eat a sensible diet – dal bhat most nights. Not one for all these processed foods, that’s for sure. And I don’t smoke. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Proper men don’t need vices. My brother, he smoked… look how he turned out. This isn’t a medical problem, Doctor. It’s this heat.
DOCTOR: Alright, healthy diet, no smoking. Let's talk about medications. Aside from the arthritis ointment and pills, are you taking anything else – even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Goodness, no. Waste of money, if you ask me. I take the pills the doctor gave me for the knees, that’s it. Paracetamol sometimes, if they’re particularly bad. But that’s just when I’ve overdone it, lifting something heavy. And… oh, sometimes I take a little something for my digestion. Just a herbal remedy, my wife – back home – used to make. Helps with the… you know. But that's it. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so paracetamol occasionally, and a herbal remedy for digestion. Do you know the name of that herbal remedy?
PATIENT: Name? Hmm… not in English, I don’t think. It’s… ajwain, maybe? Or something close to that. It's a seed, we grind it up and take it with warm water. My wife always said it’s good for the stomach. She knew a lot about these things, very traditional. It’s not a proper medicine, just something to help settle things. It's from Nepal, you see. Everything good comes from Nepal.
DOCTOR: Okay, ajwain for digestion. And to clarify, your wife is currently back in Nepal?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She… well, she went back a few years ago now. To look after her mother. I visit when I can, but it’s expensive, and with the work… it’s difficult. It's just me now, mostly. She sends me the ajwain, thankfully. And regular letters, when the post allows. A good woman, my wife. Always looked after me.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Mr. Coby. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and temperature, and take a look at your reflexes. It will only take a few minutes. Can you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Examination table, eh? Fine. Though I don't see what poking and prodding will achieve. Still, if you insist. adjusts himself carefully Just be gentle, Doctor. These old bones aren't what they used to be. And try to be quick, I have a fence to repair. Mrs. Henderson won’t be pleased if I don’t get it done soon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Coby. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Take a few deep breaths for me. In…and out… good. Your heart sounds a little fast, actually. A bit irregular too. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Temperature is normal, 98.6. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn’t uncommon with age, but we’ll note it. Now, let me just have a look at your hands… Your skin seems a little dry, and your skin turgor isn't as elastic as it should be. That could indicate some dehydration. Do you feel like you've been sweating more than usual?
PATIENT: Sweating? Yes, that's what I was telling you! Like a drenched rag, even when I’m just sitting. But I haven’t been drinking any more water than usual. Honestly, Doctor, I think this heat’s just…sucking the life out of me. It's never been like this before. And the dizziness… it's worrying. I don't want to fall and break something. I'm a practical man, I need to be able to work!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Excessive sweating, dizziness, and dry skin despite no increase in water intake. It sounds like you might be experiencing some heat exhaustion, possibly with some mild dehydration. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and irregular heartbeat, I want to be cautious. To be sure, I'd like to run a few blood tests to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly, Doctor, are you sure that’s necessary? Sounds like a lot of fuss for a bit of hot weather. I've never needed blood tests in my life! Is it really that serious? I’m a strong man, I just need to get on with things. A bit of rest and a cool drink, that’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate you wanting to avoid unnecessary tests. However, given your age, your symptoms – particularly the dizziness, irregular heartbeat, and excessive sweating – and the fact that they’ve been gradually worsening, it's important to rule out any underlying medical issues. Heat exhaustion can sometimes be a sign of more serious problems, like kidney issues or an electrolyte imbalance. The blood tests will help me determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your health. It will only take a small sample, and it will give me a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your blood tests. But I’m telling you, it’s just the heat. Wasting my time and money, honestly. But… alright. Get it over with. Just be quick about it, Doctor. And try not to poke around too much. I have a fence to repair, remember? Mrs. Henderson isn't getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll also write you a prescription for an electrolyte solution, just to help rehydrate you in the meantime. And I strongly advise you to avoid strenuous activity until we get the results back. While we wait for the results, let’s discuss some preventative measures for dealing with the heat. Do you have access to air conditioning?
PATIENT: Air conditioning? No. Never had the need for it. Grew up in the mountains, you see. Cool breezes, fresh air. Never needed fancy machines to keep cool. I have a fan, does that count? It’s enough to keep the dust off, mostly. And I try to stay in the shade when I can, but a man’s gotta work, Doctor. A man’s gotta earn a living.
DOCTOR: Alright, no air conditioning, just a fan. That’s good you’re trying to stay in the shade, but a fan isn’t always enough in this heat. Mr. Coby, I also recommend that you try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day, even if you don’t feel thirsty. And please, if you start feeling dizzy, weak, or nauseous, stop what you’re doing immediately and sit down in a cool place. We’ll get these blood test results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss a more definitive treatment plan. In the meantime, please be careful, and prioritize your health. Do you have any questions for me before the phlebotomist arrives?
PATIENT: Questions? Not really. Just seems like a lot of fuss over nothing. Eight glasses of water… I'll try, I suppose. But honestly, Doctor, I think I just need a bit of a break. A bit of rest and some cool air. Then I'll be right as rain. Tell that phlebotomist to be quick, though. I have a fence to repair, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. I’ll speak to the phlebotomist. We'll get this sorted out as quickly as we can. The results should be back within 24-48 hours, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen. I’ll let you rest now, and the phlebotomist will be in shortly. Thank you for your patience. .
