DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hello Doctor… Osterholm, right? Yes, yes. Well, my grandson, he… he signed me up for somethin’. A tryout. For… sports. I forget what kind. He says I gotta get checked first. Old bones, you know? He’s a good boy, always lookin’ out for me. But I don’t really remember much about why I’m here, just somethin’ about bein’ able to… play. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right. A tryout. Hmm. Well, it's good your grandson is thinking of you. Seventy years old and trying out for sports… that is something. Let’s try to get a little more specific. Do you remember anything about the sport?
PATIENT: Anything…? It was… with a ball, I think. And… other people. Younger people, definitely. He showed me a video, maybe? On that… the flat screen box. Lots of runnin’ and… shoutin’. It wasn’t… water, that’s for sure. Not swimmin’. I used to swim a little, back in… well, a long time ago. But this wasn't swimmin’. Honestly, my memory ain't what it used to be, Doctor. Sorry. I just wanna make sure I don’t… fall or somethin’ during this tryout. That would be embarrassing!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A ball, running, not swimming. That narrows it down… slightly. We’ll focus on making sure you’re safe, Mr. Murph. Let’s start with a quick review of your general health. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Another doctor…? Oh, um… Dr. Ramirez, I think his name was. A long time ago. For my… pressure, maybe? It’s been good, mostly. I take a little pill every mornin’. A white one. But he moved away, I think. Or retired. It’s been a few years. Mostly, I just try to stay active, you know? Walkin’ a little, helpin’ around the house. My wife, bless her heart, she keeps me movin’. She’s the strong one, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. A white pill for… pressure, you said. Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage…? Oh dear. I haven’t the faintest, Doctor. I just take one every mornin’ with my coffee. My wife, she fills the little… the plastic box with the days of the week. She handles all that. I just… swallow it. Sorry. I’m not good with numbers, never was. I always let her worry about those things. It's a little embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll need to get that information from your wife later. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, Doctor. I eat pretty much everything. My wife makes wonderful food, you see. Lots of spices. I’ve never had a reaction to anything… that I remember. No hives, no trouble breathin’… I used to get poison ivy sometimes when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. Does that count? Not really an allergy, I suppose. I just stayed away from those itchy plants after that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Past problems…? Oh, well… I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And I broke my arm once, fallin’ off a ladder when I was tryin’ to fix the roof. My wife wasn’t happy about that! And… I think I had the flu a few times. Just regular things, you know? Old age comes with its share of aches and pains, that’s for sure. Nothing major, thankfully. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix, broken arm, flu. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, Mr. Murph. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know. And please don’t be alarmed if you hear any crackin’ or poppin’. That’s just… normal. My wife says it’s the weather.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, will need to investigate that further. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Ears are clear. Throat looks a little dry, no obvious signs of infection. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Abdomen… oh, alright. Just a little tender… right there. Nothing terrible, just… a little uncomfortable. Happens sometimes. Probably just indigestion. My wife makes a wonderful spicy stew, you see. But it sometimes… doesn’t agree with me. Easy does it, Doctor. Old bones, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little tenderness in the lower right quadrant. I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Bowel sounds are… present, but a little diminished. Mr. Murph, given your elevated blood pressure, the slight murmur, and the tenderness in your abdomen, I’m concerned about a few things. It's possible this is just indigestion, as you said, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We should also get a urine sample to rule out a urinary tract infection. I also want to get an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Blood work, urine… EKG…? Is it… serious, Doctor? I just wanted to see if I could still… play a little. Is this gonna stop me from tryin’ out? My grandson is gonna be so disappointed. I don’t know… I don’t like needles. And all those tests… sounds expensive. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. But please, be gentle. And could we maybe… hurry things along? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, it’s not necessarily serious, but it's important to be thorough. These tests will help us determine the cause of your discomfort and ensure you're healthy enough for any physical activity. We’re just being cautious. As for the needle, it’s a small prick, and we’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And we’ll handle the billing, don't worry about that. Okay. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw some blood and collect a urine sample. Then, we’ll get you scheduled for an EKG. It’s a quick, painless procedure. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity, including this tryout, until we have the results of these tests. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your age and the slight murmur I heard. Do you understand?
PATIENT: No tryout… I understand. My grandson… he’s gonna be so disappointed. He was so excited for me. But you’re right, Doctor. Safety first. Old bones, you know. You’re a good doctor. Thank you for lookin’ out for me. And please tell the nurse… easy with the needle, alright? It’s been a long time since I’ve had one. I guess I’ll just have to sit here and wait, then. Whatever needs to be done, I’ll do it. Just… hurry up, alright? I miss my wife.
