DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Wynell. Though, honestly, people forget my name all the time. It's a good name, isn't it? My mother picked it out. She had good taste, even if she did let me marry… well, never you mind about that now. What exactly are we doing here today? Seems like a lot of fuss over nothing, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let's focus on why you're here. I have a limited amount of time, so if we could just get straight to the point… are you experiencing any specific health issues?
PATIENT: Health issues? Oh, plenty. Getting old is a health issue, isn't it? Everything aches, mostly. And my feet… well, they've seen better days. Though I don’t need you telling me that. I'm a podiatrist, you know. Was a podiatrist. For a long time. Now, what I won’t be doing is letting anyone poke and prod at me. I’ve spent my life fixing feet, I don't need fixing.
DOCTOR: A podiatrist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! A very good one, I might add. Though these young people these days… they don’t appreciate a good foot doctor anymore. Always wanting fancy machines and… I don’t know… what is it… laser things? Give me a good scalpel and a steady hand any day. Honestly, all this modern medicine… it's just… unnecessary. And expensive!
DOCTOR: Right. So, ignoring your… professional opinion for a moment, are you here because of pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. It comes and goes, you know? Like a bad memory. Mostly it’s just… discomfort. A general… feeling that things aren’t quite right. But I don't want anyone doing anything about it. I’ve already told you that, haven’t I? I don’t trust these procedures. They always seem to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. And where specifically are you experiencing this discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere! My feet, mostly. But it radiates, you know? Up my legs. Sometimes even in my back. It's hard to pinpoint. And honestly, it's not something you can just… fix. It's just old age. I’ve lived a long life, walked a lot of miles. It’s to be expected. You wouldn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Right. So, generalized discomfort… radiating pain. Any recent injuries?
PATIENT: Injuries? Goodness, no. I’m very careful. Always have been. Though, I did trip over that rug at my daughter’s house last Christmas. Nasty fall, that was. But I didn’t break anything. Just… bruised my pride, I think. Though, it did ache for a bit afterwards. But I didn't go to a doctor about it. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, a few. For my blood pressure, mostly. And something for my arthritis, though it doesn’t really do much. Honestly, I think half of them are just… placebos. My daughter keeps telling me I should take them, but… I don't like feeling drugged up. Makes me foggy. And I need to be sharp, you know? Especially when I’m… well, when I'm keeping track of things.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, arthritis medication… any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I recall. I've taken so many things over the years. Penicillin, maybe? Or was that my husband? I always get those two mixed up. He was a sensitive man. Everything bothered him. Though, honestly, I haven't had a serious reaction to anything in… well, I can't remember how long. It's all a blur, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your weight, has that changed recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, goodness. Probably gone down. I haven't been eating much lately. My appetite just isn't what it used to be. Everything tastes… bland. And my daughter keeps worrying about me. She makes me these… smoothies. Horrible things. Green and… sludgy. Honestly, I'd rather just have a nice cup of tea and a biscuit. But she insists.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Absolutely not. I told you, I’m a podiatrist. I give exams, I don’t take them. And I certainly don’t want anyone poking and prodding at my feet. I have my pride, you know. I’ve spent my life looking after people’s feet, I don’t need anyone telling me what’s wrong with mine.
DOCTOR: With all due respect, Wynell, it’s difficult to assess your condition without a physical examination. I can document that you refuse, but I strongly advise against it. We need to rule out potential serious issues. What specifically are you afraid will happen?
PATIENT: Serious issues? Honestly, I'm afraid they’ll find something they want to fix. And then it'll be needles and bandages and… who knows what else? I've seen enough of that in my career to know it rarely makes things better. It's just… poking around where it doesn't need to be poked. And frankly, I don’t trust these young doctors. You all just want to run tests and give expensive treatments. I'm perfectly capable of knowing what's going on with my own body.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm documenting "patient refuses physical examination." I strongly recommend you reconsider, but I will respect your wishes. However, I must advise you to follow up with a specialist if your symptoms worsen. I can give you a referral to a neurologist, given your reports of radiating pain. That’s the best I can offer at this point. Do you want that referral?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Oh, goodness. Another specialist. Honestly, it's just endless appointments and… more poking and prodding. No, thank you. I don’t want a referral. I'm perfectly fine ignoring it, thank you very much. I’ve lived this long without one, I think I can manage a little discomfort. Just… leave me be. And please, don't keep offering me more appointments. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: Very well. I have documented your refusal of examination and referral. If your condition changes, please contact your primary care physician. I won't push further. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Fine. Good day to you too. Though, I doubt it will be very good, if it means more worrying about my feet. Honestly, all this fuss… It's just ridiculous. Young people these days… don't know a thing.
