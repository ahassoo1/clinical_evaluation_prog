DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very pleasant to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s about a… a procedure I’m considering. I believe I need to be cleared for it, medically speaking. It’s cosmetic surgery… though I don’t recall all the specifics at the moment. It was… a while ago when I initially spoke with the surgeon.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can definitely work through that. Cosmetic surgery requires a medical clearance to ensure your overall health is good enough for the procedure and to minimize any risks. Let me pull up your chart here…Mackenzi Brightful, age 29. I see your height and weight are listed as 5’1” and 190 pounds. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about which procedure you’re considering?
PATIENT: Five foot one… is that right? It feels… shorter. But yes, that sounds about correct. The procedure… oh dear. It was… something to do with my stomach, I believe. A tightening, perhaps? Or a lift? I truly apologize, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it once was. It was discussed with Dr. Ramirez, at the aesthetic center downtown. Perhaps you have a record of it from them?
DOCTOR: It’s no problem at all, Mackenzi. It’s completely understandable to not remember every detail, especially when it comes to things discussed a while ago. We can certainly try to get more information from Dr. Ramirez’s office. Let me see… I’m checking for any records from Dr. Ramirez here… Ah, yes. It looks like you had a consultation with Dr. Ramirez on March 12th, 2025, regarding a tummy tuck – abdominoplasty – and a potential lift. The notes mention he requested a medical clearance due to your BMI. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: A tummy tuck… yes, that sounds right. I did want to address that. And a lift… yes. My overall health… Well, I try to keep active, gardening mostly. It’s… therapeutic. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I had some… complications a few years back, though. My husband… he passed, and it was… difficult. I haven’t been terribly ill since, but I’m not as strong as I used to be, if that makes sense. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mackenzi. Grief can have a significant impact on health, both physically and emotionally. I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s good to hear you’re active with gardening, though. That’s a wonderful way to stay healthy. And knowing you have private insurance is helpful. Okay, let’s get a little more specific about those complications you mentioned a few years back. Could you tell me what those were?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it was… after the accident. A car accident. It was… several years ago now. I broke my leg, quite badly, and… there were internal injuries, I believe. I was in the hospital for a long time, and I had surgery to repair everything. I don’t recall the specifics – the doctor spoke a lot of… medical terms. They said something about… bleeding, and a concussion. But I healed, eventually. It just… wasn’t easy. And I’ve been a bit… fragile since, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mackenzi, thank you for sharing that with me. That sounds like a very traumatic experience, and it’s completely understandable that you’ve felt fragile since then. A broken leg and internal injuries would be quite a lot to go through. I see some notes here about a femur fracture and a splenic rupture in 2022. It mentions you received a blood transfusion at that time as well. To get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right, the femur… and the… splenic rupture. It all feels so distant. No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything chronic. I go to the dentist regularly, and I had a check-up with my primary care physician about a year ago, and everything was… normal, as far as I can recall. I don’t take any medications regularly, except for occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains from the gardening. I’ve always been quite healthy, usually. It’s just… everything feels a bit more precarious now, after the accident and… everything else.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mackenzi. It’s helpful that you’ve been generally healthy and have had regular check-ups. Occasional ibuprofen use is fine, but we’ll want to be mindful of that before surgery. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything. I’ve eaten… well, most things, really. I recall being stung by a bee once as a child, but it was just a bit of swelling and discomfort. Nothing serious. I haven’t taken any new medications recently, so I don't believe there are any new allergies to consider. I sometimes get itchy skin, but that could just be the gardening… or the stress, perhaps. I do enjoy a good mango, if that's relevant!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you enjoy a mango! No, that’s not relevant, but it’s nice to hear. Okay, no known allergies. Let’s move on to your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… a bit difficult. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn’t know my father. I have a sister, but we’re not very close, and I haven’t spoken to her in years. I… don’t recall any significant medical conditions on either side of the family, to be honest. My grandmother on my mother’s side lived to be quite old, and I believe she was relatively healthy for her age. But… my memory is so vague, Doctor. I apologize. I’m not much help on this one. Perhaps I could ask my sister, if that would be helpful? Though I’m not sure she’d remember much either.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s understandable that you don’t have a lot of information about your family history, given the circumstances. And don't worry about asking your sister – it’s not essential. Okay, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. And I’ve never used any recreational drugs, either. I find gardening to be quite… stimulating enough, if you understand what I mean. I prefer a quiet evening at home, with a good book and a cup of tea, thank you very much. I’ve always been a bit… cautious, I suppose. I value my health too much to risk it with anything like that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mackenzi. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Okay. Now, just to confirm, you are currently not taking any regular medications other than occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Only the occasional ibuprofen, as needed. And perhaps some cream for the itchy skin, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, just something over the counter. I try to manage everything with rest and… well, with gardening, if I'm being honest. It's surprisingly good for aches and pains, you know. Perhaps it’s the fresh air, or the gentle exercise. Either way, it's better than taking a lot of pills, if possible.
DOCTOR: I agree, that sounds like a wonderful approach. Alright, Mackenzi. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. Based on what you’ve told me, and your chart, it appears you are generally in good health. However, given your history of a femur fracture and splenic rupture, I would like to perform a physical exam to assess your current condition, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam is… a good idea, given everything. I trust your judgment. I… I suppose I should get changed into something more comfortable then? Please let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just… be gentle, if you would. It’s been a while since I’ve had a thorough check-up.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. I will be as gentle as possible. You can change into a gown in the examination room over there. I'll give you a few minutes of privacy, and then I'll come back in to perform the exam. We'll start with your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature, and then listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also palpate your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate you explaining everything. Palpate… is that pressing on my stomach? I think so. Yes, that’s alright. I’ll go and change now. Thank you again for your kindness, Doctor. I’m in your capable hands.
DOCTOR: Alright Mackenzi, if you'd like to sit up on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128 over 78. That’s within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, if you don't mind, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. No abnormalities detected. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No abnormalities detected. Finally, I'll just check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, Mackenzi, the physical exam is unremarkable. Your heart and lungs sound clear, your abdomen is soft, and your reflexes are normal. Everything appears to be in good working order.
PATIENT: That’s… wonderful to hear, Doctor. Truly. I was a bit anxious, to be honest. So, does that mean… I’m cleared for the surgery? I… I apologize for asking so many questions. I just want to make sure everything is as safe as possible. It’s been… a long time since I’ve felt this optimistic. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been incredibly kind and patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright to ask questions – that’s what I’m here for. And I understand your anxiety. It's good to be thorough, especially with any procedure. Based on your medical history and the physical exam, I do believe you are a suitable candidate for the tummy tuck. However, given your history of a femur fracture and splenic rupture, I recommend getting a letter of clearance from your primary care physician. It's a standard precaution, and it will just provide the surgeon with an additional layer of assurance. Would you like me to provide you with a summary of our conversation and the physical exam findings to share with your primary care physician?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, please! That would be absolutely wonderful. A summary would be incredibly helpful. I… I don’t want to bother my primary care physician with all the details, and I’m afraid I’ll forget something important. You’ve been so thorough and kind, I trust your judgment implicitly. Is there anything else I need to do on my end? Any blood tests or imaging scans you recommend? I'm happy to schedule anything necessary. I just want to get this all sorted out, and finally feel… comfortable again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. I'm happy to provide a summary for your primary care physician. I'll print that out for you now. Here you are. This includes your medical history, the physical exam findings, and my recommendation for obtaining a letter of clearance from your primary care physician. At this time, I do not recommend any further blood tests or imaging scans. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, I believe you are in good health for the procedure. The main thing is to get that clearance letter from your primary care physician. Once you have that, you should be all set. Do you have any questions about the letter or anything else we discussed?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… very comprehensive. I appreciate you taking the time to document everything so thoroughly. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. It’s all very clear. I’ll schedule an appointment with my primary care physician as soon as possible, and get the clearance letter. I… I truly feel much more confident now. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been a wonderful help, Doctor. I feel like a weight has been lifted. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Perhaps a follow-up appointment? Or a payment?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. No, a follow-up appointment isn't necessary unless you have any concerns or experience any issues. Regarding payment, let me just verify your insurance information… It looks like your co-pay for today's consultation is $30. Once you receive clearance from your primary care physician, you can schedule your surgery with Dr. Ramirez. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mackenzi. I wish you all the best with your procedure.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And thank you again for everything. I feel much more optimistic now, thanks to you. I will definitely reach out if I have any questions. And I will be sure to let you know how everything goes. Have a wonderful day, Doctor Pfennig. And thank you again for your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: You have a wonderful day as well, Mackenzi. And please do keep me updated. I wish you a smooth recovery. Take care.
