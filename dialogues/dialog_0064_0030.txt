DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor, and it’s worrying me. It’s not… normal for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is good you're bringing this up – it's always best to get these things checked out. Changes in body odor can sometimes indicate something going on, and it's certainly not something to be embarrassed about. Can you tell me a little more about this change?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, it started maybe a month ago? It’s not stronger, exactly… just different. It’s hard to describe. It’s… almost a slightly sour smell, I guess? And it seems to be mostly under my arms, but sometimes I think I can smell it even when I’ve just showered. I always use the same deodorant, too – the aluminum-free kind, because of… well, things I read. I don't know if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slightly sour smell, noticeable even after showering, and you've been using the same aluminum-free deodorant for a while now. That is helpful. It's good you mention the deodorant change – sometimes those can affect things. And you said it started about a month ago?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month ago. It wasn't sudden, it was gradual. I didn't really think much of it at first, just figured maybe I was working harder, sweating more with the summer heat. But it hasn't gone away, even when I'm not doing much. It’s just… persistent. And it's making me a little self-conscious. I work with my hands all day, you know, laying floors, and I don't want people thinking... well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's smart to pay attention to changes in your body, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to address something that's making you feel self-conscious. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. Now, besides the change in odor, have you noticed any other changes – any sweating more than usual, redness in the armpit area, or any lumps or bumps?
PATIENT: No, no lumps or bumps. And I haven’t really noticed sweating more, like I said, just… the smell being different. Sometimes, if I’m really exerting myself, it’s a little worse, but not dramatically. My armpits don’t feel irritated or anything, just… normal. I haven’t had any fever or anything like that either. I guess I just feel… off. It’s hard to explain. It's not like I'm sick, but something feels different with my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no redness, no lumps, and you just feel generally "off." That's good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… No diabetes, no. My thyroid was checked a few years ago, and it was fine, as far as I know. And I don’t think I have any kidney problems. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, and I have some arthritis in my hands, but that’s it. Oh! And I was divorced about five years ago. Does that matter? I always feel like doctors ask about that.
DOCTOR: No, your divorce doesn’t matter directly, Kerriann, but thank you for mentioning it. We just try to get a full picture of things. So, no diabetes, thyroid seems okay, gallbladder removed ten years ago, and arthritis in your hands. Any family history of unusual body odor, or any of those conditions we just mentioned – diabetes, thyroid issues, kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. Let me think. My mother had diabetes, later in life, but I don’t think anyone else had anything like that. My grandmother had arthritis, but that runs on both sides of the family. I don’t recall anyone specifically having problems with body odor, no. My family isn’t really the type to talk about things like that. It’s just… not discussed. We keep to ourselves, mostly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. Family history can be tricky. Okay, so mother with diabetes, grandmother with arthritis, and no known history of body odor issues. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis medication. It’s called meloxicam. I take one pill a day for that. And sometimes, if my hands are really bad, I’ll take some ibuprofen, over-the-counter. Other than that, no. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. I also take a multivitamin sometimes, but I haven’t taken it in a couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, meloxicam for arthritis, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin occasionally. And you’re using an aluminum-free deodorant. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. It wasn’t really agreeing with my arthritis, and frankly, I just didn’t enjoy it anymore. And no, I don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a pretty simple person, really. I work hard, and I like to keep things… straightforward.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Kerriann. Thank you for being so open. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your armpits. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. Just tell me if it’s going to be cold. My skin gets sensitive easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be gentle. And I’ll warn you before anything feels cold. Please have a seat, and we'll get started. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, let’s take a look at your armpits. Okay, I don't see any obvious signs of irritation or infection. No redness, no rash, no swelling. I do notice a slightly different odor when I examine your armpits, consistent with what you’ve described. It's not a strong odor, but it's definitely present. I'll document that. Alright. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, there are a few possibilities we should consider. This could be a benign change in body chemistry, sometimes related to diet or medication. However, it's also important to rule out other causes, such as a bacterial infection or, less commonly, a metabolic issue.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… complicated. What does “rule out” mean? And what kind of “metabolic issue”? That sounds scary. I’m not sure I understand. I just want to smell normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kerriann. “Ruling out” just means we want to make sure it’s not something serious. It’s like checking things off a list. A “metabolic issue” is a broad term, but in this case, we'd be thinking about things that affect how your body processes chemicals, like kidney or liver function. It's unlikely to be either of those, but it’s best to be thorough. To do that, I'd like to order some simple blood tests. These will check your kidney and liver function, your blood sugar levels, and a few other basic things. It's a standard panel, and nothing too invasive. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Okay. That sounds… okay, I guess. As long as it’s just a standard panel. And you really think it’s probably nothing serious? I just… I don’t want to worry about something big. I’m already stressed enough with work and everything. I don’t need another thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Kerriann. It’s good you're expressing your concerns. And yes, I truly believe it's most likely nothing serious. These tests are just a precaution, to rule out any underlying medical issues. The vast majority of the time, these types of changes are due to something relatively minor. We'll get the results back in a few days, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, there are a few things you can try. Have you considered trying a different deodorant?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I thought about it. I’ve been using the same one for a while now, maybe it’s just stopped working for me. I guess I could try a different brand. I don’t really want to go back to using one with aluminum, though. I read so many things about it being bad for you. Is it okay if I try a different aluminum-free brand first?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Trying a different aluminum-free deodorant is a great first step. And I respect your concerns about aluminum. There's no need to go back to something you're uncomfortable with. If the new deodorant doesn't help, we can revisit the possibility of other options after we get your blood test results. Okay, I'll order the blood tests. The lab is located just down the hall. They'll give you instructions on how to prepare, but generally, you'll need to fast for about eight to twelve hours beforehand. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Eight to twelve hours? That’s a long time. I usually eat breakfast pretty early. So, no breakfast at all? And will they call me when the results are ready, or do I have to call them? I’m not very good with technology, so I’m worried about missing a call or something.
DOCTOR: Yes, eight to twelve hours of fasting. I know it's not ideal, but it’s important for accurate results. You can drink water, but no food. And don't worry about missing a call. The lab will contact me with the results. I'll then give you a call to discuss them. I will make a note in your file to call you directly, so you don’t have to worry about calling them or navigating any automated systems. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better. Thank you. Knowing you’ll call me directly makes me feel a lot better. I’m always worried about getting lost in the system. Okay, so just no food for eight to twelve hours, and you’ll call me with the results. I think I can manage that. Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything else you need to ask me? I’m trying to think if I’ve forgotten anything.
DOCTOR: No, I think we've covered everything for now, Kerriann. Just focus on getting some rest, and try not to worry too much. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. It’s good to know someone is taking this seriously. Okay, then. Have a good day, Kerriann. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could help. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon.
