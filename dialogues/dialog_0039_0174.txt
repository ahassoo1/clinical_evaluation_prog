DOCTOR: Hello Nani, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s…difficult to explain. A sort of heaviness, you understand? I just don’t have the energy for things anymore, and… I suppose that’s a good place to start. I'd like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We'll take things at your pace, but I understand wanting to get to the bottom of this. “Heaviness” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… everything feels like a chore. Even things I used to enjoy. My work, keeping people safe at the beach, the ski patrol in winter… they feel…distant. It's not that I don’t want to do them, it’s just…hard to muster the enthusiasm. And I find myself…well, just feeling sad. Not constantly crying or anything, but a persistent…emptiness. It’s been going on for…oh, goodness, a few months now, I suppose. Perhaps longer. Time slips away these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of feeling this heaviness and emptiness, with a loss of interest in things you normally enjoy. And it's affecting your work and hobbies… I see. It sounds like it’s really impacting your quality of life, Nani. Let’s try to get a better picture of what's going on. Do you find yourself sleeping more or less than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I wouldn't say I sleep more, exactly. But I don't sleep well. I wake up several times in the night, and often feel tired even after a full eight hours. And then I find myself…dozing during the day. Just little naps, you understand. But not restful ones. More like…escapes. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Nani. Interrupted sleep and feeling unrefreshed even after sleeping… that's important information. And these naps, are they planned, or do you just find yourself drifting off?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re…opportunistic, I suppose. If I'm sitting quietly, perhaps reading, or even watching television, I just…drift off. It’s not something I plan, Doctor. It just happens. And then I wake up feeling…worse, somehow. More confused and…foggy. It's quite irritating, to be honest. I used to have such energy. It's all very unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so falling asleep unintentionally, and then waking feeling more tired and foggy. That's definitely something we need to explore further. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I used to enjoy cooking, a lot of Nigerian food, you understand? Very flavorful. But lately… I haven’t much of an appetite. Food just…doesn’t appeal. I force myself to eat, to keep my strength up, but it’s not enjoyable. I've lost a bit of weight, I suspect, but I haven’t weighed myself recently. It's all rather…unsettling. My daughter keeps telling me I need to look after myself, but it’s difficult when you haven’t the energy or the inclination.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're experiencing a number of changes, Nani – the sleep, the appetite, the energy levels… and it’s understandable that it’s unsettling. Losing interest in things you enjoy and changes in appetite can be signs of many things. Let me ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Have you been experiencing any aches or pains?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, actually. My back has been bothering me for a while now. I thought it was just from the physical work, you understand, lifting things at the beach or helping skiers. But it's…persistent. And I’ve been getting headaches, not severe, but a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go. I just assumed it was stress. But now…perhaps it’s something more. It’s difficult to tell these days, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is difficult to tell, Nani, and that’s why we’re talking. The back pain and headaches are important to note. Do you notice anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, resting sometimes helps the back pain, but honestly, getting comfortable is a challenge. And the headaches…they seem to be worse when I’m stressed, or when I haven’t had enough sleep. Though, with the way I’ve been sleeping lately, that’s most nights, isn’t it? Hot showers help a little, temporarily. But they always come back. Honestly, I've been trying to ignore it all, to be frank. I don't like to complain. But it's becoming…difficult to ignore, now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so rest and hot showers provide temporary relief, but the pain returns, especially with stress and lack of sleep. And you’ve been trying to manage it on your own. I appreciate your honesty, Nani. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… Years ago, perhaps fifteen years back, my blood pressure was a little high. The doctor put me on medication for a while, but I managed to get it under control with diet and exercise. I haven’t had any issues with it since. No diabetes, no heart problems, thankfully. Just…the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. And I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years ago, but I recovered fully. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been quite healthy. That’s what makes this all so…strange.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Nani. No major medical conditions, and you were able to manage your blood pressure with lifestyle changes. And no history of diabetes or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes, actually. A hysterectomy, quite a long time ago now. Perhaps twenty years back. And I had my appendix removed when I was a young woman. But that was… decades ago. Nothing else, to my recollection. Nothing significant, certainly. It’s all rather… distant now, to be honest. I don't often think about these things, unless asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a hysterectomy and an appendectomy. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like depression, anxiety, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she suffered from what they called "nerves" when I was a child. She was often anxious and withdrawn, and spent a lot of time in bed. I don’t think they really understood what was wrong with her back then. And my older brother… he struggled with alcohol for many years. It caused him a lot of trouble. As for heart disease or cancer… I believe my father’s side had some cases of high blood pressure, but nothing else that I recall. It's all very… scattered, to be honest. We weren't a family who talked much about our health.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nani. History of anxiety in your mother and alcohol struggles in your brother… that's helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always warned me about the dangers of smoking. And frankly, I find the habit rather distasteful. I prefer a good cup of tea, myself. And I’ve always encouraged my daughter to stay away from it as well. No, smoking is not a part of my life, Doctor. Never has been, never will be.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A small glass, you understand. Mostly on special occasions. But I haven’t had a drink in… oh, goodness, perhaps six months now. I just…lost interest in it. It didn't seem to appeal anymore. And honestly, Doctor, with everything that’s been going on, I haven’t felt much like celebrating lately. So, no, I don’t drink alcohol regularly. Or, I haven’t been, recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine in the past, but not recently. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a daily multivitamin, just to keep my strength up. And occasionally, I take ibuprofen for my back pain, when it’s particularly bad. Nothing else, Doctor. No prescription medications. And I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies, when possible. A good cup of tea, a warm bath, a little rest… those are my preferred treatments. But, frankly, they haven’t been very effective lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nani. Multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Go ahead, please. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a few commitments this afternoon. Though, they aren’t terribly important, I suppose. But still…
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We'll keep it as quick as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft. Your reflexes are normal, but your lower back is a bit stiff. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little. Not sharp, exactly. But a dull ache. It’s been like that for weeks now. It tends to get worse when I stand for too long, or when I bend over. And sometimes, it radiates down my leg, a little. It's not debilitating, Doctor, but it's… unsettling. I try to ignore it, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult. Honestly, I worry it might be something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nani. The pain radiating down your leg is something we need to investigate further. It could be a sign of a pinched nerve or muscle strain, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, the loss of interest, the sleep disturbances, the appetite loss, the back pain, and the slightly elevated blood pressure – I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. I also recommend a urine analysis, just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… urine analysis… goodness. It seems rather…extensive. But, I suppose if it’s necessary… yes, alright. If it will help determine the cause of all this… then yes, please. I just… I hope the results aren’t too alarming. And I do hope I don’t have to wait too long for them. I’m not fond of uncertainty, Doctor. But, if you believe it’s the best course of action, then I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Nani. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned. These tests are routine, and will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get some gentle exercise, like walking, if you’re able. And make sure you’re getting enough rest. I’m going to give you a referral to a physical therapist. They can help you with exercises to strengthen your back and improve your posture. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Gentle exercise… physical therapy… yes, alright. That sounds… reasonable. Though, I must confess, I haven’t been very motivated to exercise lately. But, I suppose I should try. Anything is better than sitting around feeling sorry for myself. And a physical therapist… perhaps they can give me some guidance. I do worry about making things worse, though. I don’t want to overdo it. But yes, please. A referral to a physical therapist would be very helpful. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I do appreciate it. Now, is there anything else I need to do? Or can I leave now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. And I understand your concern about making things worse – the physical therapist will work with you at your own pace. No, there’s nothing else you need to do right now. I’ll have the lab requisition and referral ready for you before you leave. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe headache, chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please contact the clinic immediately. And if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week, once the test results are back. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week… yes, that sounds… acceptable. Though, I confess, I’m not fond of waiting. But, I understand it takes time. And I appreciate you scheduling a follow-up appointment. Fever, severe headache… yes, I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that’s all. I should be going now. I have a few errands to run. Though, they aren’t terribly important. Thank you again for your time and attention. I do hope we can get to the bottom of this soon. Goodbye. And please… thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nani. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you feel better soon. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Goodbye, and take care.
PATIENT: .
