DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come. It’s… not a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. To start, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe a week ago? At first, it was just a little bit, like… streaks in the mucus when I coughed. But the last couple of days, it’s been a bit more. Not a lot, like I said, but definitely noticeable. It happens… mostly in the mornings, I think. And when I cough hard. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. So, it’s more prominent in the mornings and with forceful coughing. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the coughing itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. I mean, I cough sometimes like… normal, when I have a cold, or when the air is dry. But this coughing… it just happens. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific. Sometimes it’s after I exercise, but I exercise regularly, so… I’m not sure if that’s related. Is that… confusing? I am sorry.
DOCTOR: No, not at all confusing, Ms. Weichers. It’s helpful to know what isn't happening as well. You mentioned you exercise regularly - that’s good. Any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and I have not had any night sweats. I sleep very well, usually. I do get a little… tired sometimes, but I think that is just from work. I am a physical therapist, so I am on my feet a lot. But no other… sickness feelings, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Physical therapist, alright. That's a physically demanding job. Do you have any shortness of breath, or any chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. And no chest pain, Doctor. It doesn’t hurt when I cough, just… feels a bit weak afterward, maybe. Like I used a lot of energy. But not pain, definitely not. And no wheezing, if that is what you are asking? I can breathe normally, even when I cough.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I have had colds, of course, and the normal coughs that come with those. But I have never coughed up blood before, Doctor. That is why I was so worried. It really frightened me. It is just… not normal for me. I don’t smoke, either, if that is what you were going to ask.
DOCTOR: Good to know you’re a non-smoker. Alright, Ms. Weichers. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible next steps. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I am ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just sit up here for me, please. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart first. Then I’ll take a look at your throat.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds good. Please, take your time. I am not in any rush.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths in and out for me… and again… Good. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can hear right now. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Say "Ah" for me... and "Ah"... Okay. Throat looks a little…red, but no obvious signs of infection. No swollen tonsils. Lymph nodes are not noticeably swollen. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal so far.
PATIENT: That is…reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. It is good to hear that things seem normal. So, what do you think is causing the blood, then? Is it something serious? I am a little nervous, I admit.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be nervous, Ms. Weichers. It's good we’ve done the exam, and as I said, things don't immediately point to something serious, but we still need to figure out the cause. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is called hemoptysis, and it can have several causes. It could be a minor irritation in your airways, a small bronchial infection we just haven't caught yet, or even a very small capillary break from forceful coughing. However, it's also important to rule out other possibilities like bronchitis, pneumonia, or, less commonly, something more serious. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. That will give us a better look at your lungs and help us determine what's going on. I'm also going to order a sputum culture to check for any infection. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very sensible, Doctor. An X-ray and a culture, yes. Whatever you think is best to find out what is happening. I am happy to do whatever is needed. I just want to know what is causing it. And… is it expensive? I have private insurance, but…
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Weichers. An X-ray and sputum culture are relatively standard tests, and your insurance should cover a significant portion of the cost. We'll submit everything to your insurance company, and our billing department will handle any remaining balance. They can also give you a cost estimate if you’d like. Let’s get the orders for those tests sent to the radiology department. They can usually get you in today. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you very much. I feel much better knowing we are doing something to find out what is happening. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Please, just let me know when and where to go for the X-ray.
DOCTOR: Okay. Here are the instructions for the radiology department – it’s located just across the street. They're open until 5 PM today. You don’t need to do any preparation for the X-ray. The results will typically be sent to us within 24-48 hours. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week, just in case we don't hear back sooner. How does next Wednesday at 2 PM sound?
PATIENT: Wednesday at 2 PM sounds… excellent, Doctor. Thank you. Across the street, okay. That is very convenient. I think I have everything I need. I truly appreciate your help, Doctor Voytek. I feel much relieved.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers. Great. Just to recap, we’ve ordered a chest X-ray and sputum culture to investigate the hemoptysis. Follow-up appointment is scheduled for next Wednesday at 2 PM. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of symptoms – such as increased bleeding, fever, or shortness of breath – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you have covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and taking the time to listen to my concerns. I will be sure to go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. Thank you again for your kindness and help. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers. You’re very welcome. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
