DOCTOR: Hello Christen, welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and… unusually hungry as well. It feels like I can’t quite quench either, no matter how much I drink or eat. I just thought I’d best get it checked out, rather than let it… continue.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you came in. It is always best to get things checked out. Thirsty and hungry… hmm. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see… I’d say… perhaps three or four weeks now? It started gradually, I suppose. Just feeling a bit more parched than usual, needing a bit more to eat. But it’s definitely… increased in the last week or so. It's becoming… noticeable. Quite noticeable, actually. I feel a bit foolish describing it, I must say.
DOCTOR: Not foolish at all, Christen. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. Three or four weeks… okay. And is it just increased thirst and hunger, or have you noticed any other symptoms alongside those?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not… immediately, I don’t believe so. I’ve been feeling a bit… tired, perhaps. But I put that down to work, honestly. Long hours, you know? And… perhaps a bit more frequent trips to the lavatory, if I’m being honest. But nothing… drastic. Nothing that I’d specifically flag, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and more frequent urination… alright. And can you describe the urination for me?
PATIENT: Well… it's just… more often. And… it seems to be a larger volume each time, if you follow me? Not… painful or anything, thankfully. Just… a greater amount, more frequently throughout the day. I didn't think much of it at first, thought I was simply drinking more water, but… it seems independent of how much I drink, to be fair. It's a bit… unsettling, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, larger volumes, more frequent, even with increased fluid intake… alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, perhaps?
PATIENT: Changes in my… vision? No, not that I’ve noticed. I wear glasses, you see, so… I suppose I wouldn’t immediately notice a subtle change. Everything seems… as blurry as usual, if that’s any help. I had my eyes tested just last year, everything was perfectly fine then. No, nothing different in that regard, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the eye test. And what about weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Well… that's a bit awkward, to be frank. I've… perhaps lost a little, over the last few weeks. Nothing drastic, mind you, but… when I stepped on the scales this morning, it was… lower than usual. I hadn’t been paying particular attention, if I’m honest. Work keeps me… occupied, you see. But… yes, a slight weight loss. Perhaps a few pounds. It’s not something I’ve actively been trying to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight weight loss… alright. Just to be thorough, have you had any unexplained cuts or bruises that heal slowly, or any infections recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’m fairly careful with myself at work, you see. Shipping and receiving… it requires a bit of attention. No slow healing cuts or bruises, no infections… I had a bit of a cold last winter, but that cleared up quickly enough. Nothing unusual beyond the typical sniffles, honestly. I pride myself on… maintaining my health, you see. This is… a bit unsettling, to be frank. Are you… thinking of something specific, Doctor? I don’t mean to be pushy, but… it’s concerning me, naturally.
DOCTOR: Not pushy at all, Christen. It's good you're concerned and asking questions. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. Based on what you've told me—increased thirst, increased hunger, frequent urination, slight weight loss—it could be a number of things. One possibility, and it's not something to panic about, is that we should check your blood sugar levels. It could indicate diabetes. Would you be comfortable with a quick blood test to check that?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh. Well… that’s… concerning. I hadn’t… considered that. My father had… issues with his health, later in life. But… yes, of course. If that’s what you recommend, Doctor, then… yes, I’d be happy to have a blood test. If it puts my mind at ease, then… absolutely. Quickly, you say? I have to be back at the warehouse this afternoon, unfortunately. But… yes, please. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Yes, it's a quick finger-prick test. We'll get the results back fairly quickly, within a few minutes. It’s a good starting point, and we can discuss the next steps based on those results. Let me just take your blood pressure and pulse while we wait for the lab technician, and then we’ll get this done. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve… always been fairly robust, health-wise. Blood pressure and pulse, you say? Very well. I’ll just… sit here, then. I trust everything is quite… sterile? No need to worry, I suppose. Just… a bit anxious, naturally. I'd prefer to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, if you don't mind. The warehouse manager… isn't terribly understanding when it comes to absences.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, everything is sterile. And I understand about needing to get back to work. We’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80, and your pulse is 72 – both perfectly normal. Now, just a little prick… Alright, that’s done. Now we just wait a few minutes for the results. We'll discuss them as soon as they’re available. Do you have any family history of diabetes, besides your father’s issues?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… “the sugar,” as she called it. She was a bit… old-fashioned, you see. Didn’t much care for doctors or hospitals. Just… managed it herself, with her diet, I believe. No, no one else, to my knowledge. And… are these results taking long? I apologise for pressing, but… the warehouse manager… honestly, he's a bit of a… taskmaster. I really should be back this afternoon. I don't mean to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Christen. And yes, the results are back… Your blood glucose level is 210 mg/dL. Normal is generally between 70-100 mg/dL when fasting. This is quite elevated, and it does suggest diabetes. However, it's just one reading, and we need to confirm it with further testing. We'll need to schedule a more comprehensive blood test, including an A1C test, which gives us an average blood sugar level over the past two to three months. It’s important not to panic. We caught it early, and diabetes is a manageable condition with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. We will work together to get this under control. Would you like me to explain a little about diabetes now, or would you prefer to schedule the follow-up appointment first?
PATIENT: Oh. 210… That is high, isn’t it? My grandmother… she never did anything about it, as far as I know. Just… ate a lot of apples, if I recall correctly. An A1C test, you say? Very well. Perhaps… the follow-up appointment first, please. If you don’t mind. I… I’d rather not dwell on it right now, if you understand. Just… schedule the appointment, and I’ll… I’ll come back when you tell me to. And… is there anything I should… avoid eating or doing in the meantime? I really should be getting back to work, if you don't mind. This is… rather disruptive, to be frank. But… thank you, Doctor. For… catching it early, as you say.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We’ll schedule the A1C test for next week, on Tuesday at 10 am?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10… Yes, that should work. Unless… something urgent comes up at the warehouse, of course. But… yes, Tuesday at 10. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I… I believe that’s all for now, isn’t it? I really should be getting back. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for now. Here’s the card with the appointment details. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And try not to worry too much – we’ll get this sorted out together. Have a good day, Christen, and please drive safely.
