DOCTOR: Hi Brodie, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… good to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. Been… a while now. A dry cough. Just… keeps hacking away. Doesn't bring anything up, you know? Just… air. Feels scratchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry, scratchy cough that’s been going on for a while. And it doesn’t produce any mucus?
PATIENT: No, no mucus. That's right. Not a wet cough. Just… dry. Feels like something's tickling my throat, but there's nothing there there. It's… bothersome when I try to sleep, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this cough been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard question. A while. Maybe… a few months? Or… longer? It's hard to say, Doctor. Things… blur these days. It wasn't sudden, it just… started. Slow like.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, starting slowly. That helps. Besides keeping you up at night, are you experiencing anything else with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… no fever. No… chest pain. I get a little… tired sometimes, but I’m an old man, so that’s probably just… old age. No shortness of breath. Just… the cough. And a little bit of… irritation in my throat, you know? Like it’s… raw.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no chest pain, no shortness of breath. Just the cough and some throat irritation. And you said the fatigue is likely just related to age, which is reasonable. Have you noticed if anything specifically triggers the cough, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. Not that I've noticed, really. Seems to happen… anytime. Maybe a little worse when the air is dry? We used to have a humidifier… my wife… but… it’s been a while. I don't really remember much about it. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially worse with dry air. I see. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your health history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s another hard one, Doctor. I used to go to the doctor… a lot, when I was younger. But… things get forgotten. I had… something with my blood pressure, I think. High blood pressure. They gave me pills. I don't take them anymore, though. And… I think I had some problems with my… joints? Arthritis, maybe? I don’t really remember the details. I just know I used to ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication, but not currently taking anything, and some joint pain potentially related to arthritis. Do you remember what kind of arthritis it was, or if you ever saw a specialist for it?
PATIENT: No, no specialist. Just… regular doctor. They gave me pills for the joints too. I don't remember what kind. Everything… blends together after a while, you know? I just… stopped taking them when my wife… well, nevermind. It's been a long time. I don’t think it was too bad, just… aches and pains. Nothing I couldn’t handle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the details. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Just… sometimes an aspirin for a headache. But not regularly. I try not to take too many pills. My wife always said… well. I just… don’t take much. That's about it. Nothing for the cough either. I haven’t tried anything, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think… Not that I know of, Doctor. I used to get… itchy sometimes, when I was a kid. But I don’t remember what caused it. And nothing serious, I don't think. No trouble breathing, no hives, nothing like that. Just… itchy sometimes. I don’t think it was anything I was allergic to, just… sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’m going to ask about your social history. Do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked. My wife… she didn't like it. Said it was bad for your health. And I always listened to my wife.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes a little beer with dinner. Not much. Maybe a can or two. I used to have a little more, with my wife… but not anymore. It doesn't… taste good, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional beer. And finally, can you tell me a little about where you live and who you live with?
PATIENT: I live in the city, Doctor. Been here… a long time. I live alone now. My wife… she passed away a few years back. It’s… quiet now. Just me and the memories. I used to have a big family… but they all moved away.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry for your loss. Okay, Brodie, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your throat, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out… again… good. Lungs sound relatively clear, although I do hear some mild wheezing, especially on exhale. Now, I’ll listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. And I don’t feel any swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Blood pressure is 140/90. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Brodie. And the mild wheezing suggests some airway irritation. It’s good you brought this cough to my attention.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated blood pressure, you say? That… doesn’t surprise me. I haven't been to the doctor in… well, a long time. The wheezing… is that bad? I just thought it was an old man’s cough.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad right now, Brodie, but it indicates that something is causing irritation in your airways. It could be related to the cough itself, or something else entirely. Given your history of high blood pressure, and the wheezing, I’d like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything serious like pneumonia or bronchitis. And I also want to check your oxygen saturation to make sure you’re getting enough air. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and check my… oxygen? Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to… feel better. It’s been a long time since I felt… good.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll have the nurse get those tests ordered right away. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to recommend a few things. First, I want you to drink plenty of fluids - water is best. And I want you to avoid any irritants like smoke or strong perfumes. For the cough, I'm going to suggest an over-the-counter cough suppressant with dextromethorphan, but please follow the dosage instructions carefully. And Brodie, I also want to talk about your blood pressure. It’s important to get that under control. I can prescribe a low dose of medication to help lower it, but we’ll need to monitor it regularly. What do you think?
PATIENT: Medication for the blood pressure… Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. I haven't been taking care of myself, have I? The fluids and… avoiding irritants… I can do that. And the cough suppressant. I just… want to be able to sleep again.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll write you a prescription for Lisinopril, a low dose, and a prescription for the cough suppressant. The nurse will explain how to take them before you leave. I'll also order a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to check your blood pressure and see how you’re responding to the medication and the cough suppressant. We’ll also discuss the results of the X-ray when they come back. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds alright. No, Doctor… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just… appreciate you listening to me. It’s been a long time since anyone took the time to… listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. That's what I'm here for. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and I’m confident we can help you feel better. The nurse will be in shortly to review the prescriptions and schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or a fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Chest pain, shortness of breath… or fever. Emergency room. I understand. Thank you… very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brodie. Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and we’ll see you in two weeks. .
PATIENT: .
