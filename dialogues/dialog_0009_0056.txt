DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s rather… complicated. Honestly, I don’t have a great deal of time for this. Something about… the students, I suppose. They simply don’t appreciate knowledge these days. It’s… draining. Truly draining. I’m a teacher, you see. Library science. Postsecondary. Though, what is secondary anymore? Everything is… muddled.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're feeling quite stressed and perhaps a little frustrated with your work situation. It’s alright if it feels complicated – we can take our time and sort through it. When you say “draining,” could you describe what that feels like physically or emotionally?
PATIENT: Physically? Goodness. Well, my back aches, naturally. At my age, things ache. But it's… a weariness, more than pain. A deep… listlessness. Emotionally? I simply have no patience for their… frivolity. They ask the most basic questions. It’s… infuriating. I used to have such a passion for imparting knowledge. Now… now it just feels like shouting into the void. Honestly, I don't know why I even bothered coming. It's not as if you can fix a generation.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're experiencing both physical discomfort with your back and a significant emotional toll from your work, feeling depleted and frustrated. It's very understandable to feel that way when your passion feels challenged. You mentioned a deep listlessness – has that been a recent change, or something you've been experiencing for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a while. Years, I suspect. Though, frankly, the years all blur together at a certain point. It’s… difficult to pinpoint. It started subtly, I think. Fewer students genuinely interested in research, more… focused on simply getting a grade. Then, the administration started… interfering. New programs, new requirements. Honestly, it’s a mess. A complete and utter mess. And I’m too old to deal with messes. I simply want to… retire, I suppose. But even that seems… complicated.
DOCTOR: I see. So this feeling of listlessness and frustration has been building for several years, coinciding with changes at work and perhaps a diminishing sense of fulfillment. It sounds like it's impacting your overall well-being. Before we talk about retirement, which we absolutely can do, I’d like to get a better understanding of how this is affecting you physically. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Sleep? Hmph. What is sleep these days? I toss and turn, mostly. Thinking about… paperwork, mostly. And the students, naturally. The endless, pointless assignments. As for appetite… it comes and goes. I used to enjoy cooking, Bulgarian cuisine, you know. Very flavorful. Now… I mostly just pick at things. A bit of cheese, perhaps. A slice of bread. Nothing substantial. It’s all rather… unappetizing. Honestly, I don’t see what good all these questions are doing. Are you a psychiatrist? This feels… inappropriate.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schlatterer, I am an internal medicine physician. We're simply trying to get a complete picture of your overall health. Changes in sleep and appetite can be indicators of underlying issues, and it’s important for me to understand how they’re affecting you. I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. We’re just ruling out any medical causes for how you’re feeling. You mentioned Bulgarian cuisine – that sounds wonderful. Has your weight changed significantly recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, goodness. I suppose so. I’ve always been… slender. But I suspect I’ve lost a bit. My clothes feel… looser. My daughter keeps remarking on it. Though, frankly, I find her comments rather… unsolicited. She means well, I suppose. But she doesn’t understand. None of them do. It’s not as if losing a bit of weight is a tragedy. It’s just… another sign of… decline, I suppose. Honestly, I’d rather just get this over with. What do you propose I do? Give me a pill? Is that what this is about? Because frankly, I’m not fond of pills. They make me… drowsy.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and your reluctance towards medication, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s good to know that you’ve noticed a weight loss, and that your daughter has commented on it. Before we discuss any potential treatment options, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of your overall health. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your general condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect any miracles. Honestly, I've seen doctors come and go. They all ask the same questions, poke and prod, and ultimately tell me something obvious. “You’re old.” I know I’m old. Just… hurry up, please. I have a stack of student papers to grade. Though, frankly, they’re not worth the paper they’re written on. A complete waste of time. But, duty calls, I suppose. Just… be quick about it. And don’t tell me to “take more vitamins.” I’ve heard it all before.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I will be as efficient as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. I’m hearing a mild heart murmur; this is common with age, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft to the touch, with mild tenderness in the upper quadrants. Reflexes are a little diminished, and peripheral pulses are somewhat weak. Overall, your examination reveals some expected changes for your age, but the mild tenderness in your abdomen and slightly weak pulses warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and thyroid levels. We’ll also want to do a basic metabolic panel. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work. Of course. More poking and prodding. Honestly, it never ends. Very well. Do what you must. But I’m warning you, I bruise easily. And I hate needles. Absolutely hate them. I suppose… yes, do the blood work. But please, be gentle. And don't tell me it won't hurt. It always hurts. And don't expect any miraculous results. Honestly, I suspect it will all be perfectly normal. Just another waste of time and money. But… fine. Do it. But I have papers to grade. And I’m not staying here all day. How long will this… ordeal… take?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Schlatterer. I will make sure the phlebotomist is aware of your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable as possible. It will only take about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw, and then the results will take a few days to come back. While we’re waiting for the results, I want to address your feelings of listlessness and frustration. It sounds like you’re experiencing significant emotional distress, and it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. However, it’s also possible that you’re experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety. Would you be open to discussing some options for mental health support?
PATIENT: Mental health support? Honestly. What an absurd suggestion. I am perfectly capable of rational thought. I am a professor, you know. I deal with… difficult people… all day. I don’t need “support.” It sounds… demeaning. I suspect it’s all this modern coddling. Everyone is so… sensitive these days. No, thank you. I’ll manage. I always have. I simply need… a break. A long, uninterrupted break. And perhaps a new stack of student papers to grade. Something challenging. Something… worthwhile. Honestly, this conversation is becoming rather tiresome. Are we finished here? Can I go now? I have papers to grade, and I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand and respect your decision. We will proceed with the blood work, and I will have the results sent to you as soon as they are available. Before you go, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. I’ve asked all the questions, and frankly, I’m not sure I’ve received any satisfactory answers. Just… send me the results. And please, don’t call me. A letter will suffice. I have no patience for phone calls. Honestly, this whole experience has been… disappointing. But I suppose that’s to be expected. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have papers to grade. And I’m not getting any younger. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. We will send the results by mail. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. I wish you well, and I hope you find some relief. .
