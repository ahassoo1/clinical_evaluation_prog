DOCTOR: Good morning, Sharifa. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… bothersome, really. I had a rather nasty cold last week, just a typical one, sniffles and such. But now, my legs… they just feel weak. It’s not painful, exactly, just… like they don’t want to go. It's quite inconvenient, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Weakness… and you said this started after a cold last week?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. About… let me think… five days ago, I believe. It came on gradually. At first, I thought it was just lingering fatigue from being sick, but it hasn't improved. Actually, it's gotten a little worse. I had to ask my nephew to help me with the groceries yesterday, which is… embarrassing. He's a good boy, but still. I usually manage perfectly well on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening weakness… and it's affecting your ability to do your usual activities, like grocery shopping. Can you describe the weakness a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s both legs, equally. It's not a sudden thing, you understand. It's not like I tripped and fell. It’s more… like trying to walk through thick mud. Everything feels… heavy. And it’s harder to start moving, if that makes sense. Getting up from a chair is… a project now. I don't look weak, I assure you. I still have all my strength up top. It’s just the legs. A very frustrating situation, really.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm, heavy feeling, harder to start moving… and mostly in the legs. Okay. And has this weakness been constant since it started, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty constant, actually. It doesn't disappear entirely. Some moments are slightly better than others, maybe after I’ve been sitting for a while, but then getting up is even harder. It’s not like I have bursts of energy, then suddenly collapse. It’s just… always there, at a low level. A persistent annoyance, to put it mildly. I do try to stay active, you know? I don't like to be idle. But even a short walk feels… exhausting now.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent weakness. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No tingling, no numbness. Just… the weakness. It's not a pins-and-needles sort of thing. It's just… they feel like they’re weighted down. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand what could be causing this. I've never experienced anything like it. And I always pay attention to my body. It’s a point of pride, really. I keep myself in good shape. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been remarkably healthy, I must say. Medicare keeps sending me those pamphlets about preventative care, but frankly, I haven’t needed much of it. I take a daily multivitamin, of course, and I’m careful about my diet. I had a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that was it. And my divorce was much more damaging to my health than any illness, if I’m being honest. But no chronic conditions. I assure you. I’m a very… robust woman. This leg weakness is a complete surprise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions, just the bronchitis. And no history of surgery?
PATIENT: No, no surgery at all. Never had the need, thankfully. I’ve always taken good care of myself, avoided risky activities. I used to go dancing, but that was years ago. Now, I mostly enjoy gardening and… supervising my nephew, who is, shall we say, not as meticulous as I am. But no surgery. And I don’t take any regular medications, aside from the multivitamin, of course. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Though I haven’t found anything that helps with this leg business. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgery and only a multivitamin. Now, have any close family members – parents, siblings – had any similar issues with weakness or problems with their legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had some arthritis in her knees when she was older, but that was different. It was pain, mostly, and she was quite… dramatic, if I’m being honest. My father… he was a very stoic man. Never complained about anything. I don’t recall any leg weakness in either of them, no. My sister… she lives in Guatemala, and we don’t speak often. I wouldn’t know. But generally speaking, no. We’re a rather… sturdy family. This is all very perplexing. It’s making me rather anxious, actually. I have a trip planned for next month, you see. A very important trip. I need to be able to walk.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concern, especially with your trip coming up. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and see if we can narrow down what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. Though I doubt it will reveal much. As I said, I'm a very healthy woman. But if you think it's necessary… yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, please. I don't like unnecessary prodding. And I have a rather sensitive back. It’s a long story involving a poorly designed garden bench. But yes, proceed. Hopefully, it won’t take too long. I have a luncheon engagement later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with just a basic neurological exam. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and balance. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I maintain that this is probably a waste of time. But go ahead. Just be mindful of my back, as I mentioned. It acts up in humid weather. And please, don’t ask me to do anything strenuous. I’m not an athlete, you know. A leisurely stroll is about the extent of my physical exertion these days. But… proceed. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a bit on the slower side, but not significantly so. Now, I’m going to ask you to push against my hands with both legs, as hard as you can. Just like you’re trying to push me away. Start with your right leg.
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? I’m not accustomed to exerting myself in this manner. It feels… undignified, frankly. But I’ve complied with your request. It’s not as strong as usual, I suppose. I’ve been rather sedentary lately, admittedly. But I wouldn’t describe it as weak. Just… not at peak performance. Now, please proceed to the other leg. I have a feeling this is going to be a rather lengthy process.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, could you please lift both legs off the table at the same time?
PATIENT: There! Is that to your satisfaction? It’s… not as easy as it used to be. I must confess, I’m starting to feel rather foolish. This is hardly a scientific endeavor, is it? I’m a woman of intellect, not a… a laboratory specimen. But I’ve cooperated. Now, please tell me what you’ve discovered. Is it something serious? I have a very important trip planned, you see. And I absolutely must be able to walk.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Sharifa. It appears you do have some weakness in both legs, as you’ve described, and it’s confirmed by the exam. Your reflexes are a little slow, and your leg strength is diminished compared to what I’d typically expect. Now, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause based on this exam alone. There are several possibilities. It could be related to a nerve issue, a muscle problem, or even something as simple as vitamin deficiency, although you mentioned you take a multivitamin. Because it followed a cold, it could be post-viral weakness, but it’s persisting longer than I’d usually expect. I think it’s best to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and thyroid function. We should also consider an MRI of your spine to rule out any nerve compression.
PATIENT: An MRI? Good heavens. That sounds… drastic. And rather expensive, I presume? I don’t recall mentioning any financial difficulties, Doctor, but I do have a budget. And honestly, I find this entire process rather unsettling. A simple cold shouldn’t warrant such… invasive procedures. Are you certain this is necessary? Couldn’t we simply try some physical therapy? Or perhaps a stronger multivitamin? I’m not comfortable with the idea of being subjected to an MRI unless it’s absolutely unavoidable. And frankly, Doctor, I’m beginning to suspect you’re overreacting. This is probably just a temporary setback. A bit of rest and some gentle exercise should suffice. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sharifa, and I certainly don’t want to cause you any unnecessary anxiety or expense. I’m not suggesting an MRI lightly. However, given the persistence of your weakness and the fact that it’s affecting your ability to do everyday activities, I think it’s important to rule out anything serious. It's a precaution, to get a clearer picture. The blood work is relatively inexpensive, and will give us some initial information. As for the MRI, we can discuss the cost with the imaging center and see if there are any financial assistance programs available. I completely agree that physical therapy is a good idea, and we can explore that as well. But it's best to have a diagnosis first, so we know what we’re treating. It's not about suspecting something dreadful, it’s about being thorough. Would you be open to starting with the blood work?
PATIENT: Very well. Blood work. I suppose that’s… tolerable. But I want it to be comprehensive. Every vitamin, every electrolyte, everything. And I expect a detailed explanation of the results, in plain English, not some medical jargon I can’t understand. And Doctor, please, no unnecessary tests. I’m not a particularly wealthy woman, and I don’t appreciate being subjected to frivolous expenses. And if the blood work comes back normal, I refuse to have an MRI. Do we have an understanding? I’m beginning to feel rather faint. I need a glass of water.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will do a comprehensive blood work panel – all vitamins, electrolytes, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. I promise to explain the results to you in plain English, and we will discuss all your options before proceeding with any further tests. And you are absolutely right – we will not proceed with an MRI unless absolutely necessary. I completely understand your concerns about the cost. I’ll have a nurse bring you a glass of water right away. While we wait, I’ll write you a requisition form for the blood work and a referral for physical therapy. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week sounds… reasonable. As long as you promise not to overwhelm me with unnecessary procedures. And please, Doctor, be mindful of my back when you hand me the paperwork. It’s a sensitive area, as I’ve mentioned. And if it turns out to be something trivial, I expect a full apology. This entire ordeal has been rather stressful. And frankly, I’m losing valuable time that I could be spending on more productive activities. But yes, a week. Let’s hope for the best. Now, where is that glass of water? I'm feeling rather dehydrated.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The requisition form is for the blood work – you can take it to any lab. The referral is for physical therapy – you can call and schedule an appointment whenever you’re ready. And here’s a glass of water. Please take your time, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And if it turns out to be something minor, I apologize for any unnecessary stress. I always err on the side of caution when it comes to patient health. We’ll discuss everything in detail next week. Is there anything else I can do for you at the moment?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. Just… try not to alarm me unnecessarily. And please, remember my back. It’s a sensitive area. I’m not a particularly fragile woman, but I do have my limitations. And if the blood work comes back normal, I will expect a full and sincere apology. This entire experience has been rather unsettling. But yes, I suppose that will be all for now. Thank you… I think. I’ll be in touch next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sharifa. We’ll do our best to get you feeling better. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing you next week. .
