DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Aldine Popova is the name, though everyone just calls me Pop. I’ve been havin’ a bit of a headache, right at the back of my head. It’s been botherin’ me for… well, a good week now, I’d say. Not the worst pain, but it’s there, y’know? Constant kinda ache.
DOCTOR: Right, a constant ache at the back of the head for about a week. Okay. And would you describe it as a sharp pain, or more of a dull pressure?
PATIENT: Definitely dull pressure, Doctor. Not sharp at all. More like… someone’s put a heavy band around my head, if that makes sense? It’s not throbbing, either. Just… there. Steady. And sometimes it feels like it goes up the back of my neck a little, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull pressure, constant, radiating to the neck… Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, nothin’ specifically. It doesn’t seem to change much with what I’m doin’. Washin’ hands for long periods at work… doesn’t really affect it. Readin’… doesn’t make it worse. Sleepin’… nah. It's just… always there, a low-level ache. Maybe… maybe a bit worse when I’m stressed? But I’m an old man, Doctor, there’s always somethin’ to be stressed about!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, stress is certainly a factor for many. Alright. And besides the headache, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… no fever, no blurry vision. No dizziness. I haven’t been feelin’ sick to my stomach or nothin’ like that. My hands are a bit shaky, always have been, but that’s just old age, I reckon. Appetite’s been normal, and I’m sleepin’ alright… though I do wake up a couple times a night to use the bathroom, if you want to count that. But that’s been happenin’ for years!
DOCTOR: Alright, so no fever, no vision changes, no nausea… shaky hands, but that’s pre-existing. Frequent urination at night… Okay. Now, have you had any changes in your vision recently, or any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: No trouble with my balance, Doctor. Still steady on my feet, thank goodness. Though I do move a bit slower these days! And my vision… well, it’s not what it used to be, but it hasn’t gotten any worse recently. I get my glasses checked every year, regular as clockwork. Last check-up was in February, and they said it was just age-related. Nothing to worry about then, they said. I can still see well enough to do my work, you know. Manicures and pedicures require a good eye!
DOCTOR: Right, regular eye exams… good. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No weakness at all, Doctor. And no numbness either. My hands get a bit cold sometimes, especially in the winter, but that’s just the circulation, I think. I’ve never had any trouble movin’ my arms or legs. I still walk to work every day, rain or shine. It’s a good walk, keeps me active. Though, now that I think about it, my fingers do get a bit stiff in the mornin’, but that’s been happenin’ for years. Arthritis, my wife says. She's always got a diagnosis for somethin’!
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I'm 87, Doctor! My memory isn't what it used to be, that's for certain. I forget where I put my keys sometimes, or what I was just talkin’ about… but honestly, I think that’s just part of gettin’ old. It hasn't gotten any worse recently, though. I still remember all my customers' favorite colors, and exactly how they like their nails done. And I can still recall details from my childhood like it was yesterday! So, no, I wouldn’t say my memory’s gotten any worse. Just… normal old man forgetfulness, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but it’s been under control with medication for a long time now. And I had a bit of trouble with my prostate a few years back, but that's been sorted out too. No major illnesses, mind you. No heart trouble, no diabetes, no cancer, thank the Lord. I've always been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. Oh! And I broke my wrist when I was a young man, playin’ cricket. But that healed up just fine, years and years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. Appendicitis when I was about twenty. Back in Jamaica. They took it out, and I've been right as rain ever since. It was a long time ago, though. I barely remember it, to be honest. It was a simple operation, my mother told me. Nothing fancy. Haven’t had to go under the knife since, and I hope I don’t have to again!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. My mother, she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her knees. And my father, he had high blood pressure, like me. My sister, she had diabetes, but she didn’t take care of herself, poor thing. And my brother… he had heart trouble, died young, unfortunately. So, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart trouble… that runs in the family, I suppose. It's not a very healthy bunch, truth be told. But, like I said, I've been pretty lucky so far.
DOCTOR: And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I take it every morning, small white pill. Been takin’ it for… oh, must be ten years now, maybe more. It keeps my blood pressure nice and steady. And that’s it. I don’t like takin’ too many pills, if I can help it. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. Though I haven't found anything that helps this headache, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, traveled all over… never had a problem. I don’t even get hay fever! My wife always jokes that I’m too tough for allergies. No, no allergies. That I know of, anyway. I’ve never had reason to worry about ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Popova, given your age and medical history, and the description of your headache - a constant, dull pressure, radiating to the neck, not worsened by anything specific - it could be a tension headache, or potentially related to your blood pressure, even though it’s currently controlled. However, given your age, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to check your reflexes and cranial nerves. It’s just a routine examination to ensure everything is functioning properly. We might also want to do a basic blood test to check your electrolytes and kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I don't mind a bit of checkin’ up, if it puts my mind at ease. Go ahead, listen to my heart and lungs, check my reflexes, do whatever you need to do. I’m an open book! I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not afraid of a little poke and prod. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that could be due to a number of factors. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Alright, go right ahead, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. Never been one for fancy medical talk, mind you, so feel free to explain things in plain English! I'm just hopin' it's nothin' too serious. An old man can only take so much worryin', y'know?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves… Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that. There you go, followin’ it up and down… left and right… no problem at all. Eyes are workin’ just fine, as far as I can tell. A little dry maybe, but that's just gettin' old, I reckon. Never had a problem seein' the details on a nail, anyway. That's the important thing!
DOCTOR: Alright, everything seems to be functioning properly there. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your neck to check for any muscle tenderness or enlarged lymph nodes. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not particularly. A bit stiff maybe, but nothin’ that I haven’t felt before. I sometimes sleep in a funny position, and my neck gets a bit sore. No sharp pains or anything like that. Just a bit of… tightness. I probably need a bit of a massage, that’s all. My wife used to give me good massages, but she’s not as strong as she used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova, based on the physical examination, there are no obvious neurological deficits, and your vital signs are generally stable. However, your heart rate is slightly elevated, and we should investigate the cause of your headache further. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests will help rule out any underlying infection, electrolyte imbalances, or thyroid problems that could be contributing to your symptoms. I’d also like to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm more closely. Would you be able to schedule these tests at the local lab?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. Tests are fine. EKG, too. I’ll head down to the local lab, no problem. I know Mrs. Peterson who works there, she’ll look after me. She's a kind woman. Just… let me know what I need to tell her, and what kind of preparation I need to do before the tests. I don't want to mess anything up! Fastin’ or anythin’ like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, please fast for eight hours before the blood tests and EKG. That means no food or drinks, except for water. And let Mrs. Peterson know that I’m ordering a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and TSH test, along with the EKG. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Eight hours… that’ll mean I’ll have to skip breakfast, but that's alright. I can manage. I’ll tell Mrs. Peterson everything you said. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, TSH, and the EKG… got it. And I’ll bring the results straight back to you as soon as I have them. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look after me. I feel a bit better just knowin’ we’re gettin’ things checked out. Hopefully, it's nothin' too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And try not to worry too much, Mr. Popova. We’re just being thorough. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will keep that in mind. And you have a good day too. I'll be seein' you soon. .
