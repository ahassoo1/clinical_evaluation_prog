DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure's been actin' up lately, that’s what brought me. Old age, I reckon. It's just been higher than it used to be, and my daughter, bless her heart, told me I needed to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. I appreciate you coming in. “Actin’ up” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I don't really feel different, ya know? No headaches or nothin'. My daughter, she bought one of them machines, a little cuff thing. She checks it when she visits, and she says it's been high a few times now. Higher than what she thinks it should be, anyways. I don’t understand all them numbers.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know. It’s good your daughter is being proactive and monitoring things. And it’s perfectly alright if the numbers are confusing. That’s what I’m here for. Do you happen to know what those numbers were when your daughter checked them?
PATIENT: Shoot, no, I don't. I try not to bother my head with 'em. She just tells me "it's a little high, Momma." Somethin' like that. I bake all day, ya know? Pies, breads, cookies… keeps me busy. Maybe it's that? All that salt, I s'pose. I don't add much, but still…
DOCTOR: That's understandable. We can certainly look into whether diet might be playing a role. Let’s get a reading here in the office to start, and then we can talk about your history a bit more. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good to me, Doctor. Just gettin' it checked is fine by me. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to wrap this cuff around your upper arm. It might feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. I’ll inflate it, and you’ll feel it squeeze for a moment. Please try to relax and don’t talk while I’m taking the reading. I’ll do it on both arms to get an accurate baseline. Okay, that’s helpful. Your blood pressure is 158/92 on your right arm and 162/94 on your left. Your pulse is 72 and regular.
PATIENT: Well now… them numbers don’t mean nothin’ to me. Is that… bad? My daughter said somethin' about 120 bein' good. Is it higher than that? I just want to know if I need to worry.
DOCTOR: Yes, those numbers are a bit elevated, Venna. Your daughter is right, generally we like to see blood pressure below 120/80. Yours is higher than that, and we consider it to be Stage 2 hypertension. It does mean we need to address it. However, it’s not necessarily cause for panic. We have several ways to manage high blood pressure. Before we talk about treatment options, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your overall health, if you don’t mind. It will help me determine the best course of action. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Questions are fine. I ain't got much to hide. Been livin' a good, long life, mostly. Just want to keep it goin' a little longer, ya know? So, ask away.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never been sick enough for a proper diagnosis, if you catch my drift. Had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but I got over 'em just fine. My bones ache a little sometimes, but that's just old age, I reckon. And I had my gallbladder taken out 'bout thirty years ago, but that was all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to confirm, you said you had your gallbladder removed about thirty years ago. Was that done here, or at another hospital?
PATIENT: It was at the old hospital in Stilwell, Doctor. That place ain't even standin' anymore, I think. Small little place, but they took good care of me. Dr. Lawson, he was a good man. Been gone a long time now, bless his soul.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, Doctor. Some pills my daughter gets me. Can’t remember the name of 'em… somethin’ with a ‘G’ in it, I think. And sometimes I take a little Tylenol for the aches, but not every day. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll get the name of that arthritis medication. That's good you're letting me know about the Tylenol, even if it's not regular. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to nothin’. I eat just about anything put in front of me, truth be told. I like a good fry bread, if you're askin'. And I've never had trouble with any pills or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, my mama, she had a weak heart, I think. She didn't go to doctors much, back in her day. Just kinda slowed down one day and… that was that. My daddy, he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. And my brother, he's still kickin', far as I know. He lives out in California, don't see him much. I don't know nothin' about his health, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And just one more set of questions, and then we'll move on. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, huh? Well, I bake, like I said. Keeps me busy all day. I don’t do much else, to be honest. My daughter tries to get me to walk with her, but I get tired easy. I used to garden, but my knees just won't let me anymore. I don’t smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol – maybe a little sip of wine on holidays.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Now, before we discuss treatment options, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and a look at your legs and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I ain't got nothin' to hide. Just try not to poke too hard, these old bones are brittle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur, which is common in people your age. Your lungs are clear. Your pulse is good and regular in all extremities. I don’t notice any significant swelling in your legs or feet. Your abdomen is soft. I also checked your reflexes and they're a little diminished, which is also not uncommon with age. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it confirms we need to address your blood pressure. It's good we're catching this now. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A murmur, huh? Is that bad? My mama had somethin' like that, I think. But other than that, not really. Just... what are we gonna do about it? I don’t want to be takin’ a bunch of pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: The murmur is likely just age-related, and isn't necessarily something to be overly concerned about right now. We’ll keep an eye on it. As for treatment, you're right to be cautious about medications. The first step is usually lifestyle changes. Given your baking, we can look at reducing your salt intake, and incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet if you're able. Regular, even gentle, exercise, like short walks, can also make a big difference. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, we can discuss medication options. There are several different types of blood pressure medications, and we can choose one that has the fewest side effects for you. It might take some trial and error to find the right fit. Would you be open to trying the lifestyle changes first, and then rechecking your blood pressure in a month or so?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… I reckon I can try. It ain't gonna be easy, cuttin' back on salt when I bake all day. But I can ask my daughter to help me find some recipes with less of it. And I can try to walk with her more, even if it's just a little bit. A month sounds good. Don't want to rush into takin' pills right away.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's a great plan. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for one month from today. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a handout with information about reducing salt intake and the benefits of exercise. I also want you to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. If you don't have a blood pressure cuff, your daughter can bring hers to the follow-up appointment, or we can discuss getting you one. If you experience any sudden headaches, dizziness, or shortness of breath before your appointment, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I think I got it. Salt, walkin’, and don’t feel bad if I get a little tired. And call if somethin' feels real wrong. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old woman.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It was my pleasure. Remember, we’re a team, and we'll work together to get your blood pressure under control. I’ll see you in one month. If you have any questions before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and happy baking!
