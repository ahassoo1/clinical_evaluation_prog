DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, yes. It’s been… present for a little while, I think. Honestly, my memory isn’t the best, so pinpointing when it started is proving tricky. It’s mainly… around my face, I believe?
DOCTOR: "A little while," you say. That’s… helpful. Let's try to be more specific. Is it just your face, or have you noticed swelling anywhere else – perhaps your hands, feet, or abdomen?
PATIENT: Hmm… abdomen… no, I don’t think so. My hands… possibly? It’s hard to say. I haven’t really been paying close attention, if I'm honest. Mostly, it's been the face that I’ve noticed. It feels… puffy, perhaps? And a little uncomfortable when I touch it. It's not painful, just… noticeable. Is that making sense? I apologize for being vague.
DOCTOR: It's… alright. We'll get there. "Puffy" and "uncomfortable," noted. And has this swelling been constant since you first noticed it, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I believe it does come and go. There are some days where it's barely noticeable, and others… well, others like today, where it's more pronounced. I haven't been able to connect it to anything specific, though. I haven’t changed my diet or anything. At least, not that I recall. It just… happens. Is that useful information?
DOCTOR: It's… data. Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Anything else…? Let me think. That's… difficult. I've been feeling a bit more tired lately, perhaps? But honestly, that could be anything. Work has been… demanding. And no, nothing major comes to mind. I haven't been ill, haven't travelled… I really wish I could be more specific. My memory is just… fragmented. I apologize again for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: Fragmented memories are… less than ideal for a medical history, Mr. Tomassoni. Very well. Let’s move on to something more concrete. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, allergies. That's… a bit better. I don’t believe I have any, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I’m aware. I've eaten… well, a fairly varied diet throughout my life, and haven’t experienced any issues. And medications… I rarely take anything, unless absolutely necessary. I try to avoid them if possible. Is there a particular allergy you’d like me to focus on? Perhaps one I should be aware of, even if I don’t recall it?
DOCTOR: We'll cover the common ones. Any reactions to penicillin or other antibiotics?
PATIENT: Penicillin… antibiotics… Let me think. No, I don’t recall ever taking penicillin, actually. And antibiotics… I might have had one or two courses in my life, years ago, but I certainly didn’t experience any adverse reactions. No rash, no difficulty breathing… nothing that I remember, at least. It was quite some time ago, though. I was younger, naturally. Is there a specific type of reaction I should be looking for in my memories?
DOCTOR: Hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat… the usual. Alright. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I generally prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I don't take any vitamins or supplements either. I try to maintain a healthy diet, and I believe that's usually sufficient. I haven’t needed anything beyond the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and even those are infrequent. I’m rather careful with what I put into my body, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. As far as I know, I’ve always been quite healthy. No diagnoses of diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems… nothing like that. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – chickenpox, measles, things like that – but nothing serious or ongoing. I’ve been fortunate, I think. Although… this swelling is rather concerning, naturally. I’m hoping you can determine the cause. Do you need me to recall any specific tests or procedures I might have undergone in the past? My memory is… unreliable, as we've established.
DOCTOR: No, let's not delve into specifics yet. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid surgery entirely. I’ve never required any procedures that necessitated it, thankfully. Just the usual minor things – stitches when I was a child, perhaps, but nothing major. I’m rather… averse to surgery, if I’m honest. I’d prefer to avoid it whenever possible. Is that… helpful information?
DOCTOR: It’s… noted. Now, family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. That’s… a bit tricky. My mother… she passed away some years ago. She had… heart problems, I believe. Yes, heart disease, definitely. My father is still alive, but I haven’t seen him in many years. I don’t recall any specific medical conditions on his side, to be honest. He always seemed quite robust, but… I wasn’t particularly close to him. And I don’t have any siblings, so there’s not much family history to draw on. I apologize for the vagueness. It's difficult recalling details about relatives I haven't seen in decades. Is heart disease a significant concern, given my mother’s history?
DOCTOR: It's… a factor. Finally, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have, never will. I find it… rather unpleasant, actually. And I'm aware of the health risks, naturally. I also don’t drink excessively, if at all. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing beyond that. I generally lead a rather… quiet lifestyle. I prefer to stay active, but I don't engage in any particularly strenuous activities. Is that… the sort of information you were seeking?
DOCTOR: Do you use recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I have no experience with recreational drugs. I find the idea… rather appalling, to be honest. I’m a firm believer in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and that includes abstaining from any substances that could be detrimental to my well-being. I’m rather… conventional in that regard, I suppose. I trust that answers your question. Is there anything else you require? I'm hoping we can begin to address this swelling soon. It's quite unsettling, and I'm eager to understand its cause.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at you. If you'll just sit up and lean forward, please. I’m going to examine your face and neck. Hmm. There is some definite pitting edema around your cheeks and forehead. And your neck… slightly enlarged, but no palpable lymph nodes. No bruits. Blood pressure is 128/76. Pulse 72. Temperature normal. We’ll need some lab work. I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a urinalysis. We'll also need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, so I'm ordering an EKG and a chest x-ray. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I’m happy to undergo. I’m eager to understand the cause of this swelling and to receive appropriate treatment. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid panel, urinalysis, EKG, and chest x-ray… yes, all of that sounds… sensible. Where do I go to have these tests performed? And how long will it take to receive the results? I trust your assessment, and I’m grateful for your thorough examination. I just want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The technician will take care of everything. The EKG and chest x-ray will be performed in the radiology department, which is on the third floor. They’ll schedule you when you’re finished in the lab. As for results, it usually takes 24 to 48 hours for everything to come back. My nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any difficulty breathing, significant chest pain, or severe headache, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll also have my nurse fax the results to your primary care physician. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Lab down the hall, radiology on the third floor, 24 to 48 hours for results, and nurse will call to schedule a follow-up… and to seek immediate medical attention if I experience breathing difficulties, chest pain, or a severe headache. Yes, I’ve noted everything. Thank you for your thoroughness and your clear instructions. I appreciate your time and your expertise. I'll proceed to the lab now. And… thank you again. I hope we can identify the cause of this swelling soon. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's hope so. .
