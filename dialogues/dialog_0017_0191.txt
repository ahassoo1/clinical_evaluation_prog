DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I came in because… I wanted to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was best to just get it over with.
DOCTOR: HIV testing, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I know it’s… a sensitive thing, but I'd just like to know my status, for peace of mind, really. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Though frankly, at your age, I find it… curious. But, I suppose everyone is entitled to their anxieties. Before we proceed, have you engaged in any behaviors that would necessitate such testing?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… not recently, no. It’s not that I expect anything, Doctor. My husband and I have been together for a very long time, and we’ve always been faithful. But… you hear things, you read things. And it’s better to be safe than sorry, isn't it? I just want to be sure. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: “Patient expresses anxieties, long-term marriage, reports fidelity.” Yes, well, preventative measures are… acceptable, I suppose. Though statistically, it's rather unlikely. Still. We will proceed. Do you have any known allergies to latex, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. And no other medical conditions, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. But nothing serious. I do take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just a small dose. It was diagnosed a few years ago, but it's well-controlled with the medication. Why do you ask? Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s… relevant. Now, what medication exactly are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it's Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. 10 milligrams, once a day. My regular doctor prescribed it. Is that… important for the HIV test? I didn’t realize it would matter.
DOCTOR: It’s… a matter of potential interactions and ensuring accurate results. Now, before we proceed with the testing, I need to gather some further information. Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never needed one, thankfully. I try to eat well and stay healthy, you see. Is that something I should have been concerned about before coming in? I'm starting to worry that I've missed something important.
DOCTOR: No, no, you haven’t missed anything. I simply need to be thorough. Now, I will need to perform a brief physical examination, and then we can proceed with the blood draw. Please, have a seat on the examination table. We will start with your vital signs.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm a little nervous, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: It’s a simple blood draw, Ms. Shaub. Hardly cause for alarm. Now, please relax your arm. I need to get a reading. 140 over 90… Hmm. Not ideal. But we'll address that later. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’ll just check your lymph nodes. No noticeable swelling. Alright. Everything appears… unremarkable. Now, we’ll proceed with the blood draw. Please tell me if you have a fear of needles.
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have a fear of needles. I’ve had vaccinations before, it’s never bothered me much. I’m just… anxious about the results, I suppose. It’s the waiting that I dislike. Is it a lot of blood? I don’t faint, but I do get a little lightheaded sometimes.
DOCTOR: A small amount, Ms. Shaub. Certainly nothing to cause concern. I assure you, it will be over quickly. Now, try to relax your arm. There. All done. Just apply pressure to the site for a few minutes. I’ll send this to the lab immediately. You should have the results within five to seven business days. Do not call my office inquiring about them prematurely. I will contact you if anything… significant arises. Now, is there anything else you wished to discuss today, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright, thank you, Doctor. No, I think that’s all. Just the results, when they come. Five to seven days… I’ll try to be patient. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. I trust you'll contact me should any… unforeseen complications arise. Good day, Ms. Shaub. .
PATIENT: .
