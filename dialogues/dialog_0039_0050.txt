DOCTOR: Hello Brodie, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… it’s this cough. Been hangin’ on for a while now. Dry as dust, it is. Feels like somethin’ ticklin’ the back of my throat all the time. Honestly, I don't even remember exactly when it started… sometime this year, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been with you for a bit. Dry, tickling sensation… that’s helpful. You said sometime this year?
PATIENT: Yes, sometime this year. Maybe spring? Or was it after the… the hot weather started? My memory ain't what it used to be, you see. My wife, she always remembered everything. Now… it’s just… fuzzy. It doesn't hurt, not really. Just… annoying. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Brodie. Memory can be tricky. No pain with the cough, just bothersome, especially at night. Okay. And has anything changed about the cough recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Hmm. Let me think. Not that I recall. It’s always been… dry. Maybe a little worse when I lie down, that’s all. I do find myself drinkin’ a lot more water now, just tryin’ to keep my throat wet. But the cough itself… no, hasn’t gotten any… better or worse, I don't think. It's just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright, constant dry cough, worse when lying down, and you've been drinking more water to soothe your throat. Do you notice anything else that seems to make it worse, like dust, smoke, or cold air?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a good question. Dust, yes, I think so. I do a little work in the garage… fixin’ things, you know? Old cars mostly. The dust does seem to bother it some. Smoke, not so much. Used to smoke a pipe years ago, so I got used to that, I guess. Cold air… maybe a little? But I live here, so it’s not like I’m out in the cold a lot. Mostly just… dusty. Old cars get dusty.
DOCTOR: Okay, dusty environment, specifically from working on old cars, seems to aggravate the cough. That’s good to know. Now, besides the cough, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… No fever, I don't believe. No… shortness of breath. I get tired easy, but I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I figure that’s just age. I do feel a little… weak sometimes, but that could be… well, everything, really. No chest pain, though. Definitely no chest pain. And I haven't coughed up any… anything. Just dry. Really, just the dry cough.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or anything being coughed up. Just the dry cough and some general weakness, which you rightly attribute to age. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your overall health, if you don’t mind. Have you had any serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothin’ major. My wife, she was the one who got sick. She had… something with her lungs, years ago. I took care of her. But me? Always been pretty strong. I worked with my hands my whole life. Never had much time to be sick. Used to be a good hunter, too. Lots of walkin’ in the woods. But that was a long time ago. No serious illnesses, no. Mostly just old age settlin’ in, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, relatively healthy past, aside from your wife’s lung condition. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… a long time ago. And… oh! I had a knee replacement, maybe ten years back? It helped a lot, for a while. But that’s about it. Nothing else that I can recall. Just the appendix and the knee. Everything else, I’ve managed to fix myself, or it healed on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and a knee replacement. Now, thinking about your family… do you know of any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family health problems… My mother, she had trouble with her heart when she got older. And my brother… he had something with his lungs, too. Not as bad as my wife, but he coughed a lot. Lots of wheezing. That’s about all I can recall. We didn’t talk much about health, back then. Just… tough it out. We were Hmong, you see. We didn’t go to doctors much. Mostly used traditional remedies. So I don't know much about family history, really. Just heart trouble and a little lung trouble, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart and lung issues in the family. Now, I’m going to ask about your current habits. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: I told you, I used to smoke a pipe. Years ago. Gave that up a long time ago. Maybe fifty years ago? I haven't touched a cigarette since. My wife didn't like it, so I quit. And I haven’t been around a lot of smoke lately, either. Just… clean air, mostly. Well, except for the dust in the garage, but that's different, isn't it? No, I don’t smoke. Haven’t for a long, long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, former smoker, quit 50 years ago. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. The doctor gave me some pills for my knee a while back, but I stopped takin’ them. Didn’t seem to do much good. I mostly just take a little something for my blood pressure now and then. Got ‘em right here, somewhere. But I don't take ‘em every day, just when I feel a little… off. I mostly try to manage things on my own, you see. Old habits, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, some medication for blood pressure, taken intermittently. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat just about anything. My wife, she was the picky eater. I always figured I was too tough to be allergic to anything. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle sometimes when the pollen’s bad, but that's just the seasons changin’. No, I don't have any allergies, not really. Just a little bit of dust, maybe, but that’s from the garage, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m just glad someone’s finally takin’ a look at this cough. It's been hangin’ on for a while, you see. Just want to make sure it's nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a listen. Can you take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: There… like that? Is that good enough? It feels a little… tight in my chest sometimes, when I breathe deep. But that’s probably just my age, isn't it? Just old lungs, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening now. I do hear some mild wheezing, especially when you exhale. Your breathing sounds a little bit diminished in some areas, but it's not dramatically so. I also feel some mild tightness in your chest, as you mentioned. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… tight. Like a band around my chest. Not hurtin’, just… uncomfortable. It's been like that for a while now. Especially when I lie down. Makes it hard to get comfortable sometimes. And when I cough, it feels… strained. Like I'm pushin’ too hard. But it’s not sharp pain, just… tightness. Is that what you're hearin’, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's consistent with what I'm hearing and feeling. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, 150/85. I also notice your skin feels a bit dry. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger.
PATIENT: Oxygen… alright. I used to spend a lot of time in the woods, you see. Good, clean air. Maybe I'm missin' that now. I'm not sure what a good number is, but is that okay? Just tell me if somethin’s wrong, Doctor. I trust your judgment. This cough just feels… persistent, you see. It’s not gettin’ any better.
DOCTOR: Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little bit low. Ideally, we want that above 95%. Given your age, the wheezing, the tightness in your chest, and the slightly low oxygen, I suspect you have some mild chronic bronchitis, possibly exacerbated by your dust exposure in the garage. Your blood pressure is also something we should keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Chronic… bronchitis? That sounds… serious. Is that bad, Doctor? Will I have to go to the hospital? My wife, she had trouble with her lungs, but I don’t remember exactly what it was. And the dust… you think that’s makin’ it worse? I like workin’ in the garage, you see. Keeps me busy. But I don’t want to get sick. What do I do? What do you recommend, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious at this stage, Brodie, but it’s something we need to manage. Chronic bronchitis means there’s some inflammation in your airways, which causes the wheezing and difficulty breathing. The dust exposure is likely making it worse. Hospitalization isn’t necessary at this time. I recommend a few things. First, we’ll start you on an inhaler to help open up your airways. Second, I want you to minimize your exposure to dust. Perhaps a mask in the garage, and someone could help with the heavier, dustier tasks. Third, we’ll monitor your blood pressure and discuss potential medication if it remains elevated. Finally, I’d like you to come back in two weeks to check your progress. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: An inhaler… and a mask… Yes, that sounds reasonable. I can do that. I can get a mask, and maybe my grandson can help with the dusty work. He’s a strong boy. And I’ll try to remember to use the inhaler, though my memory… well, you know. Two weeks, you said? I’ll mark it on the calendar. So, no hospital, just the inhaler, the mask, and keep an eye on my blood pressure? And come back in two weeks? That doesn’t sound too bad. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. That's exactly right. Inhaler as directed, minimize dust exposure, and follow up in two weeks. I'll write you a prescription for the inhaler now, and the nurse will go over how to use it properly. We’ll also schedule your follow-up appointment. Before you go, do you have any questions for me at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… one thing. Will this… condition… get worse over time? Is there anything I can do to… slow it down? Besides the mask and the inhaler, I mean. Is there anything I can eat, or drink, or… do? I just want to stay… comfortable, for as long as possible, you see. And not be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Brodie. Chronic bronchitis can sometimes worsen over time, but with proper management, we can significantly slow its progression. Besides the mask and inhaler, there are a few things you can do. First, staying hydrated is important – drink plenty of fluids. Second, avoid smoking and exposure to irritants like strong perfumes or cleaning products. Third, maintaining a healthy diet and getting regular, gentle exercise can help boost your immune system. Finally, and this is important, consider getting a flu shot and pneumonia vaccine to prevent respiratory infections, which can worsen your symptoms. We'll monitor your progress closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Flu shot and pneumonia vaccine… yes, I remember my wife gettin’ those. Okay, I can do that. I’ll ask my grandson to take me to get those. He’s very good about takin’ care of things. So, drink plenty of fluids, avoid irritants, eat healthy, gentle exercise, get the shots… and use the inhaler, and the mask. And come back in two weeks. I think… I think I’ve got it. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any other questions. Thank you again for your time, and for explainin’ everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brodie. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to review the instructions and schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
