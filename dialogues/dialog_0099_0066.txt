DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio. Have a seat. Forty years old, eh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That is correct. August 2nd, 2025, if that helps with the records. I appreciate you seeing me.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, date is noted. Don't worry, the system usually remembers these things. Though, people are remarkably forgetful. Now, let's get down to business. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a… popping sensation in my back. Or sometimes a clicking. It’s not constant, but it happens when I move in certain ways, especially when I’m, uh, working on things. It doesn’t necessarily hurt, but it’s… disconcerting, you know? It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: “Disconcerting.” Right. Popping and clicking. And when you say “working on things,” are we talking strenuous labor, or… assembling model airplanes?
PATIENT: No, sir, definitely not model airplanes. I'm an electrical and electronics installer and repairer, mostly on transportation equipment – buses, trains, that sort of thing. It involves a fair bit of bending, reaching, and sometimes lifting, though I try to be careful with my back. It’s mostly crouching and working in tight spaces, I suppose. That's when it seems to happen most often.
DOCTOR: Transportation equipment… crouching… figures. So, no actual injury then?
PATIENT: No, sir, no injury that I’m aware of. No falls, no sudden twists, nothing like that. It just… started gradually. I didn’t even notice it at first, just a little… feeling. Now it’s more pronounced. It doesn’t stop me from working, but it makes me a bit anxious, if that makes sense. I worry it could lead to something, you know?
DOCTOR: Anxious. Right. Well, worry is often misplaced. It's usually something trivial. But we should rule things out. Do you experience any pain with the popping?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s not a sharp pain, or even a dull ache. Sometimes, after it pops, there’s a very slight stiffness, but that goes away quickly. It’s more of a… sensation, a feeling of something… shifting, perhaps? It doesn’t radiate or anything, it’s just localized to my back, usually in the lower region.
DOCTOR: Localized, slight stiffness… shifting. Have you noticed it at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I think… it seems to be worse in the mornings, right after I wake up. Or after I’ve been sitting for a long period, like during my commute. Then, after I get moving, it feels a little better, but it still happens throughout the day, especially when I’m contorting myself to reach something in a cramped space. It doesn’t really seem to be worse at the end of the day, just… consistently present. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I’m following. Morning stiffness, prolonged sitting… it sounds like typical musculoskeletal… wear and tear. But, we should be thorough. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, sir, no numbness or tingling at all. Full sensation in my legs and feet. I’ve been consciously checking, especially since this started, just to be sure. No weakness either. I can walk normally, climb stairs without issue, everything feels… normal, except for the popping sensation. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right. Unsettling. Well, let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that would be wonderful. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa, hold on. No need to disrobe. Just stand up straight, and I’ll take a look at your range of motion. Please, just a simple visual assessment for now. And, if you don't mind, I’ll palpate your spine to check for any tenderness. Don’t anticipate anything drastic, but it’s procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, sir. My apologies. I got ahead of myself. A visual assessment is perfectly fine. I'll do my best to stand still. Just let me know what you'd like me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, bend forward, and touch your toes, if you can. Don’t force anything. …and now slowly stand back up. Good. Now, let’s try bending backwards, gently, just as far as comfortable.
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient, sir? I can go a little further if you’d like, but I want to avoid any… surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, side to side, gently. Don’t push it. …and now, let's see you twist your upper body from side to side. Slowly, and let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: That’s… a little stiff, but manageable. No pain with that either, just a bit of… creakiness, I suppose. It's not a smooth rotation, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Creakiness. Right. Let me just feel along your spine here… Any tenderness with this?
PATIENT: Uh, just there, sir. A little… sensitive. Not painful, exactly, but definitely noticeable. It's only when you press directly on it. Everywhere else feels… normal.
DOCTOR: Localized tenderness… Hmm. Sounds like a mild facet joint irritation. Not uncommon with your line of work. It’s likely causing the clicking and stiffness you're experiencing. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious, but it can be bothersome. You're probably just a little… worn down. It happens. Any history of back problems, surgeries, or injuries?
PATIENT: No, sir, no history of any back problems whatsoever. No surgeries, no injuries. I’ve always been relatively active, and I’ve never had any significant issues with my back until recently. I did help a friend move a very heavy refrigerator a few months ago, but I didn’t feel anything at the time. It didn’t seem to cause any issues until these symptoms started.
DOCTOR: Right. Heavy lifting. It could have been a contributing factor, though it sounds like more of a gradual onset. Let’s talk about your daily routine. What does a typical workday look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, sir, it varies, depending on the job. But generally, it involves a lot of crouching, bending, and reaching into tight spaces to install or repair electrical systems on buses and trains. I spend a fair amount of time on my knees, and often have to lift and maneuver equipment, though I try to use proper lifting techniques. I’m usually on my feet for most of the day, and I have to be careful navigating around tight spaces and uneven surfaces. It’s a physically demanding job, to put it mildly. I do try to take breaks when I can, but sometimes it’s hard when there’s a tight deadline.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, as you said, physically demanding. It's not surprising you're experiencing some wear and tear. I suspect it’s simply a musculoskeletal issue, likely exacerbated by your work. Honestly, Mr. Mastrantonio, it sounds like you're just getting old. We can try some conservative management to alleviate your symptoms. Have you tried any over-the-counter pain relievers or anti-inflammatory medications?
PATIENT: I have, sir. I’ve been taking ibuprofen occasionally for the stiffness, but it doesn’t seem to make a significant difference. It helps a little with the discomfort, but it doesn’t eliminate the popping sensation or the underlying stiffness. I try to avoid taking too much, as I’m aware of the potential side effects.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen isn't doing much. Well, we can try a short course of a stronger anti-inflammatory, if you're amenable. And I'll recommend some physical therapy exercises to strengthen your core and improve your flexibility. It’s mostly about managing the symptoms, Mr. Mastrantonio. It’s unlikely to go away completely, given your occupation. I’m not recommending any imaging at this time; it’s unnecessary. I'll also give you a list of exercises. Don't overdo it. And try to be more mindful of your posture. And maybe consider a less strenuous line of work.
PATIENT: Thank you, sir. I appreciate your recommendations. I will certainly try the stronger anti-inflammatory and the physical therapy exercises. As for a less strenuous line of work… that’s not really an option at this time. It’s what I’m trained for, and it provides for my family. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any specific signs I should look out for that would warrant a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Mastrantonio, I've told you what I think. If you experience any severe pain, numbness, or weakness in your legs, then, yes, come back. But honestly, it sounds like a typical case of wear and tear. I’m not going to waste your time or mine with unnecessary tests. Try to take care of yourself. And try not to lift anything too heavy.
PATIENT: Very well, sir. Thank you for your time and your recommendations. I will follow your advice. Have a good day.
