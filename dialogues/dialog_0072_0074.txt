DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I am Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, it's my blood pressure. Been runnin' a little high, the nurse said when she checked it. Don't feel much different, but I figure it's best to get it looked at. I don't like fussin', you know?
DOCTOR: Very well, Venna. It’s prudent to address these things. “A little high” can mean a variety of things, and we want to establish a baseline and determine if intervention is necessary. Now, can you tell me approximately how high the nurse said your blood pressure was?
PATIENT: Oh, land. Numbers… I'm terrible with numbers. She said somethin' like… one-something over eighty? Or was it ninety? I honestly don't recall. It was a big number on that machine, though. Higher than I'm used to seein', that's for sure. Sorry, dear. My memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Venna. We can certainly work with that. “Higher than usual” isn’t particularly helpful for medical purposes, unfortunately. Do you happen to know if this was a one-time reading, or has the nurse noted consistently elevated blood pressure during previous visits?
PATIENT: No, no previous visits. This is the first time I’ve seen a nurse 'bout it. I usually just go to old Man Tiberius, he’s been my doctor forever, but he retired. Said I needed to find someone new. This is my first time comin' to you. And first time havin’ my blood pressure checked, really. I just figured I was always healthy enough to skip that part.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that complicates matters somewhat. It's good to establish a pattern, and a single reading isn't always indicative of a true problem. However, given your age, it’s best to proceed with caution. Now, have you been experiencing any symptoms along with this elevated reading?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I figure a little tiredness comes with the territory. No headaches, no blurry vision, no chest pain… nothin’ like that. Just… old. I eat pretty good, bake most of my own bread, so I reckon I’m as healthy as I can be.
DOCTOR: “As healthy as you can be” is a subjective assessment, Venna. While baking your own bread is commendable, it doesn't necessarily equate to optimal cardiovascular health. We need to gather more information. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. Now that you mention it, my ankles have been a little puffy lately. Thought it was just the heat, you know? Been awful warm this summer. I usually just put my feet up and it helps. But… yeah, they do swell up some. Especially if I’ve been standin’ too long. Don’t think much of it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet, specifically?
PATIENT: Well, I bake a lot of bread, like I said. Whole wheat mostly. And I use a good bit of salt in the dough, gotta have salt! I eat some vegetables, mostly what I grow in my garden – tomatoes, beans, squash. And I have a little bit of meat now and then, mostly chicken. Not too much, though. I like sweets, too, a little piece of pie with my coffee sometimes. Not every day, mind you. I don’t drink much soda, not a fan of that stuff. Just water and coffee, mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. The salt intake is… concerning. And while home-baked bread is preferable to processed varieties, it doesn’t negate the potential for dietary factors contributing to elevated blood pressure. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. Old Man Tiberius always said I was a strong one. He checked me over every year, and I always passed with flyin' colors. Just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin’ old. Arthritis in my hands, makes bakin' a little harder sometimes, but that’s it. No diabetes, no kidney trouble, no heart problems… nothin’. I've always taken care of myself, you know? Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils taken out. That was a long time ago, though. And when I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree, but that was when I was young, too. Other than that… no, nothin’. No big surgeries, no long stays in the hospital. Just the usual doctor’s visits for checkups and the occasional cold. I did have a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered just fine at home. My daughter, Marsha, took care of me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… That’s a tough one. My mama, she lived to be eighty-five, and she had a little bit of trouble with her heart towards the end. My daddy, he passed away when I was young, somethin’ with his lungs, I think. And I had a brother, he had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself. Mostly, we just… died of old age. Didn't talk much about health problems back then. Just figured it was part of life. Not much help, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis. Something the nurse at the pharmacy recommended. It's a cream, I rub it on my hands. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, I take a little ibuprofen. Not every day, just when I need it. Other than that… no, nothin’. I don't like takin' pills if I can help it. I try to get by with natural remedies whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. Now, I'm going to conduct a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and examine your ankles. It's important to get a baseline assessment, given your elevated blood pressure and your history. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm a little stiff sometimes, so go easy on me. And I get cold easily, so maybe keep the room warm? Don't want to give you too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are slightly diminished, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breath sounds are a bit shallow. Pulse is 78 and regular, but a bit weak. Ankles exhibit 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. Skin is warm and dry, no signs of infection. As expected, there are some findings that warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation…? Oh, dear. What does that mean, exactly? Is it somethin' serious? I'm not wantin' a lot of tests if I can help it. I don't do well with needles.
DOCTOR: “Further investigation” simply means we need to gather more information to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and edema. It's not necessarily serious, but it’s important to rule out any underlying conditions. I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count to assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and overall health. We’ll also need a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. And, yes, these will require a blood draw. I understand your aversion to needles, but these tests are crucial for making an accurate assessment. We can discuss strategies to make the process more comfortable, if you’d like. And we will also need to monitor your blood pressure at home. I will have the nurse give you instructions on how to do that.
PATIENT: Oh, land. A lot of tests… I don't like the sound of that at all. But… if you think it's necessary, I suppose I can do it. Just… be quick about it, please? And… could Marsha come with me? She's better with all this medical stuff than I am. I get real flustered easily. And the blood pressure thing… can’t I just come back in a week and see if it's down on its own?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. We can certainly arrange for your daughter, Marsha, to accompany you for the blood draw. And we will do our best to make the process as quick and comfortable as possible. However, simply “waiting to see if it goes down on its own” is not a responsible course of action, given your age and the presence of edema. Untreated hypertension can lead to serious complications, such as heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. The blood work will give us a baseline assessment and help guide appropriate treatment if necessary. I'll have the nurse schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning. She will also provide you with instructions for home blood pressure monitoring and a list of potential lifestyle modifications you can begin implementing immediately. We’ll review the results at your follow-up appointment next week. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… what does that mean? Do I have to eat a bunch of rabbit food? And… what kind of complications are we talkin' about? I don't want to scare Marsha. She worries enough as it is. I just want to get back to bakin’ my bread, you know? That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: “Lifestyle modifications” simply means making some changes to your daily habits to improve your health. It doesn’t necessarily involve “rabbit food,” although increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables is certainly beneficial. It primarily involves reducing your sodium intake, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity – even a short daily walk can make a difference – and managing stress. As for the complications… untreated hypertension can lead to damage to your heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and brain. This can manifest as chest pain, shortness of breath, stroke, kidney failure, and vision loss. However, these are potential complications, Ms. Steines. With appropriate management, we can significantly reduce your risk. We're not necessarily talking about drastic changes, Ms. Steines. Small, incremental adjustments can make a significant difference. And we'll work together to develop a plan that is tailored to your individual needs and preferences. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work done. We’ll discuss the results and develop a more comprehensive plan at your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule the tests and provide you with instructions. Do you have any other questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… please tell Marsha to come with me. I don’t want to go through this alone. And… thank you, Doctor. For explainin’ things. It still sounds scary, but… I appreciate you takin’ the time. I reckon I just need to get through tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Steines. I will ensure your daughter accompanies you tomorrow. And I understand your apprehension. We will do everything we can to make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible. The nurse will be with you shortly.
