DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Just a quick one confirming I’m able to fly. My insurance, Medicare, requires it before they'll cover the ticket. It's for a trip... a personal trip.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kiante. A fit-to-fly letter. No problem at all. To ensure I can complete this accurately for you, I’ll need to ask a few questions. It’s a standard procedure, just to be thorough. First, have you been experiencing any health issues recently, anything at all that's been bothering you?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, nothing major. I lost my husband last year, so… there’s been a lot of stress, naturally. But physically? No. I’ve been feeling… okay. Normal, I guess. I had a check-up with my primary care doctor about six months ago and everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your loss, Kiante. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s good to hear you’ve been seeing your primary care physician regularly, and that things were stable at your last check-up. Just to clarify for my records, and to ensure I have a complete picture, could you tell me a little more about what your primary care doctor checked at that visit?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual things, I suppose. Blood pressure, cholesterol... they did an EKG, I think. And a full blood panel. He checked my thyroid, because my mother had problems with that. Everything came back normal. He said I was… healthy for my age. He did ask about my sleep, because I was having some trouble then, but I think it was just the grief. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, thank you. So, a recent check-up six months ago with normal blood pressure, cholesterol, thyroid function, and an EKG. And they addressed some sleep concerns. Just to be comprehensive, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I try to eat healthy, mostly. No regular medications, though. Definitely not. I prefer to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband was the one with allergies – pollen, mostly. I always teased him about sneezing season. But me? No allergies. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Just a couple more questions, then we can proceed with the assessment for the fit-to-fly letter. Have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past year?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I had a bad flu a couple of winters ago, but that was it. Just stayed home and rested. I’m usually very healthy, as I said. I really appreciate you being so thorough, though. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. It’s always best to be cautious, especially when it comes to travel. Now, to complete the assessment, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick visual assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this letter sorted so I can… well, so I can get on with things. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit here for me. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your overall appearance is good. No visible signs of distress. Everything sounds and looks good so far. Based on this brief examination and the information you’ve provided, I don’t see any medical contraindications to flying. I can write you the fit-to-fly letter today. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful news! Yes, please do. That would be fantastic. Thank you so much, Dr. Glowka. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. Here you go. This confirms you are medically fit to fly. It’s dated today, August 2nd, 2025. Please be sure to check with your insurance provider regarding any other requirements they may have. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Perfect. Thank you. This is exactly what I needed. No, I think that's everything. You've been incredibly helpful, Dr. Glowka. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. I appreciate it more than you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. It was my pleasure. If you experience any changes in your health before your trip, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a safe and enjoyable trip. .
