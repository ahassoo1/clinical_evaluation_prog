DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this breathing. It bothers me when I try to lie flat. It feels…difficult. Like something is pressing on me. I don't like it one bit. I just want to get this sorted out, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Difficult breathing that worsens when lying flat,” noted. Can you tell me a little more about this difficulty?
PATIENT: More…well, it’s not a pain, exactly. More like I can’t get enough air. It feels tight in my chest, and I have to sit up to breathe easier. It's been happening for…oh, maybe a month now? A little longer, perhaps. It’s gotten worse the last week. I used to be able to ignore it, but now it wakes me up at night. It’s quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: A month, progressively worsening, now waking you from sleep… I see. And is this difficulty constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. During the day, it's not too bad if I’m sitting or standing. But as soon as I lie down…that’s when it really bothers me. And like I said, it's been worse at night. I've been sleeping in my recliner chair, which isn’t ideal, believe me. My back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. My ankles have been a little swollen lately, and I've been feeling rather tired, even after a full night’s sleep…well, in the chair, that is. No cough, no fever, no chest pain, just…tired and a little puffy. And maybe I’ve been going to the bathroom a little more often, but I thought that was just getting older.
DOCTOR: Swelling, fatigue... and increased urination. Let’s review your medical history. I see here you have a history of hypertension, well-controlled, and some osteoarthritis. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hypertension, yes, Dr. Ramirez keeps that under control with my medication. And the arthritis…well, it’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing else, no. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was no trouble. I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in a long time. I try to stay healthy, I really do. I eat my vegetables. I just want to know why I can’t breathe when I lie down.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent hospitalizations. Gallbladder removed years ago. We'll need to do a physical exam, Ms. Vanderwiele. And likely some blood work and a chest X-ray. It could be a number of things, naturally. Let’s start with listening to your lungs and heart. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh. An X-ray? I suppose that’s necessary. Yes, alright. I’ll lie down. But I do hope it doesn't take too long. I have a library board meeting this afternoon. And I promised Mrs. Patterson I’d help her sort books. She's not very good with computers, you see.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your back, please. It won’t take long. Take a deep breath in…and out…Good. And again…Deep breath…and out…Hmm. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but regular. I hear some diminished breath sounds at the bases of both lungs. And yes, there is definite edema in your ankles. Now, sit up slowly. I’m going to check your neck veins.
PATIENT: Edema…that’s the swelling, isn’t it? Yes, my ankles are quite puffy. Everything feels so…complicated. I just want to know what’s wrong. Check my neck veins…very well. But please be quick, Doctor. I really must get back to the library. Mrs. Patterson is relying on me.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some jugular venous distension. Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. Based on your symptoms, the physical exam, and your history, it is highly suggestive of…well, it could be congestive heart failure. We need to rule out other causes, of course. We’ll need an EKG, a chest X-ray, and a complete blood count and chemistry panel. I’ll also order a BNP – that’s a blood test that helps assess heart function.
PATIENT: Congestive…what? Heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Is that why I can’t breathe when I lie down? And the swelling? I haven’t felt any chest pain…I just get tired easily. I don’t understand. What does all this mean, Doctor? And will I be able to go back to the library? Mrs. Patterson…she’ll be so disappointed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, please try to remain calm. “Congestive heart failure” doesn’t necessarily mean what you think it means. It simply means your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should be, which can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and body, leading to shortness of breath and swelling. The tests will help us determine the severity of the problem and the best course of treatment. We need to rule out other possibilities first. Until we have the results, it’s difficult to say definitively. As for the library… I cannot advise you to engage in strenuous activity until we know what we are dealing with. I understand you have commitments, but your health is the priority. Perhaps Mrs. Patterson can find another volunteer temporarily.
PATIENT: Another volunteer…? Mrs. Patterson relies on me. I’ve been helping her for years. She doesn’t understand computers, and the other volunteers…well, they aren’t as reliable. But…what if it’s something else? What if it’s not my heart? I really must get back to the library. And what about the tests? How long will they take? I have a luncheon next week, and I promised to bring my famous potato salad… This is all very upsetting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, with all due respect, your potato salad is not my primary concern at this moment. We need to focus on determining the cause of your symptoms. The tests should take approximately two to three business days, depending on the lab’s workload. In the meantime, I’m prescribing you a diuretic to help reduce the fluid buildup. This may alleviate some of your shortness of breath and swelling, but it's not a long-term solution. And, frankly, I recommend you temporarily excuse yourself from your volunteer work until we have a clearer picture of your health status. Follow the dosage instructions carefully. Now, do you have any other questions, or shall we proceed with the ordering of the tests?
PATIENT: A diuretic… That sounds…powerful. Are there any side effects? And what if it doesn't work? Will I have to…go to the hospital? I don't want to go to the hospital. No, I…I don't think I have any other questions right now. Just…please hurry with the tests. And…could you explain this diuretic again, slowly? I don't want to forget anything. .
DOCTOR: Alright. A diuretic, essentially, helps your kidneys remove excess fluid from your body. Common side effects include increased urination – obviously – and potential electrolyte imbalances, which is why we’ll be monitoring your blood work. As for hospitalization… it’s unlikely at this stage, but it's a possibility if your condition worsens. Let me reiterate: follow the dosage instructions precisely. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in three business days to discuss the results of the tests. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or confusion—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
