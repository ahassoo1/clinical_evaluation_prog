DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Deschane. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, this cough. Been botherin’ me for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Feels like somethin’ ticklin’ the back of my throat, but nothin’ comes up. Hard to explain. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. “A while now” is rather vague, Mr. Pavlovic. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Oh dear. It’s been… a good few months, I reckon. Maybe six? Longer? Time kinda… slips away these days. My wife, she… she always kept track of things. I miss that. But yeah, at least half a year, I think. It hasn't gotten worse, exactly, just… always there.
DOCTOR: Six months is… significant. And you said it’s a dry cough, no mucus production at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s right. Just dry. Sometimes it feels scratchy, like dust. Makes me wanna clear my throat, but nothin’ happens. It’s… bothersome, especially at night. Keeps me up sometimes. I just figured it was old age catchin’ up with me.
DOCTOR: "Old age" can certainly bring on changes, Mr. Pavlovic, but we should investigate nonetheless. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Accompanyin’ it… let me think. Now… I get a little short of breath sometimes, but I always figured that was from walkin’ up the stairs to my apartment. It's on the third floor, you see. And… well, I get tired easier than I used to, but I’m ninety years old! Isn’t that to be expected? I don't know if that's related to the cough or not.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I recall. No chills, either. Night sweats… hmm. I get warm sometimes, but I always just chalked that up to the blankets. As for weight loss… that’s a good question. I haven’t been weighin’ myself lately. My wife used to do that, but… well. I don’t know if I’ve lost weight, to be honest. My clothes still fit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she hated ‘em. Said they were a terrible habit. I listened to her, of course. Always did. Good woman, she was.
DOCTOR: Very good. And any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. My wife always asked when the doctor gave me somethin’ new, but… I can’t rightly recall ever havin’ an allergy. Nope. Clean bill of health in that department, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis. Doctor gave it to me a while back. A small white pill. Can't remember the name of it. It helps with the aches, but that's about it. And… sometimes I take a little something for my blood pressure, but only when it feels high. My wife… she used to manage all that. I just take what she tells me to.
DOCTOR: "Reports taking medication for arthritis, and 'something' for blood pressure, medication adherence unclear." We'll need to clarify those medications. Do you happen to have a list, or the bottles themselves, that we can review?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a good question. I... I don't think so. I usually just take 'em. My wife kept all the lists and bottles. After she... well, everything got a bit muddled. I'm not sure where she kept them. I'm afraid I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll have to work with what we have for now. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs, and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Then we’ll discuss some possible next steps. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. I'll try to relax. It's just… I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, if you don’t mind. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Deep breath in… and out… again… Okay. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but I do hear some mild wheezing on auscultation. Heart rate is 88 and regular. Blood pressure is 140/90. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. No edema. Now, could you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just a little wheezin’, huh? My wife used to say I always had a bit of a rattle in my chest when I had a cold. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: The wheezing is mild, but it warrants further investigation. Your throat is a bit dry, which could contribute to the cough. Given your age and the duration of the cough, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'm going to order a chest x-ray and a complete blood count. The x-ray will help us see if there’s anything going on in your lungs, and the blood count will check for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray, huh? Sounds a bit serious. But if you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I just… I don’t like hospitals much. Too many beeps and whistles. But if it’ll help figure out what’s wrong, then alright. Do what you need to do. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: The x-ray itself is painless, Mr. Pavlovic. You'll simply stand in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture of your chest. It’s very quick and non-invasive. We'll also need to draw a small sample of blood, which may cause a brief pinch. I’ll write the orders for both tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll schedule you for the x-ray as soon as possible. We'll review the results as soon as they come in and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… what if it’s somethin’ bad, Doctor? My wife… she always worried about things like that. But you'll let me know, right? You’ll tell me what's goin’ on?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. We will thoroughly review the results and discuss them with you in detail. It's important to remember that many things can cause a chronic cough, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. We’re simply taking these steps to rule out any potential problems and ensure you receive the appropriate care. I'll have the lab technician come in to draw your blood. They can answer any questions you have about the procedure. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulties with your veins?
PATIENT: Latex… no, I don't think so. Never had a problem with it. And my veins… well, they're a bit old, I suppose. Nurses always had a little trouble findin’ them. But they always managed eventually. I'm a bit of a prickly case, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. The technician should be here shortly. Once they've drawn your blood and you’ve had the x-ray, you can go home and rest. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Worse symptoms… go to the emergency room. Alright. Thank you. I appreciate you lookin’ into this. It's just… nice to have someone checkin’ on an old man.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. We’ll be in touch soon. The technician is here now.
PATIENT: .
