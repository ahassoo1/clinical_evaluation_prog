DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. It’s this fever, keeps comin’ back. Been a real nuisance, honestly. Feels like it flares up every other week or so. Don't know what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide, good to meet you too. A recurring fever, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, recurring. Like clockwork, almost. Not every week, but close. It’s not, like, a high fever, you know? More just...warm. Enough to make me feel tired and achy. It usually lasts a couple days, then goes away. Then it comes back. It's been goin' on for maybe two months now.
DOCTOR: Two months, alright. And you said tired and achy… anything else that comes with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a little bit of a headache, not a bad one, just… there. And I don't really have much of an appetite when it hits. Other than that… not much. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin’ like that. It's just… this feeling. And the warmth, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, no sniffles, just the fatigue, aches, headache, and loss of appetite with the fever. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Honestly, no. I haven't seen a pattern. Happens when I'm busy, happens when I'm relaxin'. Hot weather, cold weather… doesn't seem to matter. As for makin’ it better… just rest, usually. And drink plenty of water. It goes away on its own, eventually. That’s why I waited so long to come in, I guess. Figured it was just somethin' I'd shake off.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're taking care of yourself with rest and fluids. Since it's been going on for two months, though, it's a good idea to investigate a bit further, just to rule things out. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ major. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, that’s about it. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ like that. I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, Doc, but that's it. Just a small pill every mornin’. And I've always been pretty active, workin' as a chiropractor and all. It keeps me movin’, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the activity level. And you had your appendix removed as a child, and take medication for blood pressure. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill. I get it refilled at the pharmacy every month. Ugh, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I think it starts with an ‘A’… Amlodipine, maybe? Yeah, I think that's it. Amlodipine. Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that’s a common blood pressure medication. Thank you for remembering that. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take pretty much anythin’ without a problem. My wife always jokes I’m a human guinea pig. But seriously, I don’t think I’ve ever had an allergic reaction. She keeps an eye on me, though. She's a worrier, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had some trouble with his heart when he got older, needed a pacemaker. And my mother, she had arthritis, real bad. That kept her pretty stiff as she got older. And my sister… she has somethin’ with her thyroid, I think. But that’s about it, really. Not a whole lot of serious illness on either side of the family. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your mother, and a thyroid condition in your sister. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife and I might have a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that's about it. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. I need a clear head for my work, you know? Workin’ with people’s backs, gotta be focused. So, no, I keep pretty clean livin’, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about where you live and what your typical day looks like?
PATIENT: Sure. I live out in the country, a little ways from town. Quiet place, mostly farms around here. I have my own practice, been runnin’ it for over thirty years now. I see patients all day, adjustin’ backs, helpin’ people with their pain. It keeps me busy, but I enjoy it. I usually get home around six, have dinner with my wife, watch a little TV, then head to bed. Pretty simple life, but it’s a good one. It's gettin' harder though, the travel to and from patients, that's what's tiring me out. But I don't mind, really. I'll work as long as I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good sense of things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, check your reflexes, things like that. It will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, Doc. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I’m not worried, but I’m happy to let you take a look. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I've always been pretty sturdy, but old age is catchin' up to me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up there for me, that would be great. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common for your age, but nothing concerning. Blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72. Temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit. Your throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Overall, everything seems fairly normal on initial examination. However, the recurring fever is still concerning. I think we should get some blood work done, just to rule out any underlying infections or other issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible, Doc. Blood work is fine. Whatever it takes to figure out what's goin' on. I just wanna feel normal again, you know? I got patients dependin' on me. So yeah, let's do the blood work. When can we get that done? And will it take long? I got appointments scheduled for tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We'll get that done as quickly as possible. There's a lab right across the hall, and it usually doesn't take more than a few minutes. I’ll write you a requisition, and they'll take it from there. Here you go. They’ll need this at the front desk. The results should be back within 24-48 hours. I'll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, if your fever spikes, or if you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or a severe headache, please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. I'll take this to the front desk. And I'll keep an eye out for anythin' new. I appreciate you lookin' into this, and explainin' everything so clearly. It’s good to know someone’s payin’ attention. I think that’s all I need for now, right? I gotta get back to work, folks are waitin'.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clide. I’m glad I could help. And yes, that’s all for now. Just let me know if anything changes, and we’ll go from there. Get back to work, and take care of yourself.
