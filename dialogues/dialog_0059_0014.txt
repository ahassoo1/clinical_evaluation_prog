DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Uh… well, my wife, she said I should come. Something about… papers? For work, I think. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Something about needing time off… or maybe something else? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. It has to do with my job, I believe—religious activities and education, that's what I do.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s perfectly alright if things are a bit unclear. We can certainly sort through it together. So, if I understand correctly, your wife suggested this visit, potentially related to paperwork or accommodations for your work as a religious educator?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. She's very organized, my wife. I just… do the work. I think it has something to do with needing to take some time, but I honestly don’t recall why exactly. Is it… is it something serious? I feel alright, mostly. Just a little tired, maybe. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re feeling mostly alright. We’ll figure out what’s going on. It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Limtiaco, but it’s always best to understand the reason for needing time off, if that is indeed the case. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about what you do in your role as a religious educator?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I work with the church, mostly. Teaching, leading discussions… things like that. We have a lot of youth programs, so I spend a fair bit of time with the younger folks. And… organizing events, I suppose. Retreats, workshops… it’s a bit of everything, really. It's hard to explain. I've been doing it for… oh, goodness, I don't even remember how long anymore. A very long time. Is this helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It is very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Don't worry about rambling; you’re providing valuable information. So, you’ve been involved with the church for a long time, working with youth programs and organizing events. That sounds quite fulfilling. Now, has anything changed recently that prompted your wife to suggest this visit?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? That’s a good question. Now that you mention it… I have been feeling a bit more… forgetful, I suppose. Worse than usual, even. And… a little more tired, even after a good night’s sleep. But nothing major, really. Just… little things. I misplaced my glasses three times yesterday. And I forgot the name of one of the youth leaders, which was… embarrassing. It's probably just old age catching up with me, but my wife, she worries.
DOCTOR: It's good that your wife is attentive to these changes, Mr. Limtiaco. Increased forgetfulness and fatigue can be normal with age, but it’s important to investigate, especially if it’s a new or worsening symptom. To get a better understanding, let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, the doctor mentioned it years ago, but I take a little pill every day, and it seems to keep it under control. Nothing else, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. I eat okay, I try to walk when I can… Nothing serious, like diabetes or heart problems. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years back, but that's mostly gone now. Just a little ache sometimes, if I lift something heavy. But nothing that keeps me from working.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s good to know you’ve been generally healthy. And you take medication for your blood pressure, which is excellent. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, playing rugby when I was young. That’s about it, I think. No hospital stays recently, thankfully. Nothing major, like heart surgery or anything like that. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years. I've always been lucky, I suppose. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mother, she had some trouble with her heart in her later years. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had… something with his memory, I think. Not sure what exactly. My wife would know more about that, she keeps better track of these things. I know there was some cancer in the family somewhere, but I can’t recall whose it was. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to that side of the family. I wish I could be more helpful, but my memory is… well, you know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. You've provided valuable information. It's helpful to know about your mother's heart trouble and your uncle's memory issues. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I take that blood pressure pill every day, and I’ve never had any trouble with it. No allergies to pollen, dust, or anything like that either. I'm pretty lucky, I think. A simple man, with simple needs, that’s me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of doctors, if I'm honest, but I understand it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It will be a relatively quick and straightforward exam. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also check your reflexes and do a brief neurological assessment – just to assess your memory and coordination. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. First, let’s just take your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. Be gentle, please. My veins aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's a little elevated, but not significantly. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. Is everything alright so far, Doctor? I always get a little nervous during these exams. It reminds me of when I was a boy, and my mother would take me to the doctor for shots.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good so far, Mr. Limtiaco. Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Could you please lie flat on your back?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here I am, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I hope I'm not making this too difficult. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing perfectly fine, Mr. Limtiaco. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Here we go, Doctor. Just tap them, I suppose? I always feel a bit silly during this part.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, just to assess your memory and coordination, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions and have you perform a couple of tasks. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll do my best. Just be patient with me, okay? My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. Don't expect too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. No pressure at all. First, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… Is it… 2023? No, wait… Is it 2024? Oh dear. I'm so sorry, Doctor. I really should know this. Is it August already? I'm getting so confused.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It happens. Today is August 2, 2025. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Alright. Let me see… You said three words, right? What were they? Oh dear. I'm blanking. I'm so sorry, Doctor. My mind just isn't working properly today. Could you repeat the words, please?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The three words are "apple," "table," and "penny." Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… hmm… Penny… no, that's not right. Apple… table… something… Oh dear. I'm so sorry, Doctor. I just can't seem to remember them. Is this bad? My wife is going to be so concerned.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Don't worry. It's not a test to fail. Based on the physical exam and your responses, you are experiencing some difficulty with short-term recall and some diminished reflexes, which can be normal for your age, but given your concerns and recent memory issues, further investigation is warranted. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this. And I'd also like to recommend a cognitive screening test, which is a more comprehensive assessment of your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. If it will help figure out what's going on, I'm all for it. My wife will be relieved to hear you're taking this seriously. When can we do the blood work and the… cognitive screening test? And… is it going to be painful?
DOCTOR: The blood work is straightforward – just a small sample taken from your arm. It shouldn't be painful, just a quick pinch. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning at the lab down the street. As for the cognitive screening test, it's a series of questions and tasks, like the ones we just did, but more comprehensive. It will take about 30-45 minutes, and it's completely non-invasive. We can schedule that for later this week. How does Thursday afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Thursday afternoon sounds good, Doctor. That gives me a bit of time to prepare myself, I suppose. And yes, tomorrow morning for the blood work is fine too. Will I need to fast before the blood work? My wife always reminds me about fasting when I have tests done. She's very thorough, that one. And… will you explain the results to me when they come back? I always get so confused with medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 10-12 hours before the blood work – no food or drinks except water. And your wife is right to be thorough – it's always best to be prepared. And absolutely, I will explain the results to you in plain language – no medical jargon, I promise. We’ll go over everything together, and I’ll answer any questions you have. Before we finish, do you have any other concerns or questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, and I appreciate that. Just… thank you for taking the time to listen and figure out what’s going on. I'm glad I came. And please, don't hesitate to remind me of anything I need to do before the tests – my memory isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m glad you came as well. I will make sure to send a reminder with detailed instructions for both the blood work and the cognitive screening test. For now, I’ll have the nurse schedule those appointments for you. She’ll also provide you with a copy of your visit summary and instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate everything. .
