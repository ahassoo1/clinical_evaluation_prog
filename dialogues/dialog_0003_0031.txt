DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. I'm Dr. Yackey. Now, to be efficient, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, you see. And I have… a funny heartbeat sometimes. The doctor at home told me it was… atrial fibrillation, but I don’t really understand what that means. It’s just… my leg is big and it feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation… yes, I see a note here about that. Right. And this swelling… how long has your leg been swollen, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three days ago? It wasn't much at first, just a little puffiness. But yesterday it got much worse. It feels… tight, and a bit achy, if I move it too much. I haven't been able to wear my usual shoes.
DOCTOR: Three days… and it’s interfering with your footwear. Is there any redness or warmth to the leg, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t feel warm, and it doesn’t look red, not really. Just… big. And a bit uncomfortable, like I said. I tried putting my socks on this morning and they felt very tight. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Tight socks… indicative, perhaps. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness accompanying this… discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No chest pain, and I can breathe just fine. I haven't felt dizzy either. It's mostly just the leg being… well, a nuisance, really. I'm a teacher, and standing for long periods is… difficult with it like this. I do get a little tired easier, but I thought that was just the summer heat.
DOCTOR: A teacher… right. And this fatigue… is it new, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: It’s… a bit newer, I think. I mean, teaching is tiring, always. But I’ve felt more worn out this past week, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. It's been quite hot, and I haven't been sleeping as well. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: Sleep disturbances are always relevant. Now, let's have a quick look at your leg. If you could just extend it for me, please. I’ll need to palpate it and check a few pulses.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here you are. It’s probably best not to press too hard, if you don't mind. It is a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No significant tenderness to palpation, although there is some pitting edema present… approximately 3+ pitting edema to the lower tibia and ankle. Dorsalis pedis pulse is present, but slightly diminished compared to the contralateral extremity. Capillary refill is… acceptable, around 3 seconds. No significant discoloration or skin abnormalities noted. Alright. We need to rule out a deep vein thrombosis, given the swelling and diminished pulse. Has there been any history of blood clots in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood clots? I… don’t think so. My mother had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather had something with his heart, but I don’t remember the details. We didn’t talk about medical things much. Is a deep vein thrombosis… serious, Doctor? I feel rather anxious now.
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Kreckel. That’s why we need to investigate. Given your symptoms and the diminished pulse, we’ll need to order a D-dimer test and a venous ultrasound of your left leg. This will help us determine if there’s a clot present. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible and avoiding prolonged standing. We'll also need to discuss the atrial fibrillation further. Do you know what medications you are currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… complicated. Alright, I understand. Elevate my leg… yes, I can do that. I don't take any regular medications, Doctor. Not unless you count occasional paracetamol for headaches, but that's very rare. And I haven’t been taking anything recently, I promise. Will the tests… hurt? And how long will they take? I have classes to prepare for, you see.
DOCTOR: No, the tests themselves shouldn't be painful. The D-dimer is a simple blood draw. The ultrasound is non-invasive; a technician will simply apply a gel to your leg and use a probe to create images of the veins. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. I will write you a requisition for both. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or increased pain in your leg, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Emergency room if the pain gets worse. Blood test and… an image of my leg. 24 to 48 hours. I think I’ve got it. Will I need to come back to see you then, once the results are in? And… is there anything else I should be doing? Perhaps some sort of cream? Or… bandages?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to return for a follow-up appointment once the results are available. We'll discuss the findings and determine the appropriate course of action. No, I don’t recommend any creams or bandages at this time. Focus on elevating your leg and monitoring your symptoms. Given your age and the atrial fibrillation, I am also going to refer you to a cardiologist for a comprehensive evaluation. I will have the receptionist schedule that appointment for you. Any further questions, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh dear. That sounds… serious again. No, I… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just the leg, the tests, and seeing a… heart doctor. Thank you for your help. I suppose I’ll wait for the receptionist.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist will contact you to schedule the appointments. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen. .
