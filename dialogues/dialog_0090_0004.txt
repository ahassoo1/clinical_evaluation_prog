DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for my shots, like the nurse said. Routine stuff, I think. You know, keepin’ up with things.
DOCTOR: “Routine stuff,” alright. And the nurse sent you to me specifically for these… shots?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. She said I needed a few updated, and that you were the one to see about it. Something about… new recommendations this year? I don't really keep track of all that. She was very nice, though, explained everything pretty well. I just kinda nod and agree most of the time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: New recommendations… yes, there have been some changes. Let’s just clarify what exactly the nurse discussed. Do you recall which vaccinations she mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She said something about a booster… for tetanus, I think? And maybe… flu? I get a flu shot every year, so I figured that was it. Honestly, it was a bit of a blur, lots of medical words flyin’ around. She had a chart, and pointed to things... but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. According to the record, you received a tetanus booster five years ago, which means you are due. And a flu shot is always a good idea, especially coming up on flu season. However, the nurse also noted something about a pneumococcal vaccination… Do you know anything about that?
PATIENT: Pneumo… what now? No, that one doesn’t ring a bell at all. Is that… something new? I haven’t heard of that before. Is it important? I mostly just worry about the usual stuff - flu, tetanus… you know, things I get pricked for every so often.
DOCTOR: It is a recommendation for people your age, Ms. Fornes, especially with certain risk factors. It protects against pneumococcal disease, which can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and meningitis. It's not something you need every year, just a one-time booster, usually. However, given your lack of insurance and living in an urban area, it's something we should consider. Do you have any chronic health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. No, not really. I mean, I get a little achy sometimes, old age, you know? And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but nothing a doctor has ever needed to look at. I try to stay active, do a bit of gardening when the weather's nice. I mostly just try to keep busy. No serious illnesses, though, thankfully. Is this shot… expensive? I worry about costs, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, the pneumococcal vaccine can be costly. And given your health history – or rather, lack thereof – it's not strictly necessary. However, it is a good preventative measure. We can discuss options. First, let's do a quick exam. I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your vital signs, just to get a baseline. Then we can talk about the cost and whether it makes sense to proceed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Exam first, then talk about money. That makes sense. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. It's easy to get overwhelmed with all the medical talk. Let's get it over with, then. I've got some weeding to do this afternoon, gotta stay busy!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and then I’ll check your blood pressure. Just try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I always feel a little silly sitting here in just this paper gown. But, you know, gotta do what you gotta do. Go ahead when you’re ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… good. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Not bad. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, though I do detect some… mild wheezing on exhale. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath or coughing?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Oh, goodness. No, not really. I mean, I get a little winded when I’m doin’ a lot of gardening, bendin’ and stoopin’ and all. But I figured that was just from getting old! Maybe a little dust allergy sometimes, when I'm workin' in the dirt. Nothing major, I haven't needed to take any medicine for it or anything. It's just… old lady stuff, I guess. Is that somethin’ I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: “Old lady stuff,” alright. Mild wheezing isn’t typical, Ms. Fornes. It could be a sign of underlying… issues. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: COPD? No, never. Asthma, maybe as a little girl, I think my mama said somethin’ about it, but it was so long ago I don’t rightly remember. I just grew out of it, or somethin’. Honestly, Doctor, I've always been pretty healthy. I eat okay, try to stay active… mostly just ignore aches and pains and keep on keepin' on. Is this wheezin' somethin' serious? It’s makin’ me nervous now.
DOCTOR: Given your history – or lack thereof – and the mild wheezing, I'm going to recommend a simple spirometry test to assess your lung function. It’s a non-invasive breathing test that can help us determine if there's any underlying obstruction. And… I also recommend we hold off on any further vaccinations until we get the results of that test. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A breathing test… okay. I guess so. If it’ll tell us what’s goin’ on with my lungs, then yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Holdin' off on the shots is fine too, I don’t wanna put anythin’ in my system if somethin’ isn’t right. Will it… will it be uncomfortable? I don't like feelin' like I can't breathe, even a little bit.
DOCTOR: It’s not uncomfortable, Ms. Fornes. You simply breathe in and out through a mouthpiece. It takes about ten minutes. The technician will guide you through it. It's just a precautionary measure, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, ten minutes. I can handle ten minutes. Alright, let's get it over with then. Where do I go? And… will I get the results right away? I’m kinda anxious now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: The technician, Maria, is just down the hall in room three. She’ll explain everything. As for the results… it will take a few minutes for her to analyze the data. We can discuss them once I have them. Don’t worry too much, Ms. Fornes. We’re just being thorough. I'll have the nurse come get you when you're finished.
PATIENT: Okay, room three. Alright, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me. I’ll see you after the test, then. Hopefully it’s nothin’ too serious.
