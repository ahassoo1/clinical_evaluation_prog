DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine, good to see you. Though, at 85, one tends to forget these things, doesn't one?
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor. Though I assure you, my memory for details remains quite…intact. It’s the names that occasionally slip away. But I recall perfectly well signing in, and the rather comfortable chair in the waiting room. It's this diet I'm hoping you can help me recall the wisdom of avoiding. It seemed a good idea at the time, but…well, that’s why I’m here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Comfort isn’t always conducive to health, is it?
PATIENT: A perfectly reasonable observation, Doctor. Though, I suspect a little comfort now and again doesn't entirely undo a lifetime of…moderation. Or what was moderation, before I stumbled upon this…regime. Perhaps you'd best ask me what I've gotten myself into, rather than allowing me to ramble on about comfortable chairs?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get straight to it. So, Mr. Vantine, what exactly have you been doing that prompted a visit today?
PATIENT: It’s a…a rather drastic reduction in carbohydrates, Doctor. Inspired by one of those television programmes, you see. They called it the “Primal Reset.” The idea is to eat only what our ancestors supposedly ate – mostly meat, a few berries, and absolutely no starches. No bread, no potatoes, no rice…even fruit is limited. I thought it sounded…efficient. And for a short while, the weight did come off. But it’s…unsustainable, to say the least. And rather unpleasant, if I'm being honest. I feel…weak. And I suspect my digestive system is staging a full-scale rebellion.
DOCTOR: “Primal Reset,” you say. Right. And how long have you been on this…diet?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see…it began in early June, I believe. So, just over seven weeks, now. Seven weeks and three days, to be precise. I kept a log, you see. One must be methodical. Though the log now mostly contains complaints, rather than observations.
DOCTOR: Methodical, yes. And what specific symptoms are you experiencing now?
PATIENT: Well, the most…noticeable is a general lack of energy, Doctor. I used to enjoy a brisk walk in the garden, but now I find myself quite winded after a few paces. And, if I may be frank, my…digestive functions have become rather irregular. Let's just say there's a great deal of discomfort, and very little…output. And I’ve started having rather vivid dreams – disturbing dreams, filled with…potatoes. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but they’re quite unsettling. Also, my hands tremble a bit now. Not constantly, but enough to make sketching rather difficult. It's a hobby, you see. I’m a special effects artist, mostly animation these days, but sketching is essential for planning.
DOCTOR: Potatoes and trembling hands…Interesting. Any dizziness, nausea, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness… yes, occasionally. Not enough to fall, thankfully, but a sort of…light-headedness, particularly when I stand up quickly. Nausea, no, not really. Though I’ve lost my appetite somewhat, which I suspect is due to the lack of…variety. And as for my vision…well, now that you mention it, things do seem a little blurry at times. I attributed it to my age, mostly. But perhaps it’s connected to this…experiment. It’s rather difficult to tell, isn’t it? At one’s age, everything begins to feel connected to something.
DOCTOR: You mentioned being an artist, and sketching. Any muscle weakness or cramping in your hands, beyond the trembling?
PATIENT: That’s a very good question, Doctor. Yes, there is a stiffness, particularly in the mornings. And yes, cramping, too. Not severe, but enough to make holding a pencil for extended periods…uncomfortable. It began subtly, but it’s become more pronounced over the last week or so. I tried a few exercises, but they offer only temporary relief. It’s rather frustrating, you see. My hands are my livelihood, and now they seem to be…rebelling along with everything else. Perhaps it's a lack of…potassium? Is that what one gets from potatoes? Forgive my amateur speculation.
DOCTOR: Amateurs speculate. Doctors diagnose. Alright, Mr. Vantine. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. After that, we’ll run some bloodwork to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and blood sugar. It's likely this diet has thrown things off balance. Please sit back and relax. I'll need to examine your hands as well.
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. A methodical approach is precisely what’s required. Please do proceed. And thank you for not dismissing my amateur speculations entirely. I do apologize for rambling on; it's a habit. Please, do let me know if you need me to do anything specific. And I will endeavour to remain as relaxed as possible. Though, I must confess, the thought of bloodwork always does give me a slight tremor. But I will manage.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little on the low side, 110 over 65. Pulse is regular, but a bit slow at 68. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Now, can you close your eyes and follow my finger?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Following your finger. Is everything alright? I sometimes worry I'm not following instructions precisely enough. It's a rather strange sensation, relying entirely on your guidance.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now open your eyes. There’s some tenderness in the thenar eminence of both hands – that’s the fleshy part at the base of your thumb. Range of motion is slightly limited, and there is some mild muscle atrophy. This is consistent with…possible muscle weakness. Now, we’ll proceed with the bloodwork. We need to rule out any underlying deficiencies or imbalances. And, Mr. Vantine, I strongly advise you to discontinue this “Primal Reset” diet immediately. It’s clearly not agreeing with you.
PATIENT: Muscle atrophy… that doesn't sound encouraging. Quite right, Doctor. A most sensible recommendation. I had begun to suspect as much myself. The potatoes are quite appealing all of a sudden, actually. If you'll excuse the levity. I shall cease this…experiment immediately. And I trust the bloodwork will reveal the extent of the damage? I’m quite prepared for bad news, to be honest. It was a foolish endeavour, I concede. But thank you for your thorough examination. And please, do let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist you. Perhaps a detailed description of the television programme? Though, I suspect you’ve heard enough about potatoes for one day.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Vantine. No further details on the television program. We’ll get these blood results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to order a basic electrolyte replacement drink. And I recommend a bland diet—soups, crackers, something easy on the stomach. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and formulate a plan. And, Mr. Vantine, please, try not to worry. We'll get this sorted. We'll likely need to address any underlying nutritional deficiencies, and we may consider a referral to a physical therapist to help regain strength in your hands. But first, let's get these blood results back. A nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or other medical materials?
PATIENT: Very kind of you, Doctor. And no, thankfully, I have no allergies to latex or any other medical materials. A small mercy, I suppose. A nurse, you say? Excellent. I shall endeavour to remain as still as possible. And thank you for your reassurance. It’s…comforting to know there’s a plan. I must confess, I'm rather looking forward to a bowl of soup. And perhaps, a few crackers. Though, I'm still hesitant to mention the potatoes. It seems…inappropriate, at this juncture. But thank you again, Doctor. Your methodical approach is greatly appreciated. I trust the nurse will be along shortly?
DOCTOR: Yes, she should be with you momentarily. In the meantime, try to relax. And, Mr. Vantine, perhaps…avoid documentaries about paleolithic diets for the foreseeable future.
PATIENT: A most sensible suggestion, Doctor. I shall endeavour to heed your advice. Paleolithic diets shall remain firmly in the realm of television programmes. And thank you again for your…thoroughness. I shall await the arrival of the nurse. .
