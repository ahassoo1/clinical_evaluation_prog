DOCTOR: Hi Annelle, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s my… a patient of mine. He’s gotten quite yellow, you see. It’s rather concerning, and he has… trouble with his liver, I believe. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was. It's been a bit of a worry, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re concerned about a patient of yours who’s developed jaundice – that’s the yellowing you’re describing – and has a history of liver trouble. That is concerning, absolutely. Just to clarify, you mentioned a patient. Are you a healthcare professional yourself, or are you bringing in a family member or friend?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, that's right, the yellowing. I… I am a medical dosimetrist, dear. I work with radiation, planning treatments and such. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. But I noticed it at work, with one of my patients. It's been… a while since I've had to deal with something directly like this. I mostly work with the numbers now, not… the people, you see?
DOCTOR: Ah, a dosimetrist! That's very helpful to know. So you’ve noticed this change in one of your patients while at work. That makes perfect sense. And it’s completely understandable that it’s concerning, especially if it’s been a while since you’ve been directly involved in patient care. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this patient?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… his name is Mr. Abernathy. A kind man, really. He’s… older. Perhaps in his seventies? I’m terrible with ages, I truly am. He's been receiving radiation treatment for… something in his lung, I believe. It’s been going on for several months now. I’m afraid I don’t recall the specifics of his initial diagnosis, I mostly receive the treatment plans after everything is decided. It's… frustrating, to be honest, not knowing the full picture. But the yellowing… that just appeared last week, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Abernathy, in his seventies, receiving radiation for a lung issue for several months. And you noticed the jaundice develop about a week ago. That's very helpful. Has he mentioned any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He did mention feeling rather tired, more so than usual. And a bit of… discomfort in his stomach, I believe he said. Not pain, exactly, but… uneasy. And he’s been a little confused at times, which is unusual for him. He usually has a very sharp mind. But it’s difficult to say if that’s related, of course. He's an older gentleman, as I said. It's… hard to pinpoint things, with my memory being what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some abdominal discomfort, and increased confusion. Those are all things we definitely need to consider. And you're right to point out the age factor – it’s important to differentiate what might be a new symptom versus a baseline condition. Do you know if he's had any previous medical problems, surgeries, or if he takes any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… I truly wish I knew. I’ve asked, of course, but he’s not always very forthcoming. He tends to be a private man. And, as I said, I’m not his primary doctor, so I don’t have access to his records. He mentioned something about… an old heart condition, perhaps? Years ago. But I couldn’t get a clear answer. He does take some pills, yes, a small handful each morning. But I haven't the faintest idea what they are for. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re providing me with valuable information, Annelle. It’s perfectly alright – you’re not his doctor, and patients aren’t always forthcoming with details. The fact that he takes some pills and may have a history of heart trouble is helpful, even if vague. Alright. Given the jaundice, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and confusion, and considering his radiation treatment, we need to investigate this further. I'm going to need to examine him. Would you mind if I took his vital signs, listened to his heart and lungs, and felt his abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. He’s a good man, Mr. Abernathy. I just want to be certain he receives the best possible care. He's rather anxious, you see, about doctors and hospitals. I hope he won’t be too upset. Please, do whatever you need to do. I'm afraid I don't have much to offer beyond observation, but I will gladly assist in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, Annelle. I appreciate your concern. Let’s get started then. If you don't mind, could you please tell me his date of birth?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That… that’s a difficult one. I truly wish I remembered. He mentioned… a birthday in the spring, I believe. April or May, perhaps? But the year… I have absolutely no recollection. I apologize, Doctor. My memory is just dreadful. Perhaps his medical chart will have it? I feel so useless. It's been a rather long day.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Annelle, don’t apologize. These things happen. It’s not essential right now. We can often find the information we need through other means. Alright. Let's proceed. I'm going to ask him some questions, then I'll do a quick physical exam. It will be fairly straightforward. Just to confirm, he's currently undergoing radiation treatment for…what was the location again?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It was… in his chest, I believe. A lung issue, yes. But the specifics… I’m afraid I’m very fuzzy on the details. It was a while ago now, and I mostly deal with the numbers, not the diagnoses. It was a… a growth, perhaps? Or a… a spot? I truly wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It’s been a rather stressful period, with everything going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lung issue in the chest, potentially a growth or spot. That’s helpful, even if it’s not entirely specific. We’ll be able to get the details from his records. Alright. I’m going to ask him to come in now. I'll start with a quick history, then do the exam. Just to be clear, he is currently receiving treatment, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. He is. He attends the clinic several times a week for his radiation therapy. He's quite diligent about his appointments, thankfully. He’s a very… responsible man. I do hope he’s not too worried. He tends to… overthink things, you see. It’s best to be prepared, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said he’s been experiencing fatigue and abdominal discomfort in addition to the jaundice?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. The fatigue is… quite noticeable, more so than usual. And the discomfort in his stomach… he hasn’t specifically complained of pain, but he’s been… uneasy. And, of course, the yellowing of his skin. It appeared rather suddenly last week, I believe. It's rather alarming, to see such a change in him. I do hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a good starting point. Alright, Annelle. I’m going to call Mr. Abernathy in now. Once I've had a chance to speak with him and do an exam, we’ll have a better idea of what’s going on. I'll let you know what I find. “Mr. Abernathy?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate your attention to this matter. I do hope everything will be alright. It’s best to remain optimistic, I suppose.
