DOCTOR: Hi Margret, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. My chest feels tight sometimes, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble breathing and a whistling sound, along with some chest tightness. That sounds concerning, and we’ll definitely get to the bottom of it. First, can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… let me think. It began maybe… two weeks ago? At first, it was just when I walked up hills. I like to walk, you see. But then it started happening even when I am just sitting. Not all the time, but more often now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about two weeks ago with exertion – walking uphill – and has gradually gotten worse, now happening even at rest. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days are better than others. Today it is… not so good. I woke up feeling it right away. Usually, it gets worse if I… if I bend over. Or if it is cold. Cold air makes it very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, worse with bending over and cold air, and it’s particularly noticeable today. That's helpful information. Have you had a cough at all with this?
PATIENT: A cough? Not really. A little tickle in my throat sometimes, but no big cough. Just… this whistling sound. And the tight chest. I do get a bit… breathless, yes. Even walking to the shops is tiring now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant cough, just a tickle in the throat, whistling sound, chest tightness, and increasing breathlessness with activity. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems… no, not that I know of. I have always been very healthy, you see. I was a very active woman. I played netball for many years, and then I walked a lot. The doctor back home, in Bhutan, he always said my lungs were very strong. I did have a bad flu when I was young, but that was many years ago. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior diagnosis of asthma, bronchitis, or other lung conditions. A history of being very active and a single bout of the flu as a child. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes. A long time ago, when I was still living in Bhutan, I had my appendix removed. And… oh, I had a knee replacement, maybe ten years ago? It was bothering me, so I had it fixed. But that is all. Nothing with my chest or lungs.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a knee replacement – neither of those should be impacting your breathing. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… yes. I take a tablet for my blood pressure. The doctor said it was getting a little high. And… a small white tablet for my bones. Something about them getting weak. Oh, and sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knee, if it bothers me. That is all, I think. I can write it down for you, if you like?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, but if you're able to recall the names, that would be helpful. Otherwise, we can certainly look it up in our system. Knowing what you’re taking for blood pressure, bones, and for knee pain is important. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don't think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I eat shrimp, but it is not a serious allergy. Just a little itch. Nothing that needs a doctor. I can eat most things, you see. No problems there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies and a mild reaction to shrimp. That's good. Now, before we do a quick exam, I want to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems… in my family… let me think. My mother, she had a cough a lot when she was older. A dry cough. The doctor said it was just old age, you see. My brother, he smoked for many years, but I don't think he ever had any trouble breathing. No one else, that I know of. My father was very healthy, and my sisters were always strong. I don't think anyone had asthma or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had a dry cough in her later years, and your brother smoked, but no known family history of asthma or other significant lung disease. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement. I hope you can find out what is wrong. It worries me a little, you see. But I am sure you will help me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Margret. We’ll do our best to figure it out. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And another one… Okay, I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially as you exhale. That explains the whistling sound you’ve been describing. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that’s likely due to the difficulty breathing. Blood pressure is well-controlled with your medication. Your chest feels clear to the touch, no tenderness. I'm going to have you sit up a little more and I’ll listen to your back again.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I am sitting up now. It feels a little… strange, listening to my lungs. I can hear my heart beating, of course. I hope it is not too bad. This breathing… it is very tiring, you see. I get so out of breath, even just talking. I hope you can help me feel better soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, the wheezing is definitely more pronounced on the right side. Your breathing is a little faster now as well. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you might be experiencing a flare-up of asthma, even though you haven't been previously diagnosed. Sometimes asthma can develop later in life. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to make sure there isn’t anything else going on, like pneumonia or another lung condition. And I'd also like to do a spirometry test, which measures how much air you can breathe in and out, to confirm if this is asthma. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An X-ray and a… spirometry test? Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If it will help find out what is wrong, please go ahead. I trust you. What does the spirometry test involve? Will it hurt? I am a little worried about breathing into a machine, you see. It sounds… difficult. But I want to feel better, so I will do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Margret. The spirometry test is completely painless. You'll just be asked to take a few deep breaths into a mouthpiece connected to a machine. It measures how much air you can blow in and out, and how fast you can do it. It doesn't hurt at all, and it doesn’t require any special effort beyond breathing normally. We'll have a technician guide you through it step-by-step. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. The X-ray is also very quick and painless, just a brief exposure to radiation. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to give you a bronchodilator inhaler. This medication will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It’s a puff you inhale, and it should provide some immediate relief. I’ll also prescribe a short course of oral steroids to reduce inflammation in your lungs. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I am not allergic to any medications, Doctor. I told you, I have never had a bad reaction to anything. A puff and pills, you say? That sounds alright. Will the pills make me feel sleepy? I need to be able to walk to the shops, you see. I do my own cooking and cleaning. I like to be independent. But if it will help me breathe, I will take them. I trust your judgement. What are the side effects of these pills?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. The steroids can sometimes cause a little bit of sleepiness, but it’s not very common, and usually mild. They can also slightly increase your appetite and blood sugar, but again, usually not a significant issue for a short course. We'll start with a low dose to minimize any side effects. The most important thing is to get your breathing under control. I’m going to write you a prescription for the inhaler – it’s called Albuterol – and a short course of Prednisone, the steroid. I'll also give you a written handout with detailed instructions on how to use the inhaler and information about potential side effects. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few days to review the results of the X-ray and spirometry test and see how you’re responding to the treatment. In the meantime, if your breathing gets significantly worse, or if you develop a fever or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes sense. Albuterol and Prednisone. I will write it down, yes. And I will read the handout carefully. Follow-up in a few days. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I understand. Thank you very much, Doctor. You have been very kind and helpful. I feel a little better just knowing what is going on. I hope these pills will help me breathe easier.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. I’m glad I could help. It's important to remember that we're working together to get you feeling better. Here are your prescriptions and the handout. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I'll also send a note to the pharmacy to let them know to expect your prescriptions. We'll get you scheduled for that follow-up appointment right away. Do you have any preferences for days or times?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. I… Tuesday afternoon would be good, if possible. I have a friend who comes to visit on Mondays, and Wednesday mornings I do my grocery shopping. Tuesday afternoon is best. And thank you again for being so kind. I appreciate it very much. I will try not to worry.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me see… Tuesday afternoon works perfectly. I’ve scheduled you for 2:30 PM with me. You’ll get a reminder call a day or two before your appointment. Alright, Margret. I think that covers everything for today. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. We'll see you on Tuesday.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Maskal. You have been very helpful. I will see you on Tuesday. I will take care. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. Take care of yourself, and have a good rest of your day. Bye bye!
