DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day, so let's get straight to it. I want to… well, I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. I’m 51, not 80. I don’t want a complicated situation. I just want to know what I need to do to make sure everything goes smoothly, if that’s even possible.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "easy" isn’t usually a word I associate with any pregnancy, frankly. But we can certainly discuss what’s involved at your age. Fifty-one is a bit… later in life for a first pregnancy, and it does come with increased risks. First, let's get some background. Have you been trying for a while now?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not exactly. I’m not… actively trying. I just want to know if there's anything wrong with me that would prevent it. I’ve always been healthy. Good genes, you know? Hungarian stock. And frankly, I haven’t really… been with anyone regularly enough to have a reason to be trying. I just want to be proactive. Is that clear enough? I don't need a lecture about timing.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear, Ms. Shteynberg. Proactive is good. It's good you're thinking about this now. Okay, so you haven't been actively trying, but you'd like to assess your fertility potential. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a child, a very common thing, and a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s it. Otherwise, I’ve been perfectly fine. I told you, good genes. I don’t take any medications regularly. And I certainly don’t enjoy doctors, so I avoid them when possible. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: No major surgeries, no regular medications... good. That simplifies things a little. And I assure you, I'll be as efficient as possible. Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Hungarian cuisine is… robust. I've never had a reaction to anything. Not even penicillin. Really, I’m quite hardy. Look, are we going to get to the tests, or are we just going to keep going through this endless list? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ms. Shteynberg. It's just important to get a complete picture. But yes, we can move on to some initial assessments. Given your age and the fact you haven't been actively trying, I think it's prudent to start with some blood work. It will give us a baseline understanding of your hormone levels and overall health. I'll also want to check your blood pressure and weight – which I see here is 86kg, and your height is 186cm, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. Perfectly normal. I am a tall woman. And fine, blood work. But please tell me you have a competent lab technician. I don't want any mistakes. And how long will it take to get the results? Because frankly, if it's going to be weeks, it’s not worth the bother.
DOCTOR: Yes, we use a very reputable lab. You'll be in good hands. And the results usually take about 5-7 business days. We can expedite it if necessary, but there may be an additional cost. While we wait for those results, let's talk about your family history. Were there any complications with your mother’s pregnancies or any early miscarriages in the family?
PATIENT: Complications? My mother had… a difficult life, but she had three perfectly healthy children. No miscarriages, as far as I know. And my grandmother… well, she had a lot of children, and they all survived. Hungarian women are strong. I doubt there’s anything relevant there. Honestly, all this family history feels like a waste of time. Are you sure there isn’t a quicker way to just determine if my eggs are still… viable?
DOCTOR: It's not a waste of time, Ms. Shteynberg, but I understand your frustration. The family history helps us assess potential risks. And yes, there is a test to assess ovarian reserve – an AMH test, which we'll include with the blood work. It will give us an idea of the quantity of eggs you have remaining. However, it doesn't tell us anything about the quality of those eggs. We'd need further investigation for that. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any autoimmune conditions or had any issues with your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Autoimmune? Absolutely not. I am too… robust for autoimmune conditions. And my menstrual cycle… was always perfectly normal. Regular. Predictable. Never any problems. I am not someone who suffers from… delicate female issues. Honestly, I find all these questions rather… insulting. Are you implying something? I told you, I'm healthy. And frankly, my time is valuable. I need to know if this is even possible, and if it's going to be a long, complicated process, I'm not interested. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I assure you I am not implying anything. I am simply gathering information to provide you with the best possible care. Given your age and your desire to conceive, it's important to be realistic about the challenges involved. However, if you are not interested in a thorough evaluation, I respect your decision. I would recommend consulting with a reproductive endocrinologist. They specialize in fertility and can provide a more detailed assessment and discuss options like IVF. If you would like me to refer you, I am happy to do so. Otherwise, I wish you all the best.
