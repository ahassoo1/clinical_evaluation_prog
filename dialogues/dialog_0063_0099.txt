DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste any time, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Yes, let’s get right to it. I received a letter about some test results from an examination… something about my insides, I believe? I must admit, I wasn't entirely certain what it all meant, so I thought it best to come in and discuss it with you.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, these letters are often… needlessly complicated. “Something about your insides,” as you put it. Vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Indeed. I do apologize for my imprecise phrasing, Doctor. It was a gastrointestinal endoscopy, was it not? I recall it being… somewhat uncomfortable, though the staff were very kind. And the results, they indicated something wasn’t quite right, though I’m afraid the details slipped my mind the moment I left the facility. My memory isn't what it once was, despite what people say! Though, thankfully, I remember the date quite clearly: July 18th.
DOCTOR: July 18th… yes, I see the report here. An endoscopy. And you’re right to come in, though frankly, I wish more patients would simply read their summaries. Now, the report indicates… some mild inflammation. A common enough finding, truthfully. Tell me, Ms. Minatra, have you been experiencing any particular symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. Well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit… unsettled, I suppose. Not pain, exactly. More like a dull ache, now and then, in my stomach. And… a certain irregularity with my, ah, movements. I’ve also been rather tired lately, though that could simply be my age, I suspect. It’s difficult to say what’s connected and what isn’t, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Tiredness is hardly a medical marvel at your age, Ms. Minatra. As for the “ache” and “irregularity”… could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. The ache… it’s mostly in my upper abdomen, right below my ribs. It comes and goes, not constantly present. It’s not sharp, more of a pressure, a heavy feeling. As for the irregularity… well, sometimes it's difficult to… go, if you understand. And when I do go, it’s… not always formed, if you’ll excuse my frankness. It’s been going on for perhaps a month now, maybe a little longer. I haven't noticed any blood, thankfully. I do try to maintain a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, though I confess I do enjoy a sweet pastry now and then.
DOCTOR: Pastries. Of course. Look, Ms. Minatra, this isn't sounding particularly alarming. Likely just some dietary indiscretion, perhaps a touch of constipation. Though we should rule out anything more serious. I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Lie back on the examination table, please. We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust this won't be too… intrusive? I’m not a fan of medical examinations, if I'm being honest. Though I understand they are sometimes unavoidable. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Breathing normally, please. In… and out… Yes, sounds are present, though slightly diminished in the lower quadrants. Not unusual, given your… build. Tender to palpation here, on the left side. Not acutely painful, but… noticeable. And have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No nausea or vomiting, Doctor. Thankfully. And as for weight loss… I believe I may have lost a little, yes. Perhaps a kilo or two over the past few months, but I attributed it to the warmer weather. I tend to eat less when it’s hot. It’s not a dramatic loss, nothing to cause alarm, I thought. I’ve always been rather… slender, even when I was younger. Perhaps it’s simply the natural process of aging. Is that concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A kilo or two… “simply the natural process of aging.” Yes, well, everyone says that, don’t they?
PATIENT: Is it not, Doctor? What is it then? I confess, I am a rather anxious person by nature. I prefer to know what is going on, even if the news is not entirely pleasant. Avoiding the truth does not make it disappear, as my grandmother used to say. Perhaps you could explain what you suspect? Even a preliminary thought would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Minatra, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Given your age, your symptoms, and the endoscopy results, it could be a number of things. Irritable bowel syndrome is a possibility. Mild gastritis. A slight ulcer, perhaps. To be certain, we'd need to run some further tests. A stool sample to rule out infection. Blood work to check your iron levels and inflammation markers. And, frankly, a repeat endoscopy might be necessary. Though I suspect it won't be anything too serious. But we’ll need to rule everything out.
PATIENT: A stool sample… blood work… another endoscopy… It seems a great deal of bother, Doctor. But I understand. Better to be certain, as you say. I suppose I should ask… how long will all this take? And will the tests be… uncomfortable? I am not fond of… procedures, as you may have gathered. And what if it is something… serious? What are the possible treatments?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Minatra, one step at a time. The stool sample is… well, it’s a stool sample. Unpleasant, certainly, but hardly a medical ordeal. The blood work is just a prick of the needle. As for another endoscopy… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. And frankly, speculating on treatments before we even have a diagnosis is… unproductive. I will order the stool sample and blood work today. The lab results should be back in about a week. Then we’ll discuss our next steps. Is that satisfactory?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… satisfactory. A week, then. Very well. I will try to be patient. And… where do I go for the tests? Do I need to make an appointment? I wouldn't want to arrive and find myself waiting for hours. I’m not as nimble as I once was, you see.
DOCTOR: Here. All the information you need is on this slip. The lab is just down the street. You do need an appointment, so call ahead. Honestly, Ms. Minatra, I’ve explained everything quite clearly. I have other patients waiting, so I’m afraid we’re finished here. Please schedule a follow-up appointment for next week once you’ve received the results. Good day.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you… I suppose. I will call the lab and schedule an appointment. And I will be sure to schedule a follow-up visit. It seems a great deal of bother, for something that may be nothing at all. Good day to you as well, Doctor.
