DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it doesn’t feel right when I get to coughing. It’s been going on for a couple weeks now, I think. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: A couple weeks, okay. And you said it feels like your heart doesn’t feel right when you cough?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Not all the time, just when I cough hard. It feels…fluttery. Like a little bird trapped in my chest, maybe? Is that…does that make sense? It’s not painful, exactly, just…unsettling. I get short of breath too, after a good coughing fit.
DOCTOR: A little bird, okay. I understand. And has anything brought on this cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I can think of. No cold, no flu. I haven't been around anyone sick. It just…started. I’ve tried some cough drops, the cherry ones, but they don’t really do much. I used to make a tea with honey and lemon when I was younger, but I haven’t gotten around to it. It's been hot, you know? Don’t have much appetite for hot tea in this weather.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said no fever, no chills, no other symptoms aside from the cough and the…fluttery feeling?
PATIENT: No, that’s right. No fever. And no chills. I've been sleeping alright, though I do have to sit up a bit to breathe sometimes when I’m really coughing. And, well, my ankles are a bit swollen, but that's been happening for a while now. The doctor before, Dr. Ramirez, said it was my heart. I saw him for years, but he retired last year.
DOCTOR: Dr. Ramirez, yes. I see. And you said your ankles have been swollen for a while… roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started gradually, maybe six months ago? It comes and goes, you know? Some days they’re bigger than others. I wear these special stockings Dr. Ramirez had me get, compression stockings. They help a little, but not always. I usually put them on first thing in the morning.
DOCTOR: Compression stockings. Okay. And are you noticing any other changes in your body?
PATIENT: Well… I get tired easier than I used to. Even just walking to the mailbox. And I haven’t been eating much. Food just doesn’t taste the same anymore. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I don’t want to eat, just…not interested. I used to love making pupusas, but I haven’t felt up to it lately. That's unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay. We're getting a better picture here. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything besides the swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Dr. Ramirez said I have… congestive heart failure. That’s what he called it. He put me on some pills, water pills mostly, and another one for my heart. I take them every day. I think there was something else, too, but my memory isn’t what it used to be. I have a list at home, I’m sure of it. It's somewhere in the kitchen, I just can’t remember where.
DOCTOR: Congestive heart failure, okay. And you’re currently taking medication for that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take a little white pill, and a pink one. And sometimes a yellow one, when my feet get really swollen. I get them from the pharmacy every month. I have a grandson who helps me pick them up sometimes. He's a good boy. He makes sure I don't forget. What were we talking about again? Oh, the pills... yes, the pills.
DOCTOR: Right, the pills. And do you remember what those pills are for?
PATIENT: Hmm… Dr. Ramirez explained it all so carefully, but it’s been a few years. The white one, he said it was to help my heart beat better. And the pink one was for… the water? To get rid of the extra water. And the yellow one was… when I needed extra help with the water, I think. I know they’re important, that’s why I take them every day. I just don’t always remember the names. It’s embarrassing, I know.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Sadhu. It's not embarrassing at all. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been in the hospital for anything besides this?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! When I was younger, back in El Salvador, I had my appendix out. That was a long time ago. And when I came to this country, I had to have my gallbladder removed. That was maybe thirty years ago? Everything went okay, as far as I remember. No problems with either one. Just the usual soreness afterwards. I don't recall ever being in the hospital for anything else. Mostly just doctor’s visits.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family. My husband, God rest his soul, he passed away ten years ago. We had three children. Two daughters, they live in California now, and a son who lives nearby. They all have families of their own, grandchildren galore! As for… illnesses, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father, he had problems with his heart too. It runs in the family, I think. He was a strong man, but his heart just gave out. It’s scary.
DOCTOR: Okay. And did your father or mother have congestive heart failure, specifically?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I believe my father did. Yes, he was always tired, and his feet were swollen just like mine. He was in and out of the hospital a lot towards the end. My mother, she had high blood pressure, but I don't think it was the same. She was always very active, even when she was old. She used to say a little work never hurt anyone! She'd be telling me to get moving right now, I’m sure of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sadhu. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My mother always said smoking was a terrible habit. And my husband, he didn't approve of it either. I've always been careful with my health, as much as I can. I drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, just a glass. Nothing strong, usually a white wine. And I don't drink every night, just when I’m feeling up to it. I used to love to dance, but my knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Dr. Ramirez asked me that years ago, and I told him I hadn’t had any problems. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t care for beets, but that's a matter of taste, not an allergy! And I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. Do you want me to keep going? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Sadhu, that's alright. That was all very helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles, and take your blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. My knees aren't very good, as I mentioned. I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. And I’m hearing some… congestion in your lungs. And your heart sounds a bit… irregular. And your ankles are definitely swollen, with some pitting edema. Okay. So, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like your congestive heart failure is likely worsening. Your symptoms – the cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and the increased swelling – are all consistent with that. We’ll need to run some tests to confirm this, but I’m going to order an EKG, a chest X-ray, and some blood work – including a BNP to check your heart function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I figured something wasn’t right. I just hoped it wasn’t serious. The tests sound good. Whatever you think is best. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Besides taking my pills, of course. Should I be resting more? Eating less salt? I don't want to end up back in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sadhu, there are a few things. First, it's very important to limit your salt intake. Avoid processed foods, canned soups, and anything with added sodium. Second, you should weigh yourself every day, first thing in the morning, and let my office know if you gain more than two pounds in a day or five pounds in a week. That could be a sign of fluid retention. And yes, resting more is a good idea. Try to get at least eight hours of sleep, and avoid strenuous activity. And most importantly, if you experience any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No salt, weigh myself every day, rest more, and go to the emergency room if things get worse. No salt…that’s going to be hard, I love my pupusas! But I will try. I have my daughters’ numbers, they can help me. And I will definitely watch out for the shortness of breath. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. When will I hear about the tests?
DOCTOR: The lab should have the results within 24 to 48 hours. My office will call you with the results and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if anything changes, or you become more symptomatic, don’t hesitate to call. And Ms. Sadhu… I understand it's difficult to adjust your diet. We can talk to a nutritionist to help you find ways to enjoy your pupusas while still managing your condition. Do you think that would be helpful?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, that would be wonderful! A nutritionist… yes, please. I don't want to give up pupusas entirely, they're part of my life. It would be such a relief to know there’s a way to still enjoy them. Thank you so much. You’ve put my mind a little more at ease. I appreciate your patience with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. We'll get that referral scheduled for you. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. You've been very thorough. I just hope these tests aren’t too bad. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. And for the nutritionist. You've been a real comfort. I guess I'll head home now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest, Ms. Sadhu. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll get those test results to you as quickly as possible. And remember, no salt! Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will try my best.
