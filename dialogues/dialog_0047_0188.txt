DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Seconidi. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, it’s my… pee. It’s orange. I noticed it a few days ago. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Orange urine, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, orange. Like… not dark yellow, but actually orange. I drink water, normal amount I think. Maybe a little more now, because of it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long exactly has it been orange?
PATIENT: I think… maybe four, five days now? It started slow, then got more orange each day. I don’t remember anything different I ate or drank, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not burning, nothing like that. Just… the color. It is strange, you know? I feel okay otherwise. A little worried, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Do you have any history of kidney problems or liver issues?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I haven’t been to the doctor much, to be honest. Just for check-ups when I have to. My wife, she usually handles all of that. I don't know about… kidney or liver. Never been told I had problems.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t take pills. Just… sometimes a vitamin, when I remember. But not now. And no… herbal things, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you experiencing any changes in your stool color?
PATIENT: Changes in… my poop? Uh… no. I don’t think so. It is… normal. Brown, you know? Not anything different, no. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick examination. Let's start with your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm just going to feel around, see if anything feels unusual.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Is something wrong, Doctor? Is it serious? It is just my pee, right?
DOCTOR: Mr. Seconidi, I need to perform a physical exam before I can determine anything. Now, if you could just lie flat, please. I’m just checking for tenderness or any masses. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. A little hard, maybe, but not… painful. I sometimes feel full, but I eat a good amount, so maybe that. It’s okay, Doctor. Just a little… firm.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your flanks – the sides of your abdomen?
PATIENT: Flanks? You mean… here? No pain there either. A little… sensitive maybe, if you press hard. But I’m a big man, so maybe that too. Is it something bad, Doctor? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Seconidi, I’m still trying to assess the situation. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’m going to need a urine sample. There's a cup in the bathroom. Please collect a mid-stream sample and bring it back to me. And try not to dwell on things until we have the results. It could be something as simple as dehydration, although we’ll need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay. A pee sample. Right. Okay. I will go now. A mid-stream… you mean, not the first part? Just to be sure, Doctor? I don’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: Precisely. Not the first part. You start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream. It ensures a cleaner result. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please hurry.
PATIENT: Okay. Mid-stream. I understand. I will be quick, Doctor. Thank you. I hope it is nothing bad.
