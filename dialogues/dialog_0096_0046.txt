DOCTOR: Alright, Marialena, good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Burlingham. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been having this… pressure in my bladder. It’s not painful, exactly, just… a constant feeling like I need to go, even when I’ve just gone. It’s becoming quite bothersome, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a constant feeling of needing to go, even after you’ve emptied your bladder. Right. And how long exactly have you been experiencing this pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, around the middle of July. So, maybe three weeks now? It was very mild at first, just something I noticed occasionally. But it’s gradually gotten worse, becoming more frequent and… insistent, if that makes sense. I can usually hold it, but it's definitely on my mind a lot more than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, gradually worsening… Alright. And is this pressure constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, yes. It does seem to be a little worse in the afternoons and evenings, though. Like, I can get through the morning okay, but once I’m home from work, it’s more noticeable. And sometimes, if I drink a lot of fluids, it feels even more intense. But even when I haven't had much to drink, it’s still there, just… a lower level of pressure, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what kind of fluids are you typically drinking throughout the day, Marialena?
PATIENT: Mostly water, Doctor. I try to drink a good amount of water. I have a large bottle I refill throughout the day. Sometimes I’ll have a cup of herbal tea in the afternoon – chamomile, usually. Occasionally, a glass of juice with dinner, but not very often. I rarely drink soda, and I don’t drink alcohol very much at all, perhaps once a month with my husband.
DOCTOR: Water, chamomile tea, occasional juice… Good. So, you're not a big soda drinker, that's helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. The color seems normal, and the amount… well, it feels like a normal amount when I go. I haven’t noticed any blood, and it doesn’t smell different than usual. I know that sounds… strange, but I’ve been paying attention, trying to figure out what’s going on. It's just the feeling that's different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. That’s one thing I can say for sure. No pain, no burning, no discomfort at all during urination. It's truly just the pressure, like a fullness that doesn't go away, even after I’ve emptied my bladder. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I worry I'm just imagining things.
DOCTOR: Imagining things?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t want to take up your time if it’s nothing serious, Doctor. I just… I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, I suppose. And I don’t want to bother you with something that’s just… in my head. It just feels so real, though. And it's starting to disrupt things a bit, always needing to think about where the restroom is, and how far away it is. I apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: Marialena, it’s my job to listen to your concerns, and I assure you, you aren’t bothering me. It's good you came in. Now, let's move on to some other things. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this pressure?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or back pain at all. I haven’t felt sick in any way, other than this bladder issue. No nausea, no fatigue… just the pressure. It really is isolated to this one symptom. I feel perfectly healthy otherwise, which is why I question if I’m making too much of it. I just… want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. Everything seems pretty normal there, if you don’t mind me being so… blunt. No constipation, no diarrhea, nothing out of the ordinary. I’m sorry if this is a lot of questions. I’m just trying to recall everything accurately for you.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright. It's good you're being thorough. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily. Other than that… no, nothing else. No diabetes, no asthma, no allergies. I had a fairly uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery with my son, about five years ago. I don't recall any major illnesses or surgeries before that. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright, lisinopril for high blood pressure. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, just the lisinopril. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but it’s not a regular thing. I really try to get most of my nutrients from food. I don't take any herbal supplements or anything like that. I’m generally quite cautious about putting things into my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of bladder problems, kidney disease, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had frequent urinary tract infections when she was younger, but she hasn’t had one in many years. My grandmother, on my father's side, had some kidney problems later in life, but I don’t know the specifics. Other than that, I don’t recall anyone else in my family having significant bladder or kidney issues. I suppose that’s not much help. It’s difficult to recall details from so long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never smoked. My husband used to smoke, but he quit about ten years ago. He’s much healthier now. I'm quite adamant about not smoking myself, and I'm very pleased he made that decision for his health as well.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you typically consume in a week?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps one or two glasses of wine a month, with dinner. It's not a regular habit at all. I find I don’t really enjoy it that much. I prefer tea, honestly. Or just water.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long. Do you have any sensitivities to latex?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any latex sensitivities. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I’m happy to proceed with the exam whenever you’re ready. I appreciate you explaining everything beforehand. I always feel a bit more comfortable when I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. Okay… abdomen sounds normal. No tenderness to palpation. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you cross your legs and relax your feet?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'm ready whenever you are. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’ll try to stay as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright… reflexes are normal. No asymmetry. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam. I'll ask you to close your eyes and I'll test your sensation. Okay… sensation is intact. Everything appears normal neurologically as well. Now, I’d like to obtain a urine sample, if possible. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. It’s important to be a clean catch, if you can manage it. It will help us rule out a urinary tract infection.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A clean catch, I understand. I can definitely do that. Just let me know where the restroom is and I’ll do my best to provide a good sample. I always try to follow instructions carefully.
DOCTOR: It’s right over there. I’ll leave you a cup and instructions. Take your time. Once you’ve collected the sample, just leave it on the counter, and I’ll send it to the lab. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be back shortly. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure controlled, normal exam so far… but that persistent pressure… frustrating.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to follow the instructions as closely as possible. Hopefully, it’s a good sample. It wasn’t easy, I must admit. I’m a bit flustered, if you don’t mind. It’s just… always needing to go, even when I don’t. I apologize for rambling again. I just… want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. We’ll send this off to the lab. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out any other underlying issues. While we're waiting for the lab results, I recommend that you keep a bladder diary. Write down how much fluid you drink, how often you urinate, and the amount of urine you pass. It will help us get a better understanding of your bladder function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. A bladder diary sounds perfectly reasonable. I can definitely do that. It’s good to have something proactive to do while we wait for the results. I’m glad you’re being thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and investigate this. I’ll start the diary tonight. Are there any specific instructions about how detailed I should be? Or should I just write down the basics – time, fluid intake, and amount of urine?
DOCTOR: Just the basics will do for now. Time of urination, approximate amount of fluid you drank beforehand, and a rough estimate of the urine amount. We're just looking for patterns. If you notice any pain, burning, or urgency, definitely write that down as well. But otherwise, just the basics will be fine. While we await the results, I want to be upfront: your symptoms could be indicative of something more complex, like interstitial cystitis, but it’s too early to tell. We need to rule out simpler things first. It's likely, but not certain, that we’ll need to schedule a referral to a urologist if these symptoms persist after we receive the lab results. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Interstitial cystitis… I’ve heard of that, but I don’t know much about it. A referral to a urologist… yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. If that’s what’s necessary to get a proper diagnosis, then I’m happy to follow your recommendation. I understand it’s too early to jump to conclusions, and I appreciate your honesty. I just… want to understand what’s going on with my body, and get it resolved if possible. It's good to know you're thinking ahead and have a plan in place. So, to recap, I’ll keep a bladder diary, and we’ll wait for the lab results to come back. Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of at this time?
DOCTOR: No, that’s everything for now. Just keep the bladder diary, and try to relax. Stress can sometimes exacerbate these symptoms, so try to engage in activities that you enjoy. Here’s a copy of the lab orders and a template for the bladder diary. I’m also printing a summary of our conversation today for your records. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week, once the lab results are back. If you experience any fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place. I’ll start the bladder diary tonight and look forward to hearing from you next week. Thank you again for your time. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. You take care of yourself as well. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
