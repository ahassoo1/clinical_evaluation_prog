DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie, good morning. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. Hmm… what brought me in? It’s… the pee. Yes, the pee is hard. It doesn’t come easy, you know? Like pushing a rock. That’s what it feels like. Not always, but mostly. It's been… a little while now, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. “Pushing a rock,” hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! A little rock. Not a big rock, mind you. But enough to… bother a lady. And sometimes, after I do go, it doesn't all come out, you know? Like there’s still some left in there. It’s just… uncomfortable. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I do, Zoie. It sounds frustrating. So, this difficulty starting your urine stream, and feeling like you’re not emptying completely… How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s a hard one. It feels like… a few months, maybe? Or was it last year? My husband, he remembers things better. We’ve been married a long time, you know. A very long time. But I think… maybe six months? It's hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, not every single day.
DOCTOR: Alright, “a few months.” And does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. If I wait too long to go, it’s harder. Definitely harder. Like holding it makes it more stubborn. And… cold weather? I think the cold makes it worse too. But better… drinking lots of water, I think. That helps a little. Not a lot, just a little. Oh, and being warm! Warm water, warm room… that’s nice.
DOCTOR: Okay, waiting makes it worse, cold weather worse, warm water and being warm helps. Now, Zoie, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. Not a sharp pain. Sometimes it’s a little… achy, down low. Like a dull ache, not a hurting ache. And no burning, no. Just… hard to get going, you know? And not empty. That's the worst part, I think. Feeling like there's still some left in there. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or burning, just difficulty and incomplete emptying. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. I feel warm sometimes, but that's just the weather, you know? It's been hot! And chills… no, not really. And back pain… well, my back always aches a little. Old age, you know? But not any new back pain. No. Just the usual old lady aches. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's good to know. Now, Zoie, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything serious?
PATIENT: Oh dear… serious? Let me think… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. And… arthritis, in my hands mostly. And my blood pressure, the doctor says it’s a little high sometimes, but I take pills for it. That's about all I can remember, really. I went to a lot of doctors when I was younger, but… it's all a bit fuzzy now. I don’t really remember what they told me. My husband knows all that stuff, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and high blood pressure. And you take medication for the blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Little white pills. I take them every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes a little blue one if my pressure is really high, but not very often. My husband helps me keep track of them, mostly. It's hard to remember everything when you get old, you know. Lots of pills. Lots of appointments. It all gets mixed up. Do you need to know what kind of pills? I think they have numbers on them… but I can’t see very well anymore.
DOCTOR: We can look those numbers up later. For now, Zoie, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don't think so. I haven't had any bad reactions to any pills before, as far as I can remember. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just from the heat, you know? I get heat rash easily. No, I don't think I have any allergies. My husband always says I’m a tough old bird. He’s probably right. He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Zoie, let's do a quick physical exam. I just want to listen to your abdomen and do a pelvic exam, if you don’t mind. It will help me understand what’s going on a bit better. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam? At my age? Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. It’s been a long time since anyone… looked down there. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable. And… will my clothes be alright? I’m wearing a nice dress.
DOCTOR: We’ll do our best to keep you comfortable, Zoie. You can keep your dress on, we’ll just need you to lower it a bit. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let's listen to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright… I used to be more nimble, you know. It's hard to move like I used to. Just tell me if it’s going to be… unpleasant. I don’t want any surprises. And be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, just relax your abdomen for me. Alright, everything sounds normal here. Now, I'm going to do a quick external examination. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Hmm. I do feel some mild tenderness. Okay. That’s all for now. You can get dressed.
PATIENT: Oh, good. It wasn’t too bad. But… what did you find? What does “mild tenderness” mean? Is it serious? I don't like being poked and prodded, you know. It makes me nervous. Is it something I should worry about?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily something to panic about, Zoie. Mild tenderness can mean a number of things. It could just be some inflammation. However, given your difficulty with urination and the incomplete emptying, I want to run a few tests just to be safe. I’m going to order a urine analysis to check for infection, and a postvoid residual volume to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you go. Would you be able to come back in a few days so we can review the results?
PATIENT: Urine analysis… and what was the other thing? Post… something? Oh dear. More tests? I just want to be able to pee normally again, you know. Is it going to hurt? And… how long will it take? I have my bridge club on Thursdays. I promised I’d bring the cookies. And… will I need my husband to come with me? He’s better at remembering things.
DOCTOR: The postvoid residual volume is a simple test, Zoie. It just involves using a catheter to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. It doesn't usually hurt, you might feel a slight pressure. As for the urine analysis, that’s just a sample, no discomfort there. It shouldn’t take long, and you don't need your husband, but he’s welcome if he wants to come. The important thing is to get these tests done so we can figure out what’s going on. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in about a week. In the meantime, continue drinking plenty of water and try to empty your bladder completely each time you go. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Water… and empty… and the tests… and… a week? Alright. I'll try my best. But I’m not good at remembering things, you know. Can you write it down for me? All of it? The water, the emptying, and the tests? And the date for the appointment? Please? Just so I don't forget. And… will the nurse remind me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Here you go. It’s got everything listed: Drink 8 glasses of water a day, try to empty your bladder fully each time, and the date and time for your follow-up appointment. The nurse will also call you to remind you. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Eight glasses… yes, I can manage that. And… emptying… the nurse will remind me? That's good. I think I understand now. Well, I suppose I should be going. My husband is probably wondering where I am. Thank you again, Doctor Burlingham. You've been very patient with an old lady.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, take care, Zoie. And remember what we discussed. We'll see what the tests show. Next!
