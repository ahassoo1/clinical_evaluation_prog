DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, finding a specialist out here has been…difficult. I am here because my husband and I have been discussing…arrangements. For the future. We would like to have those…formalized. I believe you have forms for that? Advance directives, I think they are called. It’s simply a matter of putting things in writing, you understand. Before something…unexpected happens.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Marija. It’s very responsible of you and your husband to think ahead and plan for the future. We absolutely have those forms – advance directives, also sometimes called a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. Before we get to the paperwork, though, I always like to get a little bit of your medical history, just to have a complete picture. It helps me understand you better, even if it doesn’t seem directly related to this. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Medical history? Really, Doctor? With all due respect, I am perfectly healthy. I assure you, this is not about my health. It’s about ensuring my wishes are respected should…well, you understand. Still, I suppose a brief overview won’t hurt. I haven’t been seriously ill in decades, and I maintain a very…disciplined lifestyle. Though I fail to see its relevance.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija, and I apologize if I caused any offense. It’s standard practice, and honestly, it's more about having a complete record for legal clarity, as you said. Even a disciplined lifestyle doesn’t preclude the need for these documents to be as comprehensive as possible. Let's start with this: have you had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have always been very careful about avoiding hospitals. They are…unpleasant places, full of…germs. And frankly, the quality of care these days is…questionable. My grandmother always said a strong constitution and a healthy diet are the best medicine. And she lived to be ninety-five. So, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. Now, can we please get to the forms? This is rather taking up my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. No surgeries or hospitalizations, noted. And I completely understand your preference to avoid them. Let's move on then. What about any ongoing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or anything else you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you serious? I just told you I am perfectly healthy. Do I look like someone with ongoing medical conditions? I exercise regularly, I eat a balanced diet – mostly Moroccan cuisine, naturally – and I maintain a very active social life. I assure you, my health is not a concern. This is quite insulting, frankly. Are you suggesting I am not being truthful?
DOCTOR: Please, Marija, allow me to clarify. I am not questioning your health or your honesty in any way. I apologize if my questions are coming across that way. As I mentioned earlier, this is simply standard procedure to have a complete medical record. It’s about ensuring the forms are legally sound and comprehensive, and sometimes conditions that aren't immediately apparent can be relevant. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, sometimes there are underlying factors that are important to know. For example, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really? You’re grilling me like a common criminal. Fine. I have a slight sensitivity to certain pollens, during the spring. It causes…minor discomfort. But it is easily managed. I do not require medication. And I certainly do not consider it a “condition.” Is that sufficient? Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. Are these forms readily available or must I endure further interrogation?
DOCTOR: Pollen sensitivity, noted. Thank you for clarifying, Marija. And you are absolutely right, it’s a minor discomfort, and certainly not something to be concerned about. I assure you, we are almost finished with the preliminary questions. Just a few more to ensure everything is comprehensive. Do you currently take any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. I believe in natural remedies and a healthy lifestyle. I would never pollute my body with those…chemicals. I occasionally use argan oil for my skin, if that counts. But that is hardly a “medication,” Doctor. This is becoming quite ridiculous. I fail to see how any of this is relevant to simply formalizing my wishes. Now, please, can we get to the paperwork? I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No medications, noted. I understand your preference for natural remedies and a healthy lifestyle, Marija, and I respect that. Alright, let’s get to the paperwork then. As you mentioned, these are advance directives. We have a living will, which outlines your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment, and a durable power of attorney for healthcare, which designates someone to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Please take your time, and read them carefully. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help you through this process.
PATIENT: Finally. Honestly, the hoops one must jump through these days… This is…rather lengthy. And the language is…complicated. Is it necessary to use such…jargon? It’s difficult enough dealing with bureaucracy as it is.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija, the language can be quite complex. It’s designed to be legally precise, but I understand it can be overwhelming. Please don’t hesitate to ask me to explain anything that’s unclear. We can go through it section by section, and I’ll do my best to simplify the language. I am here to make sure you understand everything completely before you sign anything. Perhaps we can start with the first section, which outlines your general wishes regarding medical care?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is quite tedious. I haven't the patience for this. My husband, he usually handles these sorts of things. He has a…knack for paperwork. Perhaps I should simply return with him? He understands these legal…nuances far better than I do. It would save us both a great deal of time. And frankly, my luncheon is rapidly approaching. I am not accustomed to being kept waiting.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly reasonable, Marija. It’s always best to have someone involved who feels comfortable with these types of documents. If your husband would prefer to handle it, that is absolutely fine. We can reschedule an appointment for you and your husband at your convenience. In the meantime, if you happen to think of any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here is my card. I apologize for taking up your time, and I wish you a pleasant luncheon. We'll look forward to seeing you and your husband soon.
PATIENT: Very well. That will be sufficient. I appreciate you…indulging me. Though I must say, the entire process has been rather…inefficient. Good day, Doctor.
