DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Chest… hurts sometimes. And heart… feels funny. Like… beating too much. Blood pressure, they said, is high. Just want to fix it, quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Chest hurts sometimes” and “heart feels funny, beating too much.” And you mentioned your blood pressure is high – do you know what your most recent reading was, or where it was taken?
PATIENT: Don't know numbers. Nurse took it. At home, usually high. Why need numbers? Just fix it. I don't have time for… details. My wife, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: While I understand you're eager to get this resolved quickly, Mr. Sobkowicz, numbers are important. They help me understand how high your blood pressure is and whether it’s a concern that needs immediate attention, or if we can manage it with lifestyle changes and medication. It's not about wasting your time, it's about getting you the right treatment. But let's focus on the chest pain for now. Can you describe that pain?
PATIENT: Hmph. Okay, okay. Pain… like pressure. Heavy. Not… sharp. Sometimes when I walk uphill. Sometimes just… sitting. It goes away if I rest. Not always, though. It’s… annoying. More annoying than anything. Is that enough details for you?
DOCTOR: "Pressure, heavy, not sharp." It occurs when you walk uphill, and sometimes even when resting. And it doesn’t always go away with rest, correct?
PATIENT: Correct. Sometimes it just… stays. Like a weight. My wife keeps saying I need to slow down. Women. They always worry. Can we just get a pill for this? I don’t want a big fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I appreciate you wanting a quick solution, but jumping straight to a "pill" without a proper assessment isn't safe, or good medicine. We need to determine the cause of this chest pain before we consider any treatment. Have you ever had this type of pain before?
PATIENT: Maybe. Long time ago. Not remember. Old man, you know? Everything gets… fuzzy. Probably nothing. Just… old age. Don’t need to poke and prod too much, Doctor. Just… fix the heart. And the pressure. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Since your memory is unclear about previous episodes, and given your age and symptoms—chest pressure, especially with exertion—we need to rule out any serious heart problems. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to get an EKG done. That’s a simple test that checks your heart’s electrical activity. How does that sound?
PATIENT: EKG? More tests? Fine. Whatever. Just… make it quick. I have appointments. Important appointments. Don't want to be stuck here all day. Is that… uncomfortable? My wife said something about wires.
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple and painless test, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll place a few small stickers—electrodes—on your chest, arms, and legs. These connect to a machine that records your heart’s rhythm. It won't take long at all. Before we do that, let me quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Hurry up. Don't want to be here all day. And be gentle. Old bones, you know. Very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m listening now… Your heart rate is a bit fast, but regular. I can hear some mild crackles in your lungs on both sides, which could be due to a number of things – often just fluid buildup, especially with your age. Your breathing sounds somewhat labored, but not significantly. Blood pressure is 160 over 95. As expected, a bit elevated. Now, I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you set up for that EKG. Just relax.
PATIENT: Elevated? See? I told you. Just give me the pill. This is wasting my time. My wife is going to be upset I'm still here. I have to go. Really. Just… make it quick.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration, but as I said, simply prescribing medication without knowing the underlying cause could be dangerous. We need to rule out serious issues, like angina or a heart attack. The EKG will give us valuable information. While we wait for the nurse, let’s quickly go over your medical history. Do you have any other health problems, such as diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Cholesterol, maybe. Doctor said something once. Diabetes? No. I eat… okay. Not too much sugar. Wife makes me eat vegetables. Mostly okay. Don't remember details. Just old man problems. Tired, mostly. And this… chest thing. That's all. Is the nurse here yet? I want to go.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Tired, mostly," and this "chest thing." Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Maybe a little. Not much. I wear thick socks. Hard to tell. Wife says I should elevate my legs. She worries about everything. Is this going to take much longer? I have a very important lunch meeting. With… business people.
DOCTOR: Okay. Swelling in the ankles, a bit of fatigue, and this chest pressure... These symptoms, combined with your elevated blood pressure, are concerning enough that I want to be thorough. The nurse should be here any moment with the equipment for the EKG. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Penicillin, maybe? When I was young. Long time ago. Made me itchy. Not sure. Just… itchy. Don’t remember. So many years. Just get this over with. I need to go. I really, really need to go. This is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Penicillin allergy noted. Nurse, if you could please get Mr. Sobkowicz set up for an EKG, and let me know as soon as it’s ready. Mr. Sobkowicz, I know you’re eager to leave, and I appreciate your patience. This test will help us determine the best course of action, so we can get you back to your important meeting as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be quick about it. And be gentle. Old skin. Very fragile. Hurry up.
