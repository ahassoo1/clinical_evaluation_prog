DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Albino. My back… it hurts. Lower part, mostly. Been hurting for a little while now, getting worse, you see? Feels…old, if that makes sense. Like it's just wearing out.
DOCTOR: "Wearing out," alright. And how long exactly has it been hurting, Albino?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Not bad at first. Just a little ache after I’d been standing a long time, you know? Now it’s… almost always there. Even when I’m sitting. It's been getting worse the last month or so, for sure. I don't remember doing anything to cause it. Just… started.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening, worse recently… and you haven’t had any specific injury or event that you can recall that triggered it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing I can think of. I'm not a young man, but I haven’t fallen or lifted anything too heavy lately. I used to… I did a lot of walking, for my job, raising money. But that was a few years back. Now I mostly sit at my desk, making calls. I don't know if that makes it worse, you think? Sitting all day?
DOCTOR: It can contribute, yes. Prolonged sitting isn’t ideal. Okay, and on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you rate your back pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now? Hmm… it's not the worst it’s been, but it's definitely there. I'd say… a six? Maybe a seven on a bad day. It's a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels like a sharp stab if I bend over too quick. It's just…constant, you know? A six feels right. Does that help?
DOCTOR: A six to seven, with sharp stabs upon bending. Constant ache. Alright. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes, if I lie down flat for a little while, it eases up a bit. Not gone, but not as bad. Warm baths help too. Not a miracle cure, but they take the edge off. Standing still doesn’t help much, and like I said, bending makes it worse. And sitting… sitting is just… there. It doesn't get better, just stays the same. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Lying down and warm baths provide some relief. Alright, Mr. Vankampen. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not a fan of pain, if you haven’t noticed! But I want to find out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to have you stand here for a moment, and I’ll observe your posture and how you move. Then, I’ll have you lie down on the examination table. Can you tell me if you have any difficulty with balance or walking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no trouble with balance. I walk normally, I think. Maybe a little slower than I used to, but that's just… getting old. And I haven’t fallen or anything. I can stand just fine. I can show you, if you want? Just let me know what you need me to do. I'm a bit worried, to be honest, if I'm being truthful. Is it something serious, you think?
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Mr. Vankampen. We’ll get some information first. Please stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Now, I’d like you to bend forward slowly and touch your toes, if you’re able. Just go as far as you comfortably can. I’m watching your range of motion. Alright. Not bad range of motion, but visibly some discomfort with flexion. And you’re guarding slightly. Now, can you bend backward as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not easy. It's tight. And like you said, it hurts. Not terrible, but I can feel it. Just a sharp pull in my lower back. Backwards is… even worse. I can’t go very far at all. It feels like something is… blocking me. Really tight. I don’t think I’ve bent backwards that far in years. Oh dear. This isn't good, is it?
DOCTOR: Limited forward and backward flexion, guarding with movement. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, now if you'll lie down on your stomach on the examination table, please. We'll assess your spinal tenderness. I'm going to palpate your lower back to check for areas of pain. Just let me know if anything is particularly tender.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. I'm a bit nervous now, if you don’t mind me saying. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, and this is… a bit frightening. I hope it’s not something too serious. Go ahead, when you're ready. I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay… there’s some muscle spasm present, as expected. And tenderness… yes, there’s localized tenderness at L4-L5. And a bit of tenderness along the facet joints. Hmm. No obvious step-off deformity. Now, I’m going to perform the straight leg raise test. Can you let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg as I lift your leg?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… tender, yes. Right there. Feels… sore, like a bruise, almost. And… yes, that spot. Feels a bit pinched. Straight leg raise? What does that do? Is that going to hurt? I'm a bit worried about my legs. They feel okay now, but… I don't want anything to go wrong. Just tell me what to expect, please, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It assesses for nerve compression, Mr. Vankampen. I'm simply lifting your leg to see if it reproduces any pain down the sciatic nerve. Just relax your leg, and I’ll do the lifting. Alright… How about now?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Yes! That’s… shooting pain. Down my left leg. Not all the way to my foot, but down the back of my thigh. And… a bit of tingling in my calf. Stop! Please stop, Doctor. That’s… not good, is it? It feels like… electricity. That's definitely not good. This is what I was worried about. Is it a pinched nerve? Tell me, please. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just lie still. Yes, that’s a positive straight leg raise test, indicative of potential sciatic nerve compression. It seems we’re dealing with more than just a simple muscle strain, Mr. Vankampen. Given your symptoms – lower back pain, radiating pain down your leg, tingling, and a positive straight leg raise – it's highly likely you have a lumbar radiculopathy, likely caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis compressing a nerve root. We'll need imaging to confirm. I’m ordering an MRI of your lumbar spine. I’ll also refer you to Dr. Ramirez, a specialist in spinal care. He’ll review the MRI results and discuss treatment options with you, which may include physical therapy, injections, or, in some cases, surgery. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: MRI… surgery… oh dear. That sounds… serious. A herniated disc? Is that… is that dangerous? Will I be able to walk? And what about the pain? Will it just… keep hurting? I… I don't know what to ask. It's all a bit overwhelming. I just… I want to be able to walk normally again. And I don’t want to be in pain all the time. I don't know what I did to deserve this. And what does this specialist do, exactly? Will he… poke and prod a lot? I'm a bit worried about that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vankampen, let's take this one step at a time. A herniated disc isn’t necessarily dangerous, but it can cause significant pain and nerve compression. It’s a common condition, and many people recover fully with conservative treatment. As for walking, the goal is absolutely to restore your normal function. The MRI will help us determine the severity of the problem and guide treatment. Dr. Ramirez is a spinal care specialist. He'll review your MRI, examine you thoroughly, and discuss all your options. He will not simply “poke and prod,” but will conduct a focused neurological examination to assess your nerve function and pain levels. He'll explain everything in detail and answer all your questions. I’m going to prescribe you a short course of muscle relaxants and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory to help manage the pain and inflammation while you wait for your MRI appointment. I’ll also give you a referral to physical therapy – gentle exercises can help support your spine and improve your function. And, of course, I’ll ensure Dr. Ramirez has all my notes and findings. Does that sound… more manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does sound… better. Muscle relaxants and physical therapy… that sounds… less scary. And knowing Dr. Ramirez will have all your notes… that's good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. So, what do I do about the MRI? Where do I go? And how long will it take to get an appointment? And… will it hurt? I’m a bit claustrophobic, you see. Small spaces… they make me nervous. Is it a big machine? Oh dear… this is a lot to take in. I'm just… worried. But thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. You've helped me feel a little… less scared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. The MRI will be scheduled through the imaging center at St. Luke’s Hospital – I’m sending the order electronically now. They will contact you to schedule an appointment – it usually takes about a week, but I’ll ask them to prioritize it given your discomfort. As for your claustrophobia, the MRI machine is a large, enclosed tube. However, they can provide you with noise-canceling headphones and an open MRI option, if available. I'm also happy to write a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you relax during the scan. Here’s a pamphlet with information about the MRI procedure and tips for managing anxiety. I’m also sending you a referral for physical therapy with Sarah Miller. She’s excellent and specializes in helping patients with lower back pain. And, again, I'll ensure Dr. Ramirez has all my notes and findings before your appointment. Do you have any further questions at this time, Mr. Vankampen?
PATIENT: Open MRI… I'll ask about that. And the anti-anxiety medication… that sounds… helpful. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that's all for now. I'm just… overwhelmed, to be honest. I'll try to stay positive. And I'll contact Sarah Miller and see about an appointment. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. You've been very patient with me. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I'll let you know if I have any questions. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Follow up with Dr. Ramirez's office and Sarah Miller. And don't hesitate to contact my office if anything changes or you have further concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Vankampen.
