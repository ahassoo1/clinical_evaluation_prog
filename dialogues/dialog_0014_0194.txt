DOCTOR: Hello, Terasa. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain. My hearing keeps going, then coming back. And I get really dizzy with it. It’s happened a few times now. My family… someone else had something like this, I think. It was my husband, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. So, the hearing loss comes and goes, and it’s associated with dizziness. You said your husband maybe had something similar?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. He… he was a strong man, my husband. But he did have some troubles with his ears, I remember that much. Whether it was exactly like this, I couldn't say for sure. It was a long time ago, and… well, things aren't always clear in my head these days. I just know it’s in the family somewhere. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It… vaguely. Family history is helpful, but we need specifics if we can get them. Let’s try to focus on you right now. When did this start happening, Terasa?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When did it start… That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a few months, maybe? Hard to say exactly. It doesn't happen all the time, you see. Sometimes weeks go by and I’m fine, then suddenly… whoosh. It’s gone. And then it comes back just as quick. Is that helpful? I wish I could give you a proper date.
DOCTOR: Vague is… fine, I suppose. So a few months of intermittent episodes. Does anything trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, no. I just… feel fine, and then suddenly I don’t. It doesn't seem to be linked to anything I’m doing. I haven't changed anything in my routine, and I certainly haven’t been doing anything strenuous. Maybe it’s the weather? Though, it’s happened on all sorts of days. Oh dear, I really wish I knew. It's frustrating, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when your hearing goes, is it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… I think it's usually just the right ear. Yes, I’m pretty sure it's the right one. It feels… muffled, like someone turned the volume down low. And then the dizziness comes with it. Not a spinning dizziness, more like… everything is wobbly. Do you understand? It's hard to explain the feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, right ear hearing loss and a sensation of wobbliness. Do you experience any ringing in your ears, Terasa?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Now that you mention it… sometimes. It’s not constant, and it’s not very loud. Just a faint… shhh sound. Mostly when everything is quiet. I just thought it was the house settling, to be honest. Is that… is that what you mean by ringing? It’s very subtle.
DOCTOR: Right. Subtle tinnitus is not uncommon. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any trouble with your balance even when you aren't having these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really, no. I’m not the steadiest person, I’ve always been a bit clumsy, but I haven't fallen or anything. I can walk normally, and I don't feel unsteady on my feet. It's mostly just when the hearing goes that I feel off-balance. Does that make sense? I'm trying to remember everything, and it's… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any headaches, nausea, or vomiting along with these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. No headaches, no sickness. Just the hearing loss and the wobbliness. It's… a strange feeling, but not painful, you know? It doesn’t hurt, it’s just… unsettling. I can still see fine, and I haven’t had any trouble with my vision. It's mostly just my ear playing up, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. No other symptoms. Let's do a quick exam of your ears. Could you sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I hope I'm not a bother. It’s just… I really want to get to the bottom of this. It's been worrying me quite a bit, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your ear canals look clear. The eardrum itself looks… a bit dull on the right side. It's subtle, but there is some fluid behind the eardrum. It's not a large amount, but it’s there. Now, I’m going to do a quick tuning fork test. Okay, the Rinne test is normal on the left, but slightly diminished on the right. And the Weber test lateralizes to the right ear. Alright, that gives us a little more information.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Dull and diminished… is that bad? I don’t understand all the medical terms, you see. Is it something serious? And what does “lateralizes” mean? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, but it’s all a bit frightening when I don’t know what’s going on. I just want to be able to hear properly again.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to ask questions. “Lateralizes” just means the sound seems louder in one ear than the other. And the dullness and diminished response suggest there's fluid in the middle ear on the right side, which is likely causing the hearing loss. It could be a number of things. Most likely, it’s a simple fluid buildup, possibly from a mild ear infection or Eustachian tube dysfunction. But it could be something else, and it's best to rule those things out. I'm going to order a tympanometry test and an audiogram. That will give us a better picture of what’s going on inside your ear and how significant the hearing loss is. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A tympa… and an audio… test. Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get it sorted out, you see. Is it a painful test? And how long will it take? I have a little bit of a appointment later today, so I’m a bit worried about the time. Not that it’s important, it's just...I like to know these things.
DOCTOR: Neither test is painful. Tympanometry just measures the movement of your eardrum; it’s quick, only a few seconds per ear. The audiogram, or hearing test, involves wearing headphones and listening to tones at different pitches and volumes; that will take a bit longer, maybe 30-45 minutes. The results will be available later today, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. I'm sending a referral to the audiology department now. They'll contact you to schedule the tests. Do you have any allergies or take any medications I should be aware of before I finish up?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I used to be allergic to something as a child, but I’ve forgotten what it was. As for medications… oh dear. Let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. That’s it, I think. Just those two things. Nothing else. I really wish my memory was better. It’s a nuisance, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. Alright, Terasa, I've sent the referral for the hearing tests, and we'll get a clearer picture of what’s going on soon. I’m not overly concerned at this point, but we want to rule out anything serious. In the meantime, try to avoid loud noises if possible, and let me know if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief to hear you aren’t too worried, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a bit calmer now. Thank you for your time. I appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness. I’ll try to avoid loud noises, and I’ll let you know if anything changes. Hopefully, it's just a simple thing, and I’ll be back to hearing properly soon. Thank you again, Doctor. .
