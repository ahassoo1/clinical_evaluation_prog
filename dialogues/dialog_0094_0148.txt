DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain. It’s about… pain. Down there. In… the groin, I suppose. It's been… troubling me. I don’t recall exactly when it started, to be honest. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain in the groin area. I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint when things started, that’s perfectly alright. Let’s try to get a better understanding of it. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe it… It’s… not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, most of the time. But sometimes, it gets… heavier. Like a weight. And it… radiates, I think is the word? It goes down… into my leg, a little. Not constantly, though. It comes and goes. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Noelani, thank you. Dull ache, with a heavier feeling at times, radiating down your leg. That gives me a good starting point. When you say it radiates, could you tell me where in your leg specifically?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specifics… that is difficult. It’s… the whole leg, almost. But more on the… inner thigh, I think? From the… you know, right here down to the knee. But not always the knee. Sometimes just the… upper part of the thigh. It’s… hard to say, really. It’s not a consistent pain, you see. It moves around a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s a somewhat diffuse pain, varying in location and intensity. That’s very good information. Now, does anything specific seem to trigger the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger… Hmm. Well, if I stand for too long, it gets worse. Definitely. And… lifting things. Heavy things, of course. But even… moderately heavy things sometimes. It’s embarrassing to admit, but even bending over quickly can bring it on. And… and this might sound silly… but sometimes if I’m… constipated. Yes. That makes it worse too.
DOCTOR: That's not silly at all, Noelani, thank you for sharing that. Constipation can absolutely contribute to pelvic and groin pain. Standing, lifting, and bending – those are all helpful clues. And does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Lying down helps. Definitely. And… a warm bath. That takes the edge off. And… If I’m really uncomfortable, a little bit of… well, a little bit of rubbing… down there. It's… a temporary relief, of course. But it helps a bit. I hope that’s not… inappropriate to say.
DOCTOR: Not at all inappropriate, Noelani. It’s important for me to understand what helps you feel better. Lying down, a warm bath, and gentle massage – those all sound reasonable. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any pain with urination, or any changes in your bowel habits other than the constipation you mentioned?
PATIENT: Urination… No, I don’t think so. No pain with that. Although… It feels like I have to go more often, perhaps? But I’m not sure if that’s just… getting older. And with the bowel habits… just the constipation, really. It’s… not a recent thing, either. It’s been going on for… a while. I forget how long, precisely.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent urination, but no pain, and ongoing constipation. And you mentioned you’ve been experiencing this for quite some time. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical… Oh dear. That’s… a long list, I think. I had… pneumonia, years ago. And… arthritis, in my hands. But nothing major. I don't recall any surgeries, thankfully. And… and I had a hysterectomy, many years ago. Perhaps… twenty years ago? I don’t remember the specifics, to be honest. It was… a difficult time.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia, arthritis, and a hysterectomy about twenty years ago. Thank you for sharing that. Do you happen to remember the reason for the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The reason… it was… fibroids, I believe. Yes, fibroids. Very large fibroids. The doctor said they were… causing a lot of bleeding. And… discomfort. It was… a necessary thing, I suppose. But I don’t recall the details. It was a long time ago. And… it was a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy for fibroids about twenty years ago. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve taken… many medications over the years, for the arthritis and… other things. And I haven’t had any reactions. I eat… everything, really. I’m not a picky eater. No allergies that I know of, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just for the arthritis. Ibuprofen, mostly. And… sometimes naproxen, if the ibuprofen isn’t enough. And… a little bit of something for… sleep. Just when I can’t sleep, you see. It’s not every night. Just… occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen, naproxen, and melatonin. That’s good to know. And, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. My mother… she had arthritis, like me. And… she had some heart problems, later in life. And my father… he had… diabetes, I think. But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago. And… they both lived to be quite old, thankfully. No… no major illnesses that I recall. It’s a bit of a blur, to be honest. I wasn’t very close to my family, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis, heart problems, and diabetes. That gives me a better picture. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen, and then I'll gently feel around to check for any tenderness. We'll also check your range of motion and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. A physical exam… I… I hope it won't be too unpleasant. I don't like being touched… very much. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes. Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your hesitation, and I will explain everything as I go. We’ll take things at your pace. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. If you could lie down on your back, that would be great. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Okay… Your bowel sounds are present, and I don’t hear anything unusual at this point. I’m gently pressing on your abdomen now. Are you feeling any tenderness anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Oh… Yes… there. Right there. It’s… not a sharp pain, but… it’s uncomfortable. And… a little bit to the left side.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m gently checking your hip range of motion now… and your legs… Anything painful with these movements?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. When you bend my leg that way… That’s a little uncomfortable. Not… excruciating, but… definitely uncomfortable. And when you rotate it… yes. A little bit of pain there as well. It's… a dull ache, like everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, and I’m just checking your reflexes and sensation now… Everything seems to be intact there. Okay, Noelani. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing chronic pelvic pain, potentially related to muscle strain, nerve irritation, or possibly some residual discomfort from the hysterectomy. The pain radiating down your leg could be due to referred pain or some involvement of the sciatic nerve. It’s important to rule out other causes, however. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of inflammation or infection. I also recommend a pelvic ultrasound to get a better look at the structures in your pelvis and rule out any masses or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds alright. A blood count and… an ultrasound. Will the ultrasound… will it be uncomfortable? I don't like things… near that area. But… if it’s necessary, then yes. Please… just be gentle. And… tell me the results, please? I… I worry a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I understand your concerns. The ultrasound will be non-invasive. A technician will apply a gel to your lower abdomen and use a handheld device to create images of your pelvic organs. It shouldn't be painful, although you may feel some pressure. I will be sure to request that the technician be as gentle as possible. I will personally review the results with you as soon as they are available, and we will discuss the best course of action. I'll also order a referral to a physical therapist specializing in pelvic pain. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and alleviate your discomfort. In the meantime, you can continue taking ibuprofen as needed for pain relief. Avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms, and try to stay as comfortable as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds… helpful. Maybe. Will it be… a lot of touching? I… I’m not very comfortable with that. And… what if it doesn’t work? What if it’s something… serious? I worry about… cancer, sometimes. It runs in my family.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Noelani. Let’s address them one by one. Regarding physical therapy, it depends on the therapist’s approach, but generally, it won’t involve a lot of direct touching. They may externally assess muscle tension and range of motion, but you have the right to discuss your boundaries and preferences with the therapist. You can always ask them to explain what they are doing and why, and you can stop the session at any time if you feel uncomfortable. We can also specifically request a therapist experienced in working with patients who have sensitivities. As for your worry about cancer, it's understandable given your family history. That’s exactly why we are ordering the ultrasound - to rule out any structural abnormalities and get a clear picture of what's going on. The ultrasound will help us determine if any further investigation is needed. It's important to remember that pelvic pain is often caused by benign conditions, such as muscle strain or nerve irritation. However, it’s always best to be thorough. We’ll start with the ultrasound and go from there. If the results are concerning, we’ll discuss further testing options, such as an MRI. I will be with you every step of the way. Would you like me to write a referral to a specific physical therapy practice, or would you prefer to choose one yourself?
PATIENT: A referral… yes, a referral would be helpful. I… I don’t know where to start. One that… that’s gentle? And… understands about… being nervous? That would be wonderful. And… thank you. For explaining everything. And… for being patient. I… I worry a lot, as you know. It’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. It’s my job to be patient and to address your concerns. I understand that worrying is difficult, and I want you to feel comfortable and supported throughout this process. I'm going to write you a referral to "Pelvic Wellness Solutions," a practice that specializes in chronic pelvic pain and has a reputation for being very compassionate and understanding. They have several therapists who are experienced in working with patients who have anxiety and sensitivities. I'll also include a note outlining your concerns, so they are aware of your preferences. Here's the referral information and the order for the ultrasound. The ultrasound technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also have my nurse give you some information on managing anxiety, in case it helps. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help you. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you… thank you very much. For everything. You’ve… been very kind. I… I appreciate your patience. And… I’ll call if I have any questions. Thank you again, Doctor Gegan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. I'm glad I could help. Please take your time getting dressed. Remember, we’re here to support you, and we’ll work through this together. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to hearing from you after your ultrasound. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
PATIENT: .
