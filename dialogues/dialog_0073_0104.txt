DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It's my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for... a little while now. Not a big problem, really. Just… annoying. I don’t have time for this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. Well, even "annoying" things can sometimes be more serious than they seem. Let's try to get a better idea of what's going on. When did you first notice the pain?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t rightly remember. A few days, maybe? Last week, perhaps? It all feels… the same. I work, I eat, I sleep. Things just… happen. It’s not like I sit around cataloging every ache and pain, you know? It’s my throat, Doctor. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Of course. But to properly assess anything, even something seemingly simple, a little detail helps. So, let’s try this. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I suppose. When I talk a lot, it’s worse. And when… when it’s dry. Like this morning. This air isn’t good. Makes everything feel… scratchy. I don’t know. It just is painful sometimes. Look, I need to get back to work. Is this something serious? Because if it’s not, I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Scratchy” is helpful. And yes, dryness can certainly irritate the throat. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I haven’t been looking for symptoms, Doctor. I just feel… tired, probably. Everyone’s tired these days. And maybe a little… stuffy? But that could be this weather. Honestly, I don’t see what all the questions are for. It’s my throat. It hurts. Can you give me something for it?
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had a fever, chills, or any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Goodness, no. Difficulty… breathing? Doctor, I’m standing here, aren’t I? I can breathe perfectly fine. Look, I work with machinery all day. If I couldn’t breathe, I wouldn’t have a job. I'm perfectly capable. Is this going somewhere or are we just going to play twenty questions? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick examination, then. I'd like to take a look at your throat, listen to your lungs, and check your temperature. Just a standard procedure. It will help me determine the best course of action. Can you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't like doctors poking around. But... fine. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. And don't touch my tongue. It's sensitive.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your throat is a little red, some mild inflammation. No visible signs of pus or significant swelling. Lungs are clear. Temperature is 98.6, normal. It appears to be a mild irritation, likely viral. It’s not surprising, given the weather.
PATIENT: Viral? What does that mean? Is it… contagious? I need to get back to work. I can’t be missing shifts. And what do I do about it? I need something to make it stop hurting. Now.
DOCTOR: "Contagious" is a strong word. It’s a common cold, essentially. Easily spread, but usually mild. As for stopping the hurt, we can manage the symptoms. I can recommend a throat lozenge and suggest you drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, can also help. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? I don’t… I don't think so. Not that I know of. My husband… he had allergies. But I don’t. Look, lozenges and… pain relievers? That’s it? Is that all? I was hoping for something… stronger. This is very annoying. Can I get a note for work, then? Just in case? Something that says I was here. They like to… question things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, good. I understand your frustration. However, given the mild nature of the inflammation, stronger medications aren’t necessary and, frankly, wouldn’t be appropriate. I can write a note stating you were seen for a sore throat. Here you go. It states you were evaluated for a sore throat today, August 2, 2025, and were advised symptomatic treatment. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Good. This will do. No, I don’t have any other questions. You’ve wasted enough of my time already. Thank you. I need to get back to work. .
