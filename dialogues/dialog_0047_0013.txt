DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been hard to… empty my bladder lately. Like it doesn’t want to finish, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not real painful, just… stuck.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month of difficulty emptying your bladder. “Stuck,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, stuck is a good word. It starts okay, but then it just… stops. I have to… push a little, which I don't like doing. And sometimes, even then, I feel like there's still some left in there. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. These things happen. We need to get to the bottom of it. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it gradually worsened over the past month?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn’t just happen one day. It started as just taking a little longer, and now it's… well, like I said, stuck. It's not worse every time, but most times now it’s difficult. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Hilber. And is there any pain while you’re urinating, or afterwards?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. A little discomfort maybe, from… pushing, but not sharp pain. It’s more just… a feeling of fullness, even after I think I’m done. And like I said, the effort of trying to get it all out. It’s… tiring, honestly.
DOCTOR: "Tiring," alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. No, not that I’ve noticed. It looks… normal, I guess. The color is the same, not cloudy or anything. I haven’t seen any blood, if that's what you mean. I try to drink plenty of water, so it’s usually pretty clear.
DOCTOR: Good. No blood or changes in clarity. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever or chills. And my back feels alright. It gets a little stiff sometimes, old age, you know, but not a special pain with this… bladder trouble. I haven't felt sick or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Just the ones the doctor gave me for my… heart. A little pill in the morning. And something for my blood pressure, a small white one. Other than that, no. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Heart medication and blood pressure medication. Do you know the names of those medications, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question. I… I don't really remember the names. My daughter usually fills the pill box for me, so I just take what she puts in there. It's a pink one for my heart and a small white one, like I said. I could ask her when I get home, if that helps? I’m sorry, I should probably know.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Hilber. We can look them up in your file. Ah, here we are. Lisinopril for blood pressure and Digoxin for your heart. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good. Digoxin, you say? Yes, that sounds right. And allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a boy, but I haven't been stung in years. Other than that, no. I eat most things, thankfully. My wife used to make a good salmon chowder, and I never had trouble with that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Hilber, I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to check your abdomen and, if you don’t mind, a quick digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? Well, that doesn't sound very pleasant. Is that really necessary, Doctor? I mean, could we not just… try something else first? It’s just… a little embarrassing, you know? I’m an old man, but still…
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, I understand your discomfort, but it is necessary. Your prostate can often contribute to urinary issues, and a physical exam is the most reliable way to assess it. It will only take a moment, and it’s crucial for determining the cause of your symptoms. We need to rule things out. Now, if you’d like, I can explain the procedure in more detail. But frankly, delaying it won't help us find a solution. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it that way… It just feels… invasive, I guess. What exactly will you be… checking for? And will it… hurt? I’m just trying to understand why it's so important, Doctor. I don’t like the idea of it, but I want to get better, you know? I just want to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be checking the size and texture of your prostate, and assessing for any abnormalities. It will involve me gently inserting a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may be uncomfortable, a feeling of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. The reason it's so important is that an enlarged prostate is a common cause of urinary problems in men your age, and we need to determine if that's the issue here. It helps us rule out other potential problems as well. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. An enlarged prostate. That… that makes sense, I suppose. My brother had trouble with something like that, years ago. Still… it’s just… a little hard to accept. But you said it's quick, and you’ll be gentle. Alright, Doctor. Let’s get it over with. Just… tell me when you're starting, okay? I don't want to be surprised.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your left side with your knees drawn up. I’ll let you know when I’m about to begin. Just relax as much as possible. I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: .
