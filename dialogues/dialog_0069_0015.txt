DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um... my sinuses, yes. They been... bothering me. Not good. It’s hard to explain. A pain, mostly. Like… pressure, behind my face. I think. It’s been a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pain. I understand. It can be tricky to describe. “Pressure behind the face” is a good start. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Oh… when did it start? Hmm. That is… a good question. Not recent, I do not think. Maybe… a few weeks? Or months? Everything feels the same these days, if I am honest. I work a lot, you see. It is… hard to remember things when you are tired. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all. It's perfectly understandable to have trouble remembering details when you're busy and tired. A few weeks to a few months… okay. So, it's been a gradual onset, not something that came on suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. Not boom, you know? Slowly. Like… a little worse each day. Or maybe not each day. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. It is confusing. Is that… okay to say? I just… I don’t know how it started exactly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay to say, Mikeisha. It's very common for things to start gradually. Fluctuating symptoms are also quite typical. It helps me to understand what’s going on. Besides the pressure, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes my nose feels… stuffy. Like it’s blocked. And… maybe a little tired. But I am always tired from work, so maybe that is not from the sinuses. I do not know. Is a headache a symptom? I get headaches sometimes. But I always get headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, stuffy nose, fatigue – which, as you said, might be related to work, but we’ll keep it in mind – and headaches. Are the headaches typically in the same place as the sinus pressure – so, around your forehead, cheeks, or eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Around my forehead, mostly. And… sometimes my cheeks. It feels like… a heavy weight. It is not a sharp pain, never. Just… pressure. Like someone is squeezing my head. And sometimes, when I bend over, it feels worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure around your forehead and cheeks, a heavy sensation, worsens when bending over. That’s helpful. Have you had any fever, cough, sore throat, or any change in your sense of smell or taste recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I do not think so. I have not taken my temperature. Cough… not really. A little, sometimes, but I always cough a little when it’s dusty at work. Sore throat… no. And smell… hmm. I can smell things, yes. I think so. Everything smells normal. Taste is… okay. I eat food, and it tastes like food. Sorry, I am not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mikeisha. You're doing fine. No fever, cough is minimal and related to work, no sore throat, and smell and taste are normal. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you ever been diagnosed with allergies or sinusitis before?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I do not remember a doctor ever telling me I have allergies. I work with dust and… other things. Sometimes my eyes itch, and I sneeze. But I thought that was just the work. Sinusitis… no, I do not think so. Never heard of it before, actually. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Sinusitis just means inflammation of the sinuses – it’s often caused by a virus, bacteria, or allergies. No need to worry about the name itself. Okay, so no prior diagnosis of allergies or sinusitis. Let's talk about your work a little bit. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I am a rotary drill operator. For oil and gas. It’s… hard work. A lot of dust, a lot of noise. And… it is very hot, sometimes. We are outside a lot. We dig holes, you see. Big holes. It's… important work, but it makes me very tired. And dusty. Very, very dusty.
DOCTOR: Okay, rotary drill operator, working with a lot of dust and noise in hot conditions. That definitely provides some context. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses… hmm. I had the chickenpox when I was little, I think. And… I broke my arm once, when I was a child. I needed a cast. But… nothing serious since then, I do not think. No surgeries. I do not like hospitals, Doctor. So I try to stay away from them. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mikeisha. Avoiding hospitals when you can is understandable. No major illnesses or surgeries reported. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Not that I know of. I do not take much medicine. Sometimes, for headaches, I take… pills. Little white pills. But I do not remember the name. My husband buys them for me. I just take them when my head hurts. Never had a bad reaction, so… I do not think I have any allergies. Sorry. I am not very good with names.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. We can try to figure out the medication later if needed. So, no known medication allergies. Now, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the headache pills?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the little white pills for my head. I drink water, and I eat food. That is all. I do not like taking much medicine. It makes me feel… strange. My husband says I worry too much. He is a good man. Very practical. He takes care of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the headache pills as needed. And finally, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. My father… he worked hard all his life. He had problems with his back. And my brother… he is healthy, I think. He lives far away. I do not see him much. We do not talk about… medical things. It is not something we do. Sorry, I am not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mikeisha. You've given me what you know, and that's helpful. History of heart problems in your mother and back problems in your father. Okay, I think I have a good initial understanding of your situation. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… okay. If you think it is important. I trust you. Please be gentle, if you do not mind. My head… it hurts sometimes, and I do not like being touched on the face. But I trust you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mikeisha. I will be as gentle as possible. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to take a look at your ears and nose to see if there’s any sign of infection or inflammation. Then I'll listen to your lungs. And finally, I’ll gently palpate your sinuses to check for tenderness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Just… please be careful. My head… it is very sensitive. And… I do not like surprises. If it will hurt, please tell me. And… if I flinch, please do not be alarmed. It is just… a reflex.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mikeisha. I will be very careful and let you know before I do anything. Your ears look good, no signs of infection. Your lungs sound clear as well. Okay, I’m gently pressing on your sinuses now. I notice some tenderness here, on both sides. Does that pain radiate anywhere, or is it localized to this area?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that is where it hurts. It feels… like pressure, like squeezing. And… sometimes, it goes up into my forehead. And… down into my teeth, a little. Not sharp pain, never. Just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy weight. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so the tenderness radiates to your forehead and down into your teeth – still a pressure sensation, no sharp pain. That's helpful information. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis, possibly a chronic or recurrent sinus infection. The tenderness over your sinuses and the radiating pain are consistent with that. The dust exposure at your workplace is a likely contributing factor. However, to rule out other possibilities and assess the severity, I’d like to order a CT scan of your sinuses. It will give us a clearer picture of the inflammation and help us determine if there’s any structural issue. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… a CT scan? What is that, Doctor? Is it… safe? I do not like… machines. And what about the cost? I do not have insurance, you see. My husband… he works very hard, but… money is tight. Is it very expensive? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a lot of very reasonable questions, Mikeisha, and I’m glad you asked. A CT scan is a type of X-ray that creates detailed images of your sinuses. It doesn't involve any needles or injections, and it's generally very safe. The radiation exposure is minimal. It won't hurt, you'll simply lie on a table while the scanner takes the images. It takes just a few minutes. I understand your concern about the cost. Since you don’t have insurance, it can be expensive. Let me check with our billing department to see what the cost is and if we have any financial assistance programs available. I can also see if there are any lower-cost imaging centers in the area. Before we proceed with the CT scan, we could try a trial of antibiotics and nasal saline rinses to see if that improves your symptoms. However, if your symptoms don't improve or worsen, the CT scan will be important to get a more accurate diagnosis and rule out any complications. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… yes, that sounds… better than the machine. Nasal… saline rinses? What are those? I do not want to have a machine scan if we can try something else first. And… if the antibiotics do not work, can we talk about the cost of the scan again? And… will they make me sick? I get very tired easily, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mikeisha. Let's try the antibiotics and nasal saline rinses first. Nasal saline rinses are simply washing your nasal passages with saltwater. It helps to clear out congestion and inflammation. You can buy a saline rinse kit at any pharmacy – it looks like a little bottle with a spout. You just fill it with warm water and saline packets, and then gently rinse your nose over the sink. It's very simple and usually quite effective. As for the antibiotics, I’ll prescribe you a course of amoxicillin. It’s a common antibiotic that’s often used for sinus infections. There’s always a risk of side effects with any medication, but amoxicillin is generally well-tolerated. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and stomach upset. If you experience any of these, please let me know. And yes, if you experience increased fatigue, please contact me right away. We'll start with a 10-day course of antibiotics, and I want you to use the nasal saline rinses twice a day. Let's see how you're feeling in a week. If your symptoms don't improve or worsen after a week, we can discuss the CT scan again and explore financial assistance options. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A plan is good. Twice a day with the… the water in my nose. And the pills. I can do that. I trust you. And… if I feel worse, I will call. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. And… patient. I ask too many questions, I think.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. You haven't asked too many questions at all. It’s important for you to understand everything, and I’m happy to answer anything you need. Here’s your prescription for the antibiotics, and these are the instructions for the nasal saline rinses. Please read them carefully. I’ll also give you a card with my contact information. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to see how you’re doing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfect. One week. I can do that. Thank you again, Doctor. You have… eased my mind. I will see you in one week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I’m glad I could help. Get some rest, and remember to use the saline rinses and take the antibiotics as prescribed. I look forward to seeing you next week. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up.
