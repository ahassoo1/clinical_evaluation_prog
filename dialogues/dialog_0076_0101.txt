DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, you're… Aldine, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Aldine Popova. That’s right. And please, call me Aldine. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Ruocco, you said?
DOCTOR: Ruocco, yes. Look, I’m a busy man, so let’s just get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, goodness, maybe a week now? Not constant, but it comes and goes. Feels like a dull ache, nothin’ sharp. Mostly happens in the evenin’, after I’ve been on my feet all day. I do nails, you know – manicures and pedicures. Lots of bendin’ and reachin’.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Mm-hm. A week, give or take. It didn't start suddenly, you understand. It kinda crept up on me. At first, I just thought it was tiredness. Old age, you know? But it ain't goin' away. And sometimes, it makes me a little… dizzy, if I turn my head too fast. Nothing terrible, just a little wobble.
DOCTOR: Dizzy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dizzy. Not all the time, mind you. Just when I move my head quickly. Like if I'm lookin' at somethin' and then turn to talk to someone. It’s a quick thing, goes away almost as soon as it starts. But it worries me, you know? I need to be steady with the files, can’t be wobblin’ around. I got customers comin’ and goin’ all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And you're… doing nails, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Manicures and pedicures. Been doin’ it for… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years now! Started when I was a young man, came to this country. Good work, always kept me busy. But all that bendin’ and reachin’… I wonder if that’s got somethin’ to do with this headache.
DOCTOR: Fifty years… impressive. And you haven't mentioned any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the headache and the little bit of dizziness. No blurry vision, no numbness, no… well, nothin’ else. I sleep alright, eat regular… maybe a little tired, but who isn't at my age? I haven't felt sick to my stomach or anything like that. Just this head pain. It's just… bothersome, you know? Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your blood pressure. And… just to be thorough, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Don’t get your hopes up, probably just tension.
PATIENT: Sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I hope it’s not somethin’ serious. I got a lot of customers dependin’ on me.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure’s a little elevated, but not alarming. Heart and lungs sound… acceptable. You’re not running a marathon, are you?
PATIENT: No, no marathons for me, Doctor! I’m a nail technician, remember? Lots of sittin’ and bendin’, not much runnin’. I used to play cricket when I was a young man, but that was a long time ago. Why do you ask? Is somethin’ wrong?
DOCTOR: Just routine. Look, it’s likely just muscle tension from… whatever it is you do with those nails all day. I’m going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant. Take it as directed. Come back in a month if it doesn't improve. Next.
PATIENT: Oh. Well… alright then. Muscle relaxant, you say? I hope it works. I really do. Is there… anything else I should be doin’? Any stretches or somethin’? And… a month seems a long time if it doesn't help. Would it be alright if I called if things get worse before then?
DOCTOR: Look, I have other patients. Stretching… maybe. I don't have time to give you a physiotherapy plan. And if things get worse, go to the emergency room. Don't call me. Next!
