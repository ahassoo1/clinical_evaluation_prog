DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds, yeah, that’s me. Look, Doc, I just… I can’t catch my breath sometimes. And my mouth feels like the Sahara Desert, you know? And my eyes… scratchy. Real scratchy. It’s been… a while now. Can’t rightly say how long. Old man problems, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Old man problems," right. Well, we'll see about that. Let's try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. What do you want from me, a calendar? It just… happens. I’m walkin’ around, maybe doin’ somethin’, maybe not, and then whoosh… gotta stop and get my wind back. It ain’t every day, but it’s enough to be a bother. And the dry… everything is dry. Like cotton. You ever been to Cuba? It ain't humid like that anymore. Well, I haven't been in a long time. That's another story.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds. Let's try this differently. When you say "whoosh," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Feels like… like someone tightened a belt around my chest, you know? Not painful, exactly. Just… squeezin’. Makes it hard to get the air in. And then it goes away after a minute or two. Usually. Sometimes longer. I mostly just sit down 'til it passes. Don't want to fall or nothin’. Makes a fella look foolish. And then the mouth… always dry. Even when I drink water. It's gone quick as a wink. You ever notice that? Water just disappears on some days.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this squeezing sensation… does it happen with activity?
PATIENT: Activity? Well… sometimes. Sometimes when I’m… walkin’ up the stairs, I reckon. Or… carryin’ somethin’ heavy. But not always! That’s the thing, Doc. It happens when I’m just sittin’ here too. Watchin’ the TV. Or… thinkin’. Mostly thinkin’. It’s just… random. Like a bad radio signal. Comes and goes. Old age, I tell ya. Everything’s fallin’ apart. Can't trust nothin’ anymore. Not even my own lungs.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – like a cough, wheezing, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… ankles… Now that you mention it… yeah, a little. Not real bad, but… puffy. Especially at the end of the day. I figured it was just… bein' old. And a cough… sometimes. A little tickle in my throat. Not a bad cough, just… annoying. Mostly happens when I lie down. Makes me have to clear my throat a lot. You know how it is. Everything rattles around in there now. Like marbles in a tin can. Probably just dust. Or… the Sahara Desert in my lungs. What can you do?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a listen to your lungs, and then I'll check your ankles. Please sit back and take a deep breath when I ask.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Deep breath. I used to be good at that. Played trumpet, you know. Needed a good set of lungs for that. Not much trumpet playin’ these days. Too much… bother. Go ahead, Doc. Let's get this over with. I got a ballgame to watch later. And a thirst to quench. You wouldn't believe how thirsty a man can get. Especially with this… desert situation.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm hearing some… diminished breath sounds, especially on the lower lobes. And some mild wheezing. Your ankles do have some slight edema – swelling. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Allergies? Hmph. I don’t take much. A little somethin’ for my blood pressure, I think. Old man stuff. Allergies… not that I recall. Had a rash once when I was a boy. From poison ivy, I think. But that was… a long time ago. I don’t recall any trouble with any pills the doctor gives me. Mostly just forget to take ‘em. That’s my biggest allergy – forgetfulness. It’s a bad one, let me tell you. Wipes out everything. Makes this whole process… difficult. What were we talkin’ about again?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medication do you take for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… hmmm… Now that’s a tough one. The little pills… white ones, I think? Or maybe blue. Small ones. I get ‘em from the drugstore. Old man down the street helps me with it sometimes. He’s got a good memory. Name’s… uh… Arnie! Yeah, Arnie. He knows all my medications. He’s a lifesaver, that one. I just… take ‘em. Doesn’t really matter the name, does it? As long as they keep the pressure down, I suppose. It’s all a blur these days. Everything is. Like a bad dream. Or the Sahara Desert. Very confusing, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Based on your symptoms and what little information I’ve been able to gather, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure. It's important to get this properly evaluated. I'm going to order an EKG and a chest X-ray, and I also want you to see a cardiologist for a full workup.
PATIENT: Congestive… what now? Heart… failure? Doc, are you sayin’ I'm… dyin’? Hold on now. That’s a bit much, isn’t it? A little breathlessness and a dry mouth… and suddenly I’m fallin’ apart? I just need a glass of water, that’s all! And maybe a fan. This heat isn’t helpin’ things, you know. X-rays and cardiologists… that sounds expensive. And… frightening. I just want to watch my ballgame, Doc. That's all I ask. A little water, a little rest, and a good ballgame. Is that too much to ask? Honestly. The Sahara Desert sounds better than all this. .
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Guilds, I understand this is unsettling, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate care. I’ll have the nurse schedule those for you. It's better to be safe than sorry. And I can give you a referral to a cardiologist who accepts Medicare. I'll have the nurse come in with some information about congestive heart failure. Please read through it. And yes, staying hydrated is important. The nurse can provide you with some water. .
