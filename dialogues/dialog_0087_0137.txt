DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… my husband and I, we are looking at a place for me to live. A senior place. They need… a paper from the doctor, to say I am okay to go there. That is why I am here.
DOCTOR: I understand. A medical clearance for a senior living facility. Certainly. That’s perfectly reasonable. To complete that form accurately, I'll need to gather some information about your overall health. Let's start with a brief history. First, could you tell me about any current medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical… conditions? I have… old age, I guess! My knees hurt sometimes, when the weather is cold. And… I forget things, a little. But who doesn't at my age? I take a little pill for my blood pressure, the red one. That is all, I think. My husband, he knows better, maybe.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's good you’re aware of those things. “Old age” isn’t a condition, but it's helpful to know what you're experiencing. And it's good you mention the blood pressure medication. Just to clarify, when you say your knees hurt, is that a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. More when it is cold, or… when I walk too much. Sometimes, when I stand for a long time. Not every day, though. Usually, just a little ache. Not a big pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent knee pain, worse with cold weather and prolonged standing. And you mentioned some forgetfulness. Has that been getting worse recently, or is it relatively stable?
PATIENT: Stable, I think. It's always been… a little bit. I forget where I put my glasses, or… a name sometimes. Nothing too bad. My husband gets a little… worried, but I tell him it's okay. It hasn't gotten much worse lately, no.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It's common to experience some memory changes as we age, and it’s reassuring that it hasn’t been worsening. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any past medical issues you've had – any serious illnesses or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Long time ago, when I was young, I had… the measles, I think. And… when I had my babies, of course, I was in the hospital. But no big illnesses, no. Nothing serious. I broke my arm once, when I was a child, climbing a tree. But that was many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, measles as a child, deliveries, and a broken arm in childhood. No other significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. Just… the babies, but that was not a surgery, right? They… they helped them come out. But no cutting, no… big operations.
DOCTOR: You are right to clarify. Deliveries aren’t considered surgeries in this context. So, no surgeries. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, besides the red pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the red pill. That is all. Sometimes, when my knees hurt really bad, I take… a white one. For the pain. But not every day. Just when I need it. I can get it at the store, you don't need a paper for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a red pill for blood pressure daily, and a white pill for knee pain as needed. Do you know the names of these medications, or can you describe the packaging?
PATIENT: No, I don't know the names. Old lady brain, you know? The red one is… small, and round. Red, of course! And the white one… it’s a little bigger, and it has lines on it. I think. My husband, he gets them for me. He knows everything.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, no problem at all. We can often identify them from the packaging or your pharmacy records. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I eat everything. I try, anyway. My husband, he sometimes says I eat too much! No, no allergies. I don't get sick from anything. Well, sometimes a little cold, but who doesn't?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she lived to be very old. Ninety-something, I think. My father… not so long. He had… problems with his heart, I think. My sister, she is still alive, but she lives far away. She has… the sugar sickness, maybe? Diabetes, my husband calls it. No one else, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother lived to 90s, father had heart problems, sister has diabetes. That’s helpful. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And… a little wine sometimes, with dinner. Just a small glass. My husband and I, we like a glass of wine with our food. But not every day. And… no, no other things. No drugs. Just wine, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. And finally, could you tell me a little about your current living situation and activity level?
PATIENT: We live in a house. With a garden. It’s a little big now, for me. That’s why we are looking at the other place. I… I walk a little, in the garden. I like to cook. And I watch television. Not much going out now. My husband, he does most of the work around the house.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. That gives me a good overview of your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 78 and regular. I’m also just checking your knees. There’s a little bit of crepitus with movement, which is common with age, but no significant swelling or redness noted at this time. Do you experience any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: A little… a little ache when you bend it, yes. Not a big pain, just… a reminder that it’s old. But it’s okay. I’m used to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That’s consistent with what you’ve described. Reflexes are normal. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, that completes the brief physical exam. Overall, your exam is relatively normal for your age. Your heart and lungs sound good, your blood pressure is slightly elevated but stable, and your exam doesn’t reveal any acute concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You asked me everything, Doctor. Will you… will you write the paper for the place? So I can go live there?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Based on our conversation and the exam, I am happy to complete the medical clearance form for you. It indicates that you are medically stable to reside in an assisted living facility. I will also note your slightly elevated blood pressure and recommend routine monitoring there. It will take me just a few moments to finalize this. While I’m doing that, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, that is all, Doctor. Thank you very much. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This is the completed medical clearance form. Please make sure to submit this to the assisted living facility. I also want to emphasize the importance of continuing to monitor your blood pressure. They will likely do this regularly at the facility. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to let them know, or to seek medical attention. Do you have any questions about the form, or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your kindness. I will make sure my husband knows everything too. He worries a lot. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and I wish you all the best in your new living situation. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
