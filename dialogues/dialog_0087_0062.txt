DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor Soodeen. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I’m here today regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the masks they are requiring us to wear. I'm hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps alternative options. It’s… causing me some difficulties.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you're seeking medical guidance regarding your ability to wear a mask at work, potentially for an exemption or alternative solutions. Could you tell me more about these difficulties you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s difficult to explain, truthfully. It’s not a simple discomfort, you see. I find myself… overwhelmed by having something on my face for extended periods. It causes a sense of… restriction, almost a panic. It makes it hard to concentrate on my duties, and I worry about the safety of the people I’m entrusted to protect if I’m not fully focused. It’s not something I anticipated, and it’s… distressing. I’ve never experienced anything quite like it before. It started when the mask requirements were implemented, and it’s become progressively worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds quite unsettling and understandably distressing. It's important to me that we take this seriously. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe what happens specifically when you wear the mask?
PATIENT: Well, the feeling begins almost immediately. A tightness in my chest, a quickening of my breath. Then a… a feeling of being closed in. It's not that I can’t breathe exactly, but it feels like the air isn't… sufficient. My thoughts start to race, and I have trouble focusing. It's like being trapped, though logically, I know I'm not. I become very aware of the mask itself, the feeling of it against my skin, the warmth of my own breath. It’s… unpleasant. And it escalates. I start to sweat, my hands get shaky, and I really struggle to maintain composure. It’s quite… embarrassing, truthfully, to feel this way. I find myself constantly adjusting it, trying to find a comfortable position, but nothing seems to help. It’s just… a rising feeling of anxiety, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me about that. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant anxiety response triggered by wearing the mask. We need to explore this further. Do you have a history of anxiety or panic attacks?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve always considered myself a fairly calm and collected person. I've certainly faced stressful situations in my line of work – protective services can be… demanding – but I’ve always been able to manage. This is… different. It’s directly tied to the mask. I've never felt this way before the mask requirements were put in place. I haven’t sought any treatment for anxiety previously, and I don't currently take any medication for it. This truly came on suddenly with this new situation. It’s… concerning, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. A sudden onset of these symptoms, with a clear trigger like the mask, is important information. Let's delve into some other aspects of your health to get a clearer picture. Have you had any changes in your medical conditions recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing significant. I have the usual aches and pains that come with being my age, and my Medicare covers my regular check-ups. The doctor always says my blood pressure is a bit high, but it’s manageable with diet and exercise, as much as I’m able. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything new or had any hospitalizations in the last year. I try to stay active when I can, mostly walking and doing some light gardening. I haven't altered my diet or exercise routines recently either. It really does seem to be… solely related to the mask.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor, as recommended by my previous physician for my heart health. And occasionally, I'll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's infrequent. Nothing else, not regularly anyway. I don’t generally favor taking medications unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to manage things naturally when possible. No herbal supplements either, no. I've never really gotten into those. I assure you, it’s not a medication interaction. This feeling… it’s immediate, almost as soon as the mask goes on.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything I've encountered. I don't have any known environmental allergies either, like pollen or dust. I eat a fairly varied diet, and I haven’t had any issues with food sensitivities. I assure you, it isn't an allergy. This feeling is… distinct. It's not hives or swelling, or difficulty breathing in the traditional sense. It's more… psychological, I think. Although, it’s very real, of course. It's distressing to experience, and it's impacting my ability to perform my duties. I truly don't believe it's a simple allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying all of that. It sounds like we’ve ruled out a lot of common causes. Given your history and the specific nature of your symptoms, it does sound like you’re experiencing a significant anxiety response triggered by wearing the mask. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s happening physiologically, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, focusing on your respiratory system and vital signs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this thoroughly. I want to be certain we've explored all possibilities. A physical exam sounds reasonable. I am, admittedly, a bit anxious about even thinking about wearing a mask again, but if it's necessary for a proper assessment, I’ll do my best. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. I understand your apprehension, and we'll take things at your pace. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. It will just be a quick assessment to establish a baseline. Could you please sit up on the examination table and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am ready when you are. Please let me know if I need to do anything specific. I'll try my best to remain as relaxed as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but consistent with your usual readings. Oxygen saturation is 97%, which is excellent. So, physiologically, everything looks within normal limits. This further supports the likelihood of an anxiety-related response. Now, I am going to ask you to briefly put on a surgical mask, just for a moment, so I can observe your reaction. I will be right here, and we can remove it immediately if you feel uncomfortable. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. If it's necessary for a proper assessment, I'll do it. But please, be ready to remove it immediately if I become distressed. I’ll do my best to remain calm, but I anticipate it will be… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just take a slow, deep breath. I’m right here. Go ahead when you’re ready. I'm observing your breathing, heart rate and your overall appearance.
PATIENT: It… it's difficult, Doctor. I feel… trapped. My chest is tightening. I need… I think I need to remove it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright. We've gathered enough information. You did exactly the right thing by letting me know. That reaction confirms our suspicion of anxiety-related response. It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant level of anxiety with mask wearing, triggering physiological symptoms like chest tightness and rapid heart rate. It’s not in your head; it’s a real and valid response. Given your history and these findings, I recommend a referral to a mental health professional specializing in anxiety disorders. They can provide you with coping mechanisms, therapy, and potentially medication to help manage your anxiety and reduce your reaction to triggers like mask wearing. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. That sounds… incredibly helpful, actually. I've been hesitant to consider therapy, but it's clear this is beyond my ability to manage on my own. A referral to a mental health professional would be… a welcome relief. I want to be able to perform my duties effectively, and I clearly need assistance with this. I am grateful for your understanding and support, Doctor. I truly am. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. It takes courage to acknowledge these challenges and seek help, and I commend you for doing so. I’m submitting a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a specialist in anxiety disorders right here in the rural clinic. Her office will be contacting you shortly to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I can provide you with some resources on relaxation techniques and deep breathing exercises. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be very helpful indeed. Any tools I can utilize to manage my anxiety would be greatly appreciated. I’m willing to try anything that might alleviate these symptoms. I want to thank you again for your patience and understanding. This has been… a difficult experience, but I feel much more hopeful now that I have a clear path forward. Thank you, Doctor Soodeen. I appreciate your thorough assessment and your support.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. Here are some resources on progressive muscle relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing. These can be helpful for managing anxiety in the moment. Also, remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace and prioritize your well-being. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been exceptionally helpful and informative. I feel much more equipped to handle this situation now, and I am grateful for your guidance. Thank you again for your time and understanding, Dr. Soodeen. I appreciate everything you've done for me today. Have a good afternoon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I wish you all the best in your journey to manage your anxiety. Have a good afternoon as well. .
