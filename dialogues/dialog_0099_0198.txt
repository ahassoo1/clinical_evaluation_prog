DOCTOR: Right. Liza Sugino, 47 years old. Good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Overgaard. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’m interested in learning about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I keep hearing good things, and honestly, life feels a bit… much sometimes. I thought maybe this would be a good place to ask about it.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness… meditation. Hmm. You’ve come to a family doctor for… stress management techniques?
PATIENT: Well, yes, I suppose so. It just seemed… easier, somehow, to start here. I wasn’t sure where else to go, really. And you know my history, being a regular patient and all. I figured you might have some resources or know someone who teaches it. I didn’t want to just jump into a class without… well, without talking to someone first. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… unconventional, let’s say. Most people come to me with ailments, not… self-improvement projects. Still. I suppose we can discuss it. Let’s start with this “much” you mentioned. Can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. It's not like I'm sick, exactly. It’s more… my job is pretty demanding. Signal and track switch repair – you have to be very focused, very precise. A lot rides on getting it right, you know? And then outside of work… well, I’m single, and I worry about my mother, she’s getting on. Just a lot of little things adding up, I guess. I find myself thinking about everything all the time, and it's hard to switch off. It doesn’t give me trouble sleeping, thankfully, but it’s… draining.
DOCTOR: Right. So, anxiety related to work stress and caregiving concerns. No sleep disturbance, which is good. I see your last physical was… fairly unremarkable, aside from slightly elevated cholesterol, which we discussed. Have you experienced anything like panic attacks?
PATIENT: No, not panic attacks. It’s not that bad. More like… a constant hum of worry in the background. Like I’m always running through checklists in my head. I’ve never felt like I couldn’t breathe or anything. Just… restless, and my mind races. And sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed, like I can't focus on anything for very long. Does that make sense? I'm not trying to be dramatic. It's just… a persistent feeling.
DOCTOR: Persistent feeling… restlessness. You’re what I would categorize as a generally high-functioning individual experiencing moderate stress. Before we explore mindfulness, which, frankly, isn't really in my wheelhouse, let's rule out any underlying medical causes for your anxiety. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That's good to know you want to check for other things first. Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a bit more tired lately, but honestly, that could just be the summer heat. And maybe a little more irritable than usual, but again, I think that's linked to the stress. I haven't had any chest pain, dizziness, or anything like that. My appetite is normal. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been getting headaches more often. Not terrible ones, just… a dull ache at the back of my head, especially after a long day at work. But I usually just take some ibuprofen and it goes away.
DOCTOR: Headaches… more frequent, dull ache, relieved with ibuprofen. Okay. And how often would you say you're taking ibuprofen for these headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, not every day, Doctor. Maybe three or four times a week, if I've had a particularly stressful day. Sometimes less, sometimes a bit more. It really depends. It's not a constant thing, and it's usually just one or two pills at a time. I don't think it’s anything serious, but I figured I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Three to four times a week… for a dull headache?
PATIENT: Well, yes. I know it’s probably not ideal, and I’m not thrilled about taking so much medication, but they’re not debilitating headaches. It's just… a persistent pressure. And I really don’t like going to the dentist, so I’d rather deal with a little headache than have to go to the doctor! I’m probably making a fool of myself, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sugino, self-treating with ibuprofen three to four times a week for headaches is… not advisable. It can lead to rebound headaches, stomach issues, even kidney problems. We need to investigate the cause of these headaches before we even think about stress management techniques. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. And frankly, I think a neurological consultation is warranted.
PATIENT: Oh. A neurological consultation? Is that… serious? I just thought it was stress. I didn’t realize the ibuprofen was… bad, like that. I’m sorry. I should have said something sooner. I just… I don’t like making a fuss. It's probably nothing, right?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sugino, frequent headaches, especially when coupled with regular ibuprofen use, require investigation. I'm not saying it’s anything catastrophic, but it’s irresponsible to dismiss it as "just stress." The blood work will rule out any underlying medical conditions, and the neurologist can assess whether further testing, like an MRI, is necessary. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'll have my nurse draw the blood now, and I'll write a referral for a neurologist. In the meantime, I want you to stop taking the ibuprofen. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No more ibuprofen. And I’ll see the neurologist. I’m sorry for not saying anything sooner. I just… I didn’t want to bother you with something that seemed so small. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s… a relief to know you're taking it seriously. Do you think… is it possible it’s something serious? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sugino, I understand your anxiety. It’s always best to be thorough. It’s possible there’s an underlying issue, but it’s equally possible it’s a tension headache exacerbated by stress. The tests will give us clarity. Let's focus on getting the blood work done and scheduling the neurologist appointment. We will address this methodically. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to medications, food, or anything. I'm pretty healthy, generally. Just a bit… stressed, apparently. Thank you again for listening. And for taking this seriously. I feel much better knowing we’re getting it checked out. Where should I go for the blood work? And do you have a preferred neurologist?
DOCTOR: Here. This is the requisition for the blood work. You can go to Quest Diagnostics, the address is on the form. As for the neurologist, I recommend Dr. Anya Petrova. She’s excellent, very thorough. Here’s her contact information. My nurse, Maria, will call you tomorrow to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and please, stop the ibuprofen. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Overgaard. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I’ll schedule the blood work right away and call Dr. Petrova’s office. And I promise, no more ibuprofen. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I’ll see you next week. I suppose this means we’ll have to put the mindfulness on hold for a bit.
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s prioritize the medical issues first. People and their… self-diagnosis. .
