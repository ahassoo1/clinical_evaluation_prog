DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, it's my stool. It's black. Been happening for a bit now. I take a lot of pills for my arthritis, you see. Those NSAIDs. I don't know why it matters, honestly. It's just…black. Is that all you need to know? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concern, and I appreciate you letting me know about the black stools and your arthritis medication. It does matter, and I want to understand what’s going on fully to provide you with the best care. Could you tell me approximately how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long? Let me think… Honestly, probably a few weeks now. Maybe a month? It comes and goes, you know? Not every single time. And it's not like…dripping blood or anything dramatic. Just…darker. I really don't pay much attention to that sort of thing, to be perfectly honest. I’ve got better things to worry about. Is this going to require a bunch of tests? Because I really don’t have the energy for that.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Hatchard. A few weeks to a month, coming and going, and not overtly bloody… that’s helpful information. You're right to be concerned, and we do need to investigate this a bit further, but I will strive to keep any testing as minimal as possible given your energy levels. Black stool, also known as melena, can indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The NSAIDs you're taking for your arthritis can contribute to this, as they can sometimes cause stomach irritation or ulcers. However, there are other potential causes as well. Before we discuss potential tests, could you describe any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Oh, dear. My mother had ulcers. Dreadful thing. I suppose that’s what I suspected, honestly. Look, I’m tired, Doctor. Really tired. And my stomach… it’s just always a bit off, you know? Sort of queasy. And I haven’t much of an appetite. But that could just be…old age. I'm 73, for goodness sake. It’s not like I’m running marathons. Do I have to explain every little ache and pain?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize for potentially causing alarm. It’s good you mentioned your mother's history with ulcers; that is helpful information. You are right to be concerned about the fatigue, queasiness, and loss of appetite. These can be related to a potential issue in the stomach, but also have other causes. It’s important to rule things out systematically. To help me get a clearer picture, have you noticed any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? No, not really. I haven’t thrown up or anything. I get a bit…sick to my stomach sometimes, like after a heavy meal. But that happens, doesn’t it? I mean, I’m not a spring chicken anymore. Everything feels a bit off these days. Look, are you going to poke me? Because I really don’t like doctors poking me. I’m perfectly fine if it’s just a quick listen with that…that tube thing. But no poking.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hatchard. No poking, I assure you. A quick listen with the stethoscope is certainly something we can do. Since you haven't experienced any vomiting, that's good. We'll start with a physical exam – listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. I’ll also review your medication list in detail. To complete the picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And I’ve got high blood pressure, but it's managed with pills, of course. And…arthritis, as we’ve established. Oh, and my hips are bad. They want me to get them replaced, but I'm not keen on surgery. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a mess. It’s a miracle I'm still standing. Is this all necessary? I feel like I'm giving you my life story.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Hatchard. It's not a mess at all; it's important information, and I appreciate you being so forthcoming. It helps me understand the whole picture, and it is necessary for providing the best care. Knowing about your gallbladder removal, high blood pressure, arthritis, and hip issues is very helpful. We'll take everything into consideration. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I mean, I get a bit of a rash sometimes if I eat shellfish, but that's it. And I’m not fond of penicillin, it always makes me feel a bit… funny. Not a full-blown reaction, just… unsettled. I haven't taken it in years, so it probably doesn’t matter. Honestly, I take so many pills I can’t keep track anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Shellfish allergy and a possible intolerance to penicillin – noted. It’s good you’ve mentioned that, even if it’s just a feeling of being unsettled. To get a complete picture of your medication list, do you have a list with you, or can you tell me what you take regularly, including dosages?
PATIENT: Ugh, a list? Do I look like I have a list? Honestly, Doctor. It's a whole handful. Let me see… There's the blood pressure pill… Losartan, I think it's called. And then there’s the arthritis stuff… Naproxen, mostly. Sometimes Celebrex. And something for my stomach, because the Naproxen hurts it… Pantoprazole, is that right? Oh, and a vitamin D supplement. And… honestly, I'm probably forgetting something. My husband usually handles all of this. It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hatchard. Losartan for blood pressure, Naproxen and Celebrex for arthritis, Pantoprazole for stomach protection, and Vitamin D. That's very helpful. We'll double-check this against your chart, and it’s perfectly fine if we need to clarify. Now, Ms. Hatchard, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and gently press on your stomach to check for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. And be gentle, I told you. I bruise easily. And don’t expect me to tell you if it hurts a little. I’m 73, everything hurts a little. Just… do it quickly. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hatchard. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand things may be sensitive, and I will proceed at your pace. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They appear to be…normal. There is some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, particularly in the epigastric region – that’s right here. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is reassuring. Overall, the exam suggests some mild discomfort, but nothing acutely concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings from the exam, it's possible the black stools are related to the NSAIDs you're taking, causing some irritation to the stomach lining. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I recommend we order some blood tests, including a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a stool test to check for blood. What do you think?
PATIENT: Tests… of course. More tests. Honestly, Doctor, it’s always something. Fine, go ahead with your tests. But I want the results quickly. And I don’t want a long list of follow-up appointments. I'm trying to enjoy my retirement, not spend it in a doctor’s office. Can I at least get a printed copy of the results? I’d like to show them to my husband. He’s the sensible one.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Hatchard. I will do my best to expedite the testing and minimize any further appointments. I agree, it’s important to enjoy your retirement. We will order the blood tests and the stool test right away. The lab results should be available within a few days, and I will personally review them with you as soon as they are ready. And yes, absolutely, you can have a printed copy of the results to share with your husband. In the meantime, I recommend temporarily reducing your Naproxen dosage, if possible, to see if that helps alleviate the symptoms. Of course, discuss this with your primary care physician before making any changes. Would you like me to send your primary care physician a summary of our consultation?
PATIENT: Yes, send it to Dr. Abernathy. She’s good. And…fine, I’ll try to take less of those pills. But honestly, they’re the only thing that keeps me moving. Alright, is that everything? Can I go now? I've got a garden to tend to, you know. The tomatoes won't pick themselves.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is everything for today, Ms. Hatchard. I will send the summary of our consultation to Dr. Abernathy right away. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And enjoy your garden – the tomatoes are lucky to have you. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. Goodbye, Doctor. And try not to overbook your schedule. Some of us have actual lives to get back to.
