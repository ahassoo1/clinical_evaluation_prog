DOCTOR: Talofa, Demondre. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hey, nice to meet you too, Dr. Kimm. Um… well, honestly? Just kinda curious, you know? I haven’t really needed a doctor in a while, but I figured I should probably get checked up, just to make sure everything’s okay. I work on the boats, so… I guess I wanna make sure bein’ out on the water isn’t doin’ anythin’ bad to me.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you, Demondre. Preventative care is fantastic – much better than waiting until something is wrong. Working on the boats definitely has its own set of potential health considerations. So, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about what you do on the boats?
PATIENT: Yeah, for sure. I'm a… well, mostly I keep the engines runnin’ smooth. Marine oiler, that's what they call it. Lots of… checkin’ levels, makin’ sure nothin’ is leakin’, stuff like that. It can be kinda greasy, and loud, sometimes. And I’m out on the water for days at a time, usually. Not always, but often. We go pretty far out, too. Mostly cargo stuff, nothin’ fancy. It’s a job, you know? Pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Right, a marine oiler. That does sound like it has its own unique challenges. The grease, the noise, being out at sea… all good things for us to consider. Okay. Have you noticed any specific symptoms that made you decide to come in today?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Like I said, nothin’ wrong, just wanted to check. But… now that you mention it, my ears kinda ring sometimes. Not all the time, but after a long shift, definitely. And sometimes my back feels a little stiff, but I figured that's just from bendin’ and reachin’ all day. It's probably nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, the ringing in your ears and the back stiffness are good things to mention, thank you. Let’s talk about those a bit more. The ringing – is it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Uh… I think both, actually. It’s kinda hard to tell sometimes, but yeah, I reckon both. It's not super loud, more like… a high-pitched whine, you know? Comes and goes. Mostly when it's quiet. Like when I get off the boat and finally get some peace and quiet. It usually goes away after a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And you said it tends to happen after a long shift, so related to the noise level on the boat, you think?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. The engines are… they’re loud. Really loud. We got earplugs, but… sometimes I forget to put ‘em in, or they get uncomfortable after a while, so I take ‘em out. I probably should be better about that. It’s just… hard to hear people when you can't hear nothin’ at all.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – hearing protection isn't always the most comfortable thing. It’s good you’re aware of it though. Prolonged exposure to loud noise can definitely cause hearing damage, even if it doesn’t feel like a big deal at the time. And you also mentioned some back stiffness. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yeah, well… it’s mostly in my lower back. Feels kinda tight and achy after a long day. Like I said, I’m bendin’ and reachin’ all the time, checkin’ levels and stuff, movin’ hoses, that kinda thing. It usually goes away after I rest for a bit, but sometimes it’s there when I wake up in the mornin’. Not painful, exactly, just… stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like it could be muscle strain related to your work. We’ll want to check your range of motion and do a quick neurological exam just to be thorough. Would you mind if I do a quick physical exam now?
PATIENT: Nah, that's fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind at all. I figured you'd wanna check somethin', that's why I came. Just tell me if it’s gonna be uncomfortable or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Great. I will definitely let you know. Okay, first I’m just going to listen to your lungs, front and back. Deep breaths in and out for me, please. Okay, good. Everything sounds clear there. Now, I’m going to gently feel along your spine to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels particularly sore. And now I'm going to have you bend forward, backward, and side to side, just to see your range of motion. Don’t push yourself if anything feels painful. Okay, good. Reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Your strength is good as well. Everything looks pretty good overall, Demondre. Your lungs are clear, your reflexes and strength are normal, and there are no obvious neurological deficits. It does sound like you might have some muscle strain in your lower back, likely from the repetitive bending and reaching.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to hear. Muscle strain sounds better than somethin' serious. So, what do I do about it? Is there somethin’ I can take, or…? I don't really like goin' to the doctor, so I'd prefer somethin' I can do at home if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding extra trips to the doctor is a good goal. Fortunately, muscle strain is usually manageable at home. For the back stiffness, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. Heat or ice packs can also help, whichever feels better for you. Gentle stretching and low-impact exercise can help prevent it from getting worse. However, and this is important, if the pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet, you need to see a doctor right away. That could indicate something more serious. Now, regarding the ringing in your ears… We want to protect your hearing. I highly recommend consistently using earplugs when you’re on the boat, even if they're a little uncomfortable. There are different types available, so maybe we can find a pair that fits better. And avoiding loud noises as much as possible when you’re not working is a good idea.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Ibuprofen, heat or ice, and stretchin'. I can do that. And I really need to get better about the earplugs, you're right. I’ll try and find some that fit better. So, no big worries, just gotta take care of myself a little better? No need to come back unless somethin' gets worse?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You're right, it sounds like mostly taking better care of yourself and being mindful of your body. No, no need to come back unless something gets significantly worse – like the pain in your back becomes unbearable, or you develop numbness or weakness, or if the ringing in your ears gets much louder or doesn’t go away. I’ll send a summary of today’s visit to your insurance, and I'm happy to provide a work note if needed. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers everything. Work note isn’t necessary, thank you though. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen and explain everything. It’s good to know it’s probably just muscle strain and nothin’ too serious. Thanks again, Dr. Kimm.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. Remember to listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Take care, and have a safe journey on the water. .
