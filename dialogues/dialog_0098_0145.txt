DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here today for… a certification, I believe. For home health, or perhaps hospice. My… arrangements are being made, and this is required, yes? It concerns my mother.
DOCTOR: Right, yes… a certification. For home health or hospice… concerning your mother. Okay. Could you tell me a little more about why this certification is needed now?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother… she is quite unwell. She is 93 years old, and… well, she is very frail. She has trouble with… everything, really. Eating, moving… even thinking clearly some days. We have been trying to care for her at home, but it is becoming… very difficult. We are exploring options so she can be more comfortable, and receive proper care. I understand this certification confirms that she… qualifies for assistance?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. It’s essentially an assessment to determine the level of care she needs and whether she qualifies for benefits under those programs. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what's been going on with your mother?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, for the past six months, she has declined quite steadily. She had a fall in January, which… didn't break anything, thankfully, but she never fully recovered her strength. Before that, she was still quite independent, though needing a little help with cooking and cleaning. Now… she requires assistance with almost everything. She has also become very confused at times, forgetting who people are, even sometimes where she is. Her appetite is very poor, and she’s lost a considerable amount of weight. She… she mostly just sleeps now. It is… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a steady decline over the past six months, fall in January with no fractures but a loss of strength afterwards… confusion, poor appetite, and increased sleep. Has she seen a doctor recently for these issues?
PATIENT: Yes, she has. Doctor LeFevre, he is her primary care physician. She saw him just last week, actually. He confirmed… he said it was likely a combination of things, her age, of course, and… some mild dementia. He is the one who suggested we explore home health and hospice options. He provided me with this… form, requesting this certification. I brought it with me, if that is helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is very helpful, thank you. Let’s see… Doctor LeFevre’s notes here confirm what you're saying. Okay. Has she been experiencing any other symptoms – any pain, changes in bowel habits, difficulty breathing, or fever?
PATIENT: Let me think… Pain, not consistently. Sometimes she winces, but it is difficult to tell if it is actual pain or just discomfort from moving. Bowel habits… they are irregular, yes. Constipation mostly. As for breathing, she does seem to… short of breath at times, especially when she tries to do anything. And… no fever, not that I have noticed. She doesn't seem to get sick often. She mostly just… fades. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like she’s experiencing a number of challenges. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about her medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. She had… high blood pressure for many years, which was managed with medication. She also had a mild heart condition, but it was… stable for a long time. She had a hip replacement about fifteen years ago, which went very well. Other than that… she was remarkably healthy for her age, until recently. She always said it was the fresh air and good food.
DOCTOR: And what medications is she currently taking, if you know?
PATIENT: Let me see… she takes Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. And… a low dose of Aspirin, Doctor LeFevre prescribed that after the fall, to help with circulation. Oh, and… a Vitamin D supplement. That is all I believe. I manage her medications, so I would know. I keep a list, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s very helpful. Now, are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that we know of. She has never had any reactions to anything. She is… quite resilient, actually. Even at her age, she rarely gets sick. We have always been very careful with what she eats, avoiding anything processed or artificial. She had a very… simple diet. But… she did have a reaction to a bee sting when she was a child, many years ago. But that was… well, a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little about her social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, she was a teacher, for many years. She taught French, actually. She loved her work. She was married to my father for… over fifty years, but he passed away about ten years ago. I am her only child. She lives with me and my wife, in our home. She doesn't have many visitors anymore, unfortunately. Most of her friends have… passed on. She enjoys reading, when she has the energy. And… she used to love gardening, but she hasn't been able to do that for a while. It is… lonely for her now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Bahta. It's helpful to get a full picture. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, just to assess her current condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is perfectly alright. Whatever is necessary. I… I just want what is best for her.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could help her onto the table, that would be wonderful. I'll start by listening to her heart and lungs, and then check her blood pressure and temperature. Don’t hesitate to let me know if anything is causing her discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well. Please, be gentle. She is… very delicate.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible, Mr. Bahta. I understand. Her heart rate is a little fast, around 90 beats per minute, and her rhythm is regular. I'm hearing some… crackles in her lungs, mostly on the lower lobes. Blood pressure is 140 over 80, which is a little elevated, and her temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Abdomen is soft, with no tenderness noted. Some edema present in bilateral lower extremities and hands. Overall, her findings suggest some congestion in the lungs, likely related to her age and reduced mobility. The edema also suggests some fluid retention. I'll document these findings for Doctor LeFevre.
PATIENT: That… sounds concerning. Is it serious? Is she in pain? What does this mean for her care?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily an emergency, Mr. Bahta, but it does indicate that her condition is progressing. The congestion in her lungs is likely causing her shortness of breath and reduced energy levels. The edema suggests that her body is retaining fluid, which can make her feel uncomfortable and worsen her breathing. As for pain, it's difficult to say without directly asking her, but the discomfort from the congestion and edema could be contributing to her winces. These findings support what you've already told me – that she's declining and requires increased care. It does mean that we need to focus on managing her symptoms – making her more comfortable, improving her breathing, and preventing further complications. We can discuss options for doing this – including medications to help with the congestion, oxygen therapy if needed, and continued support with her daily care. And, given her overall condition, it’s important to have a conversation about hospice care, to ensure she receives the comfort and support she needs in the coming weeks or months. Before we go any further, do you have any questions about these findings?
PATIENT: Hospice… I… I had hoped to avoid that conversation, if possible. But… I understand. It is what is best for her, isn't it? I just… I want her to be comfortable. I want her to be at peace. What does hospice entail, exactly? Will she be able to stay at home? Will she… will she be in pain?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel anxious about hospice, Mr. Bahta. It’s a difficult conversation, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. Hospice care focuses on providing comfort and support to patients with a life-limiting illness. It’s not about giving up; it’s about prioritizing her quality of life in her final months or weeks. The goal is to manage her symptoms – pain, shortness of breath, anxiety – and ensure she’s as comfortable as possible. And importantly, yes, she can absolutely stay at home. Most hospice care is provided in the patient’s home, with visits from a team of nurses, doctors, social workers, and chaplains. They’ll work with you and your wife to create a plan of care that meets her individual needs. As for pain, we’ll do everything we can to manage her pain effectively. Hospice teams are experts in pain management, and they’ll use a variety of medications and therapies to ensure she’s comfortable. We can also provide emotional and spiritual support to both her and your family. It’s a very difficult time, and you don’t have to go through it alone. Would you like me to explain the different types of hospice services available, or perhaps put you in touch with a hospice representative who can answer your questions in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explaining the different services would be… helpful. I want to understand all of our options. And… perhaps a representative to speak with later, would be good as well. I… I need to think. I need to process this. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course. Take your time, Mr. Bahta. It is a lot to process. There are generally four levels of hospice care: Routine Home Care, Continuous Comfort Care, General Inpatient Care, and Respite Care. Routine Home Care is the most common level of care. A nurse will visit regularly, usually several times a week, to assess her condition, administer medications, and provide support. Aides can also assist with bathing, dressing, and other personal care needs. Continuous Comfort Care is provided for patients experiencing a crisis – perhaps a sudden increase in pain or difficulty breathing. A nurse will provide around-the-clock care for a short period of time to manage the crisis. General Inpatient Care is provided in a hospice facility or hospital for patients who require a higher level of care than can be provided at home. Respite Care provides temporary relief for caregivers, allowing you to take a break and recharge. We can discuss which level of care is right for your mother based on her individual needs. We’ll also work with you to create a plan of care that meets your family’s needs. I can provide you with the contact information for several hospice agencies in the area. They can answer your questions in more detail and schedule a consultation to assess your mother’s needs. Does that help clarify things a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… very helpful. Thank you. The routine home care sounds… the most appealing, if possible. Keeping her at home is… important to us. Could you provide me with those contact numbers? And… perhaps a list of questions I should ask them? I… I want to make sure we choose the right agency. This is… a very big decision.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are a few hospice agencies in the area that have good reputations. ComfortCare Hospice: 555-123-4567 Sunrise Hospice: 555-987-6543 Golden Years Hospice: 555-246-8080 And here are a few questions you might want to ask them: What services do you offer?
PATIENT: Are you Medicare-approved? What is your on-call policy? What is your staff-to-patient ratio? What is your experience with patients with similar conditions? What is your philosophy of care? This is… very helpful. I appreciate your patience and kindness, Doctor. I think… I think I have enough information for now. I need to discuss this with my wife. And… I need to prepare myself. This is… not going to be easy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed, and it's good that you're taking the time to consider all of your options. And you're right to discuss this with your wife. It's important to make these decisions together. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any further questions. I’m here to support you and your family in any way I can. I'll document these findings and recommendations in her chart, and I'll let Doctor LeFevre know about our conversation. Take care of yourselves, Mr. Bahta. And please, remember that you’re not alone. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Thank you again for everything. I… I suppose I should be going. Good day.
DOCTOR: Good day to you as well, Mr. Bahta. Please, take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. .
