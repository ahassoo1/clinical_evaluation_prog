DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker lately, and my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids… that is something we should look into. To help me get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started in my legs, I think. Just feeling a bit more tired after walking, or standing for a long time. Now it’s… it’s in my arms too. Lifting things is harder. It’s not a sudden thing, like I pulled a muscle or anything. It’s just… less strength, you know? And it seems worse at the end of the day. I find myself needing to sit down more often.
DOCTOR: Alright, progressive weakness in your legs and arms, worse at the end of the day… that’s helpful. And you mentioned the drooping eyelids – is that happening on one side or both?
PATIENT: Both, actually. It’s not dramatically different on either side, but if I look in the mirror, I can definitely see it. It’s more noticeable when I’m tired, like in the evenings. My wife… well, ex-wife, actually, she pointed it out first. She said I looked… sleepier than usual, even when I wasn’t. I didn't really pay attention to it then, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. Both eyelids drooping, more noticeable with fatigue... okay. And how about your vision?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I haven't really noticed any changes to my vision, not directly. Maybe things are a little blurry sometimes, but I always have needed glasses, so I just figured it was time for a new prescription. I haven’t been to the optician in a while, though. It hasn't been bad enough to warrant a visit, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant vision changes that you've noticed, other than perhaps a general blurriness you attribute to needing a new glasses prescription. Let’s talk a bit about other symptoms. Have you experienced any double vision, difficulty swallowing, or changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Double vision… no, not that I’m aware of. Difficulty swallowing… no, not really. And my speech… I don't think so. People haven't said anything, and I haven’t noticed anything myself. Though, sometimes I do feel like my voice sounds a little… quieter, maybe? It’s hard to describe. It's not constant, and I thought it might just be because I’ve been a bit run down.
DOCTOR: Alright, no double vision, difficulty swallowing, or significant changes to your speech, though you've noticed some occasional quietness in your voice. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Nothing major, no. I had chickenpox as a child, like everyone else. And I broke my arm when I was younger, but that was just a simple fracture. Oh, and I had really bad allergies when I was a teenager, but those seem to have faded as I got older. I haven't really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I usually just try to tough things out. Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: No, it's not necessarily a bad thing, Gedalya, but it's good you're here now. No significant medical history other than childhood chickenpox and a previous arm fracture, and allergies that have subsided. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid all that, thankfully. I’ve always been fairly careful, I suppose. I try to stay active, but nothing too strenuous. And I eat reasonably well. I wouldn’t say I’m a health nut, but I definitely try to avoid junk food. Is that relevant, Doctor? Should I be mentioning my diet?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Gedalya. It is relevant. A healthy lifestyle is always a plus. Let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family members with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My mother… she had something with her muscles, I think. It wasn’t a quick thing, it developed slowly over many years. She needed help with… everyday things eventually. Walking, getting up from chairs, things like that. My aunt on my father’s side had something similar, but I don't really know the details. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. I'm not sure what it was called, exactly. Something with the nerves, maybe? Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. A family history of slowly progressive muscle weakness is important information. Do you know approximately when your mother and aunt were diagnosed with this condition?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My mother… I’d say it started when she was in her fifties, maybe early sixties. It took a long time for her to get a diagnosis, she kept dismissing it as getting older. My aunt… she was older, I think. Probably in her seventies when it became noticeable. It happened a long time ago, I was quite young then. I’m afraid I don’t have many specifics. It’s all a bit hazy, honestly. Do you think it’s important that I try to find out more about it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it would be very helpful if you could try to gather more information about your mother and aunt’s conditions. Even a general name or the hospital they went to could be a good starting point. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I don’t really care for alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And absolutely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I work as a facilities manager, so I need to keep a clear head. It wouldn’t be very safe otherwise. Is that… does that matter? I suppose it’s good I don't have any of those habits, right?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Gedalya. A healthy lifestyle continues to be a positive factor. Now, finally, let’s talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Just seasonal allergies, like hay fever. Nothing serious. A bit of a runny nose, itchy eyes, that sort of thing. I occasionally take an over-the-counter antihistamine when it gets bad, but that's it. No other allergies that I'm aware of. And like I said before, no regular medications. I’ve always tried to avoid taking pills if possible. Is that everything, Doctor? Should we… should we get to the examination now? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, seasonal allergies, occasional antihistamine use, no other known allergies or medications. Yes, let’s move on to the physical exam. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, Gedalya. We'll take things one step at a time. I’m going to start by checking your vital signs - your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam, checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. I suppose it’s better to get it over with. I’ll try to relax. Please, just… tell me what you’re doing as you go along, if you wouldn’t mind? It would help me feel a little less… uneasy. And if it’s going to hurt, just let me know beforehand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Gedalya. I will explain everything as I go and let you know if anything will be uncomfortable. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal, but your breath sounds are a little quieter than they should be on the lower parts of your lungs, both sides. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. This will involve testing your reflexes, strength, and coordination. I'll start with your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit slower than normal on both sides. Now let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a bit weaker than usual, to be honest. I’m starting to worry now, Doctor. Is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya, that’s good, but not full strength. It’s consistent with what we’re finding so far. Now I'm going to ask you to do a few simple coordination tests, like touching your nose with your finger. I'm also going to check your gait – how you walk. Could you please walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that… alright? I feel a bit silly walking back and forth like this. And it is harder than I thought it would be. My legs feel a little… shaky. I'm starting to get quite nervous, Doctor. What do you think is happening? Could it be something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. I’ve completed the physical examination. Based on what I’ve observed – the drooping eyelids, slightly diminished reflexes, reduced muscle strength, unsteady gait, and mild tremor – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is a condition called Myasthenia Gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. Another possibility, given your family history, is a form of muscular dystrophy, although your age of onset is a little later than typical. However, there are many different types. To get a more accurate diagnosis, we’ll need to order some blood tests to check for antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis, as well as a Creatine Kinase level to check for muscle damage. I also recommend an Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Study, which can help assess the function of your nerves and muscles. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… what did you say? And muscular… dystrophy? Those sound… serious. My mother… was it something like that? I don’t remember exactly. Tests… yes, alright. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to know what’s happening, and what we can do about it. Will the tests be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? Is it… is it something I should be really worried about, Doctor? I'm starting to get quite scared.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're scared, Gedalya. It's good you're asking questions. Myasthenia Gravis can be managed with medication, and there are treatments available to help improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue. Muscular dystrophy has varying levels of severity depending on the specific type. It's too early to say definitively what you have, which is why the tests are so important. The EMG and Nerve Conduction Study will involve inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure electrical activity. It can be a little uncomfortable, like a mild muscle cramp, but it’s usually well-tolerated. The blood tests are routine and painless. The results typically take about a week to come back. Once we have those, we'll discuss the findings and create a plan of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. I'm also going to order a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in nerve and muscle disorders. They can provide further evaluation and treatment if necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, that sounds… alright. A neurologist, yes. And rest… I can do that. I'll try to avoid overdoing it. The blood tests and the… EMG thing… I'll schedule those as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's… it's still scary, but I feel a little less lost now. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should be looking out for? Any symptoms that I should tell you about right away?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. It’s good to hear you feel a little less lost. Yes, a few things. If you experience any difficulty breathing, double vision, or significant difficulty swallowing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those symptoms could indicate a Myasthenia Gravis crisis, which requires urgent medical attention. Also, if you notice any new weakness or muscle pain, please let me know. We also need to keep track of your fatigue levels. I'll give you a fatigue scale form to complete before your next appointment. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant to help with any discomfort you're experiencing. It's not a long-term solution, but it may provide some temporary relief. Finally, given your low weight, I recommend consulting with a registered dietitian. They can help you create a healthy eating plan to ensure you're getting enough nutrients. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… double vision… I’ll remember that. Emergency room, right. A dietitian… yes, that might be a good idea. I haven’t really been eating very well lately. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now, Doctor. Just… thank you again. I appreciate everything you’ve done. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible, and I’ll let your office know when I’ve made the appointments. Thank you, Doctor AX. You've been very helpful. I think that’s everything for now.
