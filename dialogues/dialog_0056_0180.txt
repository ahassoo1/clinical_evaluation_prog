DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do. It's… my energy. It's just gone. And I… I don't know, I been eating dirt. Not a lot, but… yeah. Dirt. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay… alright. Eating dirt, you said. And you're feeling very low energy?
PATIENT: Low energy is putting it mildly! It’s like… dragging myself through mud, and it’s not helping that I want to eat the mud. It started… well, a while ago. I don’t really keep track of dates. Just… lately it’s worse. And it’s not like… regular dirt, if that makes a difference. More… clay-like? I don’t know. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, clay-like dirt. And this has been going on for a while, getting worse recently. You said you’re feeling very low energy because of it. Is there anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? My stomach's been… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… not right. And I get headaches. Dull ones. Mostly just… annoyed all the time. Look, I’m a CNC programmer, I gotta think. This is making it hard to concentrate. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, so stomach issues, headaches, difficulty concentrating… and this is impacting your work. Have you had any changes in your appetite, or noticed any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I don’t know. Probably. I haven't been stepping on the scale, and honestly, I don't really care. I eat when I can, but… it’s not like I’m enjoying it. Everything tastes… flat. And I’m tired all the time, so cooking is… a lot. It’s just all a mess, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, food tasting bland, and fatigue. And you mentioned headaches. Have you been having any other symptoms, like dizziness, shortness of breath, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes in… what now? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to. I don't keep a log! Dizziness… sometimes, maybe? When I stand up too fast. But I’m old! Old people get dizzy. This is ridiculous. Are you going to ask me about my childhood next? I just want something to fix this, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, dizziness when standing up quickly. Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any unusual cravings for things other than dirt?
PATIENT: Cravings? Like… sweets? No. Not really. I mean, who doesn't like a little chocolate now and then? But nothing… specific. Just… the dirt. It’s stupid, I know. It just… feels like I need it. And it’s not like I'm eating handfuls, it’s just… a little. Okay? A little bit. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a craving for dirt, not a large amount, but enough to be concerning. And no other specific cravings. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Ugh. Allergies? Not that I know of. I don't take anything regularly. Painkillers if I really need them, but that's it. And no, I haven't broken out in hives or anything. Look, I'm a practical person. I don't fuss over every little thing. Is this getting somewhere or what? I got a program to finish.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, no regular medications. Okay. I'm going to ask a few questions about your past medical history, just to get a complete picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with…? Look, I’ve had the usual aches and pains. Old age, right? Nothing major. No hospitals, no surgeries. I’m pretty tough. My husband… he was the sickly one. Had all sorts of problems. I haven’t been to a doctor in… years. Honestly. Just for checkups. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, no surgeries, haven't been to the doctor in years. And your husband had some health issues. Do you know what those were, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… a lot. Diabetes, I think. And something with his heart. He needed pills, always needing pills. It was… a long time ago. I don’t really remember the details. I just… took care of him. It doesn't matter now, does it? He's gone. Can we just get back to me? I'm the one feeling awful.
DOCTOR: Of course. You're right. Let's focus on you. Okay. Do you have any family history of… anemia, or iron deficiency?
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? What does that even mean? Look, my family… we're Aztec, okay? We come from strong people. We didn't worry about… deficiencies. We ate what we had. Corn, beans… whatever we could grow. I don't know about iron. My mother… she made tea with herbs. That's all I remember. Honestly, this is all a waste of time. I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of anemia that you're aware of. Alright. And just to cover all bases, could you tell me a little bit about your diet now?
PATIENT: What do you think I eat? I work. I eat when I have time. Usually it's something quick. Sandwiches, soup… leftovers. I don't have time to cook fancy meals. And sometimes… I eat the dirt. Is that what you want to know? Look, I’m not a picky eater, but I don't spend hours in the kitchen. It’s just… simple food. Simple life. Now, are you going to help me or not? I got a deadline.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your heart, lungs, and see if I can get a sense of what might be going on. And I'd like to order some blood tests. It will help us figure out what’s causing your fatigue and, frankly, the dirt eating. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Blood tests, poking and prodding… I don't care. Just tell me what's wrong and give me something to fix it. I haven't got all day. And try not to poke too much. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. If you could just take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Your throat looks fine, and your ears are clear as well. Now, I’m going to check your skin. I notice you mentioned bruising easily. Your skin is pale, and I do see some bruising, even without me pressing hard. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Is it okay if I do that?
PATIENT: Ugh, be careful! It's… tender. I told you my stomach's been off. Don't push too hard. And hurry up. This is… uncomfortable. It just feels… weird. And don't ask me about my bowel movements again. I'm not discussing that.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m being very gentle. It is tender in the lower abdomen. No masses that I can feel, but it’s definitely sensitive. Okay. I think the blood tests are the next step. They’ll help us determine if you have any deficiencies or underlying conditions causing these symptoms. I'm ordering a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll take the samples, and we should have the results back in a few days. Here's the form. Please take this to the lab, and they'll get everything taken care of. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just tell me where it is. And can I get a glass of water? My mouth feels dry. This whole thing is… draining. Just get it over with. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: The lab is right through that door, on your left. And yes, absolutely. Here you go. Once we have the results back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. I want to understand why you're craving dirt and address your fatigue. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like fever, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go to the lab?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the results back quickly. And don't tell me it's all in my head. I know something's wrong. Look, I really need to go. I’ve wasted enough time here already. And… thanks. I guess.
