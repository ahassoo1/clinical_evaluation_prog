DOCTOR: Hi Jamill, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Amussen. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing a rather…uncomfortable sensation in my back. It’s a sort of popping or clicking sound, and sometimes I can feel it, you understand? It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and while it hasn’t gotten dramatically worse, it’s enough to be concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sound in your back for a few weeks. That’s definitely something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly in your back you’re feeling this?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to be primarily centered in my lower back, right around where my spine curves inward. Not on the spine itself, but in the muscles on either side of it. It’s…difficult to pinpoint precisely, but that’s the general area. Sometimes it radiates a bit to my sides, almost like a dull ache, though the popping sensation is the most noticeable part.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, near the curve, in the muscles… and it radiates to the sides sometimes with a dull ache. And the popping/clicking is the main thing you notice. Is this happening with any specific movements, or does it happen randomly?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. It doesn’t seem entirely random, though it's not consistently tied to one specific movement. I’ve noticed it happens more frequently when I’m bending over – like when I’m retrieving tools from the floor in the workshop, or even just tying my shoes. It also seems to occur after I’ve been sitting for a prolonged period, like during my commute. Standing up afterward often triggers it. But there have been times it's happened while simply walking, so it's a bit unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bending, especially reaching, prolonged sitting then standing, and sometimes just walking. Does anything relieve the sensation, like stretching or changing positions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Gentle stretching does provide some temporary relief. Specifically, if I do a slow back extension – you know, leaning backward very gently – it seems to loosen things up a bit. Also, changing positions frequently – not staying in one posture for too long – helps prevent it from getting worse, though it doesn't always eliminate it completely. Walking around for a few minutes usually helps more than staying still.
DOCTOR: Alright, stretching and changing positions help, walking is better than still. Have you experienced any pain associated with this – beyond the dull ache you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. The ache is the most consistent thing, but on a few occasions, I've felt a sharp, fleeting pain when the popping occurs. It's not debilitating, it lasts only a second or two, but it's enough to make me wince. It usually happens if I try to lift something a bit too quickly or bend at an awkward angle. It hasn’t been frequent, thankfully, but it’s something I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp, fleeting pain with quick or awkward movements. Have you had any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I have not experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in my legs or feet. My legs feel completely normal. I was a bit concerned about that, so I've been paying close attention to that specifically.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever had any back problems before – like injuries, surgeries, or other issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't had any significant back problems previously. I’ve had the occasional muscle strain from lifting heavy objects in the workshop – as one might expect with my occupation – but nothing that required medical attention or prolonged recovery. No surgeries, no chronic pain, nothing like that. I generally consider my back to be quite strong, which is why this is so puzzling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior back problems, just occasional muscle strains. Do you have any other medical conditions – like arthritis, diabetes, or anything else – that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m fortunate in that I don’t have any other significant medical conditions. I have slightly elevated cholesterol, which my family doctor monitors, and I take a statin for it, but otherwise, I consider myself to be in good health. No arthritis, no diabetes, nothing else that would be relevant, to my knowledge. I have private insurance, so I have regular checkups.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated cholesterol, managed with a statin, otherwise healthy. And you said you have private insurance, good. Let’s move on to medications. Besides the statin, are you taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the statin as we discussed. I do occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s infrequent – perhaps once or twice a month, if that. No other prescription medications, no regular vitamins, and no supplements. I prefer to try and manage things naturally whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no known allergies. No reactions to any medications, foods, or anything else that I’m aware of. My wife always double-checks when I try anything new, just to be safe, but I’ve never had an allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Last question before I do a quick physical exam. Can you tell me a little bit about your occupation and your typical daily activities?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned briefly before, I’m an electrical and electronics installer and repairer, specifically for transportation equipment – mostly buses and light rail vehicles. It involves a lot of bending, reaching, lifting, and working in confined spaces. My day typically involves diagnosing electrical issues, replacing faulty components, and running new wiring. I’m on my feet for most of the day, and I often have to work in awkward positions to access the equipment. It’s physically demanding work, but I enjoy it. I’m married, and outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, gardening, and occasionally restoring old electronics.
DOCTOR: Okay, physically demanding work, a lot of bending and reaching. Thank you for that information. Alright, Jamill, let’s just do a quick physical exam. If you don’t mind, could you lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to do, or if you’d prefer me to adjust my position in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I'm going to start by palpating your spine and the muscles around your lower back. I'm feeling for tenderness, muscle spasms, or any abnormalities. Okay, tell me if you feel any pain when I press here… or here… Hmm, I’m noticing some tenderness on the left side, right around the L4-L5 level. Not severe, but definitely some discomfort when I apply pressure. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do feel some discomfort there. It’s not a sharp pain, but it’s definitely noticeable when you apply pressure. It feels…similar to the sensation I’ve been experiencing, but more localized. It’s on the left side, as you said, right around where my spine curves. It doesn’t radiate at this moment, but I can feel it’s the same general area where the popping sensation originates.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now I'm going to check your range of motion. I want you to gently bend forward, as far as you comfortably can, and then sit back up. And then, gently lean back as far as comfortable, and sit back up. And finally, I want you to rotate your torso to the left and then to the right, as far as comfortable. Tell me if you experience any pain during any of these movements.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Now leaning back… And rotating… I feel some stiffness throughout all of those movements, Doctor, particularly when leaning back and rotating. It’s not a sharp, debilitating pain, but it’s noticeable. It’s…a discomfort, more than anything. The left side feels slightly more restricted than the right.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness, more restriction on the left. I'm going to check your reflexes and strength now. Just relax your legs. Okay, good. Reflexes are normal, strength is good in both legs. Alright, Jamill, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain in your lower back, potentially with some mild facet joint irritation. The tenderness on the left side and the restriction in your range of motion support that. It's not likely anything serious, but it's important to address it to prevent it from becoming a chronic problem.
PATIENT: That’s…reassuring to hear, Doctor. A muscle strain is certainly preferable to anything more serious. I was concerned it might be something related to my occupation, perhaps a more structural issue. So, what sort of treatment do you recommend?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can rule out some of those structural issues, but it's important to be mindful of your work. I recommend the following: First, rest and avoid activities that aggravate your pain. That means modifying your work duties as much as possible for the next few days. Second, apply ice to the area for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. After a few days, you can switch to heat. Third, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain. And finally, gentle stretching and low-impact exercises, like walking, can help improve your flexibility and strength. I'm also going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the spasms. It’s a low dose, and it should help you get some relief. I'll also give you some information on proper lifting techniques and back care. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable, Doctor. I can certainly modify my work duties for a few days, and I’m already accustomed to using ice or heat for minor strains. The muscle relaxant…I’m slightly hesitant about that, if I’m honest. I generally prefer to avoid medication if possible, but I understand you feel it’s necessary. What are the potential side effects of the muscle relaxant? And are there any exercises you’d specifically recommend, or any I should avoid while recovering? I wouldn’t want to exacerbate the strain.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. It's good you're thinking about that. The most common side effects of the muscle relaxant I’m prescribing are drowsiness and dizziness. That's why I’ll advise you not to drive or operate heavy machinery while you’re taking it. It can also cause dry mouth, so drink plenty of fluids. It's a low dose, and most people tolerate it well, but it’s important to be aware of the potential side effects. As for exercises, avoid anything that causes pain, especially bending, twisting, and lifting. Gentle stretching, like knee-to-chest stretches or pelvic tilts, can be helpful. Walking is good, as long as it doesn’t aggravate your pain. I’m going to give you a handout with some specific exercises and instructions. If you’re unsure about an exercise, please don’t do it. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment with you in two weeks to see how you’re doing. If your pain doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse, please call the office sooner. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…thorough, Doctor. The handout will be very helpful, and I appreciate you emphasizing the importance of avoiding exercises that cause pain. I’ll certainly be mindful of that. Two weeks seems like a reasonable timeframe for a follow-up. One final question, if you don’t mind. I sometimes experience stiffness in my back after sitting for prolonged periods, even when I’m not actively experiencing a strain. Do you have any recommendations for preventing that? Perhaps a specific type of chair, or a posture I should be striving for?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, and something a lot of people struggle with. For prolonged sitting, a chair with good lumbar support is crucial. Look for one that has an adjustable backrest and armrests. Also, make sure your feet are flat on the floor or supported by a footrest. And most importantly, get up and move around every 30 minutes. Even a short walk or some simple stretches can make a big difference. Pay attention to your posture, too. Sit up straight with your shoulders relaxed and your back supported. Avoid slouching. I'll include a link to some resources on proper sitting posture in the handout. Here’s the handout with all of the information we discussed, including the exercises, proper sitting posture, and a list of potential side effects of the muscle relaxant. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to address all of my concerns. I’ll follow your instructions carefully and schedule a follow-up appointment. Thank you again for your time, Dr. Amussen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jamill. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to listen to your body and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest and take it easy. I’ll see you in two weeks. Have a good day!
PATIENT: .
