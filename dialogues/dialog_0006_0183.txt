DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. What brings me in? Well, Doctor... it’s this tiredness. Always tired. Not like… sleepy tired. Just… done tired. Like the battery is always low. It’s been… a while, now. Maybe six months? More? Hard to say, really. It just… crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, “done tired” for six months… creeping up on you. Right. And is this tiredness interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Interfering? Yes. It is. I work with… cloth. Making things. It takes… focus. And energy! Now… I have to sit more. My wife, she does more of the lifting. Before… I could do it all day. Now? A few hours, and I need to lie down. It’s… not good. Not good at all. And the work… it’s important. We need the money.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s impacting your ability to work, specifically needing to rest more frequently… affecting your stamina. And you're noticing this over the last six months. Is there anything specific that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Not really… specific. Maybe… when it’s hot? The sun. It drains me. Always have been sensitive to heat. But… even when it’s cool, it’s still there. And… sometimes, after I eat. But not every time. It’s… confusing. I don't know what to tell you, Doctor. It just… is. Like a weight. A heavy weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, heat sensitivity and sometimes after eating… sometimes. It sounds… non-specific, you’re right. Let's try to get a better picture here. Do you notice any other symptoms alongside this tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Beside… the tiredness? Let me think… My stomach. It’s… not right. Sort of… bloated, sometimes. And… well, my skin. It feels… itchy. All over. And yellow. My wife says so, anyway. I don't look at myself much. Old man now, what’s the point? But she says I'm… a bit yellow. Is that… bad? I don’t know these things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Bloated stomach, itchy skin, and your wife noticed some yellowing of your skin… Okay. That’s… important information. Just to confirm, is this yellowing all over, or more in certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly… face, I think. And eyes. She says the whites of my eyes are… not white anymore. More… green-ish, maybe? She's very observant, my wife. Always has been. And the stomach… it’s hard to explain. Not pain. Just… full. Even when I haven’t eaten much. Like there’s a stone in there. A heavy stone. It’s… unsettling. You see? Unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing of the face and eyes, a feeling of fullness even with limited food intake… I'm going to take a quick look at your medical records here... Alright, Mr. Grumman. I want to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your skin. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam… yes. Okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My heart… it’s getting old, I suspect. Always was a bit… fast. But… yes. Do what you need to do. Just… don’t take too long, eh? I have things to do. Cloth to cut. Things to make. But… yes. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the exam table for me… Excellent. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Heart rate is a little elevated, as you mentioned… Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Abdomen… no pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. A fullness. Like a balloon. Tight. And… a bit tender, maybe, up here, on the right side. Not sharp. Just… when you push. And… it feels… swollen. Like something is growing. I don’t like it, Doctor. It doesn't feel right. And… my wife… she worries. She says I shouldn’t ignore it. She’s probably right. She always is.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the right side of your abdomen, feeling of fullness, swelling… and your wife’s concerns are noted. Now, let me just examine your skin. Yes, I do see some jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes, as your wife mentioned. Given your symptoms – the tiredness, abdominal discomfort, swelling, and jaundice – I’m concerned about a possible liver issue. I want to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your liver function. We’ll also need to do an ultrasound of your abdomen.
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Blood tests? Liver issue? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I just feel tired. And a bit uncomfortable. I cut cloth. I make things. I don’t need… serious. Is it something I ate? Something in the water? I don’t understand. Tell me… plainly. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, it’s understandable you’re worried, and I want to explain things as plainly as possible. The symptoms you’re describing could indicate a problem with your liver. The blood tests will tell us how well your liver is functioning. The ultrasound will allow us to visualize the liver and check for any abnormalities. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but we need to investigate. It could be something you ate, or something else entirely. We need those tests to find out. I'm going to have my nurse draw the blood now, and we'll schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life. Just… maybe aspirin, for a headache, sometimes. But… no allergies. And… contrast dyes? What are contrast dyes? Doctor, you’re using words I don’t understand. Just… tell me. Is this going to hurt? Will I be sick? I have things to do, you see. Things to make. I need to be strong. I need to work. Will these tests… stop me from working?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Let me break it down. Contrast dye is a liquid we sometimes use with the ultrasound to get a clearer picture of your organs. It’s usually given through an IV. It doesn’t usually cause any serious side effects, but some people experience a warm sensation. The blood tests are just a simple prick of the finger. They won't stop you from working. They just give us information. I understand you're worried about being able to continue working, and I want to assure you we'll do everything we can to get you a diagnosis quickly and get you back to your normal routine. The blood tests and ultrasound are the first steps. We need to figure out what we're dealing with before we can discuss treatment options. I want to be clear: I'm not saying you have anything serious, but we need to rule things out. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: So… blood tests, then a picture. Then you’ll know. And then… maybe I can get back to work. Is that right? Will it be long? How long will it take to get the results? My wife… she worries. I don’t want to worry her. And… is it expensive? I don’t have much money. Just… what will it cost? I need to know. Plainly. Just the cost. And how long. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Grumman. You want to know about cost and timing. The blood tests and ultrasound… we’re looking at roughly $800 to $1200 total, depending on the specifics. Medicare should cover a significant portion of that, but there may be a copay or deductible you'll be responsible for. Our billing department can give you a more accurate estimate based on your specific plan. As for timing, the blood test results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. The ultrasound will likely be scheduled within the next few days, and the results should be available within a day or two after the scan. I understand your wife is worried, and you’re concerned about the cost. I'll make sure our billing department contacts you with a clear estimate, and we’ll keep you informed every step of the way. I'll also have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results as soon as they're available. Does that help?
PATIENT: Eight hundred to twelve hundred… Medicare… copay… It’s… a lot. But… alright. I’ll speak to my wife. She’s good with these things. She handles the money. And… 24 to 48 hours for the blood… then a few days for the picture… then you’ll know. Alright. I suppose. Tell the nurse to come. I’ll let her take some blood. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining. Even if it’s… not good news. I need to know. That’s right. I need to know. Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. I'll have the nurse come in right away. Just relax, and we'll take it one step at a time. And remember, we don't have a diagnosis yet, so there's no need to worry prematurely. We're just gathering information at this point. Please let me or my staff know if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I’ll step out now to let the nurse come in.
