DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Coby’s the name. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. But this heat… it’s just getting ridiculous. I can’t handle it like I used to, that’s for sure. Never had this problem before.
DOCTOR: Right, the heat. Yes, we've been having a particularly warm spell. And it’s good you came in, it’s always best to check these things out. So, you’re saying this is a new development?
PATIENT: New development is putting it mildly. I’ve worked outside my whole life – painting, construction, you name it. August used to be no problem. Now? I feel like I’m going to melt just walking to the mailbox. It’s…uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And it's not just a little sweat, you know? It feels…different. I don’t know how to explain it. I just know it's not right.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a significant change, especially given your history of working outdoors. When you say "different," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just being hot and sweaty, like it always was. It's like… my body isn’t adjusting. Usually, you get hot, you sweat, you cool down a bit. This…it just keeps getting worse. I feel dizzy sometimes, even in the shade. And I’m tired. Really tired. More tired than a man my age should be. It's not like I've been pushing myself harder or anything. It's just… happening. And frankly, Doctor, I don't like it.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and increased fatigue along with that change in how your body responds to the heat... That's certainly concerning. Do you notice the dizziness with any specific movements, like standing up quickly?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Standing up is the worst. It’s like everything spins for a second. I have to hold onto something, usually the kitchen counter, to steady myself. Doesn’t happen every time, but often enough that I’m being careful. Used to jump up and down like a mountain goat, now I’m shuffling around like…well, you get the idea. And I’ve noticed my hands get shaky too. Not constantly, but when I’m really warm, they tremble. It’s embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a bit more to work with. Shaky hands and dizziness upon standing, along with the fatigue and altered response to heat… Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. Though I doubt poking and prodding will find anything. I’m a practical man. Usually, things sort themselves out. But if you insist. Just try not to take too long, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Coby. We'll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse while you’re lying down, then standing up. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look in your ears and throat. Then I’ll do a quick neurological assessment, just to check your reflexes and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Balance? What's my balance got to do with the heat? Honestly, Doctor. But fine. Do what you need to do. Just… don’t expect miracles. And try not to make me lie there too long. My back isn’t what it used to be. Though, truthfully, what is these days?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78. Now, let’s check it again when you sit up slowly… and then when you stand. Okay, sitting blood pressure is 130/85, pulse 82. Standing… 110/70, pulse 90. That’s a fairly significant drop in blood pressure when you stand. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears… Ears look normal. Throat is clear as well. Now for a quick balance check. Could you just stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Feet together, eyes closed. Not exactly steady, Doctor. I told you I'm not as nimble as I used to be. You don't need a fancy test to tell you that. What are you looking for anyway? I’m a practical man. I’ve never needed balancing acts in my life.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it's clear your balance is a bit compromised. That's helpful information. Now, could you try walking a few steps forward, and then backward?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? I’m not exactly a graceful dancer, Doctor. And this floor is a bit slippery. Honestly, I think I’m getting worse just standing here. This isn't helping me feel any better. It's making me anxious, that’s what it’s doing. So, what does it all mean? Am I dying?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Coby, you are not dying. But you are experiencing some concerning symptoms, and it’s good you came in to get them checked out. The significant drop in blood pressure when you stand, combined with the dizziness, shakiness, and altered response to heat, is suggestive of a condition called orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure upon standing. It can cause those symptoms you are experiencing. The fact that it’s worsened with the heat could be contributing. Now, there are several potential causes for orthostatic hypotension. It can be related to dehydration, medication side effects, or underlying conditions affecting your heart or nervous system. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and kidney function tests. I also want to check your heart rhythm with an EKG. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work, EKG… More tests. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a waste of time. I’m telling you, it’s the heat. Just a bit of a rough summer. But fine. If you insist. But don’t go sending me off to some specialist, alright? I’m a practical man. I don’t need fancy tests and complicated explanations. Just tell me if it’s serious, and if I need to stay out of the sun. And make it quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. I understand your hesitation. I won't send you to a specialist unnecessarily. The blood work and EKG will give us a baseline to work with and help rule out anything serious. If the results are normal, we can likely manage this with simple measures, such as staying hydrated, avoiding prolonged sun exposure, and moving slowly when changing positions. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood now, and then we’ll get you hooked up to the EKG machine. It’s a quick and painless test. While we’re waiting for the results, let’s review your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with bee stings, pollen, nothing. My wife used to try and get me to take something for hay fever, but I always told her I was fine. Tough as nails, that’s what I was. And she respected that. She always said I was too stubborn for my own good. She's gone now, you know. Passed away a few years back. Good woman. Didn't believe in doctors much either. Said they just make things worse. But I’m here, aren’t I? So, what’s this EKG thing entail? More poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like she was a strong woman. It takes courage to seek medical attention, especially when someone close to you has different views. And no, the EKG isn't poking or prodding. It's completely painless. We'll simply place some small adhesive patches on your chest, arms, and legs, and they’ll record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. It helps us check for any irregularities in your heart rhythm. Now, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a few years back. But the doctor took me off it. Said I was fine, didn't need it anymore. Can't remember the name of it. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. Nothing else. Honestly, I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel weak. I prefer to tough things out on my own. It's probably just old age, anyway. Everything starts to fall apart eventually. But don't tell anyone I said that.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no current medications, apart from the occasional multivitamin. And you were previously on blood pressure medication, but it was discontinued. That's helpful information. Now, a quick question about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. Heart disease… the doctor did say my heart was a bit enlarged, a few years back, during a checkup. But he said it wasn't anything to worry about. Just a bit bigger than normal, he said. I’ve never had any trouble with my kidneys, not that I know of. I drink plenty of water, always have. Used to work on the construction site, you need to stay hydrated. Oh, and I broke my leg when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago. Doesn’t count, does it? It healed just fine. Practical man, remember? I heal quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, enlarged heart noted, and a history of a broken leg as a child. And no history of kidney problems. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or children – who have been diagnosed with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… Family history. That’s a tough one. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. Died of a stroke, actually. Pretty sudden. My mother, she lived a long life, but she wasn’t one for doctors either. Never talked much about her health. I have a brother, he’s still alive, lives up in the mountains. I haven't seen him in years. He's a bit of a recluse. Don’t know anything about his health. And I never had any children. Just me. So, not much help there, I’m afraid. Not a very healthy bunch, if you ask me. But then again, we were practical people. We didn’t dwell on things. We just kept going.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a clearer picture. High blood pressure and stroke in the family. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife couldn’t stand the smell. Alcohol… I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, a long time ago. But I haven’t had a drink in years. Don’t care for it much, to be honest. And recreational drugs? What do you take me for? I’m a practical man. Always have been. I've lived a clean life, Doctor. You can write that down. A clean, practical life. Though I suppose everyone has their vices, don’t they? But mine weren’t along those lines. Just hard work and a bit of stubbornness. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, non-smoker, rarely drink alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Very good. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, do you have any allergies to latex, iodine, or any other medical supplies?
PATIENT: Latex… Hmm. Can’t say I’ve ever had any trouble with latex. Gloves or anything. Iodine… never thought about it. I don’t think so, but I don’t pay much attention to those things. I just let the doctors do what they need to do. I suppose if I was allergic to something, I’d know about it by now, wouldn't I? I'm a practical man. I've survived a lot of bumps and bruises in my life. A little iodine isn't going to hurt me. But if you're worried, just use whatever is safest. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just get on with it. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Let’s begin with the physical exam. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, examine your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just try not to poke around too much, alright? My back isn’t getting any younger. And be gentle. I’m a practical man, but I’m not made of steel. But do hurry. I have things to do. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78, temperature is 98.6, and respiratory rate is 16. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint, as I noted before. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen – gently press on your stomach to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Not particularly comfortable, Doctor. My stomach’s a bit sensitive, always has been. Probably from all the hard work over the years. And maybe a bit of indigestion. But nothing serious, just a bit of discomfort. And honestly, it's a bit unnerving having someone poke around in there. I'm a practical man, but I don't appreciate being prodded and poked. Just get on with it, alright? Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’ll tap on your tendons with a small hammer. And now the other side. And finally, I'll check your foot reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again, and this time I'll listen for any murmurs or irregularities. I do detect a faint murmur, but it's not particularly concerning at this time. Overall, the physical exam is within normal limits, with some diminished reflexes and a faint murmur. But the most concerning finding is still the significant drop in blood pressure upon standing, as well as the dizziness and shakiness you've been experiencing. Now, let's discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? What does that mean, exactly? Is it serious? I don't want any complicated procedures, Doctor. I'm a practical man. I just want to know what's going on, and what I can do about it. And don't tell me it's all in my head. I know my own body. Something's not right. But frankly, I suspected as much. All this poking and prodding isn't making me feel any better. So, what's the plan? What are we going to do about it? And can we hurry things up, alright? I have things to do. Things a practical man needs to get done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Let's not jump to conclusions. A murmur simply means there’s an extra sound when your heart beats. It can be caused by a variety of factors, most of which are not serious. In your case, it's faint, and I don’t believe it’s immediately concerning. But it’s something we need to monitor. As for the dizziness and shakiness, the most likely cause is orthostatic hypotension, as we discussed earlier. To confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a few more tests. I’m going to order a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function tests, a lipid panel, and an EKG. I’d also like to perform a tilt table test to see how your blood pressure responds when you change positions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A tilt table test? What is that, exactly? Sounds…uncomfortable. I don't like the sound of that, Doctor. I'm a practical man, I'm used to standing on my own two feet, not being strapped to a table. And honestly, all these tests… it's a waste of time and money. I don’t like being poked and prodded. I just want to know what's causing the dizziness and shakiness, and what I can do about it. Is it serious? Am I dying? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I don't want any complicated explanations or fancy procedures. Just the truth, alright? And can we hurry things up? I have things to do. Things a practical man needs to get done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. You are not dying. Let me assure you of that. The tilt table test is a relatively simple procedure. You'll be lying on a table that tilts you slowly to an upright position while we monitor your blood pressure and heart rate. It helps us determine if your blood pressure drops significantly when you change positions, which would confirm the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. It can cause some dizziness or lightheadedness, but we'll be right there with you to ensure your safety. As for the tests, I understand your hesitation, but they are necessary to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. For example, we need to check your electrolytes to see if you’re dehydrated, and we need to check your kidney function to see if your kidneys are working properly. And the EKG will help us rule out any heart problems. If the results of the tests are normal, the most likely diagnosis is orthostatic hypotension, which can be managed with simple measures, such as staying hydrated, increasing your salt intake, avoiding prolonged sun exposure, and moving slowly when changing positions. But we need to rule out other potential causes first. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Do what you need to do. But I’m not promising I’ll enjoy it. And if it turns out to be nothing serious, I expect an apology. A sincere apology. I don’t like wasting my time and money on unnecessary tests. But if it puts my mind at ease, I suppose I can tolerate it. Just hurry things up, alright? I have things to do. Things a practical man needs to get done. And please, try not to poke and prod too much. My back isn’t getting any younger. So, what’s first? Blood work? And how long is all this going to take? I have things to do, you know. Things a practical man needs to get done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. First, we’ll draw some blood for the complete blood count, electrolytes, and kidney function tests. That should only take a few minutes. Then, we’ll perform an EKG, which will also take just a few minutes. After that, we’ll schedule you for the tilt table test, which will take about 30-60 minutes. The results of the blood work and EKG should be available within a day or two, and we can schedule the tilt table test for later this week. Once we have all the results, we’ll discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle. I don't like needles. My practical nature doesn't extend to enjoying being poked and prodded. Just get it over with. And then I can get on with my day. I have things to do, you know. Things a practical man needs to get done. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. I'll let the nurse know to be gentle. She'll be right in. Thank you for your patience. And Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: What? Don't tell me you've forgotten something already. I haven’t got all day, you know. Honestly…
DOCTOR: No, no. Just...try to relax. And remember to drink plenty of fluids between now and your next appointment. That might help with the dizziness. .
PATIENT: Hmph. .
