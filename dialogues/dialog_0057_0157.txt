DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Sieh. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. My husband drives me, and he hates waiting around. The nurse said something about my blood pressure being high? I just… want to know what I need to do to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can definitely get to the bottom of this efficiently. High blood pressure is something we want to address, and it’s good you’re getting it checked. Just to clarify, the nurse took your blood pressure during intake, and it was a little elevated. Do you have any idea what your usual blood pressure readings are, if you've had it checked before?
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? I haven’t really… paid attention before. My mother always said doctors just try to scare you into taking pills. I don't have any numbers or anything. I only go when something's really wrong. Honestly, I don’t see the point in numbers if they're just going to tell me I'm doing something wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate you being honest with me. It's true that sometimes it can feel like doctors are pushing medication, but my goal is always to help you understand what’s going on with your health and work with you to find the best solution—not just prescribe a pill. "Elevated" means the force of your blood against your artery walls is a bit higher than what we’d like to see. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong right now, but consistently high blood pressure can increase your risk for things like heart disease and stroke down the road. That’s why it's important to understand what's happening. We can check it again today to get a more accurate reading. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Is it going to hurt? And will it take long? My husband is waiting in the car, and he gets… impatient.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt at all. It’s a very simple, painless procedure. We just wrap a cuff around your arm, and it inflates for a moment to stop blood flow, then slowly releases. It takes just a couple of minutes, honestly. If you'd like, you can sit right here and we'll get it done quickly. I'll explain what the numbers mean as soon as we have them.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Just… hurry. And don’t try to tell me I need to change my whole life. I eat normal food. My husband cooks. I don't see what the problem is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I promise I'm not here to tell you to overhaul your life. We'll look at the numbers together and discuss what they mean for you. Sometimes small adjustments can make a big difference, and we'll tailor any recommendations to fit your lifestyle. Okay… your blood pressure is 158/92. That is elevated. Do you feel okay right now?
PATIENT: 158… what even is that? And what's the other number? I feel… normal. A little stressed, maybe, because you're poking my arm and making me talk about numbers. My husband always says doctors just want to find something wrong so they can make more money. Is that true?
DOCTOR: I understand why you'd feel that way, and it's perfectly reasonable to be skeptical. The top number, 158, is your systolic pressure—that's the force when your heart beats. The bottom number, 92, is your diastolic pressure—that’s the force when your heart rests between beats. A normal blood pressure is generally considered to be around 120/80. Your numbers are higher than that, and that’s why we need to explore this further. It doesn't automatically mean something is terribly wrong, but it does mean we should investigate to see if there’s an underlying cause or risk factors. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your health history and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. My husband is probably fuming right now. And don’t ask me about exercise. I do enough. I keep the house clean. Isn't that enough? Ask whatever you need to, but I'm warning you, I don’t remember a lot of details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, we’ll take it slow. Keeping the house clean is definitely work! First, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. My mother always handled the doctor stuff. I went when she told me to. She said I was healthy enough. I haven’t really… been sick, not seriously. A few colds, maybe. And a bad flu once. But nothing… official. I don’t do regular checkups. Waste of time. What about my husband? Does his health matter too? He's the one who drives me around.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It's helpful to have a general idea. It's alright if you don't remember specifics. Your health is what matters most right now. And yes, your husband's health can be relevant, especially when it comes to family history, but we’ll focus on you for now. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I had all my tonsils out when I was a kid, I guess. That’s about it. I haven’t been to a hospital since. It’s a scary place. And I don’t like doctors poking around. Are you almost done with these questions? I’m getting a headache. Maybe it’s my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Tonsils out is helpful information, thank you. And you're right, hospitals can be scary. We're almost through the initial questions, I promise. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother had something with her heart, I think. She was really old when she died. My mother always said it was just old age. And my uncle… he drank a lot. I don’t think that counts as a medical condition. He just… wasn't very careful. Honestly, I don’t keep track of all that family stuff. It’s depressing. Is this getting me anywhere? I still don't know what I need to do to fix this blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in the family are good to know, even if it was just mentioned. And you are right, that's helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No! Never. My mother would kill me. And it’s disgusting. Makes you smell awful. I don't even like being around people who smoke. I don’t understand how people do that. Next question. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Never smoking is fantastic. Okay, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, if it's been a bad week. My husband drinks beer. He likes sports. It's normal. Doesn’t everyone drink a little? Does that matter? I’m starting to feel really annoyed. This is ridiculous. I just want a pill, if that’s what it takes. Why do you need to know everything?
DOCTOR: It's good to know. A glass or two of wine with dinner is not necessarily a problem, and it’s good you’re aware of your intake. I’m asking so I can get a complete picture of your health and determine the best course of action. Sometimes lifestyle factors play a big role in blood pressure. Okay. I want to be respectful of your time, and I understand your frustration. So let's talk about the blood pressure reading. We need to find out why it's elevated. There are several possibilities, and we need to rule some things out. Would you be okay with me listening to your heart and lungs, and taking a quick look at your throat?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But if you find anything wrong, I'm blaming you. I told you I was fine before I came in here. I'm sure it’s just stress. All these questions and poking around… it’s enough to raise anyone’s blood pressure. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily something to be alarmed about, but we should investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Your throat looks fine, no redness or swelling. Now, given your blood pressure reading and the murmur I heard, I’d like to order a few tests. We’ll do a basic blood panel to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. And I’d also like to get an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Seriously? I thought I just needed a pill. My husband is going to be furious. He hates when I have to go to the doctor. And I don't like hospitals… or labs… or whatever you need to do these tests. Can’t you just give me something for the blood pressure and see if that works? I don't want to waste any more time with this. I have things to do. Is an EKG… painful? I swear, if this is going to be a whole ordeal…
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I truly wish we could just prescribe something and be done with it. However, it's important to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before starting any medication. Simply treating the symptom without knowing the cause could mask an underlying issue. An EKG is completely painless. It involves placing small, sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn't involve any needles or discomfort at all. It takes just a few minutes. The blood panel will require a small blood sample. I promise to make this as quick and easy as possible. We can schedule both tests for the same appointment at the lab down the street. I can even write a note for your husband explaining everything. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But you better make it fast. And don't let them poke me too much. And if I start feeling dizzy or anything, I want to know what's going on. I don’t want to just sit there and be helpless. Just write the note for my husband, and let’s get this over with. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I will write a detailed note for your husband explaining the tests, and I’ll make sure the lab technicians know you're feeling anxious and to take it slow and explain everything to you. We’ll also have a nurse check on you frequently. I'm ordering a complete blood panel – including a metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone – and an electrocardiogram. I'll also note your expressed anxiety about the tests. Here's the note, and here’s a referral for the lab. It’s just a few blocks away. The receptionist at the front desk can give you directions if needed. Before you go, I want to emphasize that if you start feeling dizzy or experience any chest pain, you need to tell someone immediately. Please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I just want to go home. I hope you're right about this being fast. And I hope my husband doesn’t yell at me for wasting his time. Thank you… I guess. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. I hope the tests go smoothly, and we’ll get the results back quickly. Please call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We’re here to help. .
