DOCTOR: Hi Aeisha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Rosanova. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a reset, or maybe a jumpstart. I’m not quite sure how to explain it. I just don’t feel like myself lately, and I’m hoping you can help me figure out what that means.
DOCTOR: Okay, "stuck" and not feeling like yourself… that’s a good place to start. It's perfectly alright if it's hard to put into words. Let’s try to unpack that a little. When did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It didn’t happen suddenly, it was more…gradual. I suppose if I had to pick a time, maybe six months ago? Things just started to feel…heavier, I guess. Not necessarily bad, just…less bright. I’ve been trying to push through it, but it’s not really getting any better. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. A gradual onset is very common. Six months of feeling this way is definitely worth looking into. Can you tell me a little more about what “heavier” feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to describe. It’s like everything requires more effort. Getting out of bed, even things I usually enjoy… cooking, spending time with my husband. I feel… drained, constantly. And I'm a little more irritable than usual, I think. He’s very understanding, but I can tell it’s… noticeable. It's not sadness, exactly, more like…a weariness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased effort for everyday tasks, a sense of drain, some irritability, and a general weariness – not necessarily sadness. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My sleep hasn’t been the best. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, but I wake up several times during the night. And I don't feel rested when I wake up, even if I’ve slept for a full eight hours. As for appetite… it’s definitely decreased. I don’t really feel hungry very often, and when I do eat, it’s usually not much. It’s not intentional dieting, I just don't have the desire for food like I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, disrupted sleep and decreased appetite… those can definitely contribute to feeling worn down. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been generally healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I do have…high blood pressure, I was diagnosed about five years ago. I take medication for it, as prescribed by my primary care doctor, and it’s usually well-controlled. Other than that… no, nothing significant. I’ve been with the same doctor for twenty years, and he always says I’m a remarkably healthy woman, for my age. It's why this is so strange.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and it’s helpful that your blood pressure is generally well-controlled. Sometimes even well-managed conditions can impact how we feel. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. I've always been a bit… cautious when it comes to those. I prefer to avoid them if at all possible. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but that wasn’t a surgery, of course. Just a lot of bed rest and chicken soup! Honestly, I feel like I’m rambling a bit. I’m just trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all! It's good you're being thorough. Okay, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit tricky. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father…he had heart problems. He passed away when he was fairly young, I believe it was a heart attack. On my husband's side, his mother had arthritis, quite severely. I don’t think there’s anything else… not that I’m aware of. It’s been a while since we talked about family history in detail, to be honest. We haven’t had a major health scare in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, and arthritis in your husband’s mother. Good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I live with my husband, as I mentioned. We have a small house with a garden, which I enjoy tending to when I have the energy. I used to be quite active – I loved to dance, and we used to go hiking regularly. But lately, with feeling so tired, I haven’t been doing much of either. I work as a…well, I suppose you'd call it a molder, shaper, and caster. I work with clay and other materials to create sculptures and decorative pieces. It’s a very physical job, but it’s also quite fulfilling. I’ve been doing it for over twenty years. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I’m probably not as healthy as I should be, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a physically demanding but fulfilling job, no smoking or heavy alcohol use. That's good. One last thing about your history – do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My primary care doctor always double-checks when prescribing new medications, and I haven't had any issues. I've eaten all sorts of foods throughout my life, and I haven't had any problems with food allergies either. I’m very lucky in that regard. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's excellent. Alright, Aeisha, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a really good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Great. Your reflexes are good, and your lungs sound clear. Pulse is a little elevated, and blood pressure is a bit higher than ideal, but not drastically so. I'm also going to take a look at your throat and ears, and briefly examine your abdomen. Everything seems physically normal at this point, which is good. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, the weariness, the disrupted sleep, and the decreased appetite – and the fact that the physical exam is unremarkable, I'm considering a few possibilities. It could be related to stress, or possibly a vitamin deficiency. It could also be a sign of something else, such as early menopause or, less likely, a thyroid issue despite the normal palpation. To rule things out, I'd like to order some blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea to rule things out. I trust your assessment. I’m honestly just hoping to figure out what’s going on and get back to feeling like myself again. So, yes, please order the blood work. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. We'll also check your iron levels. The lab technician will need a small blood sample. They’re just down the hall. Once we have the results, which usually takes a few days, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, just the Lisinopril for my blood pressure, as I mentioned before. The dosage is 20mg daily. I’ve been on it for about five years now, and it usually keeps things well-controlled. I haven’t changed the dosage or anything recently. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but it’s not a regular thing, more like when I remember. No other medications, herbal supplements, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, and an occasional multivitamin. Good to know. We’ll make a note of that. Before you go, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, I suppose. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I guess… what’s the typical next step if the blood work comes back normal? I’m just trying to prepare myself for all possibilities.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question. If the blood work comes back normal, which is certainly possible, we would then start looking at other potential factors. It could be related to stress management, sleep hygiene, or even dietary adjustments. We might consider a referral to a therapist or a nutritionist. We could also explore more in-depth testing, but we’ll cross that bridge if we need to. The important thing is to not dismiss your symptoms, even if the initial tests are normal. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Do you have any concerns about the blood draw itself?
PATIENT: No, not really. I'm not particularly fond of needles, but I’ve had blood work done plenty of times before. I know it’s a necessary evil. I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time and patience, Doctor Rosanova. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aeisha. I'm glad I could help, and I appreciate your patience. The lab technician will be right with you, and they’re very skilled. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can go about your day as usual. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Here’s the requisition form. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
