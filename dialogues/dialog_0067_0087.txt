DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Croonquist, yes. Look, I just… need some lab work done, if that’s alright. Medicare covers it, I think. Honestly, I can't really remember why I need it, just that the lady on the phone said I did. Is that enough? I haven’t got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. We can definitely get some lab work ordered for you. It's common to forget the specifics, especially when it comes to routine tests. Let me pull up your record here... Okay, I see a note about a yearly wellness check with some recommended labs. Just to be sure, and to help me understand your overall health, could you tell me if you’ve been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Different? Hmm. Well, I'm 73, Doctor. Everything feels different these days! Joints ache, that sort of thing. Can’t remember where I put my keys half the time. Is that what you mean? I eat… mostly. Sleep when I can. Look, I really don’t have any major complaints, if that helps. Just the usual old man stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Croonquist. “Usual old man stuff” is perfectly valid! It's good you're able to articulate that. The aches and forgetfulness you mention are common at your age. Just to get a more complete picture, let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently, besides just “mostly” eating?
PATIENT: Appetite… weight… Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been on a scale in… well, a long time. I eat when I’m hungry, and sometimes when I’m not. Probably lost a bit of weight, everything seems looser than it used to be, but I haven’t been keeping track. I mostly just want this lab work done, if we can get to it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, no problem at all. We can certainly focus on getting that lab work done. Just a couple more quick questions, then we’ll get that ordered for you. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… No, not that I recall. It’s been hot, of course. Very hot. But no shivering or anything like that. Night sweats… maybe? I do sleep with a fan on, always have. It gets stuffy. Look, I'm a simple man, Doctor. No fancy illnesses, I hope. Just need the tests.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. We're just covering all the bases. Now, thinking about your past medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions… Oh, dear. That’s a long time ago. I think… I think the doctor once mentioned my blood pressure was a little high, years and years ago. Put me on some pills, I think. But I don’t take anything regularly now. Honestly, my memory is just… shot. I’ve seen a lot of doctors over the years, you understand. They all say the same things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll do our best to piece everything together. Do you remember the name of those pills for your blood pressure, or roughly when you were taking them?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I really don't. Little white pills, maybe? Or blue? It was a long time ago, and I stopped taking them when… well, when I started forgetting to take them, probably. Honestly, it’s all a blur. Can we please just get to the lab work? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. We can definitely get to the lab work. I apologize for asking so many questions, but it's important for me to have a complete picture of your health. Now, just to confirm, you said you're currently not taking any medications?
PATIENT: That’s right. None. Nothing. Just… old age and a bad memory. Look, I appreciate you trying, Doctor, but I really need to get going. I think. I think I brought my insurance card... somewhere.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. Let's focus on getting that lab work ordered. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Those will give us a good baseline understanding of your overall health. Do you have your Medicare card with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I think so. Here it is. Everything’s a mess in here, you understand. Don't expect much organization.
DOCTOR: Perfect, thank you. Okay, I've got your insurance information entered. The lab order is now sent electronically to the lab across the street. They'll be expecting you. You don’t need an appointment, just walk over there when you have a chance. They'll take your blood sample, and the results should be back to us in about three to five business days. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Three to five days… alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient. I appreciate it. I just hope they don't poke me too much. And… could you remind me where exactly this lab is? My sense of direction isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. It’s no problem at all. It’s right across the parking lot, in the medical building next to the bakery. You can’t miss it. And don’t worry, the phlebotomists there are very skilled. Here, I’ll print you a copy of these lab orders and a map to the lab. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And we'll follow up with you once the results are in. Have a good day, Mr. Croonquist. And try not to worry about the poking!
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. Very kind of you. I appreciate it. Yes, a good day to you too. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I think I'll go find some coffee.
