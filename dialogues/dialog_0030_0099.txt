DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Quicksey. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, I believe it was called an endoscopy… and it seems there was something… abnormal detected. I’m not entirely sure what it means, that’s why I’m here. I received a letter requesting I come in for a discussion.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be unsettling to receive results without a clear explanation. An endoscopy, yes, that’s a procedure where we look at the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It’s good you came in to discuss this. Do you happen to have that letter with you, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here you are. It’s a bit… disorganized in here, I apologize. My late husband always said I carried everything but the kitchen sink.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Don’t worry about the organization, it’s perfectly alright. Okay, it appears the endoscopy report indicates a polyp was found in your stomach. It’s described as… approximately 8 millimeters in size. Now, polyps are fairly common, Ms. Minatra, and most are benign – meaning not cancerous. However, because of the size and to be certain, we need to determine the best course of action. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Eight millimeters… No, I don't believe so. I was quite healthy, always have been, really. A little arthritis in my knees, but nothing a bit of walking doesn’t help. My husband… bless his soul… he was the one with the ailments. High blood pressure, mostly. But me? No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything significant. I do take a daily vitamin, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And the daily vitamin is helpful; it’s always good to prioritize health. Just to clarify, when you say walking helps your arthritis, is it more of a stiffness you experience, or do you have significant pain with movement?
PATIENT: It’s mostly stiffness, Doctor. Especially in the mornings. And after I’ve been sitting for too long. A good walk gets the joints moving, you know? It doesn’t cure it, of course, but it certainly makes things more manageable. No sharp pain, thankfully. Just… a creakiness. Like an old door, perhaps. I apologize for the analogy.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Ms. Minatra. That’s a very apt description, actually. We all describe things in our own way. So, no sharp pain, just stiffness that improves with movement. That’s helpful information. Now, regarding the polyp… to get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with, we’ll need to do a biopsy. This involves taking a small sample of the polyp during another endoscopy and sending it to the lab for analysis. Are you familiar with biopsies?
PATIENT: A biopsy… yes, I believe the technician mentioned something about that during the first procedure. Something about “checking it closely.” It didn’t sound… pleasant, but I trusted him. Is it painful, Doctor? I must admit, I’m a little nervous. I haven’t had many procedures in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be nervous, Ms. Minatra. It’s not something anyone looks forward to. The endoscopy itself involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end, which is gently inserted through your mouth. During the biopsy, a small tool is passed through the tube to take a tiny sample of the polyp. Most patients don’t experience significant pain during the procedure, though you might feel some pressure or discomfort. We can also give you medication to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. It's usually well-tolerated. Would you like me to explain the preparation process for the endoscopy and biopsy?
PATIENT: That… that does sound a little more manageable knowing there is medication available. Pressure and discomfort… I can tolerate that, I think. Yes, please, Doctor. Could you explain the preparation? What will I need to do beforehand? I want to be as prepared as possible. And… how long does the whole thing take, generally?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The preparation is the most important part. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure. That means no solid foods, and only clear broths, water, clear juices – things you can see through. We’ll give you a detailed list. The day before, you’ll also need to take a bowel preparation – a laxative solution – to completely empty your colon. This is important so the doctor can get a clear view during the endoscopy. It’s not the most pleasant part, I’ll admit, but it’s crucial for an accurate examination. The procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You’ll be given medication to sedate you, so you likely won’t remember much of it. Afterward, you’ll stay in the recovery area for a few hours until the sedation wears off. Do you have any questions about any of that so far?
PATIENT: A clear liquid diet… and a… laxative solution. That does not sound particularly appealing. A full 24 hours… I do enjoy my meals, Doctor. But I understand it’s necessary. And sedation… that is reassuring. Would I be able to… drive myself home afterwards? Or would I need someone to accompany me? I do not want to be a burden on anyone, but I also do not want to risk anything.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Minatra. Absolutely not. Due to the sedation, you cannot drive yourself home. You will need someone to accompany you and stay with you for at least 24 hours afterward. The sedation can affect your judgment and coordination, and we want to ensure your safety. It’s also best to avoid making any important decisions or operating heavy machinery for the rest of the day. Do you have someone who can accompany you?
PATIENT: That is… a slight complication. My son lives quite far away, and he is very busy with his work. I have a neighbor, Mrs. Rodriguez, who is very kind, but she has a bad back and I wouldn’t want to impose on her. Perhaps… I could ask my granddaughter, Isabella? She is a student at the university, and I believe she has some free time next week. I would need to check with her, of course. This is… more complicated than I anticipated.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Minatra. It’s understandable that it’s more complicated than anticipated. Let’s focus on Isabella. If she’s available, that would be wonderful. If not, we can explore other options. The clinic has a list of resources that may be able to assist with transportation and post-procedure care. We won't schedule the procedure until you have confirmed arrangements for someone to accompany you. To move forward, let’s discuss your medical history in a little more detail. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: That is… very kind of you, Doctor. Knowing there are other options is a relief. I will speak with Isabella immediately. Allergies… hmm. Not that I am aware of. I have taken penicillin in the past, without issue. And I have had a tetanus booster recently. No reaction to those, either. I do have sensitive skin, and I sometimes get a rash from certain perfumes, but that is all. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. No known medication allergies is helpful. And sensitive skin is good to note. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the daily vitamin, Doctor. It’s a standard multivitamin. Nothing else. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in the power of good food and fresh air.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Minatra. A healthy lifestyle is the best medicine. Now, let’s briefly discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I recall. I had my tonsils removed as a child, but that was a very long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was a young girl, but it healed perfectly. Nothing serious, Doctor. Mostly just minor ailments… colds, the flu… the usual things. I’ve always been quite fortunate with my health, really.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Minatra. And we’ll consider you fortunate until proven otherwise. One final question regarding your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, like my husband. And my father… he developed diabetes later in life. But other than that… not that I am aware of. My siblings are all relatively healthy, as far as I know. There was an aunt, on my mother’s side, who had… stomach problems, I believe. But it was a very long time ago, and I don’t recall the specifics. It’s difficult to say, really. Families are large, and memories fade.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Minatra. It's common for family medical histories to be incomplete. High blood pressure and diabetes are good to note, and we’ll keep the aunt’s stomach problems in mind. Okay, so to summarize, you have no known allergies, you're currently taking only a multivitamin, you’ve had your tonsils removed as a child and broke your arm once, and there is a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and possible stomach problems. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… remarkably accurate, Doctor. You are very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to gather all of this information. It makes me feel… more prepared, and less anxious. So, what are the next steps? And when might we be able to schedule this procedure, assuming Isabella is available?
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could put your mind at ease a little, Ms. Minatra. Thoroughness is important. The next step, as we discussed, is to schedule the endoscopy and biopsy. We need to do this to determine the nature of the polyp and rule out anything serious. I would like to get it done within the next two weeks, ideally. If Isabella is available, please let the receptionist know, and they can find a suitable appointment time. She will need to be able to drive you home and stay with you for 24 hours afterward. After the procedure, the polyp will be sent to the lab for analysis, and it typically takes about a week to get the results. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all of my questions. Thank you again for your time, your patience, and your thoroughness. It has been a very helpful consultation. I will speak with Isabella immediately, and I will let the receptionist know as soon as possible. Perhaps… perhaps it is not as frightening as I initially thought. Thank you.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Minatra. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Quicksey. I will. Thank you again for everything. Goodbye.
