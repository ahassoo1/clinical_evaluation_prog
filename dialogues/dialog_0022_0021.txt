DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my foot. It's been swelling up, mostly on this side <gestures to left foot>. It’s been getting worse over the last few days. Not sure what I did, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Swelling in the left foot, getting worse over the last few days. And you haven’t recall any specific injury that might have caused it?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothin’ I can think of. I’ve been doin’ my usual, you know? Work, a little walkin’… I work at the bank, loan stuff. Mostly sittin’ though, so it’s not like I’m on my feet all day. It just… started. Felt a little tight, then boom, big as a grapefruit, almost. <gestures again to his foot with a slight grimace>
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first notice the tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… around last Saturday, I reckon. Saturday the 26th of July. I was watchin’ the football game, and I noticed it felt a bit achy after. Didn’t think much of it at the time, just put my feet up. But then Sunday it was a little worse, and then each day after… well, you see it now. It’s not really painful, more just… uncomfortable. Heavy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started last Saturday, the 26th of July, with a bit of achiness, and has gradually worsened since then. You mentioned it’s uncomfortable and heavy, but not particularly painful. Do you notice any redness or warmth to the foot along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is warm. I hadn’t really paid attention to it ‘til you asked, but yeah, it’s warmer than my other foot. And… now that I look, it’s kinda reddish, too. Not bright red, but… yeah, you’re right. It’s a bit red around the ankle part especially. It feels tight all over, but the redness is mostly around here <points to the inner part of his left ankle>.
DOCTOR: Okay, good observation. Warmth and redness are important to note. Have you noticed any changes in the skin texture?
PATIENT: Skin texture… let me see. It feels… kinda smooth, still. Not rough or bumpy or anything. It doesn't feel different than usual, if that makes sense. It's just swollen and reddish. I dunno if that changes the texture, but it feels the same to me. <He flexes his foot slightly, looking down at it carefully>. No blisters or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no blisters and the skin texture feels normal. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothin’ like that. I’m pretty healthy, to be honest. I eat alright, try to walk when I can. Never been diagnosed with anything serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothin'. I don’t even take regular medication, ‘cept maybe an aspirin now and then if I get a bad headache. <He pauses> I don’t have insurance, so I don’t go to the doctor unless I really need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Not a fan of ‘em, to be honest. <He gives a small chuckle> I managed to avoid all that. Just a few broken bones when I was a kid, but those healed up just fine. Nothing major, nothing that would bother me now. Just the usual scrapes and bruises.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, just some childhood broken bones. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can take most things, to be honest. I've taken penicillin before, and I’ve had a few shots over the years, and never had a reaction. Nothing comes to mind, sir. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. <He shrugs slightly>. I don't keep track of that kind of stuff, though. I just take what the doctor gives me. If it helps, good. If not, well…<He trails off>.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have a family history of blood clots or swelling in the legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My family… well, they’re mostly back in Somalia. I haven't seen ‘em in a long time. And we didn’t really talk about medical stuff, not much. I know my father had some problems with his legs when he got older, but I don't know what kinda problems. Just that he used to complain about them bein’ tired and achy. No blood clots that I know of, though. And my mother was always pretty healthy. <He pauses, thinking> No, I don’t think so. No history of that sort of thing on either side, as far as I know. It's hard to say, really. We didn’t keep those sorts of records.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of blood clots or leg swelling. Lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t really drink, either. Maybe a glass of juice now and then, but that’s about it. And definitely no recreational drugs. Not my style, not at all. I try to stay healthy, like I said. <He smiles faintly>. I just worry about work and makin' a decent livin'. That's enough trouble for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Mr. Parascondola. Now, I'm going to take a look at your foot. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. No problem. <He carefully gets up from the chair, a slight wince crossing his face as he puts weight on his left foot>. Here we go. <He slowly makes his way to the examination table and carefully lies down, adjusting his position slightly>. Let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Parascondola. I’m just going to gently feel around your ankle and foot. Please let me know if anything is particularly tender. Okay, I'm noticing some significant swelling around your ankle, particularly on the inner side. It is warm to the touch, as you mentioned, and a bit tender when I press here. Your pulse is present on both feet, which is good, but it is a little weaker on your left foot. And your range of motion is limited due to the swelling. I'm also checking the skin for any breaks in the skin. The skin appears intact, no open wounds or sores. I also feel for a calf tenderness, and there is some tenderness there. Do you feel any pain when I bend your foot upwards like this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That kinda hurts. Not terrible, but yeah, definitely a bit of a twinge there. It's a dull ache, not a sharp pain. It feels like somethin’s pullin’ in the back of my leg. <He grimaces slightly, flexing his foot involuntarily>. It’s not constant, though. Only when you bend it like that. The rest of the time it’s just a dull ache in my ankle. And yeah, you're right, it is pullin’ in the back of my leg. <He pauses> I hadn't even thought about my calf bein' sore 'til you poked at it. Maybe I just strained it walkin'? I don’t usually notice aches like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you might have a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, in your calf, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins. The tenderness in your calf, the swelling, warmth, and redness in your ankle, and the limited range of motion all point to that. The weaker pulse on your left foot is also a concerning sign. However, we need to confirm this with an ultrasound. Would you be willing to go for an ultrasound to rule this out or confirm it?
PATIENT: A blood clot? In my leg? Oh, boy… That don’t sound good, Doctor. <He looks genuinely worried>. I’ve heard stories about those. Dangerous, right? <He shifts uncomfortably on the examination table>. An ultrasound… yeah, sure. If that’s what you think is best, I’ll do it. I want to know what’s goin’ on. Is it gonna hurt? What happens if it is a blood clot? What do they do about those? I’m kinda scared now, to be honest. I just came in ‘cause my foot was swollen… I didn’t expect anythin’ like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Parascondola. It's good that we are taking this seriously. DVTs can be serious, but they are treatable. An ultrasound is a painless procedure. It involves using sound waves to create an image of the veins in your leg, so we can see if there's a clot. It's like a pregnancy scan, no needles or anything like that. If it is a DVT, the treatment usually involves blood thinners, which are medications to prevent the clot from getting bigger and to reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs, which would be a very serious complication. We would likely start you on these medications immediately. We’d also want to rule out any other possible causes of the swelling. Given you are uninsured, I want to make sure you have access to the care you need. I will see what options we have for getting you an ultrasound quickly, and I'll discuss the costs with you upfront. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. Do you have a preferred hospital or imaging center?
PATIENT: Okay, that… that makes me feel a little better. No needles, that's good. And you’ll help me figure out the costs? That’s a big relief, Doctor. I don’t have a preferred hospital, not really. I just go wherever they tell me to go. The clinic here is fine, if that's the easiest option. And you said somethin’ about it travelin’ to my lungs? Oh, dear… That sounds scary. <He takes a deep breath> I just want to get this fixed, you know? I need to work. I can't afford to be sick. So, whatever you think is best, I trust you. Let's just get this ultrasound done, please. The sooner, the better. <He looks pleadingly at Dr. Tosca>.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola. I completely understand. We’ll get this ultrasound done as soon as possible. I’ll write an order for you right now for the imaging center here at the clinic. They have availability this afternoon, around 2:00 PM. You'll need to bring your identification with you. The technician will do the ultrasound and then the radiologist will read the results. I will review the results with you as soon as they are available, which should be within a few hours. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid prolonged sitting or standing. Try to keep your leg elevated when possible, and stay hydrated. And if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or coughing up blood, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, 2:00 PM sounds good. I can do that. And, yeah, I'll try to keep it elevated. Hydrated… okay. No chest pain… I’ll remember that. That sounds serious. <He pauses, thinking> I guess… how long does it take to get the results? And… if it is a blood clot, will I have to go to the hospital? Will I need surgery? I know I’m askin’ a lot of questions, but I’m really worried now. I just want to know what I’m up against, you know? I don't want any surprises. And… <he hesitates> what’s the cost of this ultrasound gonna be, roughly? I need to know if I can afford it. Sorry to keep askin' about the money, but... I don't have any savings.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Mr. Parascondola. It’s good to be informed, and I want to address all of your concerns. The results of the ultrasound usually take a few hours, as the radiologist needs time to review the images. I will call you as soon as I have them, regardless of the time. Most DVTs are treated with medication, specifically blood thinners. Surgery is rarely required unless the clot is very large or there are complications. The blood thinners help prevent the clot from growing and reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs. They are typically taken orally, and we’ll monitor your bloodwork closely while you're on them. Now, regarding the cost of the ultrasound, it’s approximately $300. I will also check if the clinic has any financial assistance programs available, or if we can negotiate a payment plan for you. I will call the billing department right after our consultation and let you know what options we have. I understand your concerns about the money, and I will do everything I can to help. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: $300… okay. That’s… that’s a lot, but maybe I can manage it if I can get a payment plan. And you’ll check for assistance, that’s good. Payment plan and assistance… okay. <He pauses, thinking hard for a moment> I think… I think that’s everything for now. You’ve answered all my questions, Doctor. I’m still scared, but I feel a little better knowin’ what to expect. Thank you. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly and for bein’ so patient with me. 2:00 PM it is, then. And you’ll call me with the results, no matter what time? <He adjusts himself on the examination table, looking slightly less anxious than before>. I guess I’ll head home now and try to keep my leg up. I’ll see you this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, I will absolutely call you with the results as soon as I have them, no matter what time. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then. Alright, Mr. Parascondola. You take care of yourself and try to rest. I’ll see you this afternoon at 2:00 PM. .
