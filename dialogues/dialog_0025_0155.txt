DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Jezik, it's good to meet you. Though, frankly, you’re looking a little…thin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yes. Good to meet you too, Doctor… Fourney, is it? It’s this…shaking. My hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, and it’s getting…noticeable. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s a bother. A real bother.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Shaking, you say. And you can’t pinpoint when it began?
PATIENT: No, no, I really can’t. Things just…blur together after a while, you know? It’s not like it came on suddenly, not that I recall. It just…gradually got worse. I suppose. Honestly, I have trouble remembering details these days. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating for you, perhaps. Makes my job more difficult, naturally. Alright. Is it constant shaking, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Definitely. It’s worse when I’m trying to do something…precise. Like…buttoning a shirt. Or eating soup. That’s a disaster, usually. But when I’m just…sitting, it’s not so bad. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: Eating soup, you say. And are you noticing it anywhere else besides your hands?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I…think so? Maybe a little bit in my leg sometimes, but I put that down to…old age, mostly. It’s hard to say, really. Everything feels a bit…wobbly these days. I don’t pay much attention to it unless it’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Wobbliness. Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been…tired. A lot. But that’s probably just…being old, too. And my sleep isn't great, but who does sleep well at my age? I don't know… honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure. Is there something specific I should be looking for? I just came about the shaking, because it's…annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying is hardly a clinical presentation, Mr. Jezik. But alright. Let's take a look at you. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. There we go. Bit creaky, you know. Everything's bit creaky. What are you looking for, exactly? I hope it’s not anything serious. I really don't have the energy for…well, anything serious.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, as expected for your age. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. Is this…okay? It’s a bit hard, you know. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be either. And my neck gets stiff. Is something wrong? You’re making me nervous, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I'm assessing your condition, not deliberately causing anxiety. The eye movement isn’t entirely smooth. Now, let's have you stand up. Slowly, now. I want to see how you balance.
PATIENT: Whoa there… Balance isn’t my strong suit these days, Doctor. Never was, really. I always felt a bit clumsy. Are you seeing something? Is it bad? Just tell me straight, I can take it. Well, maybe.
DOCTOR: Your gait is somewhat unsteady, and your posture is… stooped. Have you experienced any falls recently?
PATIENT: Falls? Hmm… not recent falls, no. But I’ve had a few…stumbles. Mostly I manage to catch myself on something. The furniture, usually. My wife… used to say I was always bumping into things. She’s gone now, though. A long time ago. It's just… harder to keep my footing, that’s all. Everything feels a bit…slippery.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your symptoms and this brief examination, it appears you may be experiencing the early stages of Essential Tremor, possibly with some contributing postural instability. However, given your age and the gradual onset, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work to check for underlying causes, and I’d like you to get a basic neurological assessment. I’ll have the nurse draw some labs and schedule that for you. It's just to be thorough, you understand.
PATIENT: Labs and…neurological assessment? That sounds… complicated. And expensive, probably. I don't have insurance, you know. Look, is it really necessary? I mean, it’s just a bit of shaking. I can live with a bit of shaking. I’ve lived with a lot worse. Can't we just… leave it at that? I just want it to stop, that’s all. Not a whole lot of tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, dismissing potential causes without proper investigation is irresponsible. Your "bit of shaking" could be indicative of a more serious condition. While I understand your concerns about cost, your health is paramount. I can write a referral to a clinic that offers reduced rates, but I will be ordering the labs. It’s non-negotiable. We need a baseline. The nurse will explain the process. And frankly, you need to be more proactive about your health. We’ll start with a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and vitamin B12 level. And I’ll get the neurology referral sent over. Next.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Labs and a…neurologist. Fine. Whatever you say, Doctor. I just…don't have the energy for all this fuss. Fuss, fuss, fuss. I suppose I should have just stayed home. Just…tell the nurse to get it over with, please. I'd like to go home now. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you shortly. And Mr. Jezik, try to get some rest. It's important. Next.
