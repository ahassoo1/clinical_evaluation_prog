DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Paes. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's mostly this skin thing. It’s getting darker, you know? And I’ve been really tired lately, even when I get enough sleep. It just feels... off.
DOCTOR: “Skin thing” is rather vague, Ms. Paes. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry. It’s hard to explain. It's like... patches, mostly on my arms and face. Not all over. And it's not like a sunburn, it’s more…brownish? And it feels a little rough, if that makes sense. It started maybe a month or two ago, I think. I don't really keep track of dates well.
DOCTOR: A month or two ago. And has it been gradually worsening, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn't like bam, overnight. Just…slowly getting darker. I noticed it more when I was out in the sun, but it’s been getting darker even when I try to stay covered up. Does that make sense? I work outside sometimes, at the plant, so I am in the sun a bit, even with sunscreen.
DOCTOR: Sun exposure…right. And where specifically on your arms and face are these patches located?
PATIENT: Mostly on the backs of my hands, and on my cheeks. And a little bit on my forehead, right at my hairline. It’s not all over my face, just those spots, you know? And like I said, it feels a bit rough to the touch. It doesn't really itch, though.
DOCTOR: No itching. Okay. And you mentioned fatigue. Is this constant tiredness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, I think. I used to be able to go all day at work and still have energy for things in the evening. Now, I just want to sit down as soon as I get home. Even on my days off, I feel like I could sleep all day. It’s not like a heavy exhaustion, just…always tired.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Paes?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just some over-the-counter stuff sometimes, for aches and pains. Nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I don't have any serious health problems, you know? Just…this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat all kinds of food, I don't have to be careful with anything, so I guess not.
DOCTOR: Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to take a look at those patches on your arms and face. If you don’t mind. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Please roll up your sleeves.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. No problem at all. Here you go. Just let me know if you need anything else.
DOCTOR: Hmm. These are somewhat hyperpigmented, a bit rough to the palpatation, as you mentioned. No visible inflammation. They’re irregularly shaped, not uniform in color. Now, let me take a look at your face. Similar findings on your cheeks and forehead. The coloration appears more pronounced with sun exposure, but present even in shaded areas. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No edema noted in extremities. Okay. I’m noting these findings in your chart. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but these patches could be a number of things—potentially solar lentigines, or melasma, but we need to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…complicated. Solar…what-now? And mel-ah-something? I just want to know what’s wrong, and if it’s serious. Is this something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Solar lentigines are essentially sunspots, Ms. Paes. They’re very common, especially with outdoor work. Melasma is a skin condition causing patches of discoloration, often linked to hormonal changes, but it can also be triggered by sun exposure. Neither is inherently serious in the life-threatening sense, but they can be cosmetically bothersome. However, given your fatigue, it’s prudent to investigate further to ensure there isn’t an underlying cause contributing to both the skin changes and your tiredness. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. This will give us a broader picture of your overall health. I’ll also send a referral to dermatology for a definitive diagnosis of the skin condition. They can perform a biopsy if necessary.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…like a lot of tests. But if it will figure out what's going on, then that’s good. Will the tests tell me why I'm tired? And when can I get them done?
DOCTOR: The blood tests will help rule out common causes of fatigue, such as anemia, thyroid issues, or electrolyte imbalances. It won’t necessarily pinpoint a single cause, but it’s a crucial first step. The dermatologist will be able to determine the specific type of skin condition you have and whether any further investigation is needed. I’ve already sent the lab requisitions electronically to the lab at St. Jude’s hospital—they’re a short drive from here. You can go anytime tomorrow. The dermatology referral is also submitted—they will contact you to schedule an appointment. It may take a week or two to get in. I will give you a printout of the lab orders and the dermatology referral information. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. A week or two is fine. And St. Jude's is close, so that's good too. Hmm... No, I don't think so. Just…thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Paes. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Here’s the paperwork. Please contact the lab and dermatology office as soon as possible to schedule your appointments. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms—such as fever, significant weight loss, or worsening fatigue—please contact my office immediately. Otherwise, we’ll review the test results once they’re available. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
