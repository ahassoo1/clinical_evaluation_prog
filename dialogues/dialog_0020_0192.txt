DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Beinborn, you said? Right. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the army. Gotta get it done, you know? They want me to take it. Seems silly, all this checking-up just to… well, just to join up.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you need a physical for potential army enlistment. Understandable. We want to make sure you’re in good health. Alright. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you want to join the army?
PATIENT: Why do I want to join? Honestly? It's… a good job. Steady pay. My boy, he's always on at me about having something to do. And, well, things haven't been easy, you understand. Work’s been… spotty. And my wife… she thinks it’ll be good for me. Give me some discipline. Not that I need it. But, that's what she says. It's a change, alright? A change is good.
DOCTOR: I understand. A stable job and a positive change in life – those are good reasons. Before we get into the physical exam itself, let’s just go through some medical history. It will help me get a clearer picture. Have you been feeling generally healthy lately?
PATIENT: Generally healthy? Yes. Fine. I haven’t been… laid up or anything. Bit of a cough now and then, this time of year, you know? But nothing a good Swedish winter doesn't fix. And my back… it aches a little. From work. Always lifting. But I push through it. A man’s gotta work, right? Don't mean anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some back pain. We'll definitely take a look at that back. When you say "cough," is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up?
PATIENT: Bringing anything up? What kind of question is that? Just a cough. Normal cough. You know, like when you've got a tickle in your throat. Sometimes it’s worse in the mornings. Not much more to it than that. Really, I don't go to doctors for every little sniffle. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your point. We just want to cover all the bases for the army exam. And you’re right, we don’t need to dwell on minor things. Now, about your back pain – where exactly does it hurt, and does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Right, the back. It's… lower. Right here. . When I bend over, it gets worse. Lifting, obviously. Been like that for years, really. And… sitting for too long. That doesn’t help. What makes it better? Not much, honestly. Maybe lying down. And… ignoring it. That works best.
DOCTOR: Lower back pain, worse with bending and lifting, relieved somewhat by lying down. It sounds like it’s been a long-term issue. Have you ever had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Injuries? Not that I recall. No broken bones or anything. Maybe pulled something once, years ago. Working on a tractor. But it healed up. Didn't bother me much. Just… a twinge. Nothing worth going to a doctor for, naturally. I’ve always been strong. Built like a Swede, you know?
DOCTOR: I can see that. Alright. Have you ever had any other serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? No. Surgeries? Once. Appendix. When I was a boy. That’s it. Nothing else. Healthy as a horse, mostly. A bit of a cold now and then, but nothing that a bit of fresh air and strong coffee can’t fix. You people always ask about everything. It's… a bit much, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. We just need to be thorough to ensure we have a complete picture of your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Supplements? No. I get my vitamins from my food. Real food. Not those fancy pills. My wife, she tries to get me to take something for my joints. But I refuse. Never needed any of that nonsense. Strong coffee is all I need. Keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. And you've had your appendix removed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. Never had an allergic reaction in my life. Dust maybe, makes me sneeze a bit, but that’s not an allergy, is it? My wife is always asking if I'm allergic to something. She worries too much. I’m a Swede, we’re built tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, before we move onto the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What do you want to know? My father, he lived to be 80, worked on a farm his whole life. Strong man. My mother… she was alright. She died when I was young. Cancer, I think. My brother, he’s fine, works in a bank. Nothing exciting. They were all… normal people. Healthy enough, I suppose. Not much illness in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, father lived to 80, mother died of cancer, brother is healthy. Alright. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol? A beer now and then. Socially. With friends. Nothing heavy. Recreational drugs? What kind of question is that? I’m a respectable man. Never been involved with any of that nonsense. My wife would kill me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol, no recreational drugs. Thank you for being so open. Now, let's move on to the physical exam. I'm going to start by checking your height and weight, then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I’ve got things to do, you know. It's all a bit silly, if you ask me. But, alright. Height and weight. Just… try not to take too long. I've got a good build, I tell you what. You'll see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please step onto the scale for me. And then I'll need you to stand against the wall so I can measure your height. No problem at all. Okay, your height is 187 centimeters, and your weight is 53 kilograms. That’s… a bit lower than expected, Mr. Hartness. We should discuss this further after the exam.
PATIENT: Lower than expected? What do you mean? I told you I’ve got a good build. Lean muscle, you know? I work hard. Maybe the scale is wrong. Or… maybe I lost some weight recently. It’s been a bit stressful, with the army and all. But I’m strong. Don’t let the numbers fool you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's possible. We'll take that into account. Let's continue with the exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please sit back and relax. Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted.
PATIENT: Fine. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Strong heart. Good lungs. Always been outdoors, you know? Fresh air. Better than being cooped up in an office. You’ll see. I’m perfectly healthy. Don’t waste your time looking for something that isn’t there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please extend your arms and legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally in upper and lower extremities. That’s within normal limits. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Tenderness? No. Palpate away. Nothing there. Strong stomach. I eat good food, you know? Real Swedish food. Meat and potatoes. Never had any trouble with my stomach. Just… get on with it, alright? I’ve got things to do. This is all a bit of a waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart sounds again, and take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 110/70. Heart sounds remain regular. Now, I need to take a look at your throat, ears and eyes.
PATIENT: Throat, ears, eyes… alright, alright. Just get it over with. Everything's fine. I can see perfectly well, I tell you what. And my ears work just fine. Don't waste your time looking for something that isn't there. I'm a Swede, remember? We're built tough.
DOCTOR: Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Ears are clear bilaterally. Eyes are clear to examination, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Alright, Mr. Hartness. The physical exam is complete. However, I am concerned about your weight. At 53 kilograms for your height, you are significantly underweight. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional weight loss? Well… now that you mention it… I have been a bit preoccupied lately. With the army and all, and… things at home. My appetite hasn’t been the best. I just haven’t been eating as much. But I feel fine. Honestly. I'm strong. It’s just… stress, alright? It’s just stress. And… maybe I need to eat more meat and potatoes. But it's not a problem. Really.
DOCTOR: I understand. However, unexplained weight loss can be a sign of underlying medical conditions, even if you feel otherwise. Given your weight and recent changes in appetite, I recommend we order some blood work to rule out any potential issues. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and thyroid levels. Would you be willing to proceed with blood work, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Blood work? Really? Is it that bad? I told you, it’s just stress. I don’t like needles, you know. And I don’t have insurance. It’ll cost money, won’t it? I suppose… if it’s necessary… but I still think you’re overreacting. Alright. Fine. Do the blood work. But if everything comes back normal, I expect an apology. And you'd better hurry up, I need to get this army thing sorted.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hartness. We'll keep the cost as minimal as possible and prioritize the most essential tests. And I assure you, we are simply being thorough to ensure your health and safety, especially given your enlistment plans. I’ll have the lab draw your blood now. They’ll need approximately two vials. Once the results are back, which usually takes about 3-5 business days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you focus on maintaining a balanced diet and managing your stress levels. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… get it over with. And make sure they don’t poke me too much. I hate needles. And if it turns out to be nothing, you owe me an apology. A proper one. And… tell them to be gentle. Alright? Just… gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hartness. I'll make a note for the lab technician to be as gentle as possible. I’ll also ensure they explain the process thoroughly. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. They’re expecting you. I’ll be in my office if you have any questions. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And I apologize in advance if this causes any inconvenience. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort after the blood draw.
PATIENT: .
