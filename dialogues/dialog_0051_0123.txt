DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my skin... it's been so itchy lately. It's driving me crazy, honestly. It's all over, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, itchy skin. That can be very bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it started, oh, maybe a month ago? It's not really… a rash, not exactly. It’s just… dry and feels like little pinpricks all over. It’s worse at night, definitely. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. And it doesn’t seem to be getting any better with lotion, which is what I usually do.
DOCTOR: A month ago, worsening over time, worse at night, and lotion isn’t helping… Okay. Is the itching localized to certain areas, or is it truly all over?
PATIENT: Oh, it's pretty much everywhere. My arms, my legs, my back… even my stomach. I mean, maybe not my face, but everything else. It's just… a general itchiness, you know? Not like a bug bite or anything specific.
DOCTOR: I see. Generalized itchiness… and you mentioned it’s been about a month now. Have you noticed anything that makes it better – anything at all?
PATIENT: Well… not really. Cool air helps a little, maybe? When I’m inside with the air conditioning on, it's not as bad. But it comes back as soon as I get warm. And… I don't know if this matters, but I've been feeling a little more tired than usual lately, too. Not sick, just… worn out.
DOCTOR: Cool air provides some relief, and increased fatigue… Alright. Ms. Cassimatis, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Before we get into a physical exam, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let’s see… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but I don't take anything for it. The doctor said to just watch my salt intake. Nothing else really, I don't think. Oh! And I got divorced about ten years ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. The gallbladder removal and slightly elevated blood pressure are important. And no, Ms. Cassimatis, divorce doesn’t count, but I appreciate you sharing. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. And I try not to take anything for pain or anything unless I absolutely have to. I prefer to just tough things out, if I can. Honestly, I haven’t been to the doctor in a while. This itching is just getting too annoying to ignore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to know you’re not on any regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. I remember being stung by a bee as a kid, but I didn’t have a bad reaction then either. Just a little swelling. Nothing major. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies. Ms. Cassimatis, before we move on to the exam, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… well, my mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father had heart trouble. My brother is fine, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other much anymore. And my grandmother… she had really bad eczema when she was young. It was on her hands mostly, I remember. It was very painful looking. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That is important. Diabetes, heart trouble, and a history of eczema in your grandmother… thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried to get me to, when we were young, but I wouldn’t have it. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. And definitely no drugs! I'm a retired political scientist, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Cassimatis. That's helpful to know. Now, one last thing before the exam. Could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… Well, I live alone now, since my divorce. My son lives in Florida, with his family. I talk to him on the phone every week or so. I used to be very active in local politics, but I’ve slowed down a bit in recent years. Mostly I spend my time reading, gardening, and watching the news. It keeps me busy!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fulfilling life, Ms. Cassimatis. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a much better understanding of your overall health. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright. We’ll just take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, you can figure out what's causing this itchiness. It’s really driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please loosen your clothing, that would be great. We’ll start with your skin. Now, if you don’t mind, could you please roll up your sleeves and loosen the collar of your shirt?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm not seeing any obvious rashes or lesions. Your skin is quite dry, and there's some mild redness, particularly on your forearms and shins. It looks a bit like excoriation—small scratches, likely from the itching itself. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay. I'm trying to relax, but it's hard when you're thinking about how itchy everything is!
DOCTOR: Your heart rhythm is regular, and your lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated—148/92. That's consistent with what you mentioned your doctor told you. Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. Based on the exam, your skin is dry with evidence of scratching, your lungs are clear, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. It seems the most pressing issue is the itchy skin.
PATIENT: So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? And what can we do about it? This itchiness is really making me miserable. I haven't slept well in weeks!
DOCTOR: Well, there are several possibilities. Dry skin, also known as xerosis, is very common, especially as we age. However, persistent itching like you're experiencing could also be due to allergies, underlying medical conditions, or even medications—although you haven't mentioned taking any regularly. Your family history of eczema is also something to consider. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the fact that the itching hasn’t responded to lotion, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, liver function, kidney function, and a complete blood count. This will help us determine if there's an internal issue contributing to the itching. In the meantime, to help manage the itching, I recommend using a fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, especially after bathing. Avoid hot showers or baths, as these can further dry out your skin. And if possible, try to keep your environment cool and humidified. Would you be comfortable with us scheduling a blood draw?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to find out what's causing this. And yes, I can definitely get a blood draw. I don’t mind at all. When can we schedule it? And will you explain the results to me when they come back? I get nervous about these things, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cassimatis. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The lab is just down the hall. And yes, of course I will explain the results to you in detail when they come back. I understand your nervousness—it’s perfectly normal. We’ll go over everything together, and I'll answer any questions you have. In the meantime, if the itching becomes unbearable, or if you develop any fever, chills, or other new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for listening and taking the time to help me. I really appreciate it. I feel a little better just knowing we’re getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re here for you. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again. Goodbye.
