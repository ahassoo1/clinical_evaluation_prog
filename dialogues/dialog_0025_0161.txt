DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Trefren, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi Doctor Fourney. It's… well, it's a bit awkward to talk about, honestly. A friend suggested I come in and ask about… that pill. The one that helps prevent HIV. PrEP, I think she called it? I just want to get some information, you know? See if it’s even right for me. I’m not… I haven’t really done much research, to be honest.
DOCTOR: PrEP. Right. Yes, I see. A preventative measure. It's... good you're being proactive, I suppose. Though frankly, most people my age aren’t concerned with that sort of thing. But, we can certainly discuss it. First, I need to understand why you're even considering this. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I am. Not… a lot, lately. But, yes. And, well, it's… complicated. I date. Online mostly. And you meet all sorts of people, you know? And I just… I want to be careful. I don’t want to end up with any surprises, if you know what I mean. My friend, she said it’s better to be safe than sorry. And I’ve heard stories. It just… makes me anxious, honestly.
DOCTOR: "Stories," yes. People hear things. Online dating... it’s a breeding ground for, shall we say, unpredictability. Alright. So, you're concerned about potential exposure to HIV. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. Last one was… let me think… about two years ago, I think. It was negative. A standard test, at the health department. They do a good job there, very professional. I remember the nurse was really nice. I got the results pretty quickly. I've always been pretty careful about using protection, but... you just never really know, do you?
DOCTOR: Two years ago. Alright. And you consistently use protection… when you’re sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. I mean, I try to. It's… awkward, sometimes. With dating, you know? It’s hard to just bring it up. And… sometimes things just happen. I’m not proud of it, but it’s true. I definitely don't always think things through. That's why I'm here, really. I want to be able to relax a little more, you know? Not constantly worry.
DOCTOR: “Relax.” Right. Well, let's be frank, Ms. Trefren. PrEP isn’t a free pass to engage in risky behavior. It's a preventative medication, and like all medications, it has its own set of requirements and potential side effects. Before we even consider whether this is appropriate for you, we need to run some tests. We need to check your kidney function, make sure you don't have any underlying conditions that would contraindicate its use, and rule out any existing HIV infection, of course. And we definitely need to discuss your sexual history in more detail. How many partners have you had in the last six months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of questions. Okay, um… kidney function, that sounds serious. I feel pretty healthy, but… I’m not sure. As for partners… let me think. In the last six months… probably around four? Maybe five. It hasn't been a steady thing, more like… dates. I haven't really had a long-term relationship in years. It's mostly casual. Does that matter? I'm a bit embarrassed to even say it out loud.
DOCTOR: “Casual.” Right. Well, Ms. Trefren, frequent changes in partners absolutely matter. It increases your risk of exposure to not only HIV, but other sexually transmitted infections as well. We will need to do a full STI screening in addition to the HIV test and kidney function panel. Have you experienced any symptoms of an STI recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. No unusual discharge, no pain… nothing like that. I’m usually pretty good about noticing things, you know? I’m a practical person. But… I haven’t really been to a doctor for a check-up in a while, if I’m being honest. Just routine stuff. Work gets busy. I’m a parking attendant downtown. Long hours, lots of walking. Not a lot of time for myself, really.
DOCTOR: A parking attendant. Yes, I see. Well, Ms. Trefren, that is... less than ideal. Ignoring your health for the sake of work is rarely a good idea. Alright. Before we proceed any further, I'm going to need you to fill out a detailed medical history questionnaire. And I want a list of all medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones. Then, we'll draw some blood for the tests. It’s a fairly standard procedure, but it’s important we get a complete picture of your health status before even considering PrEP. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. I can do that. Allergies… hmm. Not really. I’m allergic to pollen, a little, but that's it. Nothing medical. Just seasonal sniffles. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Really. Mostly, I just drink a lot of water and try to get enough sleep when I can. I guess I'll go fill out that questionnaire then? Where can I find it?
DOCTOR: Right there. The blue one. Take your time, be as accurate as possible. And please, be honest. I need a complete picture of your health. Once you’re finished, hand it to the nurse and she’ll draw your blood. It's quite a few vials, so you might want to drink some extra water beforehand. We'll need to send those results out to the lab, so it will be a few days before we have everything back. I’ll contact you once I’ve reviewed them. Don’t leave until you’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. It’s important we don't rush this.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor Fourney. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’ll get started on that questionnaire right away. I will try to drink some extra water. It’s just… a lot to take in. Hopefully, everything will be okay.
DOCTOR: See that you do. And Ms. Trefren… remember. PrEP is not a substitute for safe practices. It’s a preventative measure, not a cure-all. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I understand. Thank you again, Doctor.
