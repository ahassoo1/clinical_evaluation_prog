DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…Lason, actually. Colt Lason. And honestly? It’s been…troubling. My wife, she’s the one who made the appointment. She says I’ve been…forgetful. Or confused, she says. I don’t know. It just feels…off sometimes. Like I’m not quite here, you know? But I’ve always been sharp as a tack. Still am, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It can be unsettling when things feel “off,” and I appreciate your wife bringing this to our attention. It’s good you're here to discuss it. It's also very helpful that you feel you've been sharp as a tack, and that you are noticing a change. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me more about these times when you feel forgetful or confused?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm wandering around lost or anything. It’s more…little things. Like I’ll be in the middle of a tile job – I’ve been setting tile for forty years, you know – and I’ll…forget where I put my trowel. Or what cut I was about to make. Just for a moment. Then it comes back to me, but it’s…irritating. Very irritating. And sometimes I struggle to remember the names of…newer clients. Not the ones I’ve been working with for years. The new ones. It’s…humiliating, frankly.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s primarily short-term memory issues, affecting your work and recalling recent acquaintances. That’s very helpful to know, Mr. Lason. And it sounds like these episodes are frustrating and concerning for you, which is completely understandable. Do you find these moments happen more frequently at a certain time of day, or are they pretty random?
PATIENT: Random, mostly. Though…now that you mention it, I think it's worse in the afternoon. After I’ve been working a long time. It’s hot out, of course. Been brutal this summer. I always thought it was just the heat, making me tired. But maybe…maybe it's something else. I’ve always been able to handle the heat. Forty years of setting tile in the sun, you know. A little sweat never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Lason – the connection to the afternoon and the heat. It's wise to consider all possibilities, and it's good you've been able to work through the heat for so long. We need to explore if it could be something more. Now, has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My wife has been nagging me about my balance lately. Says I seem a bit…wobbly. I haven't noticed it myself, truthfully. I’ve always been steady on my feet. But she worries, you know? She’s a worrier. And…oh. And I’ve been having trouble sleeping. Not that I can’t fall asleep. But I wake up a lot during the night. And I’m tired even after I’ve slept.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we’re adding some potential balance issues and disrupted sleep to the picture. It's very good your wife has noticed these changes. It’s often helpful to have another perspective. Just to get a broader understanding, has your appetite changed recently?
PATIENT: No, my appetite is fine. Always have a good appetite. My wife makes a good breakfast, you know. And I eat a good lunch on the job site. And dinner…well, dinner is always good. No complaints there. I enjoy my food. I haven’t lost any weight, if that’s what you’re asking. She checks. She checks everything.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Lason. No changes in appetite or weight is good. Alright, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Been on medication for it for…oh, fifteen years, maybe? Something like that. And my knees. Old tile-setting knees. They bother me sometimes. But that’s just wear and tear, you know. Nothing major. I take something for the pain when they act up. Otherwise…no. Nothing else. I’ve always been a healthy man. Always worked hard. Always been active.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee pain. And you mentioned you take something for the knee pain. Do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Ugh. See? This is what my wife is talking about. I should know this. It’s…something with a "cox" in it, I think? Like, Cele…something. I get it refilled at the same pharmacy, of course. But the name…it escapes me. Honestly, Doctor, I just ask for the usual knee pills, and they give it to me. I don’t bother with names. They’re just names.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lason. We can look it up in your records. Okay, I see here you’re currently taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure and Celecoxib for your knee pain. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had a need for them. Knock on wood. . Always been able to fix things myself, or let things heal on their own. I believe in letting the body do what it’s supposed to do. No cutting into things unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone in your family who has had memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother…she got a bit confused towards the end. Very old, though. Ninety-something. We just thought it was old age. And my uncle, on my wife’s side, I think he had something…something they called “hardening of the arteries,” maybe? It affected his thinking. But beyond that…no. Not that I recall. My side of the family, we’re all pretty sharp as tacks.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some potential memory issues in your mother and a possible vascular condition affecting your uncle on your wife's side. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work. Hard. Six days a week, usually. Tile setting. Always been physically active. I enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning. And…I enjoy watching the news with my wife in the evening. Simple life. Not much excitement. Don’t drink much. Maybe a beer with dinner on the weekends. And…I don’t smoke. Never have.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Lason. So, physically active job, moderate coffee intake, limited alcohol, and no smoking. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. My wife always asks, and I always say no. She worries about everything, you know? She makes me take allergy pills just in case, even when I'm not allergic to anything. Drives me a little crazy, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, Mr. Lason, this is all very helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I've got jobs to do, you know. I'm a busy man. But…go ahead. Just don't take too long. And be gentle with the knees. They aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. We'll take it easy. Okay, Mr. Lason, can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Done. Anything else? This is…rather tedious, you know. I’ve got tile to lay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that strong enough? I set tile all day, you know. Strong hands are important. And I haven’t lost any strength.
DOCTOR: Good, good strength. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay…and now I'm going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can feel it. Perfectly normal sensation. Don’t poke too hard, Doctor. I need these feet to stand on all day. This is all very…unnecessary, frankly. I’m sure it’s just the heat. And maybe a little stress. Running a business, you know. It takes a toll.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. Alright, based on the examination, your reflexes are a little diminished, and I did notice some slight unsteadiness when you walked. Your strength and sensation are generally intact. It’s important to note that a diminished reflex is not necessarily cause for alarm, but it does warrant further investigation alongside your reports of forgetfulness and balance issues. To get a clearer picture of what might be going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. We'll also get a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Additionally, I think a Vitamin B12 level is important. And to rule out any structural problems, an MRI of the brain is warranted. It's important to remember this is just precautionary. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds…excessive. I’m sure it’s nothing. Just the heat, like I said. And maybe a little stress. But…fine. If you insist. Just…get it over with quickly. I’ve got a business to run, you know. And I don't want to spend all day in a hospital. Tell me what I need to do. And try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Lason, and I assure you we’ll get this done as efficiently as possible. We'll schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning at the lab just down the street, and we can arrange the MRI for later next week. The MRI usually takes about 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we have the results of the MRI. Just as a precaution. And I'd also like you to try to get plenty of rest and stay well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Avoid driving? Are you serious? I need to drive! I’ve got clients to see, tile to deliver…this is ridiculous. But…fine. I’ll try to arrange for someone to drive me. For now. But if this takes too long, I’m holding you responsible for my lost business. And…no. I don’t have any other questions. Just get me the results as quickly as possible. And I expect a clear explanation. None of this medical jargon, you understand? Just tell me what’s wrong, plain and simple.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I will ensure the results are expedited, and I promise to explain everything to you in plain language, avoiding any medical jargon. I’m going to have my nurse, Sarah, come in and give you the lab requisition and schedule the MRI for you. She can also answer any logistical questions you may have. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We'll review the results together as soon as they're available. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. That's all. Just get it done. And tell your nurse to be quick. I’ve got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Lason. I’ll have Sarah come in right away. Thank you for coming in today. And please, take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: .
