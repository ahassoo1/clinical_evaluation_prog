DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Beinborn. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it's… the sun, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by the light lately. More than usual, anyway. It feels like my eyes are extra sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, extra sensitive to the light. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like I can’t go outside, but when I do, even on a cloudy day, it feels… harsh. Like I need to squint all the time, and my eyes water. And sometimes, even inside with the lights on, it's uncomfortable. It’s been going on for a few months now, slowly getting worse. I don't remember hitting my head or anything, or getting sick before it started.
DOCTOR: A few months, gradually worsening… no injury or illness preceding it. And you said it happens both indoors and outdoors?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Indoors isn't as bad as being in direct sunlight, of course. But even just the normal lights in the house or at the store… they seem brighter, somehow. And it gives me a bit of a headache sometimes, if I’m looking at a screen for too long. Not a terrible headache, just… annoying. It feels like my eyes are strained.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this affecting your vision in any way?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. Everything seems clear enough. I haven’t noticed anything blurry or double vision, or anything like that. But it’s… hard to explain. It’s more of a discomfort than a problem with seeing, you know? Like, my eyes feel tired and irritated, even when I haven't been doing anything particularly straining.
DOCTOR: Right, a discomfort and irritation rather than a change in your vision. Let's do a quick eye exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I've always had good eyes, so this is a bit worrying. Is there anything I should be doing now, like avoiding the sun? I know that sounds silly, but…
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all. Avoiding excessive sun exposure is always a good idea, and we can talk about protective measures. But let's take a look first, and then we can discuss it more specifically. If you could sit facing that wall chart, please. I’m going to check your visual acuity first. Just read the smallest line you can comfortably see.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Let me know if I should be wearing my glasses or not? I have them right here. They’re the ones I normally wear for reading.
DOCTOR: Please, go ahead and wear your reading glasses. That's helpful to know your current correction. Start with your right eye, if you would. Cover your left eye with your hand, and read the smallest line you can make out.
PATIENT: Alright. Okay… um… let’s see… E… F… P… T… 6… 7… I think 7 is the smallest I can clearly see. Is that right? It’s a little blurry on the smaller letters.
DOCTOR: Okay, 7. Now, let's try your left eye. Cover your right eye, please. And again, read the smallest line you can comfortably see.
PATIENT: Hmm… this one feels a little worse. Let me see… E… F… P… T… 6… That's about it. I can't really make out the next line. It's just a blur. That's disappointing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slight difference between your eyes. Now, I’m going to check your pupils and do a quick scan of the inside of your eyes with a light. It won’t be painful, just a bright light. Look straight ahead for me.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Straight ahead, got it. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. I’m seeing a normal optic nerve. No obvious clouding of the lens. And no significant redness or inflammation. I'm also going to check the pressure in your eyes, just to rule anything out. It’s a quick puff of air. It won't hurt, but it might be a little startling. Chin down, please. Look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Alright, chin down. Just let me know when it's over, please. This sounds… a bit intimidating.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. Your eye pressure is normal. So, everything looks normal on the basic exam. Given your description of the sensitivity to light, and the normal findings here, it sounds like you might be experiencing photophobia – increased sensitivity to light. This can have a number of causes, from simple eye strain to migraines, even certain medications. Do you have frequent headaches?
PATIENT: Migraines, not really. I get headaches sometimes, like I mentioned earlier, but they’re usually just mild tension headaches. Nothing too bad. And I don't take any regular medication at all, unless it’s just something over-the-counter for a cold. I haven't started any new medications recently. I did have a really stressful few months at work, though, before I took some time off. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: Stress can absolutely be a contributing factor. And eye strain from prolonged screen time could also play a role. Given your normal exam findings, it's less likely to be a serious underlying issue. For now, let’s try some conservative measures. I recommend reducing screen time, taking frequent breaks when you are using a screen – the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. And wearing sunglasses outdoors, even on cloudy days. A wide-brimmed hat can also help. We can also consider artificial tears if your eyes feel dry. I’ll write you a prescription for those. And if your symptoms worsen or don't improve after a couple of weeks, please come back and see me. We can discuss further testing, like checking for underlying inflammation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Reducing screen time will be hard, but I can definitely try. And the sunglasses and hat make sense. I’ll get a good pair of sunglasses. Artificial tears too. So, if it doesn’t get better after two weeks, I should come back? And you’ll do more tests then? Is there anything specific I should be looking out for that would mean I need to come back sooner? Like, what kind of pain or vision changes would be worrying? I always worry about something being really serious.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re being proactive and asking those questions. If you experience any sudden vision changes – blurring, double vision, or loss of vision – please come back immediately. Also, if you develop severe eye pain, or if your eyes become red and swollen, that would be a sign of something more serious. A headache that’s significantly different from your usual tension headaches would also be a reason to come back sooner. For now, let’s focus on the conservative measures and see how you respond. I’ll write you a prescription for the artificial tears, and a handout with some tips for managing eye strain. I’ll also send a note to your primary care physician letting them know what we discussed. Does that cover everything?
PATIENT: Yes, that covers everything, I think. Thank you, Dr. Beinborn. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, and for not dismissing my concerns. It’s… helpful to know what to look out for. And the handout would be great. I think I’ll go get some sunglasses now! And try to remember the 20-20-20 rule. It sounds silly, but… it might actually help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. It’s always better to be cautious, and I'm glad I could help. And the 20-20-20 rule isn’t silly at all – it’s a really effective technique for reducing eye strain. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
