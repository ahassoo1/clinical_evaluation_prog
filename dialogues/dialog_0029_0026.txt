DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Chora. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's about this tiredness. Just… utterly drained. It comes and goes, you see. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don't keep up with all that. It's just… exhausting, all of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness that comes and goes, and some lab results that weren’t quite right. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. When you say “off,” do you remember what the young man said specifically?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. Honestly, they all mumble these days. Something about… creatine? And… kinase? It sounded important, but my mind just… wanders. I mostly just nodded and let him do his business. I was a commercial diver for goodness sake, I don't need a lecture on… whatever that was. It's probably nothing. Just old age, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving – that’s quite a career! It's good you have a strong background. Creatine and kinase can be important, though. Creatine is a waste product from your muscles, and kinase is an enzyme released when muscles are damaged. Elevated levels can point to muscle breakdown, or potentially other issues. Just to clarify, when did you notice this tiredness starting?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it wasn't sudden, you see. It's been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe six months ago? Or was it last winter? Everything blends together after a while. I used to be able to get up and do things. Now… well, now I need a nap just thinking about it. It’s not like I’m out doing anything strenuous these days anyway. My husband does all the heavy lifting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over the last six months or so. And it's impacting your energy levels, making even simple tasks feel tiring. Have you noticed any pain or weakness in your muscles at all?
PATIENT: Weakness, yes. Definitely. Especially in my legs. Getting up from a chair is… a project. And sometimes my arms feel like jelly. But pain? Not really. Just… heavy. Like they're filled with lead. It's more of a… discomfort, I suppose. Though, truthfully, I have aches and pains all over at my age. It’s hard to say what’s new and what’s just… me.
DOCTOR: Alright, weakness in your legs and arms, and a feeling of heaviness. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite... well, I don't eat as much as I used to. Food just doesn't seem as appealing. And yes, I’ve lost a bit of weight, I think. My clothes are a little looser. My husband keeps telling me I need to eat more, but honestly, I just don't have the… the enthusiasm for it. It's all so tiresome.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss, along with the tiredness and weakness. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you had any trouble breathing, or noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, not particularly. I get a little winded climbing the stairs, but that's nothing new. And swelling… yes, actually. My ankles do puff up a bit at the end of the day. I just assumed it was the heat. We've had a dreadful summer, you know. It's so humid, everything swells.
DOCTOR: Okay, some swelling in the ankles, particularly at the end of the day. And no significant trouble breathing. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I've got the usual things for a woman my age. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. And arthritis, of course. It's in my hands mostly. I take pills for both, I think. Honestly, I leave most of that to my husband. He's very good at keeping track of things. I mostly just take what he gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and arthritis. And you're currently taking medication for both, managed by your husband. Do you remember the names of those medications, if you can?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, no, I haven't the faintest idea. Little white pills, mostly. And a pink one, I believe. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for remembering names. I just want to feel better, not become a pharmacist. My husband handles all the details. It's easier that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly understandable. We'll get that information from the record. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me think. Years ago, I had my gallbladder out. That was… a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. That needed a cast. Other than that… no, not that I recall. Nothing major. I've always been a fairly healthy woman, all things considered. Until this tiredness, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist in the past. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of any serious illnesses in your family – heart disease, cancer, muscle problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. She died when I was quite young, actually. And my brother… he had some kind of cancer, a long time ago. But that's about all I know. We weren't a very close family, you see. I haven’t spoken to most of them in years. It's not something I dwell on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart trouble in your mother and cancer in your brother. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I would never! My husband doesn’t approve of any of that nonsense. We’re very respectable people, you see. I might have a small glass of sherry with dinner occasionally, but that's it. And definitely no smoking or… whatever else young people are doing these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, recreational drugs, and only occasional sherry. Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Oitker. Now, let me just review your records here… I see a history of hypertension, osteoarthritis, and… ah, yes. Your medications are lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for pain. The lab results from last week do show an elevated creatine kinase level, and slightly low hemoglobin. Given your symptoms and these lab results, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. The elevated creatine kinase could indicate some muscle damage or inflammation. The low hemoglobin could be contributing to your tiredness. It’s possible this is simply age-related muscle loss, but we need to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Hmm. Muscle damage? Inflammation? That doesn't sound very pleasant. What sort of causes are you thinking of, Doctor? And what sort of things will you do about it? I don't want a lot of poking and prodding, you know. I'm not a young woman anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Oitker. We'll take things slowly and avoid anything unnecessary. Some possible causes include medication side effects – though lisinopril is less likely to cause this – vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or, less commonly, an autoimmune condition affecting the muscles. To investigate further, I’d like to order a few additional blood tests: a complete metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin D level. I'd also like to order a urinalysis. These are all routine blood and urine tests. If those tests don’t provide a clear answer, we might consider a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and possibly an electromyography study, which assesses muscle activity. However, let's start with the blood tests first. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, alright. As long as it's not too much. And no poking and prodding, you said? Just… blood? I suppose I can manage that. Though, honestly, I always feel so faint. My husband will have to drive me, of course. He’s very good at handling these things. And I'd like to know what you're looking for, exactly. Not just a lot of medical jargon, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, no jargon. We're looking to see if your kidneys are functioning properly, as that can affect muscle function. We’ll check your thyroid level, as an underactive thyroid can cause fatigue and muscle weakness. And we’ll check your vitamin D level, as a deficiency can also contribute to these symptoms. The blood tests are relatively quick and painless – just a small sample taken from your arm. I'll order them now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. After the results come back, we'll discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, try to stay well-hydrated and avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like severe muscle pain, dark urine, or difficulty breathing, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hydrated… strenuous activity… Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t done anything strenuous in years. It all sounds very… condescending. But no, I don’t suppose I have any questions. Just… get it over with, please. And tell the young man at the lab to speak clearly, will you? It’s very frustrating having to repeat everything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I will make a note of that. I’ll have the lab notified of your preference. I’ve sent the orders to the lab now, and they’ll be in touch to schedule your appointment. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before then. I’ll be following up with you once the results are available. Have a good day, Ms. Oitker.
PATIENT: Humph. Goodbye, Doctor. I sincerely hope this doesn't take too long.
