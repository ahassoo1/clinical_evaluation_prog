DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Stilaire. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? For the policy. I'd like to get it over with as quick as possible if we could.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I understand wanting to be efficient. This is a common request for life insurance policies, and we can absolutely work through it. So, to be clear, you don’t have any specific health concerns you are aware of, this is primarily for the insurance requirements?
PATIENT: Right. No, nothing I know about. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? Just the usual stuff for getting older, I guess. They just sent me here.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, this is a comprehensive physical exam they’ve requested?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's what the lady on the phone said. Blood tests, checking my heart... the whole thing, I think. Look, I just wanna make sure everything is okay, so they'll give me the insurance. Is that what you do here? Check if I'm healthy enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Putney, that is precisely what we do. We'll perform a thorough examination, including blood tests and a cardiac assessment, as you mentioned. I see here your height is listed as 174 centimeters and your weight as 97 kilograms. Is that still accurate?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right. Maybe a little more now, to be honest. Things haven't been easy. But yeah, those numbers are pretty close.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for confirming. We'll get your current weight recorded as well. Perhaps we could start with a review of your medical history?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever gets this done faster. I don't really have a medical history. I mean, I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. Maybe for a cold once or twice, but that was years ago. Divorced, living alone now… not much reason to go, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Putney. It’s common for people to not visit the doctor regularly if they’re feeling well. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been told I had any of those. Like I said, haven't really been to a doctor. And my ex-wife would've let me know if I was sick all the time, believe me. She always kept track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree… but that was it. Just a cast. It healed fine. No big deal. Look, I hope this isn't gonna take all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Putney. We'll proceed as efficiently as possible. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um... that's a tough one. I didn't really keep up with that stuff. My dad… he had a heart problem, I think. Something with his valves, but I wasn't really close to him, so I don't know the details. And my mom… she just kind of… got old, you know? Nothing specific, as far as I know. We weren't a family that talked about health stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright, we can work with what you know. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Never really needed to. Just... sometimes a pain reliever for a headache, but that's it. The really cheap kind.
DOCTOR: Very well. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I used to love shellfish, but... it's expensive now. But no, no allergies. I'd remember that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you certainly would. Thank you for providing me with that information, Mr. Putney. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. I’d like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and examine your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Just get it over with. The quicker we finish, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit up and loosen your shirt, we can start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Your blood pressure is 145 over 88. Heart rate is 72 beats per minute and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Now, I would like to listen to your heart sounds more closely.
PATIENT: Fine. Just tell me if anything's wrong. Are you almost done?
DOCTOR: I'm detecting a mild systolic murmur. It’s difficult to assess without further investigation, but it’s not immediately concerning. Mr. Putney, this murmur warrants some additional testing. I'd like to order an EKG and a basic blood panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I just need this for the insurance, I don't want to start getting all kinds of tests and… Is it expensive? I don't have a lot of money, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, it's understandable to be concerned. A murmur is simply an unusual sound heard when listening to the heart. It doesn't automatically mean there's a serious problem. Many murmurs are harmless, often described as "innocent murmurs." However, to be thorough and ensure your peace of mind – and to satisfy the insurance requirements – we need to investigate further. The EKG will assess the electrical activity of your heart, and the blood panel will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. These are routine tests, and Medicare should cover a significant portion of the cost. We can check your specific coverage details with the billing department to give you a precise estimate. I want to assure you that we're not jumping to conclusions. We’re simply taking the necessary steps to ensure you're healthy. Would you like me to proceed with ordering those tests?
PATIENT: Look, I just want the insurance. That’s all. But if they need these tests… okay, fine. Do them. Just… promise me it won’t be too expensive. And the quicker we get this over with, the better. Just let me know when I can get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we will do everything we can to minimize any financial burden. I’m ordering the EKG and basic blood panel now. The lab is located just down the hall; you can go at your convenience. They’re open until 5 pm today. Once the results are back – usually within 24 to 48 hours – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'll also need a urine sample for a basic urinalysis. Would you be able to provide that before you leave?
PATIENT: A urine sample? Seriously? Fine, whatever. Just point me to the bathroom. And can I at least get a printout or something explaining what all these tests are for? I don't want to be surprised by a huge bill for something I didn't even know I was getting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. Here you go. This document details the EKG, the blood panel, and the urinalysis, including what each test measures and the standard Medicare coverage. The restroom is just to your right, and I’ve provided a collection cup for the urine sample. Please leave the sample with the lab technician when you're finished. Once you’ve completed the tests, please let the receptionist know, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you. Do you have any other questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Just… get it over with. I'm gonna go do this and hopefully be done with this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. Thank you for your patience, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions. We’ll be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are available. .
