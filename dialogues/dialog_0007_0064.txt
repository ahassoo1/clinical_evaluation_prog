DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Is okay if I call you Valerie? Good to meet you too. Um… my chest. It hurts sometimes. Not all the time, you know? It’s… a pain. Like a heavy feeling.
DOCTOR: Please, call me Valerie. Absolutely. Okay, a pain in your chest. Not constant, you said?
PATIENT: No, not all the time. More when I… walk fast, maybe? Or if I carry something heavy, like groceries. It goes away when I rest. It’s been… oh, maybe a month now? A little longer, I think. Hard to remember exactly, you know how it is. But not getting worse, just… there.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good it hasn't been getting worse. So, a month or so of chest pain brought on by exertion – walking fast or lifting things – and it eases with rest. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe? It’s… not a sharp pain. More like… squeezing. Like someone is hugging my chest too tight. And heavy, like I said. Not like a muscle hurt, you know? It’s… inside. Does that make sense? I don't know all the words for things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Sherion. Squeezing, heavy, inside… that’s very helpful. Does the pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? What does that mean? Sorry, Doctor, I don’t understand. Does it… spread? Like a stain? I'm not good with these words. Maybe if you show me?
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Sherion. It just means does the pain travel to other parts of your body – your arm, your jaw, your back, maybe?
PATIENT: Oh! Travel! Yes. Sometimes… my left arm feels a little… achy. Not always, but when the chest hurts, sometimes the arm too. And… a little in my shoulder. Not bad, just… feels tired. Like I carried too many bags.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pain in your chest, sometimes radiating to your left arm and shoulder. That's good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… other things happening? Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little… breathless. Not like I can’t breathe, but… short of breath. When I walk up the stairs, maybe. And… sometimes a little dizzy. But not often. I thought it was just getting old!
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath with exertion and occasional dizziness… Okay. And have you had any nausea, sweating, or palpitations – that’s a feeling of your heart racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: Nausea? No, not sick to my stomach. No. Sweating… well, I live in Colombia, it’s always hot! I sweat a little, but that’s just the weather. And… palpitations? What is that? Is that like… when your heart beats fast? Sometimes, yes. When I get nervous, maybe. Or after I walk fast. But not always.
DOCTOR: Palpitations is a feeling of your heart racing or fluttering. Okay, so sometimes with exertion or when you're nervous. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions… Hmm. The doctor back home, he said my blood pressure was a little high once. But he gave me some pills, and I took them for a while. Then I moved here, and I didn’t see a doctor for a long time. I don’t have… diabetes, I don’t think? And cholesterol… I don’t know what that is. I eat pretty healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past. And you haven’t been regularly followed up on it since moving. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. I haven’t taken many pills, really. Just the ones for the blood pressure, and sometimes for a headache. Never had a bad reaction, nothing like that. I’m pretty good with medicines, usually.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, not right now. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a long time ago. Just… sometimes a little aspirin for a headache. But not often. I try to rest when I have a headache, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications currently. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother… she had a little trouble with her heart when she got old. She was very tired all the time. And my father… he had high blood pressure too, I think. He took pills for it. My brother… he’s healthy, I think. We don’t see each other much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. And finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean? Oh… like what I do every day? I live with my husband. He works, and I… I take care of the house. I like to walk, when the weather is nice. And I cook. I try to eat healthy, like I said. We don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. You live with your husband, you enjoy walking and cooking, and you don't smoke. Sherion, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you could be experiencing angina. That's chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It's often brought on by exertion and eases with rest, which matches your symptoms. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, as chest pain can be caused by many things. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I think an EKG and some blood work would be a good idea. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Angina? That sounds… scary. Reduced blood flow… oh dear. EKG and blood work… that’s okay. If you think it’s important. I trust you, Doctor. But what does it mean? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Sherion. It's good we're looking into this. An EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all – we just place some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The blood work will help us check your cholesterol levels and rule out other possible causes. It will just be a small sample of blood taken from your arm. The results will help us determine the best course of action. It could be something simple, or it could be something we need to manage with medication and lifestyle changes. Either way, we'll figure it out together. Let’s start with the physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers and blood. That doesn’t sound too bad. Yes, okay. Listen to my heart and lungs. That’s fine. Just… be gentle, please? My chest is a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. I will be very gentle. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. It helps me hear any unusual sounds. I’ll also check your blood pressure again and feel your pulse. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but we'll want to investigate it further with the EKG. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. And your pulse is steady. Now, let's get you set up for the EKG and blood work. My nurse, Maria, will come in shortly to assist you. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A murmur? That doesn't sound good. Maria… okay. Is the blood work… a lot of blood? I get a little dizzy sometimes, you know. And will the EKG take long? I have to get home to make dinner for my husband.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be concerned, Sherion. A murmur simply means there's a slightly different sound when your heart beats – it doesn't automatically mean anything is wrong. The EKG and blood work will help us understand what's causing it. The blood work will only be a few small vials – maybe two or three. And we’ll make sure you’re comfortable and sitting or lying down to prevent any dizziness. The EKG takes just a few minutes – we'll have it done very quickly. Maria is very experienced and will take good care of you. We'll get you back home in time to make dinner, I promise. Let me call Maria now and let her know you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay… a few vials and a few minutes. That’s… better. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Please, tell Maria to be gentle with the needle. My veins are a little small, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. I'll let her know right away. Small veins can sometimes be tricky. Maria is excellent at finding them, and she'll take extra care. Maria, could you come in here when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
DOCTOR: While we wait for Maria, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you might have forgotten?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I think. You answered all my questions. Just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. My husband would worry so much. He’s not good with medical things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion. It’s natural to worry about your husband. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll have a clear plan to address whatever it may be. Remember, we’re taking these steps to gather information and ensure your health. We'll take things one step at a time. And I’ll be here to explain everything clearly to both you and your husband. Maria, this is Sherion. She’s going to have an EKG and some blood work done. She has a bit of a concern about her veins being small, so could you be extra gentle?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Maria. It’s nice to meet you. Yes, my veins… they are a little small. It’s okay, though. I’ve had blood work before. Just… please be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Doctor. I’m very careful with all my patients. It’s nice to meet you too, Sherion. Don’t worry, we’ll get this done quickly and comfortably. Let’s start with the EKG. If you could just lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll explain everything as we go. This might feel a little cool, but it won’t hurt. We just need to place these stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It measures the electrical activity of your heart.
