DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It is… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because my husband, bless his heart, thinks I need to have one of these… Advance Directive forms. Or a POLST, he mentioned that as well. Honestly, I find the whole thing rather morbid, but he is insistent. I suppose I should humor him. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you coming in, Marija, and I understand your hesitation. It is a difficult topic to contemplate. Your husband is very thoughtful to be proactive about this, though. These documents – the Advance Directive and POLST – are about ensuring your wishes are honored if you ever become unable to speak for yourself. Perhaps we can discuss both, and determine which, if either, is most appropriate for you. To begin, are you familiar with the difference between an Advance Directive and a POLST form?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. He just kept saying "you need these papers" and talking about… what happens if something terrible occurs. He’s always been a bit dramatic. I skimmed something online, but it was full of… legal jargon. Is one more… binding than the other? And, frankly, I'm quite healthy. I don't see the necessity of planning for… complications at this moment.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Marija. It is often confusing terminology, and it’s good you’re asking questions. Let me explain. An Advance Directive is a broader document outlining your overall healthcare wishes, including things like what kind of medical treatment you want or don't want, and who you'd like to make decisions for you if you are unable to. It’s generally used for future situations, not necessarily emergencies. A POLST, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a more specific medical order, usually for individuals with serious illnesses or who are nearing the end of life. It’s based on a conversation with your doctor and outlines specific treatments you want or don't want right now. Because you are currently healthy, an Advance Directive might be the more suitable option for you at this time. It allows you to thoughtfully express your values and preferences. Does that distinction make sense?
PATIENT: It… sounds rather involved. And frankly, I don't enjoy dwelling on unpleasant possibilities. I've always believed a doctor simply knows what is best. I trust medical professionals to act in my best interest. Why is this… questioning of their judgment even necessary? It seems rather distrustful, doesn’t it? Is this common now, this… insistence on dictating one's own treatment? I prefer to leave these decisions to the experts.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid point, Marija, and a sentiment I hear often. Historically, the medical profession operated under that very principle – the doctor knows best. However, modern ethics emphasize patient autonomy – your right to make decisions about your own body and care. The Advance Directive isn't about distrusting doctors; it's about ensuring your values are honored, even if you're unable to communicate them directly. It helps us understand what's important to you, beyond just the medical facts. It’s a safety net, really. And, it is your body, and your right to decide. Would you be open to discussing some examples of the kinds of decisions covered in an Advance Directive?
PATIENT: I suppose I can listen to examples. But I assure you, Doctor, I have a perfectly sound mind, and my wishes are quite simple: do whatever is necessary to restore my health. I don’t require a lengthy document outlining the obvious. However… if it will appease my husband, I am willing to indulge this exercise for a short while. But I foresee no changes in my opinion.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Marija. We can certainly keep it brief, and you are under no obligation to complete anything you’re not comfortable with. It’s about exploring your thoughts, not changing them. One common element of an Advance Directive is naming a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you can't. Would you be comfortable discussing who you might choose for that role?
PATIENT: Of course. My husband, naturally. Who else would it be? He fusses over me enough as it is. He’d insist on the most… thorough treatment, regardless of my personal comfort. He means well, but… his definition of “quality of life” and mine may differ significantly. Still, it’s simpler that way. Less complication. Just… record that he is my proxy, and let us proceed. I trust he will… advocate for me. Even if I might not always agree with his methods.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I have recorded your husband as your healthcare proxy. Now, another aspect of the Advance Directive involves thinking about specific medical treatments. For example, should you ever be in a situation where you have a serious illness and are unable to breathe on your own, would you want to be placed on a ventilator?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. A ventilator? The indignity of it! I’ve seen those machines… people hooked up to them, utterly helpless. No, Doctor, I would not want that. I prefer… a natural conclusion, should it come to that. No artificial prolongation of suffering. Record that as well, please. No ventilators. No feeding tubes. Nothing that extends life artificially. Do you understand? I want my dignity preserved, above all else.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, I understand completely. I have recorded your wishes regarding ventilators and feeding tubes – that you do not want those interventions if they are unlikely to improve your quality of life. Now, sometimes people have strong feelings about CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which is used to restart the heart if it stops beating. Do you have any preferences regarding CPR?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather morbid. But… if I must continue this exercise… yes. I do not want CPR. I’ve seen those shows… the broken ribs, the… frantic efforts. If my time has come, it has come. No heroic measures, please. I want peace, not a prolonged and painful struggle. Record that as well. No CPR. Is this… nearly finished? I find this discussion deeply unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we are nearly finished. I have documented your wishes regarding CPR. So, to summarize, you’ve designated your husband as your healthcare proxy, and you’ve expressed your wishes against the use of ventilators, feeding tubes, and CPR if they are unlikely to improve your quality of life. I can print out a copy of this document for you to review with your husband, and you can sign it if you’re comfortable. It’s important to remember that you can change your mind at any time. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: Yes, let us simply get it over with. Print the document. I will review it, and sign it to appease him. But I maintain my position: this is a rather unnecessary exercise, and I hope to never revisit this discussion again. Thank you, Doctor. And now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I've endured enough unpleasantness for one day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Here you are. Take your time reviewing it, and please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I understand your reservations, and I respect your wishes. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad you came in today. If you do have any further questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a pleasant day, Marija.
