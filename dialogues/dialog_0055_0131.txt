DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s Ms. Sladen, actually. And, well… my blood pressure’s been acting up a bit. That’s what brought me in.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, of course. My apologies. “Acting up” is rather vague, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: Yeah, you’re right. Sorry, I didn’t explain myself well. It's just… higher than it usually is, when I check it at the pharmacy. Not by a ton, but enough to make me a little worried. I usually get it checked when I pick up my meds.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when was the last time you had it checked at the pharmacy, precisely?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was last week, on Tuesday, I think. July 30th. I was getting my usual prescription refilled, and the pharmacist said it was a bit high, so I figured I should get it looked at properly.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see... I take a little something for my arthritis, it’s called Celebrex, I think? And then I have a pill for my cholesterol, it’s… Atorvastatin. Yeah, that’s it. Just those two, regularly. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement, but that's not prescribed, just something I picked up.
DOCTOR: Right. Celebrex and Atorvastatin. Dosage, if you recall?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. For the Celebrex, it’s 200 milligrams, once a day. And the Atorvastatin… I think it’s 40 milligrams. Every evening. I’m pretty good with my pills, usually, so I think that's right. I have the bottles at home if you need to be absolutely sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any known allergies to any medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Not to pills, foods, nothing. I wish I could say the same about mosquitoes, though! They love me. But allergies… no.
DOCTOR: And your family history… are there any instances of hypertension, heart disease, or stroke that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my uncle, her son, he had a stroke a few years back. Not a massive one, thankfully, he recovered pretty well, but yeah, there’s that. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Sladen. Now, let us discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in regular physical activity?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't really drink either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that's it. As for exercise… well, that’s where I fall down a bit. I try to walk when I can, but with my arthritis, it’s not always easy. I used to be much more active, but… it’s harder now. I mostly just take it easy.
DOCTOR: “Taking it easy,” as you say, is often detrimental to one’s health. Now, before we proceed, let me ask about any current symptoms you are experiencing. Aside from the elevated blood pressure readings, are you experiencing headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. That’s what’s so strange! I feel perfectly fine, really. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just… life, you know? No headaches, no dizziness, my vision’s okay. That’s why I was surprised when the pharmacist said my blood pressure was high. It just doesn’t feel high.
DOCTOR: Hm. You report feeling perfectly well despite elevated readings. We shall perform a physical examination to corroborate your self-reported state. Please lie down on the examination table. I will begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I’ll just… excuse me a moment.
DOCTOR: Breathe deeply, Ms. Sladen. Normal breaths, if you please. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72 beats per minute. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I will check your blood pressure manually. Please remain still. Readings are… 148 over 92. Confirmed. And 150 over 90 on the second attempt. Slightly elevated, as the pharmacist noted. I’ll palpate your pulse in your radial artery. Pulse is regular and strong. No irregularities detected. Now, I will examine your thyroid gland. Please extend your neck slightly. Thyroid gland is within normal limits, no palpable abnormalities. I'll briefly assess your neurological function. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Coordination is intact. Now, sit up slowly. We will review your EHR for any prior blood pressure readings.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm just lying here, trying to relax. That's a lot of numbers. I just hope it's nothing serious. I'm not a fan of going to the doctor, to be honest. It always makes me a little anxious, even when nothing's wrong. Hopefully, it's just a blip.
DOCTOR: Your previous blood pressure readings are… inconsistent, to say the least. There is a record of 130/80 from six months ago, but also several readings in the 140s taken over the past few months. It appears the readings fluctuate quite a bit. This makes a definitive diagnosis challenging, but based on the current and past recordings, coupled with your family history, I suspect you may be experiencing stage 1 hypertension. Now, before you become unduly alarmed, it is important to understand this is often manageable with lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medication. However, we must rule out any secondary causes.
PATIENT: Stage 1… that sounds… serious. But manageable, you said? What kind of lifestyle modifications? And what do you mean, "secondary causes"? Is there something else going on besides just… my blood pressure being high? I'm a little worried now, if I'm honest. I thought I was just a bit stressed, maybe eating too much salt. But "secondary causes" sounds… complicated.
DOCTOR: “Complicated” is perhaps too strong a word. “Investigation” is more accurate. Secondary hypertension refers to high blood pressure caused by an underlying medical condition, such as kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain medications. These conditions must be ruled out before we attribute the hypertension to essential causes. As for lifestyle modifications, these include adopting a heart-healthy diet – low in sodium and saturated fats, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains – engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting alcohol consumption. To investigate further, I recommend a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess kidney function, a lipid panel to evaluate cholesterol levels, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to assess thyroid function, and an electrocardiogram to evaluate heart rhythm. We may also consider a sleep study if you exhibit symptoms of sleep apnea – such as snoring or excessive daytime sleepiness. For now, I will order these blood tests and schedule you for an ECG next week. We will re-evaluate your blood pressure readings and discuss the results in detail. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Wow, that’s… a lot of tests. Kidney disease, thyroid… I didn't even think about any of that! And a sleep study? I do snore a bit, my husband complains, but I just thought it was normal. I guess I am a bit sleepy during the day, now that you mention it. So, all these tests are just to figure out why my blood pressure is high? Not necessarily to start medication right away? And… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it cost a lot? I'm on Medicare, so I’m worried about copays and stuff. Sorry, I'm just asking a lot of questions. I get nervous when it comes to medical stuff.
DOCTOR: These are perfectly reasonable questions, Ms. Sladen. The purpose of these tests is to ascertain the underlying cause of your elevated blood pressure, as I previously stated. Medication is not necessarily the immediate course of action. We will first address any identifiable secondary causes, if present, and assess your overall cardiovascular risk. The results of the blood tests typically take 24 to 48 hours. The ECG results will be available within a few hours. As for costs, your Medicare coverage should cover a significant portion of these tests. However, you may be responsible for copays and deductibles. I recommend contacting your insurance provider for specific details regarding your coverage. Now, I will generate the necessary orders for these tests and schedule your ECG appointment. I also recommend reducing your sodium intake and engaging in light exercise, such as walking, while we await the results. Do you have any further questions before I proceed?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… better, I guess. Knowing it’s not necessarily straight to medication makes me feel a bit better. I’ll call Medicare and see what they cover. Walking I can definitely do, I think. And I’ll try to cut back on the salt. My husband does a lot of the cooking, so I’ll have to talk to him about it. No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to answer all my questions, even the silly ones.
DOCTOR: Very well. I shall prepare the orders and schedule the ECG. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. We will review the results next week. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Sladen.
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor. Thank you again.
