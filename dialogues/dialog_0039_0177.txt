DOCTOR: Hello Jimmi, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello. I... something's not right. Down there. It's...leaking. A little bit. Not a lot, but it's there. It's been a few days now, I think. Maybe longer? I don't really keep track of those things. It's kinda embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be a bit embarrassing to talk about these things. Don’t worry, I’m here to help and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. “Leaking,” you said… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s...not like a flood or anything. Just...a drip, sometimes. And it smells funny. Not a good funny, you know? Like...old fish, maybe? I cleaned it up, of course. I always keep things clean. But it keeps coming back. I don't know what's causing it. I haven't...well, I haven’t been with anyone in a long, long time. So it's not from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a drip with an unusual odor… and you haven’t had any recent sexual activity. That’s good to know. Has this been happening consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. Some days nothing. Some days a little. Today it was...more than usual, that’s why I came. It's kinda itchy too, sometimes. Not all the time, just…when it's leaking. And it's just…uncomfortable. I don't like feeling uncomfortable. It’s just…not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, with itchiness when the leaking occurs. And you said it's more than usual today… can you describe the “leakage” to me?
PATIENT: Well… it's… yellow-ish. And kinda thick. Not watery, like pee. Thicker. And it smells...well, I told you, like old fish. It gets on my underwear, of course. I try to wash it right away, but… it just bothers me. It's not like it used to be, you know? Everything's just… getting old. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellow-ish, thicker discharge with an odor, and you've noticed a change. Thank you for sharing all of that. It is important to investigate changes like this. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We'll just take a look. And it's perfectly okay if you'd prefer a female nurse to assist, if that makes you more comfortable.
PATIENT: Exam? Oh dear. Well... I don't really like doctors poking around. Is it necessary? Can't you just...give me something to make it stop? I don't like being touched. Especially down there. It's embarrassing enough just talking about it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Jimmi. It is very sensitive, and I wouldn’t do anything without your full consent. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to know what’s causing this without a quick look. It helps me rule out certain things and make sure we get you the right treatment. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible, and you can stop me at any time. We may need to collect a sample as well, just to be sure. I want to assure you that this is a very common issue, and there are usually effective treatments. But to get there, we need to understand what we're dealing with. If you’re still uncomfortable, we could potentially start with some initial bloodwork to rule out any other underlying causes, but that wouldn't give us a definitive answer for this specific problem. Would you like to discuss those options?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Hmm. I don't like needles either. Everything's poking and prodding. Honestly, I just want it to stop. It's interfering with my art. I can't concentrate when I'm worried about… this. Is it something serious? Like… cancer? My cousin, she got cancer, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jimmi, and it’s completely natural to worry about something serious, especially with a family history of cancer. It's good you brought that up. While cancer can sometimes cause changes like this, it's not the most common cause, and we shouldn't jump to conclusions. The bloodwork I mentioned is just a routine check to see if there’s any inflammation or infection present, which is often the cause of these types of symptoms. It’s a simple test, and doesn't take long. However, I do think it’s important to investigate this properly, and that may involve a quick examination. If you're very uncomfortable with that, we could start with the bloodwork, and then re-evaluate after we get the results. But I want to be honest with you: without an examination, it will be difficult to make an accurate diagnosis and get you the right treatment. Would you prefer to proceed with the bloodwork first, keeping in mind that we may need to revisit the idea of an examination later?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Bloodwork, then. But not too much, okay? And gently! I bruise easily, you know. I'm an artist, I need my hands. And… can I sit up during it? I get a little dizzy when I lie down.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. We'll take it slow and easy. Just a small amount of blood is needed. I'll make sure the phlebotomist knows you bruise easily and prefers to sit up during the draw. We can definitely have you sit in a chair if that’s more comfortable. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Hmm… my left arm feels weaker. Maybe the right one? It's usually okay. And… could you tell me what you think it is? Just a guess? I hate not knowing. It's the uncertainty that bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: Okay, right arm it is. As for what it could be… based on what you’ve told me – the discharge, the odor, and the itchiness – it’s most likely an infection, perhaps a bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. Those are very common and usually easily treated with medication. However, it's important to rule out anything more serious, which is why the bloodwork is important. We'll send the sample to the lab, and I'll call you as soon as the results are in, usually within a day or two. Then we can discuss the next steps. For now, let’s get the bloodwork done, and then you can relax a little, knowing we're on top of it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds okay. As long as you're careful. And you'll call me? Not a nurse? I don't really trust nurses. You promised. And… what if it is something bad? Like my cousin?
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise I’ll be the one to call you with the results, Jimmi. I’ve made a note of that specifically. And I understand your concerns. It’s natural to worry about the worst-case scenario, but let's focus on getting the information we need first. If it were something more serious, we would discuss all your options and I would refer you to a specialist immediately. We have excellent specialists in the area. But, again, the most likely explanation is a common infection that is easily treatable. Let's just get this bloodwork done. Would you like to use a tourniquet?
PATIENT: Tourni…what? No. I don't like things tight around my arm. It makes me nervous. Just… do it quickly, okay? And gently. Like you promised. I have to get back to my art, you know. Inspiration won't wait.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. No tourniquet, quick and gentle. I'll stay right here with you the whole time. I'll let the phlebotomist know your preferences. Just try to relax, and breathe deeply. It will be over before you know it. Here she is now.
