DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. I’m Dr. Auelua. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet mostly. It’s been… a few weeks now, I suppose. Not constant, but it’s enough to bother me. I just want to know what’s causing it, if you can help. I haven’t been sleeping well worrying about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet for a few weeks, comes and goes, and it’s been keeping you up at night. I understand that’s concerning. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. First, can you describe the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… It’s like… pins and needles, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as… strong. And sometimes it feels numb, just… not really there. It’s hard to explain. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s… unsettling. Does that make sense? I hope so. I’m not good at describing things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Teretha. “Pins and needles” and numbness, like a foot falling asleep, but less intense. And not painful, just unsettling. Okay. Now, where exactly are you feeling this tingling?
PATIENT: Mostly in my fingertips and toes. And sometimes it goes up my hands a little, into the palms. And the tops of my feet, too. Not my ankles, though, thankfully. It's worse on my right side, I think… or maybe I just notice it more there. It’s hard to tell, really. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, so primarily in your fingertips and toes, extending into the palms and tops of your feet, a bit more noticeable on the right side. I understand your frustration – wanting it to stop is a perfectly reasonable feeling. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if anything specifically seems to trigger it or make it worse?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t know if anything specifically does. It doesn't seem to be after any certain activity. I walk a lot for my job, delivering mail, but it doesn't seem worse after a long shift, and it happens even on days I don't work much. Maybe… maybe when it’s cold? I do feel it more when my hands are chilly. But I wear gloves. I don’t know. It just happens. I wish I could tell you something concrete.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be directly related to activity, although cold might play a small role. And you wear gloves, which is good. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Have you had any other symptoms along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I've been a little more tired lately, but that could just be my age, you know? And my back aches sometimes, but I do a lot of lifting at work. Oh… and my balance isn’t what it used to be. I almost tripped the other day, but I caught myself. Nothing else really. I’m not sick or anything, just… old, I guess. And worried about this tingling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue, back pain related to your job, and a little bit of trouble with your balance. I appreciate you sharing all of that. Now, Teretha, I’m going to ask some more general questions about your medical history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Ask away. I don’t have much of a medical history, to be honest. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. But ask what you need to know. Just… don't take too long, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient as I can. First, have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. Never been tested for it, either, to be honest. I eat okay, I think. A little too much pierogi sometimes, maybe, but nothing terrible. My husband, God rest his soul, always said I needed to eat more. He liked to cook. Never had any problems with sugar, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, not those either. I’ve never really gone to the doctor much. Just when I broke my wrist a few years back, and for a flu shot now and then. My husband always took care of things like that. He was the worrier, not me. I just... I don't like doctors, if I'm being honest. It reminds me of him being sick.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Teretha. It's perfectly alright to feel that way. We’ll take things at your pace. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the one. A hysterectomy, a long time ago. When I was… oh, I don’t even remember exactly how old. Maybe in my thirties? It was a long time ago. Everything went fine, as far as I know. No problems after that. Nothing else, though. Just that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the hysterectomy. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… My mother had arthritis, badly. She was in a wheelchair the last few years of her life. And my father… he had heart trouble. He didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much. He died young, I think. Not sure exactly how old. That’s about it, really. Not much else runs in the family, as far as I know. Everyone else lived a long life, mostly. Ukrainian people are hardy, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had arthritis and your father had heart trouble. That’s helpful. Now, Teretha, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take most anything, as far as I know. I don't take much medication, though. Just some ibuprofen for my back now and then. And… oh, sometimes a little something for a cold, but that's it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and minimal medication use. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Well, I suppose so. If you have to. I don't like being poked and prodded, but if it will help figure out what's wrong… Alright. Go ahead. But please be gentle, Doctor. My skin is sensitive. And hurry, if you can. I really do have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Teretha. I’ll be as gentle as possible and we'll get through this quickly. First, let’s check your reflexes in your knees. Could you sit on the edge of the examination table, please, and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Alright. <I carefully sit on the edge of the examination table, legs dangling, and look at Dr. Auelua with a slightly apprehensive expression.> Just… try not to hit me too hard, okay? It's going to be a long day if my knees are hurting.
DOCTOR: I certainly will, Teretha. This won’t hurt. Just relax. <I gently tap Teretha’s patellar tendon with the reflex hammer. I observe her leg for any response.> Okay… and now the other leg. <I repeat the process on the other leg. Both reflexes are 2+, normal. <I make a note on my chart.> Okay, good. Now, I’m going to check the sensation in your feet. I’m going to lightly touch your feet with this, and tell me when you feel it. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright. <I shift slightly on the table as Dr. Auelua begins to touch my feet with something. I close my eyes briefly, concentrating on the sensation. Yes, I can feel that… a little bit prickly, maybe?> Yes, I feel it. Here. <I point to the top of my right foot. And… yes, there too. <I point to the bottom of my left foot. It’s not very strong, though. It feels… muffled. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. You are able to feel that. And your strength seems good in both hands and feet - 5 out of 5, which is normal. I also notice your skin is a little bit dry, but that's common, especially with the changing weather. I'm documenting all of this. Based on what you've told me and the exam, the tingling and numbness are concerning, and could be related to a few different things, like nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy, or even a vitamin deficiency. It's hard to say definitively without further investigation. To help narrow things down, I’d like to order some blood work. It will check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work… <I sigh softly.> Well, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like needles, but… I want to know what’s wrong. Yes. Blood work is fine. But… how long will it take to get the results? And will it hurt much?
DOCTOR: It won't hurt much at all, Teretha, just a quick pinch. And the results usually take about 3-5 business days. We’ll have them sent to the clinic, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if the tingling gets significantly worse, or you develop any weakness or severe pain, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now before we get the order for the blood work sent in?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. And… hopefully, it's nothing serious. I really just want to get back to my job and… well, live my life. Okay, send in the blood work order. Let’s get this over with. <I shift in my seat, looking a little anxious.
