DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Umm... hi. My nails. They look... funny. Not good funny. I don't even know where to start, really. They just... changed. I think. It’s been a while since I really looked at my hands, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’ve noticed changes in your nails and you’re not sure what’s causing it. That’s a good reason to come in. “Changed” is pretty broad, though. Can you describe what’s different about them?
PATIENT: Different... hmm. They're kinda... bumpy? And the color isn't right. Not like a pretty pink, more... yellowish, I guess. And one of them... feels thick. Like it could break, maybe. I don’t know. It's just... not normal. I don't usually pay attention to stuff like this, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumpy, yellowish discoloration, and one feels thickened, potentially brittle. And this has been happening for… how long have you noticed these changes, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh gosh, time... that's a hard one. Maybe... a few months? I really can't say for sure. I just noticed it the other day when I was gardening, and I thought, "That doesn't look right." Before that... I don't remember. I been busy, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright. A few months is helpful. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort associated with the changes in your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. It doesn't hurt hurt. Maybe a little... sensitive when I get dirt under them, but that's normal with gardening, right? Like, when you pull weeds? It's just... a little ouch sometimes. Nothing I can't handle.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant pain, just some sensitivity with dirt under the nails, especially when gardening. Now, besides gardening, are there any other activities you do regularly that might put stress on your hands?
PATIENT: Stress? Not really. I watch a lot of TV. And I... cook sometimes. But nothing hard. Just, you know, normal stuff. I used to do pottery, a long time ago, but I haven't done that in ages. Why? Does pottery do something to your nails? I always thought my hands were fine.
DOCTOR: No, pottery isn’t necessarily the issue, just trying to get a complete picture. And you're right, it’s good you're bringing this up now. Let's take a look at your hands and nails. Can you hold out your hands for me, palms up?
PATIENT: Okay, here. Be gentle, alright? I don’t want them to break. They're my gardening hands, you know? Can't garden with broken nails.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. There is some discoloration, a yellowish hue, particularly on several nails. And I notice some thickening and slight ridging on the nail of your right index finger, and a bit of pitting on a couple of others. The texture seems a little brittle as well. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like... what kind of symptoms? I don't feel sick or anything. Maybe... my skin feels kinda dry, but that’s probably just the weather. It's been so hot. And my joints ache sometimes, but that's just getting old, I guess. Everyone gets old.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin, and some joint aching. Any other medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And the doctor said I had a little bit of, what was it... cholesterol? Something like that. But he said it wasn't anything to worry about. Oh, and I get a little dizzy sometimes, but that’s just my ears, I think. They always bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, some history of cholesterol, and dizziness. Are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any recently?
PATIENT: Medications... not really. Just some vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes I take vitamin D in the winter, 'cause the doctor said I was low. Oh, and I use a cream for my hands, 'cause they get so dry. But that's it. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, occasional vitamin D, and hand cream. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat all kinds of stuff. I haven't had a problem with food, or anything. Sometimes my skin gets itchy if I wear cheap jewelry, but that's just a little rash. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Based on what you've told me, and the examination, it's possible this could be a fungal infection of the nails, called onychomycosis. The discoloration, thickening, and brittleness are consistent with that. However, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, like psoriasis, or even simply trauma to the nails. To be certain, we need to do a test to confirm if there’s a fungal infection. Would you be okay with me taking a small scraping from under your nail to send to the lab?
PATIENT: A scraping? Like... take a piece of my nail off? Oh dear. That doesn't sound very nice. Is it gonna hurt? And what if it isn't a fungus? What then? I don't like things being scraped off of me.
DOCTOR: It’s a very small scraping, Ms. Thut, not a big piece of the nail. It’s usually not painful, more like filing your nail a little bit. And you're right to ask about what if it's not a fungus. If it's not, we'll discuss other possibilities and potentially run further tests, depending on what we suspect. It could be a skin condition, and we'd explore treatment options for that. The test is the best way to figure out what’s going on so we can get you the right treatment. Would you like me to explain the test process in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If it's just a little scrape... and you say it won’t hurt… I guess so. But be gentle, alright? And what happens if it is a fungus? Do I have to take pills? I don't like taking pills. And will it spread to the other nails?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I’ll be very gentle, I promise. If it is a fungus, treatment options depend on the severity. Sometimes topical medications are enough, like a special nail polish you apply regularly. In more severe cases, oral medication might be necessary, but we’d discuss the risks and benefits thoroughly before making any decisions. And yes, fungal infections can spread, which is why it's important to treat it. We'll discuss ways to prevent that spread as well. I’ll explain everything step-by-step as I go. First, I’m going to clean the area…
