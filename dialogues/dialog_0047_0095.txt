DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day to explain things. It's...well, I woke up this morning and I can't hear out of one ear. And my face feels…droopy, on that same side. It's quite alarming, really. I expect you to know what that means.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I do know what that could mean, Ms. Nissenbaum, but I need you to tell me exactly what you’re experiencing so I can properly assess the situation. “Can’t hear” and “droopy” are rather vague. When you say you can’t hear, is it a complete loss of hearing, muffled sound, ringing?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not a doctor. How am I supposed to describe not hearing? It's just…gone. Like someone turned off a switch. Completely silent. And the face thing…it just feels weak. Like half of my face is going to slide off. Is that clear enough? Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather…basic.
DOCTOR: It is clear that you’re distressed, Ms. Nissenbaum. And I apologize if my questions seem basic, but they are necessary. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness are concerning symptoms. To be more specific, is the weakness on the left or right side of your face?
PATIENT: The right side. Definitely the right side. And it happened overnight. I went to bed perfectly fine, and woke up like this. I don’t understand why I have to detail everything. It's quite obvious something is wrong. Do you need a list of all my vital signs from…yesterday? I don't even know why I bothered coming in if I have to explain the obvious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I assure you, I do understand something is wrong. However, determining the cause requires a thorough assessment. Sudden onset unilateral hearing loss and facial weakness… strongly suggests Bell’s palsy, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to perform a brief neurological exam. Can you please follow my instructions?
PATIENT: Neurological exam? Goodness. Honestly, I was hoping for a quick diagnosis and a prescription. But fine. Just get it over with. I have…appointments. Don't expect me to be particularly cooperative if it involves a lot of…silliness. And please, no poking.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I’m going to take a look in your ears. Please keep your head still. Ears look clear. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes. I’m going to ask you to smile. Show me your teeth. Hmm. And now, try to close both eyes tightly. Do they both close equally?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is humiliating. Yes, they do not close equally. The right one…feels looser. Like it won't stay shut. Is that what you wanted to see? I feel like I'm in a circus. And I still don’t know what’s wrong. Don’t tell me it’s just…a pinched nerve. I read things online, you know. It could be something dreadful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your anxiety, but catastrophizing won't help. You are right to be concerned, and I am taking your symptoms seriously. Based on my initial examination, Bell’s palsy is the most likely diagnosis at this point. It’s a condition where the facial nerve becomes inflamed, causing weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. However, we need to rule out other causes. Do you have any history of stroke, diabetes, or recent viral infections like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Stroke? Absolutely not. Diabetes? Heavens, no. I eat very healthily. A recent…cold? Perhaps a slight sniffle last month. Nothing serious. It was just…a sniffle. Honestly, I don't see what a sniffle has to do with my face falling off. Is this a common occurrence? Because if so, I'm moving to a different state. Somewhere with better doctors and fewer sniffles.
DOCTOR: Bell’s palsy can sometimes be preceded by a viral illness, even a mild one. It's not always the case, but it's common enough to ask. It's also important to determine the severity of the weakness. Can you lift your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Honestly, I'm not sure what you expect me to do. Lift them? I suppose I can…a little. The right one barely moves. It’s pathetic. Like a…a wilting flower. Is this going to be permanent? I have a luncheon next week. A very important luncheon. I can't go looking like this. Do you have anything that will fix it immediately? A cream, perhaps? Or an injection?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there is no immediate “fix,” Ms. Nissenbaum. In most cases, Bell’s palsy resolves on its own within weeks to months. However, we can help manage the symptoms and improve your chances of a full recovery. I'm going to prescribe you a course of oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. I will also recommend lubricating eye drops, as the weakness can cause your eye to dry out. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t keep a list of allergies. I’ve never had any problems with…pills, generally. Though I do prefer natural remedies. Do these corticosteroids have side effects? I don't want to gain weight. And will they make me…irritable? I already have very little patience. This is all rather inconvenient, you know. I had plans. Very important plans. .
DOCTOR: Corticosteroids can have side effects, including weight gain, increased appetite, and mood changes, though these are usually mild and temporary. We can discuss alternative options if you are concerned, but they are generally the most effective treatment. Given your age and medical history, I would also recommend a referral to a neurologist to rule out other potential causes and monitor your progress. Do you have insurance?
