DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to begin, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Reisig. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? It said my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something? They just used a lot of big words, and honestly, I don’t really understand it. That’s why I made an appointment.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you received some lab results that caused some concern, and you’d like me to help explain them. Absolutely, that’s what I’m here for. “Hyperlipidemia” is the term they likely used – it simply means you have higher than optimal levels of cholesterol in your blood. To get a better understanding of what's going on, and to determine the best course of action, I’d like to ask you a few questions. First, do you have a copy of those lab results with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do! I brought everything they sent. It was quite a stack, actually. I wasn’t sure what was important.
DOCTOR: Thank you. This is helpful. Okay, I see your total cholesterol is 240, your LDL is 160, your HDL is 45, and your triglycerides are 180. These numbers do indicate elevated cholesterol. Now, Ms. Geho, have you been told about your cholesterol levels before, or is this the first time you're aware of them?
PATIENT: No, this is the very first time. I usually feel pretty good, to be honest. I eat… reasonably well, I think. Not a lot of fast food. My mother always said I had good genes, but maybe that’s just wishful thinking! I’ve never had any tests like this before, so it’s all new to me.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if it's new to you – many people don't have their cholesterol checked regularly unless there's a specific reason. And family history is certainly a factor, so your mother may well be right! To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your overall health and lifestyle. Have you ever had any heart problems, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I get a little breathless sometimes when I’m climbing the stairs… but I live on the third floor, so that’s not surprising, is it? And I walk a lot, but mostly on flat ground. I've never been to a cardiologist or anything. I just thought it was getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Breathlessness with exertion can have many causes, and living on the third floor certainly explains some of it! We'll want to rule out anything serious, of course. Now, Ms. Geho, do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, none of those. My blood pressure is usually pretty good, the nurse checks it every time I get my flu shot, and it’s always fine. And I haven’t been told I have diabetes or anything like that. I do take a little medication for… well, just arthritis in my hands. Nothing major, just something to help with the stiffness.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands. And what medication are you taking for that, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: It’s called… Oh, let me see… Here it is. Naproxen. Just when I need it, you know? Not every day. It’s an over-the-counter one, mostly. Sometimes the doctor prescribes a stronger one if it’s really bad.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Naproxen is an NSAID, and it’s good to know you use it as needed. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any heart problems, high cholesterol, or diabetes in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had a heart attack when he was quite old, maybe in his eighties. And my mother’s brother… he had some kind of trouble with his blood sugar, I think. He was always tired. But other than that, not really. They both lived to be pretty old, all things considered. My father smoked for years, of course. I never did, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And finally, let’s touch on your lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well, regularly is maybe a strong word. I walk a lot, like I said. To the grocery store, to the library. And I try to get out in the garden when the weather is nice. But I wouldn’t say it’s a strict routine. I don’t go to a gym or anything. Mostly just pottering around, really. I used to swim a bit, but the pool closed down a few years ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Any activity is good activity. Now, Ms. Geho, before we discuss a plan, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Do I need to change into a gown?
DOCTOR: No, a gown won’t be necessary for this exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long. Everything sounds good so far. I'll just feel your pulse now. Your pulse is regular and strong. Now, based on your history and this exam, and the lab results, you do have elevated cholesterol. The good news is it’s something we can manage. Would you like me to explain the different options?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I would really appreciate that. I’m not really a fan of taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. Are there things I can do? Like with my diet? Or more walking? I just want to understand all my choices. And what happens if I… don’t do anything? I guess that’s important to know too.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very good question, and it's important to understand all your options. Let's start with what happens if we don’t address it. Elevated cholesterol, over time, can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries, which can narrow them and restrict blood flow. This increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Now, about what you can do. Lifestyle changes are a great first step, and often enough to significantly lower cholesterol, especially if it’s only mildly elevated. Diet is a big factor. Reducing saturated and trans fats, and increasing fiber intake can make a real difference. Things like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein are beneficial. Increasing your physical activity is also very helpful. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We can also discuss medication if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Statins are the most common type of medication used to lower cholesterol, and they’re generally very effective. However, they do have potential side effects, so we would carefully weigh the risks and benefits before starting any medication. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, it does, thank you. So, if I really focus on my diet and walking, maybe I can avoid the pills? And if that doesn’t work… then we talk about the medication. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like… special supplements or anything? I read things online, but I don’t trust everything I see.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach. Yes, focusing on diet and exercise is a great first step, and many people are able to lower their cholesterol significantly with these changes. We can always revisit medication if needed. As for supplements, there's some evidence that certain supplements, like omega-3 fatty acids, can help lower triglycerides, but the evidence for lowering LDL cholesterol is less convincing. Red yeast rice can lower cholesterol, but it contains a natural form of statin, and the amount can vary, so it's not always consistent and can interact with other medications. I generally recommend focusing on a healthy diet and exercise first, and not relying on supplements. I would like to repeat your cholesterol levels in three months to see how you are progressing. We can also discuss a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you create a personalized meal plan. Would that be something you're interested in?
PATIENT: Yes, I think a dietitian would be very helpful. I always struggle with knowing what I should be eating. And yes, please, let’s do the blood test again in three months. I’ll try really hard to walk more and eat better. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the next blood test? Like… fast beforehand or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm happy to hear that. I've sent a referral to a registered dietitian, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. For the follow-up blood test in three months, it's best to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. We’ll want a fasting lipid panel for the most accurate results. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Reisig. You’ve explained everything so clearly, and I feel much less worried now. I really appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, we're in this together, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you again in three months.
