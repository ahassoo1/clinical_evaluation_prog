DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about having a baby. And I want to make sure it happens…easily. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I want to skip all the trouble, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: "Easily," you say. Right. Well, let's be realistic. Having a baby is never truly "easy." But we can certainly look into optimizing things. You're 51, which does present some…challenges. Have you been trying for a while?
PATIENT: No. Not trying. Thinking about it. Planning. I don't waste my time on things that might not work. That's why I’m here, isn't it? To find out if it will work, and what needs to be done to make it…efficient. And frankly, I'd like to know if it’s worth the effort before I get my hopes up. I don't do disappointment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s start with some basics. Have you had children before?
PATIENT: No. Never married, not until…well, it doesn’t matter. Divorced. And that's precisely why I'm here now, before time runs out. It was a…brief arrangement. Point is, I haven’t had a child. And I don’t need a lecture on the…ideal timing of things.
DOCTOR: I wasn't offering a lecture, Ms. Shteynberg. Just gathering information. It’s relevant. Have you had any significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing…important. A few colds, a broken wrist when I was a girl, but nothing that would…interfere. I’m very healthy for my age. I cycle every day. Keeps me fit. I take care of myself. Really, I expect this to be a straightforward case. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: “Straightforward” is rarely the case in medicine, Ms. Shteynberg. But we'll proceed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Penicillin. A mild rash. Nothing serious. And I prefer to avoid medication if possible. All those side effects. I read the labels. I'm very cautious. Is that all? Because I have an appointment this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s quickly go over your current medications, if any. Vitamins, supplements, anything at all. And then we'll need to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Fine. I take a multivitamin. Every day. And calcium, for my bones. Cycling, you know. And…sometimes, a ginger capsule for digestion. That’s it. Really. A physical exam seems rather excessive, but if you insist. Just…try to be quick. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll excuse me, I'll step out so you can change. We’ll start with your blood pressure and weight, then move on to a quick abdominal and pelvic exam. It's necessary to assess your overall health and rule out any potential issues. Don’t take too long.
PATIENT: Abdominal and pelvic? At my age? Look, I’m a bicycle repairer, not some… delicate flower. I assure you, everything is perfectly functional. I’d prefer to skip that part, if at all possible. And frankly, I'm starting to regret wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, with all due respect, a thorough medical evaluation is essential, regardless of your profession or personal beliefs. Your age and desire to conceive necessitate a complete assessment to determine if it is safe and feasible. Skipping crucial steps is simply irresponsible. The pelvic exam is non-negotiable. It's a standard component of a fertility workup and allows me to evaluate your reproductive organs. I understand your discomfort, but I must prioritize your health and well-being. If you are unwilling to proceed with the full examination, I am afraid I cannot provide you with the care you are seeking. I will document your refusal in your chart. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you must. But don’t expect me to be…pleasant about it. And I expect you to be…efficient. I have a business to run. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. If you are ready, we can begin. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure and weight, then we'll proceed with the abdominal exam. After that, we'll move on to the pelvic exam. I will explain each step as we go.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. The faster this is done, the better. And please, no unnecessary chatter. I'm perfectly capable of understanding what you’re doing without a detailed explanation.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated. We'll monitor that. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please try to relax. Abdomen is unremarkable. No significant findings. Now, for the pelvic exam…please bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table. I will use a speculum to visualize your cervix. This may cause some discomfort.
PATIENT: Just... hurry. And be gentle. I won't tolerate any…roughness. I’ve had enough indignity for one day.
DOCTOR: There is some mild tenderness on the left ovary. It’s difficult to determine the cause at this point. It could be due to a number of factors. Now, I’m going to take a swab to screen for sexually transmitted infections. This is standard procedure, even if you have not been sexually active recently. It's best to be thorough. Alright. That’s all for the physical exam. I'll send the swab to the lab for analysis. We'll also need to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, hormone levels, and an ovarian reserve test to assess your egg supply. Do you have any questions before we proceed to the next step?
PATIENT: Hormone levels? Ovarian reserve? You’re starting to sound… pessimistic. Is this what you do? Tell women they’re too old and send them on their way? I came here for a solution, not a lecture on the decline of…well, everything. And frankly, I don't like the sound of any of this. Can’t you just…boost something? Give me a pill? I’ve read about those things. I want options, not bad news.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration. However, responsible medical care requires a thorough assessment before recommending any treatment. The hormone levels and ovarian reserve test are necessary to determine your individual suitability for fertility interventions. Simply "boosting something" without knowing your baseline hormonal status or egg supply could be ineffective, and potentially harmful. There are options, but they depend on your test results. If your hormone levels are low, we can explore hormone therapy. If your egg supply is diminished, we can discuss options such as donor eggs. But we need the data before we can make any recommendations. I am not trying to deliver "bad news," I am trying to provide you with the most accurate and appropriate care. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your situation and allow us to develop a personalized plan. I will write the orders for the lab tests now. It will take a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Fine. Do the tests. But I want you to be honest with me. No sugarcoating. And if there’s nothing you can do…just tell me. I don't need false hope. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a business to run.
