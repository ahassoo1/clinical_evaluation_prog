DOCTOR: Right. So, Mrs. McConnon, you’re… 90, is it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… Ninety. Seems like yesterday I was a little girl, but… time goes fast, doesn’t it? My belly… it feels full, but not in a good way. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Everything just… sits.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, things change. “Feels full,” you say. And not… pleasant?
PATIENT: No, not pleasant. It's… heavy. Like a balloon, maybe? And I get tired easy. Not like I used to go running, mind you, but even little things… walking to the kitchen, it takes it out of me. I used to be a… a worker, you know? A thinker. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “Heavy,” “tired easy.” Any nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea? Hmm… what's that mean, exactly? Do you mean… sick to my stomach? Sometimes, yes. Not always, but when the belly is really full, I feel a bit… wobbly. Like I might… well, you know. But not throwing up, no. Not for a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. "Wobbly." Okay. And any changes in your… bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now… what does that mean? Is that… about going to the bathroom? I… it's not as regular as it used to be, that's for sure. Sometimes it's hard, sometimes… not so much. Old age, I guess. Everything slows down, doesn't it? I'm sorry, I don’t understand all these fancy questions.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. McConnon, I have other patients. Are you constipated, or do you have diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness! Such… direct questions! Well… sometimes it's hard to… push it out, if you know what I mean. And sometimes it's… too loose. Like water, almost. But mostly hard. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, really. I used to study people, I asked the questions, not the other way around!
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Any… abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Pain… yes. Sometimes. It’s not sharp, you understand? More like a dull ache. Low down, in my belly. Comes and goes. It’s… uncomfortable, that’s all. Like a heavy weight pressing on me. It doesn’t take my breath away or anything. Just… there.
DOCTOR: And… any changes in appetite beyond just not wanting to eat?
PATIENT: Well… food doesn't taste the same anymore. It used to be such a pleasure! Now everything is… bland. Even the sweets. My daughter brought me a nice cake last week, and… it just didn't have the flavor it used to. I try to eat, I really do, but it's just… not enjoyable. Everything feels a bit… dusty, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Look, Mrs. McConnon, it sounds like… old age. You’re 90, things slow down. Probably some mild constipation, loss of appetite. We could do some tests, but honestly, at your age… Do you have any allergies or are you taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh… tests? I don't know… I don’t want to be poked and prodded, if I can help it. I'm not on any medicine, no. Never been much of a pill-taker. And allergies… hmm… I used to be allergic to cats, but I haven’t been around a cat in years! Maybe I'm not anymore. I just want to feel… a little better, you know? Is there anything… anything simple I could do? Something to help the belly?
DOCTOR: Look, drink more water. And… eat fiber. Fruits, vegetables. I'll write a note for a stool softener. But honestly, at your age, these things are common. Don’t expect miracles, alright?
PATIENT: Oh… water, yes. That’s sensible. And… fruit. I like apples, when I can get them. A stool softener… is that like a… a little helper? Will that really make a difference? I just… I just want to be comfortable enough to enjoy my afternoons, you know? Sit in the sun and read my books. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Here. Take this to the pharmacy. And... try to get some exercise, if you can. Walk around a bit. I have other patients waiting. Is there anything else, or are we done?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, doctor. Exercise… well, I’ll try. It’s harder these days, you see. And… no, I don’t think that’s all. I… I feel a bit lonely, sometimes. My daughter visits, but she has her own life, you understand. It’s just… nice to talk to someone, even if it’s about my belly.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. McConnon, I'm a doctor, not a therapist. I can help with medical issues, but… loneliness is something you need to address with family or friends. Good day.
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Well… thank you for the paper, anyway. And… thank you for listening, even if it wasn’t… what I needed. Good day to you too, doctor. .
