DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Really, it's just… a formality, I suppose. New to the area, you see. Medicare insisted on a visit. Honestly, I haven’t needed a doctor in… well, a very long time. I’m perfectly capable, thank you very much. I simply needed to fulfill their requirements. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: I understand. While fulfilling insurance requirements is certainly valid, a check-up can be beneficial regardless of current health status. It allows us to establish a baseline and proactively address any potential concerns. Nevertheless, we can certainly keep this brief if you prefer. However, I am obligated to ask a few standard questions, even if simply for documentation. To begin, have you experienced any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Goodness. At my age, everything is changing. Bones ache a bit more, perhaps. Memory isn't what it used to be – though it never was exceptional, if I'm being honest. Is that what you mean by changes? I haven’t fallen ill, if that’s what you're getting at. I maintain a very… sensible lifestyle. I assure you, I am not one to complain needlessly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your… forthrightness, Ms. Engelhaupt. When I refer to changes, I'm inquiring about any new symptoms or deviations from your usual state of well-being. Aches and memory lapses are common with age, of course, but have these worsened recently?
PATIENT: Worsened? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep a log of my aches and pains. It ebbs and flows, as things do. And the memory… well, let’s just say I rely heavily on my husband. He handles the appointments and… reminders. I wouldn't say it's worse. Just… present. Is this truly necessary? I have errands to attend to.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Engelhaupt. A comprehensive understanding of your health is paramount, even if you feel perfectly well. It allows me to assess your overall condition and ensure there are no underlying issues that require attention. Perhaps we can approach this systematically. Let’s start with a brief review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – such as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chronic conditions… My husband handles all that paperwork, you see. I vaguely recall something about… high blood pressure, perhaps? Years ago. But he managed it. He always does. I honestly couldn't tell you the specifics. It was treated, and I’ve been perfectly fine since. Really, I don't trouble myself with such details. Is he permitted to speak on my behalf? It would save us both a great deal of time.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your husband’s involvement, Ms. Engelhaupt, I am obligated to obtain information directly from you whenever possible. Medical privacy regulations, you understand. However, we can certainly proceed at a slower pace if that is more comfortable. Very well. Let’s try this. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… oh dear. That was… a very long time ago. When my eldest was born, there was a complication. A rather unpleasant one, I recall, but all resolved, thankfully. And… I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. That's all I can readily recall. Honestly, Doctor, this feels… rather intrusive. I've lived a long and healthy life. I hardly think dredging up ancient history is necessary. Is there a way to simply… sign something stating I'm in good health?
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, with all due respect, a simple statement of “good health” is not sufficient for proper medical documentation. It's my professional responsibility to gather a thorough history. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Oh, heavens no. I believe in a sensible diet, not those… concoctions. As for prescription drugs… well, my husband used to manage my blood pressure medication. But that was years ago. He would know the name, if you must. Honestly, I've always preferred a natural approach to health. All these chemicals and… interventions. I'm quite certain I'm not taking anything currently. Are we nearing the end of this… ordeal?
DOCTOR: Very well. Finally, let's discuss allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don't believe so. I’ve always been rather robust, you see. I eat most things without issue. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but that’s hardly an allergy. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning… tedious. I’ve lived a long life without being plagued by allergies. Is there a point to all this? I truly must be going. My errands are piling up. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. In the interest of time, I will proceed with a brief physical examination. It will be quite cursory, given your expressed… disinterest in a comprehensive assessment. Please have a seat on the examination table. I will begin by listening to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shoes and socks.
