DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s…well, I feel just drained. Like all the energy's been sucked right out of me. It comes and goes, but when it's bad…it’s bad. My husband keeps saying I need to rest more, but I do rest! It just doesn’t…help.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling drained, with energy that comes and goes…that's definitely something we need to look into. When did you first start noticing this, Ardelle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I…? It’s been…a while. Not recently, certainly. Maybe…last year? Or the year before? Honestly, keeping track of dates isn’t what it used to be. Everything just seems to…blur together after a certain age, you know? It's not like I haven't been busy, though. I still do a bit of diving when I can.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. So, it's been ongoing for at least a year, maybe longer. And you mentioned you still do some diving – that's good to know. Is the fatigue interfering with your ability to do the diving, or other activities you enjoy?
PATIENT: Well, it has been a bit harder to get going, to be truthful. Used to be, I could just…suit up and go. Now? It takes…effort. And sometimes, I just feel too weak, too tired. My husband, bless his heart, worries about it. He says I shouldn’t push myself, but what else am I going to do, sit inside all day? I’ve been diving since I was a girl! It's not just a hobby, you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. It’s good you’re staying active, but we need to make sure it’s safe for you. Besides the fatigue and difficulty getting started, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Other symptoms…well, my muscles ache sometimes. Not constantly, just…after I’ve been doing something. Or even if I haven't been doing anything much. It’s a dull ache, not a sharp pain. And I’ve been…a bit clumsy, I suppose. Dropping things. Tripping over…well, nothing, really. Just…off balance, sometimes. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches and some clumsiness or feeling off balance. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is fine. I eat what's put in front of me. Though maybe not as much as I used to, but who does when they're feeling tired all the time? And weight…I don’t really weigh myself. My husband says I look fine. He always says that. I’ve always been…petite.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… I take a little something for my blood pressure, nothing fancy. And…oh, a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were a bit low. Allergies…not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. Though I did have a bit of trouble with a shellfish once, many years ago, but that was just a stomach upset. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and a vitamin D supplement. No known allergies other than a past, mild reaction to shellfish. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to check your balance and reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. I suppose I should cooperate. But I don't like doctors poking and prodding. My husband says I’m a terrible patient. I just want to know what's wrong with me, you know? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ardelle. We’ll take it one step at a time. It may not be anything serious, and the exam will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Okay, let's check your balance. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here goes. There. I’m standing. Don't I always get nervous at the doctor? It always throws everything off. My husband says I worry too much. What are you looking for, exactly? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Just assessing your balance and coordination, Ardelle. No need to worry. Now, could you please close your eyes and extend both arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Like this? Oh dear, I’m a bit wobbly. I told you, I get nervous. Everything feels…off. Are you sure this is necessary? It’s making me feel rather faint.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is helpful. Just hold still for a moment. Okay, you can open your eyes now. Mild tremor noted in both arms, slight imbalance. Okay, Ardelle, please sit back down. I'm going to look at your EHR and see what your recent bloodwork looks like. It will take just a minute. This gives me a bit more information.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose I can sit. But what does all this mean? Are you finding something bad? My husband is going to be terribly worried. He's always been so protective of me. Honestly, doctors these days…so much poking and prodding and looking at screens. It used to be a simple visit with a friendly face, and now it's all…complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ardelle. I’m looking at your recent bloodwork now. It appears your vitamin D levels are still a bit low, despite the supplement. And your TSH is slightly elevated, which could indicate an underactive thyroid. It's not a definitive diagnosis yet, but it's something we need to investigate further. We’ll also do a CBC to rule out anemia. It’s good we’re looking into this now. These things are usually very manageable with medication. Would you be comfortable getting some blood drawn today to get these levels checked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An underactive what-now? And more blood? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a pincushion! Manageable with…pills? I don't like taking pills. They always make me feel sick. My husband will be so upset. But…if it makes me feel better…well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But I want you to explain everything to me, very clearly. And I want to know what pills I'll have to take, and what they do. And if there are any side effects. Don't leave anything out.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I will explain everything as clearly as possible. An underactive thyroid – also known as hypothyroidism – means your thyroid gland isn't producing enough thyroid hormone. This hormone is important for regulating your energy levels, metabolism, and overall body function. That could explain the fatigue, muscle aches, and even the clumsiness you’ve been experiencing. The blood test will confirm if this is the case. If it is, the treatment is a synthetic thyroid hormone, called levothyroxine. It replaces the hormone your thyroid isn't producing. It’s a very common medication, and usually very well-tolerated. Common side effects, if any, are usually mild – things like feeling a little jittery or having some trouble sleeping. More serious side effects are rare, but we'll monitor you closely. Would you like me to order the bloodwork now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Jittery and trouble sleeping? That sounds terrible! I already have trouble sleeping as it is. And monitoring me closely…does that mean even more visits to the doctor? Honestly, I don't know…I need to think about it. Can I at least talk to my husband about it first? He always knows what to do. And he asks better questions than me. I'm just…a bit flustered, you know? All this talk of hormones and pills…it's a bit much to take in.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. Absolutely. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed, and it’s perfectly fine to discuss it with your husband first. We can definitely wait to order the bloodwork until you’ve had a chance to talk with him. I’ll write down the information about hypothyroidism and levothyroxine for you to take home, and we can revisit this at your next appointment. If you do decide you’d like to proceed with the bloodwork, we can schedule that then. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be very kind of you. Thank you. A written copy…yes, that would be very helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be. No, I don’t think so. Just…the fatigue, really. And I suppose…the clumsiness. But if this underactive what-you-call-it is the problem, then maybe those will go away, right? I just want to feel like myself again. My husband says I haven’t been myself lately.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This explains hypothyroidism in more detail, and lists the common side effects of levothyroxine. Yes, Ardelle. If this is the cause of your symptoms, and we’re able to get your thyroid hormone levels back to normal, you should start to feel much better. Your energy levels should improve, and the muscle aches and clumsiness should subside. We’ll monitor you closely with regular blood tests to make sure the medication is working correctly. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. So, for now, take this information home, talk to your husband, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss it further. Is there anything I can do for you before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don't think so. Just…getting home to my husband. He’s probably worried sick. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ardelle. It was my pleasure. Remember, take your time getting home, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Have a good day, and give your husband my best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
