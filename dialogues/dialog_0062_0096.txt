DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. DeCosta, good to meet you too. It’s… well, it’s kinda strange, to be honest. My eyes have been really bothering me in the sun lately. Like, way more sensitive than they used to be. It started a few months ago, I think, but it’s getting worse now that it's summer.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is good to know. Increased sensitivity to sunlight is definitely something we should look into. A few months ago… and getting worse with the summer sun. Can you describe how your eyes are bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Well, it’s not like a pain, exactly. More like… everything is too bright. Even with sunglasses, sometimes it feels like I’m staring right at the sun. Makes me squint a lot, and my eyes water. And it gives me a headache afterwards, usually. It’s… uncomfortable, really. It makes it hard to be outside for long, even just walking to the store.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not pain, but significant brightness and discomfort, even with sunglasses. Watering eyes and headaches afterwards. And it’s impacting your ability to be outside. That gives us some good information to work with. Do you notice if it's a particular type of light that bothers you more, or is it just sunlight in general?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I think it’s mostly sunlight, yeah. I haven’t noticed it being as bad with, like, indoor lights. Fluorescent lights don't bother me, or the lights in the store, even. It’s definitely worse when I’m outside on a bright day, even if it’s cloudy. It feels… sharper, somehow, the sunlight. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Sharper sunlight is a good way to describe it. Okay. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can think of. I lost my wife last year, so… things have been pretty quiet since then, to be honest. I'm retired now, mostly just keep to myself, do some gardening. No new medications, no new hobbies, nothing like that. Just… quiet. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Arbin, thank you for sharing that with me. Losing your wife is a huge life change, and stress and grief can sometimes manifest in physical ways. But let's focus on your eyes for now. Do you have any other symptoms with the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, makes sense. Let's talk about the eyes. Hmm… other symptoms… not really. No blurry vision, no double vision, no floaters or anything like that. Just the brightness, the watering, and the headache afterwards. I haven't noticed any pain in my eye, just around my head after being in the sun too long. Oh! Sometimes my eyes feel… gritty, like there's sand in them, but that goes away pretty quickly if I blink a few times. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Okay, no blurry or double vision, no floaters. Headache after sun exposure, and a gritty sensation that improves with blinking. That's all good information. Have you had any changes to your vision overall, even if it's not blurry or double vision?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, no. I had my eyes checked a couple of years ago, just a routine check-up. The doctor said I needed reading glasses eventually, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Everything seems pretty clear, just… bright, you know? I can still read, still watch TV, still do all the usual things. It's just uncomfortable, especially when I’m outside.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a routine check-up a couple of years ago, with a recommendation for reading glasses in the future. And your vision overall still feels pretty good, aside from the brightness sensitivity. Do you wear any contacts or have you had any eye injuries or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No contacts, never have. And no injuries or surgeries, either. My eyes have always been pretty good, honestly. Never had any trouble with them until recently. I used to work in construction, but I always wore safety glasses, so I don’t think it’s that. I really haven’t had any problems with them, like I said, until a few months ago. It’s just… frustrating, you know? It's stopping me from doing things I enjoy.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely, Arbin. It sounds like this has really come on suddenly and is impacting your quality of life. Alright, let’s do a quick exam of your eyes. I'll check your vision, look at your pupils, and take a look at the front of your eyes. It won't be painful at all. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get this sorted out. Let's get to it.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, could you please follow my pen with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. <I follow the pen with my eyes, carefully trying not to move my head.> There we go. Just keep going?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now looking straight ahead… I’m just going to shine a light in each eye… It’ll be quick. Alright. Your pupils are equal and react to light normally. And when I look at the back of your eyes, I don't see anything immediately concerning – no swelling or damage to the retina or optic nerve. It's all looking pretty healthy back there. However, I do notice some mild dryness on the surface of your eyes. That could be contributing to the gritty sensation and the light sensitivity. I’m going to perform a Schirmer's test to measure your tear production. It just involves placing a small strip of paper under your lower eyelid for a few seconds. It won’t hurt, but you might feel a little pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds okay. Mild dryness, huh? Makes sense, I guess. I do live in Florida, it’s pretty hot here. A test to measure tears… yeah, sounds good. Pressure, okay. I can handle a little pressure. Let's do it. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It makes me feel better knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I understand it can be worrying when something changes with your vision. Alright… the Schirmer’s test shows your tear production is a little lower than normal, which supports the finding of mild dryness. Given your symptoms – the increased light sensitivity, gritty sensation, and mild dryness – it's likely you're experiencing a condition called photokeratitis, also known as sunburnt eyes. It's caused by prolonged exposure to UV radiation, and it can make your eyes feel very uncomfortable. It's similar to getting a sunburn on your skin. The fact that you lost your wife last year and are possibly experiencing some stress is also a factor, as stress can affect tear production. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Photokeratitis… sunburnt eyes, huh? That makes sense, with the Florida sun. And stress… yeah, I guess that makes sense too. It's just… I never really connected the two before. So, what does that mean, exactly? Is there anything I can do about it? Will it go away? I'd really like to get back to gardening. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: That’s a really good question, Arbin. It's certainly possible to get back to gardening. Photokeratitis is usually self-limiting, meaning it will resolve on its own, typically within a day or two. However, we can certainly help speed up the recovery and prevent it from happening again. The main treatment is to avoid sunlight as much as possible until your eyes feel better. I’m going to recommend using artificial tears frequently – at least four times a day – to keep your eyes lubricated. Also, it's crucial to wear high-quality sunglasses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays whenever you're outside, even on cloudy days. A wide-brimmed hat can also provide extra protection. I'm also going to recommend a warm compress on your eyes for 10-15 minutes a few times a day. That can help soothe the irritation. Do you have any questions about those recommendations?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Avoid the sun, artificial tears, good sunglasses, warm compress. I think I can do that. High-quality sunglasses… are there any brands you recommend, or anything I should look for specifically? I don't want to buy something that doesn't work. And with the artificial tears, is there a particular kind that’s best? I've seen a lot of different options at the drugstore.
DOCTOR: That’s a smart question, Arbin. It’s important to get the right products. When it comes to sunglasses, look for ones that specifically state they block 100% of UVA and UVB rays. Polarization is also a good feature, as it reduces glare. Some reputable brands known for good quality sunglasses include Maui Jim, Ray-Ban, and Costa Del Mar, but there are plenty of other good options available. Don't necessarily need to spend a fortune, but avoid the very cheapest ones, as they may not provide adequate protection. Look for a wraparound style if possible, as this offers more coverage. For artificial tears, I recommend ones that are preservative-free, especially if you're using them frequently. Some good options include Systane Ultra, Refresh Tears, or Blink Tears. You can find these at most drugstores. If one brand doesn't feel comfortable, try another – everyone's eyes are different. Do you have any allergies to eye drops or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, and no other medical conditions that I know of. Just a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that doesn't affect my eyes. That's really helpful about the sunglasses and the preservative-free eye drops. I'll definitely keep that in mind when I go shopping. So, if I follow those instructions – avoid the sun, good sunglasses, artificial tears, warm compress – you think this should clear up on its own in a day or two? And I should be able to get back to gardening after that? I’m really looking forward to getting back to it.
DOCTOR: Yes, Arbin, that’s my expectation. If you follow those instructions, your symptoms should improve within a day or two. You should be able to get back to gardening once your eyes feel comfortable again, but be sure to protect them with sunglasses and a hat while you’re outside. I do want to mention that if your symptoms don’t improve within a few days, or if you develop any new symptoms such as blurry vision, pain, or discharge, you should contact me immediately. Those could indicate a more serious problem. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been really helpful, Doctor. I feel a lot better knowing what's going on and what I can do about it. Thank you so much for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thanks for being so understanding about… everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could help. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Take care of yourself, and I hope you enjoy getting back to gardening. Have a good day!
