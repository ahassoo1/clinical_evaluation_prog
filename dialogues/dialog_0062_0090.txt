DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe this is for… clearance? My understanding is I need to be checked over before I can proceed. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. A pre-operative evaluation, got it. No worries about it being fuzzy, that's what I'm here for! To clarify, you said you're hoping to have surgery...do you already have a surgery scheduled, or are you still in the planning stages?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I… believe it’s scheduled. Yes. A date was set, I think… with Dr. Ramirez? It was… some time ago, though. I’m afraid I don't recall the exact date. My husband… he handled most of the arrangements. It’s been difficult remembering details since… well.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed with details, especially if it was arranged by someone else. Dr. Ramirez… that’s good to know. Let’s try to piece things together. Do you remember what surgery you're scheduled for?
PATIENT: It was… something to do with my stomach. Not… a weight loss thing, exactly. More… restorative? To fix something that… wasn’t right. I remember Dr. Ramirez saying something about… a hernia, perhaps? Or maybe it was a different kind of… bulge? Honestly, it’s all quite vague. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible hernia repair with Dr. Ramirez. That gives us a good starting point. Don’t worry about apologizing, it’s perfectly fine. We can sort through it together. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk a little bit about your symptoms. Can you describe what you're experiencing that led you to see Dr. Ramirez in the first place?
PATIENT: Well… there was discomfort, mostly. A… a pulling sensation, on this side. It wasn’t terribly painful, not constantly. More… noticeable after I’d been on my feet for a long time, or if I lifted anything heavy. And… it felt… fragile, somehow. Like something might… give way. I kept worrying it would become worse, so I finally went to see the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, pulling sensation on your lower right side, worse with activity and a feeling of fragility. That sounds concerning. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – like constipation, diarrhea, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I don’t believe so. No, not that I recall. My bowel habits have been… fairly regular, thankfully. Though… …since my husband passed, my appetite hasn't been the best, so things are a bit… slower, generally. But no blood, no diarrhea… just… less frequent, I suppose. And sometimes a little… uncomfortable. Not painful, just… strained.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally regular, but a bit slower and potentially strained since your husband’s passing. I’m very sorry for your loss, by the way. That must be incredibly difficult. Now, aside from the discomfort in your abdomen and the changes in bowel habits, have you noticed any other symptoms – things like nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or any weight loss?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… it has been difficult, yes. No, thankfully, no nausea or vomiting. I do sometimes get… a little heartburn, especially if I eat something rich or spicy. But that’s been happening for years, really. And… no, no significant weight loss. If anything, I’ve probably… gained a little, since I haven’t been as active. I’ve just been… trying to take things easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn occasionally, no nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. And you've mentioned being less active since your loss. That’s all helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. My husband always handled the doctor’s visits, so I wasn’t always… involved in the details. I think I’m generally healthy. I’ve always tried to eat well and get enough rest. But… …I did have high blood pressure, a few years ago. Dr. Ramirez put me on medication for it, but… I’ve been taking it regularly, and he said it was under control. He monitored it at every visit. I believe it’s… lisinopril? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, lisinopril is a common medication for high blood pressure. Good, that’s important to know. And you’ve been taking it regularly and Dr. Ramirez was monitoring it. That's reassuring. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. But that was… a very long time ago. Nothing since then. No, I haven't had any other surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, no other surgeries. What about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family… we don’t really… talk about medical history. It’s not something we’ve ever done. My mother passed away when I was young, and my father… he wasn’t very forthcoming about things. I know he had… some heart problems, later in life. But I don’t know the specifics. And I don’t know about any other family illnesses. I wish I could be more helpful, but… I’m afraid I just don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, it’s understandable. It's common for family medical history to be unknown. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I’ve never had a problem with medications. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I’m very fortunate, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. No, just the lisinopril. Nothing else. I occasionally take… a pain reliever for a headache, but that’s very rare. Just… ibuprofen, I think. But I don’t take it regularly. No other medications at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, just lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently examine your abdomen. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Okay… there’s some mild tenderness here, on the right side. Not excruciating, but definitely noticeable. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses felt. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tense. Okay. Based on this exam, you do have some mild tenderness in your right lower quadrant. It's not alarming, but it's consistent with some inflammation. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count will check for signs of infection. I also want to check your kidney and liver function. And finally, I’ll order a comprehensive metabolic panel . Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. Blood work sounds… fine. Will it be a lot of blood? I… I’m not particularly fond of needles.
DOCTOR: It won’t be a lot, Mackenzi. Just a couple of vials – maybe two or three. It’s a standard blood draw, and the phlebotomist is very good. We'll get you in and out quickly. I’ll write the order now. And then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Usually, it takes a few days to get everything back from the lab. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any change in your bowel habits, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Sudden, severe pain… fever… I’ll remember that. And… a follow-up appointment? To discuss the results? Yes, that’s good. When would that be?
DOCTOR: Let me check the schedule... How does next week, say, Tuesday at 2:00 PM sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM… yes, that should be alright. Yes, that works. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the lab order printed for you, and the receptionist will schedule the follow-up appointment. She’ll also let you know where to go for the blood draw. Is there anything else I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I believe that’s everything. Thank you again for your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Take care, Mackenzi. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you. .
