DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mitchell. I… have a headache. In the back of my head. It’s been… a few days now. Not a bad headache, you understand. Just… there. Always there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. A headache for a few days, located in the back of your head. And you describe it as a constant, not severely painful headache. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. Constant. Like a… weight. Not sharp, not throbbing. Just… heavy. It doesn't really get worse with anything, I don’t think. Maybe… when I bend over? A little bit. But mostly… just there. I used to work with the trains, you know. Lots of bending and lifting. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don't know. It started… after my wife, Elena, passed. A few months ago now.
DOCTOR: I see. A constant, weighted feeling in the back of your head, potentially slightly worsened by bending. And it began a few months ago, around the time of your wife Elena’s passing. I’m very sorry for your loss, Mitchell. Grief can manifest in many ways. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… it was a long time. Sixty years together. Other symptoms… hmm. Not much, really. I… I feel tired, sometimes. More tired than usual, maybe. And my hands… they shake a little. But I'm ninety years old! I expect some shaking, you know? I sleep alright, I think. And I eat… well, not as much as I used to. Everything tastes… different. Not bad, just… not the same. Oh! And sometimes… I forget things. Small things. Where I put my glasses. What I was saying. But nothing important. Not yet.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue, some hand shaking, a decreased appetite with altered taste, and some forgetfulness. It's good you’re able to recognize those changes. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. That's a good question. Not… blurry, exactly. But things don't seem as… bright, maybe? Like looking through a… a dirty window. Not all the time, just… sometimes. And sometimes, I see… little spots. Flashes of light. Not big flashes, small ones. Like… sparkles. Do you understand? I don't know if that's important. I haven't told anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mitchell, that is important. Dimming vision, and those flashes of light – those are things we need to investigate further. Now, thinking about your headaches, have you had any fever, neck stiffness, or nausea or vomiting associated with them?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. My neck feels… stiff sometimes, but that's just old age, I think. And no… no sickness. No throwing up. Just the headache. And the tiredness. It comes and goes, the tiredness. Some days are better than others. Today… today I feel a little shaky. But mostly just the headache. It's… a worry, you know? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother at all, Mitchell. It's my job to listen to your concerns and help figure out what’s going on. I appreciate you sharing everything with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you need. I trust you. Elena always said I worry too much. Maybe a good examination will… calm me down. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time. Not since… well, not for a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. Let’s get started. If you could sit up on the examination table for me, that would be wonderful. First, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age and recent stress. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. Elena always said I had strong legs. From all the dancing, you know. We used to dance all the time. Every weekend. Salsa, merengue… all the dances. She was a beautiful dancer.
DOCTOR: Good. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but still present. Now, can you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: There. Is that strong enough? My hands… they don't feel as strong as they used to. From working with the trains, you know. Lots of gripping and pulling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good, Mitchell. A little weaker than average, but understandable given your history. Now, I’d like to check your pupils and your vision a bit more closely. Follow my light with your eyes. Good. And now look straight ahead. Your pupils are equal and react to light, but they are a little… constricted. And your eye movements are a little slow. Now, could you tell me if you have any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: My balance… hmm. Sometimes. Not a lot. But sometimes I feel… a little wobbly. Especially when I stand up quickly. Or when I turn my head. It’s just a little thing. I usually catch myself. But sometimes… I worry I’ll fall. Elena… she used to hold my hand when we walked. She was always so careful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mitchell. That’s good you’re aware of it. And it’s good you had Elena to help you. Given your symptoms – the headache, fatigue, hand shaking, altered taste, forgetfulness, vision changes, constricted pupils, and difficulty with balance – I think it’s important we get some further testing done. I’d like to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural issues. I also want to order some blood tests to check for any underlying infections, vitamin deficiencies, or other problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and blood tests? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is something… wrong? I just want to know… is it bad? I don’t want to be a bother. I’m an old man, you know. Maybe it’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Mitchell, it’s completely understandable that you’re worried. I want to assure you I'm not immediately concerned about anything catastrophic. However, given the combination of symptoms you're experiencing, it's important to rule out any serious causes. The CT scan and blood tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It could be something relatively minor, like a vitamin deficiency or a side effect of medication. But it's also important to rule out things like a stroke, a brain tumor, or other neurological conditions. We need to be thorough. I’m going to order those tests now. The CT scan will require a referral to the imaging center, and the blood tests can be done here at the clinic. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… I don't think so. I haven’t had any tests like that before. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, really. Just… dust, sometimes. Makes me sneeze. A stroke… a brain tumor…? Oh dear. Elena… she always worried about me getting sick. She’d always make me drink tea with honey when I had a cold. She was a good woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. No known allergies to contrast dye, that’s good. And it’s completely normal to feel worried when you hear those words. We are being proactive to understand what's happening. I'm going to write a referral for the CT scan now. The imaging center will call you to schedule an appointment. The blood tests can be done right here in the clinic before you leave today. We'll also need to get a detailed list of any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements. Do you have that readily available?
PATIENT: Medications… not much, really. Just a little aspirin, sometimes, for my knees. And a multivitamin, every morning. Elena used to remind me. She was very organized. I think that's all. Just aspirin and a multivitamin. I'll have to check… maybe there's something else I forgot. It's hard to remember these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin as needed for your knees and a daily multivitamin. That’s helpful. We'll document that. I’m going to write you a script for the CT scan and a lab order for the blood tests. Once you have the results back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A follow-up appointment… Yes. How long will it take to get the results back? And… will the tests hurt? I don’t like needles. Elena used to hold my hand when I got vaccinated. She was very kind. Will I be able to drive myself to the appointment? I don't want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mitchell. The CT scan results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back, and the blood tests should be available within a few days. The CT scan itself is painless. You'll simply lie on a table while the machine takes images of your brain. There may be a small amount of radiation involved, but it's a very low dose. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually very quick. As for driving, I recommend that you do not drive yourself to the follow-up appointment. We'll need to discuss the results, and depending on what we find, you may not be in a condition to drive safely. I’d recommend having someone drive you, or taking a taxi or ride-sharing service. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you for listening to me. And for being so kind. Elena would have liked you. I'll get the tests done. And I’ll ask my neighbor, Mr. Rodriguez, to drive me to the appointment. He’s a good man. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to be able to… remember things. And not worry so much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mitchell. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. And it’s understandable to feel worried. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. Here are the referral and lab orders. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care of yourself, Mitchell. And please, don’t worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will try. .
