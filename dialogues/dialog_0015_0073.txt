DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been… a nightmare. I’ve had the runs for almost a week now, and nothing seems to be stopping it. I’ve tried… things. You know, over-the-counter stuff. It just doesn’t work. And frankly, I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: "Things," you say. Right. Well, let's get some specifics, shall we?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics. Look, I took some… Imodium, I think it was called. And Pepto-Bismol. Does it matter? They didn't do a thing. It’s just… constant. And it's not just inconvenient, it's… weakening. I can’t even explain. It's just…bad. And I really need to get back to work. I’ve got things to paint.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Ms. Woodring. Details are crucial. We need to understand what we’re dealing with. “Constant” is vague. Can you describe the frequency?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Frequency? Look, it’s… a lot. Multiple times a day. Like, after everything I eat or drink. I’m not going to count how many times, okay? It's disruptive. And embarrassing. I just want it to stop. Is that too much to ask? I don't have time for a detailed log of my…bathroom habits.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, truly. However, a proper assessment requires more than just "a lot." Are we talking three times a day?
PATIENT: Three? No. More than three. Probably… five or six, easily. Maybe more on days I try to actually eat something substantial. Look, I'm a painter, not a scientist! I don't keep records of these things. It's just… constant, liquid, and utterly exhausting. And it's been almost a week, and it's not getting better! I don’t know what you want from me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Five or six times a day for nearly a week. And you've tried Imodium and Pepto-Bismol without relief. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, good heavens, no! I would know if there was blood. That would be… alarming. No, nothing like that. Just… watery. And… unpleasant. Honestly, it’s just ruining my whole schedule. I had a commission due next week, and I can barely leave the house, let alone paint. You have any idea how frustrating that is? .
DOCTOR: Alright. No blood. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside this diarrhea?
