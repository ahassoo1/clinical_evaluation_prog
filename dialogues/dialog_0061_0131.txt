DOCTOR: Bula and welcome to the clinic, Mykeisha! I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kimm, it’s nice to meet you too! Well, I’ve been having some trouble with my blood pressure, that’s what the nurse said anyway. It’s been a bit high, and I wanted to get it checked out properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you’re getting it checked out. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to keep an eye on. The nurse did note some elevated readings. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, well, I haven’t really felt anything different, to be honest. No headaches or anything like that. I just went for a regular check-up with my friend’s cousin – she’s a phlebotomist – and she said it was a little high, so she told me to come see a doctor. She was pretty worried, so I figured it was best to get it checked out, you know? I don’t usually bother doctors unless something's really wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're taking it seriously, especially since your friend’s cousin was concerned. It's always better to be safe. So, no symptoms at all – no headaches, dizziness, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Really, I feel perfectly normal. I’ve been a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t tired? I work a lot, so I just figured it was that. It’s been hot too, so maybe that’s playing a part. I do a lot of different jobs, helping people out with things, so it can be tiring running around.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. "Tired" is pretty vague though – can you describe what you mean by tired?
PATIENT: Well, not like, falling-down exhausted. More like...at the end of the day, I just don’t have much energy left for anything. I used to like going for walks after work, or meeting friends, but now I just want to sit and watch TV. And I'm sleeping okay, usually about seven or eight hours, but I don’t wake up feeling refreshed, you know? Just…blah. It’s been going on for a few weeks, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, fatigue that’s impacting your usual activities, and not feeling rested even with adequate sleep. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, to be honest. I had the flu a couple of times, and a bad cold last winter, but that’s about it. No serious illnesses or anything. My mom had high blood pressure when she got older, but she didn’t start getting it until she was in her seventies. And my dad was fine, healthy as a horse until the very end. I don’t really have a family history of much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No personal history of chronic conditions, and a limited family history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope, never. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a mango tree, but that was just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. I’ve always been careful, I think. I try to avoid the hospital if I can! It always smells funny in there.
DOCTOR: I understand that feeling! No surgeries or hospitalizations besides the broken arm as a child. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, that’s it. I take one every morning with breakfast. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take some paracetamol, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. I don’t really like taking pills, so I try to avoid them as much as possible. I prefer just to rest if I’m feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional paracetamol. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, really. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My friend is allergic to shellfish, but I’m perfectly fine with it. I love a good shrimp curry! I don’t think I’ve ever even had a mild reaction to anything, come to think of it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Dr. Kimm. I trust your judgement. I’m happy to get it checked out properly. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable or anything. I’m a bit ticklish, though, just so you know! .
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know about the ticklishness! We’ll try to avoid those spots. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92 on the right arm and 146 over 90 on the left. Your heart rate is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear. Ears look good, throat is clear as well. Pulses are good and strong. Everything sounds good so far, but your blood pressure is definitely elevated. It’s higher than we’d like to see. We’ll need to investigate a bit further. I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine test. Also, an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a lot, but if you think it’s necessary, then yes, that’s fine. I trust you, Dr. Kimm. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Blood tests, urine test, and… an EKG, right? What exactly does that involve? I’ve never had one of those before.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests, urine test, and an EKG. An EKG – or electrocardiogram – is a really simple and painless test. We just put some small stickers – electrodes – on your chest, arms, and legs. They’re connected to a machine that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all, and it takes just a few minutes. It helps us see if there are any abnormalities in your heart rhythm or any signs of heart strain. The blood tests will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other underlying causes for the high blood pressure. The urine test will also help us assess your kidney function. Do you have any questions about any of those tests?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…not too bad, actually. Stickers on my chest, that’s fine. And it doesn’t hurt? Good. I was worried it would be like a needle or something. And the blood tests and urine tests… just regular samples, right? I guess I’m a little worried about what the results might show, but if you think it’s important, then I’m happy to do them. Will I need to fast before the blood tests? And will the nurse show me where to go for the urine sample? .
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is fine. We’ll schedule the tests for first thing tomorrow morning, so you can fast overnight. And yes, the nurse will show you how to collect a urine sample. It’s a clean catch sample, meaning you need to clean the area first and collect the mid-stream urine. She’ll give you instructions and a sterile container. She'll take you to the restroom, and it's perfectly private. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your stress levels, getting regular exercise, and eating a healthy diet. And I'd like you to monitor your blood pressure at home if you can. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have a blood pressure cuff at home. I don’t really monitor my health that closely, to be honest. I just go to the doctor when something feels wrong. But I can try to reduce my stress levels, I guess. Work can be stressful sometimes, but I’ll try to take more breaks. And I’ll try to eat healthier, too. So, fasting overnight, blood tests, urine sample, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Okay, I think I’ve got it. Is there anything else I need to do before tomorrow?
DOCTOR: No, that’s it for now. Just remember to fast overnight and bring a list of any questions you have for me. The nurse will schedule your appointments before you leave. I'm going to give you a printed sheet with instructions on how to prepare for the tests, and a list of some resources for managing stress and healthy eating. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Dr. Kimm. You’ve been very helpful and explained everything really clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not making me feel rushed. It’s nice to have a doctor who actually explains things. I guess I'll see you when the results are back. Thank you again, Dr. Kimm.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Dr. Kimm. You have a good day too!
