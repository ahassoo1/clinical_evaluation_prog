DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor Shelly, yes? Just…chest hurt. And my heart, it goes bump-bump-bump too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they say is…high. Not good. I don’t have time for this, you know. Busy man.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. Chest pain and a rapid heartbeat can be concerning, and high blood pressure does require attention. We’ll certainly get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More about? What kind of “more”? It just…hurts. Here. Like…a heavy feeling. Not always, though. Comes and goes. And the fast heart…when I get upset, maybe? Or after I walk a little too far. Is that all you need to know? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. “Heavy feeling” is a good way to describe it. And it’s helpful to know it's related to activity and perhaps stress. When did you first notice this chest pain and the rapid heartbeat?
PATIENT: Hmm… ... Maybe…three, four months ago? I don't keep track of these things! My wife, she notices more. She says I get red in the face, too. But I…I just want to know if it's serious. Will I drop dead? That's what I want to know. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Sobkowicz, and that’s a very valid question. We'll work to determine the cause of these symptoms to ensure your well-being. Has this pain ever radiated to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? What do you mean, "radiate"? Like sunshine? No, it stays…here. Sometimes feels tight, like a…band around it. Not going anywhere. And my wife complains I get short of breath when I climb stairs. She makes me stop. A lot. Is that important? You doctors always ask so many questions!
DOCTOR: I apologize for the many questions, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's important to get a complete picture. The tightness and shortness of breath are both important details. Have you ever experienced dizziness or lightheadedness with the chest pain or rapid heartbeat?
PATIENT: Dizzy? Sometimes. When I stand up too fast, maybe. Or if I get…really angry. My wife tells me I look pale then. I don’t pay attention to that sort of thing. Look, are you going to give me some medicine or what? I don’t want to sit here all day. My lunch is getting cold.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Sobkowicz. Before I recommend any medication, I would like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. But be quick about it. My wife packed me a good sandwich, you know. Roast beef. Don't want it to get soggy.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, as you mentioned. Now, if you’ll please take a deep breath for me… Your heart rate is a bit fast, and I'm hearing a normal rhythm. Lungs sound clear. Pulses are strong and regular. Do you feel any pain in your chest as I press here?
PATIENT: No pain. Just…annoyed. So? What does it mean? Is it something bad? Tell me straight. I don’t need fancy doctor talk. Just yes or no. Dying or not dying. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam, it's not an immediate emergency, and I don't believe you are in immediate danger of dying. However, your elevated blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, and chest discomfort do require further investigation. We need to determine the cause of these symptoms. It could be related to several things, including high blood pressure, a heart condition, or even stress. I recommend we order some tests. An EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity, a blood test to check your cholesterol and other markers, and a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Tests? More waiting. More poking and prodding. Fine. Do the tests. Get it over with. But I want results. Quickly. And no complicated explanations. Just tell me what I need to do. Less talking, more fixing. My wife will kill me if I’m late for mahjong. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ve ordered the tests, and the lab and radiology departments have been notified. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available. The lab work should be completed within a couple of hours, and the X-ray results typically take a bit longer. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low dose of a beta-blocker. This medication can help slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure. I will also give you instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure at home. Please contact my office immediately if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any chest pain that is severe or doesn’t subside with rest. I understand you are busy and have a lot on your mind, but it’s important to address this now to ensure your long-term health. We’ll get a better understanding of what's going on with these tests, and then we can discuss a plan moving forward. .
