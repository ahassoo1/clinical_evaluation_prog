DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Doctor, yes? Look, I don’t have all day. My chest… it feels funny. And my heart, it goes bump-bump-bump too fast sometimes. And the nurse, she said my blood pressure was high. Very high. I want to know what is wrong with me, quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand your concerns and will do my best to be efficient. “Funny” in your chest… could you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe? Like… tight. Squeezed. Not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It happens when I… when I get upset. Or when I walk up the stairs. Not a big deal, really. But the nurse made it sound like a big deal. She kept talking about… numbers. I don’t understand numbers.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that for me, Mr. Sobkowicz. “Tight” and “squeezed” are helpful descriptions. And it's good you mentioned it's related to exertion and emotions. The nurse likely referred to your blood pressure and heart rate readings, and those can be important. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. Have you noticed this feeling recently, or has it been happening for a while?
PATIENT: A while. A long while. Maybe… six months? Longer, maybe. I don’t keep track of these things. It comes and goes. Sometimes I feel fine, sometimes… like this. My wife, she tells me to slow down. Always slowing down! But I have things to do. Important things. This feeling… it just makes it harder to do them. Is that… is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that it makes things harder, Mr. Sobkowicz. And it's good you're aware of it and that your wife notices as well. Six months is a significant amount of time. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if this chest discomfort radiates – meaning, does it spread anywhere else, such as to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiates? What does that mean? You use too many fancy words, Doctor. Does it… go somewhere else? Sometimes my arm feels a little… heavy. Left arm. But that could be anything. I carry groceries, you know. Heavy bags. It’s probably just my arm. I don’t have time for aches and pains. Just tell me what is wrong with my heart.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask me to explain, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I apologize for the medical jargon. “Radiates” simply means does the sensation spread from your chest to other parts of your body. And yes, the heaviness in your left arm is relevant information. Given your description – the chest tightness, the speeding heart rate, the high blood pressure reading the nurse noted, and the arm heaviness – it’s important to investigate this thoroughly. It could be related to your heart, or it could be something else. To help me determine that, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your pulse and blood pressure again. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just be quick about it. I have appointments. Important appointments. And don't poke me too much. I don’t like being poked. And if it's nothing serious, I'm leaving. My time is valuable, Doctor. Very valuable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. I understand your time is valuable. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. It won’t be uncomfortable, just a little cool against your skin. Okay. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of crackling in the lower lobes of your lungs. Your blood pressure is indeed elevated, 160 over 95. And your pulse is 88, a bit fast. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you have any history of shortness of breath, or have you noticed any weight gain recently?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Not really. I get tired, maybe. I’m 86 years old, Doctor. I’m supposed to be tired! And weight gain… my wife keeps telling me I’ve gotten bigger. She makes me a lot of food. Good food! But I don’t think I’ve gained that much weight. Maybe five pounds. It’s probably just muscle. I still do some gardening, you know. Important gardening! What does this all mean? Is my heart broken? Don't tell me I need surgery. I don’t want surgery.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re still active with gardening, Mr. Sobkowicz. And it’s understandable to be concerned about these changes. "Broken heart" is not what I suspect, but we do need to investigate further. The combination of the irregular rhythm, crackling in your lungs, elevated blood pressure, and mild swelling suggests a few possibilities. It could be related to heart failure – not necessarily a “broken” heart, but a weakening of the heart muscle – or it could be a lung condition contributing to these symptoms. The irregularity in your rhythm is also something we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Specifically, an EKG to look at your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to see your lungs, and a blood test to check for certain markers that can indicate heart strain or kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Hmph. Fine. But I want results quickly. I don’t have time to wait around. My appointments… they are very important. And if these tests show something serious… I don’t want any drastic measures. No surgery, no… poking around. Just tell me what pills I need to take, if that’s all it is. And if I don't feel better after a week, I'm getting a second opinion. Understand?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I will do my best to expedite these tests and get you answers as quickly as possible. I assure you, we will discuss all options thoroughly before making any decisions, and I will never recommend a procedure without your full understanding and consent. The tests will help us determine the best course of action, which may involve medication, lifestyle changes, or, if necessary, further evaluation. I will also order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, as that can impact medication choices. The nurse will draw the blood now, and we can get the X-ray done right here in the clinic. Once the results are back—typically within 24-48 hours—we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your salt intake and avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I take a little something for my arthritis. That’s all. And salt… my wife puts salt on everything. She says it makes the food taste better. But fine. I'll try to tell her to use less. She doesn't listen to me much, but I can try. Arthritis… it's in my hands. Makes gardening hard sometimes. And my knees. Always aching. But I need to finish these appointments, Doctor. Important things. Just get me these results quickly, okay? I don't want to waste any more time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand. We will prioritize getting these results back to you as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. I will also make a note to discuss your arthritis with you during our follow-up appointment. For now, please try to rest and limit your exertion. We'll get to the bottom of this together. </stage> .
