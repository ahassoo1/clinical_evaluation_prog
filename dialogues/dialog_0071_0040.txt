DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s my flank, mostly. It’s been giving me trouble again. And… well, I seem to be getting urinary tract infections quite a bit lately. It’s a bit bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Right, flank pain and recurrent UTIs. Okay. Let’s start with the flank pain. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… well, it’s a pain on the side of my back, just below the ribs. It comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s quite sharp. Not constant, thankfully. It usually lasts a day or two, maybe three, and then it fades. I’ve had it for… oh, goodness, years now, on and off. The doctor before you, he said something about my kidneys. Something about lots of little… pouches? I can’t quite remember the word he used.
DOCTOR: Years, on and off… and “pouches,” you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Pouches. He said it had a name… Polycystic… something? Polycystic Kidney… Disease, I think it was. He said it’s not uncommon, but… well, I don’t really understand what it means, exactly. It just means my kidneys have these little things on them, doesn’t it? And that’s why I get the pain.
DOCTOR: Polycystic Kidney Disease, yes. That lines up with what I see in your records. It can cause flank pain, as you’ve experienced. And recurrent UTIs are also common with it. Now, about these infections… how frequently would you say you're getting them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly. Seems to be getting more often lately, though. Maybe every… two or three months, perhaps? Sometimes a bit longer, sometimes a bit sooner. I usually just go to the urgent care, get some antibiotics, and it clears up. But it's just… tiring, always having to go. And I worry about the antibiotics, taking them so often.
DOCTOR: Every two to three months… I understand your concern about the frequent antibiotic use, that’s definitely something we want to address. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better feel for things. And then we can talk about some further investigations to get a clearer picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know what you'd like me to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and back, and then I'll gently press on your flanks to check for any tenderness. Nothing to worry about, just routine.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. Let me know if anything feels… too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breath in… and out… Alright. A little tenderness on the left flank, as expected. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78 and regular. Everything else seems within normal limits, at least on initial assessment. Now, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a kidney ultrasound, if that's alright. The urine analysis will check for infection, and the ultrasound will give us a better look at your kidneys. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A urine analysis and an ultrasound. Yes, please. Whatever you think will help. I'm happy to do whatever’s needed. When will I be able to get those done?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve sent the orders to the lab and radiology. The lab should be able to take the urine sample right away – I’ll have a nurse come in and collect that for you. And the radiology department should be able to schedule the ultrasound for you within the next few days. I’ll have the nurse give you instructions on how to prepare for the ultrasound. While we wait for the results, let’s talk a bit about managing the UTIs. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know that I’ve noticed anything specific, really. I drink plenty of water, I think. And I try to… well, go to the bathroom when I need to. But no, nothing obvious. Sometimes it just seems to happen. Maybe when I'm a bit stressed, perhaps? But I wouldn't say for sure. It's all a bit… random, really.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly play a role. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the UTIs – like burning when you urinate, frequent urination, cloudy urine, or fever?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it, there is usually burning, yes. And I have to go quite often, even when I haven't had much to drink. And the urine… yes, sometimes it does look a bit cloudy. I haven’t had a fever, thankfully. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Just the burning and the frequent trips to the bathroom. It's mostly just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Burning, frequency, cloudy urine… okay. That's all helpful information. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… Not really. I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's about it. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, of course, that's why I have these glasses. But no other serious illnesses. I haven't had any surgeries, and I don't take any regular medications, other than the occasional pain reliever for my arthritis.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, occasional pain reliever for arthritis… that's good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother, she had diabetes, I think. And my father… well, he didn't take very good care of himself, if I'm honest. I don’t really know much about his medical history. I don't recall anyone else in my family having kidney problems, specifically. My siblings, we're all quite healthy, as far as I know. It's not something we talked about much, I'm afraid. We weren't a very close family, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's perfectly alright. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked. Never had the habit. Always thought it was a foolish thing to do.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little now and then. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, once or twice a week. Nothing excessive. I don’t drink spirits or beer, just a little red wine. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just occasional red wine. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat most things, and I haven’t had any trouble with medications in the past. I've never had a reaction to penicillin, if that’s what you’re asking. I’ve taken that a few times for… well, for minor infections, before. But no, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. That's very helpful, thank you. So, to summarise: you've been experiencing recurrent flank pain and UTIs, likely related to Polycystic Kidney Disease. You've noticed burning with urination, frequency, and cloudy urine. You have a bit of arthritis, but no other major medical conditions, and no known allergies. You have occasional red wine and don't smoke. We’ve ordered a urine analysis and kidney ultrasound. While we wait for those results, I suggest drinking plenty of fluids, urinating frequently, and avoiding irritants like caffeine. We'll review the results together, and discuss further management options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Plenty of fluids, frequent urination, and avoid caffeine. I can certainly manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your time and attention. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. When should I expect to hear back about the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. The lab usually takes a couple of days for the urine analysis, and the radiology department should contact you directly to schedule the ultrasound. Once the results are in, my nurse will give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. It should be within a week, hopefully sooner. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, severe flank pain, or blood in your urine, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've answered everything I was wondering about. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I'll wait for my nurse to call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day too, Mr. Espinueva. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you.
