DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiio. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about getting some vaccinations, if that’s alright. I think I’m due for a few, but honestly, I get a little mixed up remembering which ones I’ve had and when. That’s why I scheduled the appointment, to be safe.
DOCTOR: Right. Vaccinations. Sensible. We can certainly sort that out for you. Let me pull up your records… Okay, I see here you're covered by Medicare, which is good. And you're 47 years old… Just to confirm, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Forty-seven. And yes, Medicare is my insurance. Everything looks correct so far. I appreciate you checking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, the system says here you've had your primary series, tetanus boosters are up to date as of… let's see… 2019. But it’s not terribly detailed. Have you had a flu shot in the last year?
PATIENT: Hmm… a flu shot… Let me think. 2019… that was the last time I remember getting one for sure. It was at the pharmacy, I think. I honestly can’t recall if I got one last year, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's what we're here for. And it's good to be cautious. Beyond the flu shot, have you had a pneumonia vaccine?
PATIENT: Pneumonia vaccine… that sounds familiar, but I really don’t know. I think maybe… once? A long time ago? I’m truly not sure if it was even me, to be honest. I get confused with things like that. Is there a way to tell for sure?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a way to tell. It involves looking at your vaccination history… which, unfortunately, isn't particularly comprehensive in this system. Do you happen to have any old medical records you could bring in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, sadly. I’ve moved around a bit over the years, and I never really kept track of those things. It’s probably a good idea to start, but… well, here we are. It seems I’m relying on you to figure it out! Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the lack of documentation, we’ll have to proceed with a reasonable approach. Considering your age and no confirmed history, it would be prudent to administer both the pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine and the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine . They’re given at different intervals, so we'll need to schedule a follow-up. Are you comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Two vaccines… okay. That sounds… thorough. If you think it's the best thing to do, then yes, I’m comfortable with that. I trust your judgment. What does that mean for the follow-up? How long until I need to come back?
DOCTOR: Good. PPSV23 should be administered at least eight weeks after Prevnar 13. So, we’ll schedule you for roughly mid-October. In the meantime, you may experience some mild side effects – soreness at the injection site, perhaps a little fatigue. Nothing serious, usually. Now, before we proceed, have you ever had a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I remember, anyway. I’ve always been pretty good with vaccines. Just a little soreness afterwards, like you said. Nothing major. I don't have any allergies that I know of, actually.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get this done, then. Just roll up your sleeve. This will be into your deltoid muscle – it might sting for a moment. There you go. All done. Now, please sit here for fifteen minutes so I can observe you for any immediate reaction. I’ll be back to check on you shortly.
PATIENT: Okay. That did sting a little, but it’s alright. Fifteen minutes… perfect. I’ll just sit quietly here. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Just… sitting. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: I'm feeling fine, actually. No different than before. Just a little bit of soreness, but nothing to worry about. It’s probably just the sting, like you said. I’m just glad to get it done. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Good. As long as there's no fever, or severe swelling, or difficulty breathing, you should be fine. Here’s information on potential side effects, and instructions on what to do if you experience any. And a reminder for your follow-up appointment in October. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your patience, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to sort all of this out. It’s a weight off my mind, knowing I’m protected. I suppose I’ll see you in October then. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Right. October. Very well. You can head out now. And try to remember any relevant medical history before your next appointment, if possible. .
PATIENT: .
