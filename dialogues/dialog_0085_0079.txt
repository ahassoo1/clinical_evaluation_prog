DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's about my bruising. It's been getting worse, and I'm on… a blood thinner, Warfarin, I think it’s called. It's just… a lot more than usual, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s getting worse while on Warfarin is definitely something we should look into. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the bruising starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… Probably about… three weeks ago? It started with just little ones, like from bumping into things, normal stuff. But now… I got a bigger one on my arm just from, like, carrying groceries. And my legs… they have a few. It's just… more frequent and easier to happen, is what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, starting with small bruises that have progressed to larger ones happening with minimal trauma. And you said you're on Warfarin – do you know the dosage you're taking?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not off the top of my head. I just… take it every evening. The pharmacy sends it, and I just… take what's in the bottle. It's… 5 milligrams, maybe? I think that's right. Honestly, I don’t really pay attention to the number. It's the same every time, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, 5 milligrams daily, and it's been consistent. That's helpful. Now, has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Not really. I've been eating pretty much the same. No new medicines… Oh! Wait. I started drinking a little more herbal tea. Just chamomile, for sleeping. Does that matter? I thought it was harmless.
DOCTOR: That's good you mentioned the chamomile tea. While chamomile is generally safe, some herbal supplements can interact with Warfarin. Let’s talk about that in a moment. First, can you describe the bruising itself?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, chamomile. It’s just… I haven't been sleeping well. As for the bruising… it’s just… bruises. Different colors, you know? Some are red at first, then purple, then kinda… brownish. Not raised or anything, just flat. And they ache a little when I bump them, normal ache. They just… don't go away as fast as they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, typical bruise discoloration—red to purple to brownish—and some aching with impact, but no swelling. And they're taking longer to resolve. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to gently check your bruising, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that's fine. Just… try not to poke too hard, okay? They're pretty sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. Okay, I've checked your arms, listened to your heart and lungs, and checked your pulse. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. Your bruising does appear widespread, and there's no sign of anything else going on, like swelling or tenderness that would suggest a different issue. I'm noting the locations and sizes of the bruises in your chart. Now, to get a better understanding of how your blood is clotting, I'd like to order a blood test called a PT/INR. Have you had one of those done recently?
PATIENT: A PT/INR…? I don’t think so. No, I haven’t. I just… take the Warfarin. They never said anything about a test. Is that something I should have been doing? Honestly, I'm starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, and I’m glad you brought it up. Yes, with Warfarin, regular PT/INR testing is essential. It measures how long it takes your blood to clot and helps us make sure you're on the correct dosage of the medication. It’s how we prevent it from getting too thin or too thick. The frequency of testing varies, but it’s usually done weekly or bi-weekly initially, and then less often once your levels are stable. I'm going to order a PT/INR for you right now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in quickly. Once we have the results, we can adjust your Warfarin dosage if needed. In the meantime, let's avoid any activities where you might bump or injure yourself. Also, it's important to be consistent with your diet – especially vitamin K intake – as it can affect your Warfarin levels. Do you know what foods contain vitamin K?
PATIENT: No, not really. I just eat… normal stuff. Salads sometimes? I don’t really pay attention to vitamins and stuff. So… I’ve been taking the wrong amount of this medicine this whole time? Is that what you're saying? And I could have been… what, bleeding too much? Or… too little? This is stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s not jump to conclusions. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve been taking the wrong amount, but it does mean we need to establish a baseline and make sure you’re at a safe level. Think of it like fine-tuning an instrument – we need to know where we’re starting to get the right sound. Regarding vitamin K, it’s found in leafy green vegetables like spinach, kale, and broccoli. It’s also in some oils and fermented foods. You don't need to avoid these foods entirely, but it's best to keep your intake consistent from day to day. Big fluctuations can affect your INR. To be on the safe side, I'm going to recommend a few things while we wait for your lab results. First, avoid any strenuous activity or situations where you might get injured. Second, if you experience any unusual bleeding—like nosebleeds, heavy periods, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool—go to the emergency room immediately. Third, I'm going to give you a handout with more information about Warfarin and vitamin K. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few. Um… how long will it take to get the results? And what happens if… if it is too high or too low? What does that even mean? And… is it my fault I didn’t know about the tests? Should someone have told me sooner?
DOCTOR: Okay, those are all very good questions, and it’s important to address them. The lab results should be available within a few hours. Once they’re back, we’ll call you to discuss them. Regarding what happens if your levels are too high or too low: If your INR is too high, it means your blood is taking too long to clot, which increases your risk of bleeding. We would lower your Warfarin dosage in that case. If your INR is too low, your blood is clotting too easily, which increases your risk of blood clots. We would increase your dosage then. As for whether someone should have told you about the testing, absolutely. Regular monitoring is a crucial part of Warfarin therapy, and it’s standard practice. I apologize that wasn’t communicated to you sooner. It’s not your fault at all. We'll make sure you're properly educated and monitored moving forward. This handout explains everything in more detail, and it includes a list of emergency contact numbers. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to review your results and discuss any further adjustments to your medication. Does that sound okay?
