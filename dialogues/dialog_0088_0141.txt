DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's this itching. All over, really. Been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it’s… driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not terrible, but constant. Like little ants crawling, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Itching all over, for about two weeks. And you describe it as a constant, ant-like sensation. Is it worse at any particular time of day, or after doing anything specific?
PATIENT: Not really a particular time, no. It’s pretty consistent. Maybe a little worse after I shower, but not by much. I use the same soap I’ve always used, though. Nothing fancy. Just… regular stuff. It's just… always there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I can recall, no. Same routine for… well, for a long time now. I eat the same things, mostly. I haven’t traveled anywhere. Used a new laundry detergent once, a few months back, but I switched back right away when my wife… well, never mind. It didn't help with the itching then either, and that was before this started. It’s just… been a strange couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay. No changes in routine, no new travel, you switched back from a different detergent… good to know. Has anyone else in your household been experiencing similar symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no one else. I live alone now, you see. My wife… passed away last year. So, it’s just me. And the itching. It's a very singular problem, apparently.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Ferneding. That must be very difficult. Alright, let's focus on the itching. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… it was a while ago. But thank you. As for other symptoms… not really. No rash, no fever, no fatigue. Just… the itch. Sometimes it makes it hard to sleep, but I just try to ignore it. I haven’t noticed any bumps or anything like that. Just… skin. And itch. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no rash, no fever, no fatigue. Just persistent itching. Have you noticed any changes in your skin – dryness, redness, thickening, or anything else unusual besides the itch itself?
PATIENT: Let me think… actually, now that you mention it, my skin feels a little drier than usual. And maybe… a little rough? Hard to say, really. I’ve always had… fairly normal skin. But yeah, perhaps a bit more dry. Not flaky or anything, just… not as smooth, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry and rough skin along with the itching. Do you have any allergies that you know of – to foods, medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had any trouble with allergies, to be honest. I can eat pretty much anything. I've taken some medications over the years, of course, mostly for… well, minor things. High blood pressure, that sort of thing. But never had a reaction to any of them. Nothing springs to mind, at least. I don’t wear any fancy perfumes or anything, so it's not likely to be that either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you said you take medication for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: That’s right. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, but I take it every day. Been on it for… oh, must be ten years now. No changes to the dosage recently, though. Everything’s been pretty steady. I always get a refill at the same pharmacy, too, so they’d know if anything changed, wouldn’t they?
DOCTOR: Yes, they would. Good. Alright, Mr. Ferneding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just take a look at your skin and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start here. Skin is dry to the touch, as you mentioned. No visible rash, no hives, no lesions. Similar findings here. Dry skin, but no obvious dermatological issues. Heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is… 138 over 82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Overall, no immediate red flags, but the dryness is notable. I'm going to check your thyroid. It’s a simple exam, just feeling your neck. Thyroid feels normal. No palpable nodules or enlargement.
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… reassuring, I suppose. I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly. It just feels so… irritating, you know? The itching, the dryness… it's constant. Makes me wonder if it’s just… getting older. Maybe skin just does that. But it’s never been this bad before.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're proactive about it, and you're right to want to get it checked. While it could be simple dryness, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some basic blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. This will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the itching and dryness. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work is fine. I don't mind a bit. Hopefully it will give us some answers. Where do I go for that? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll send the order electronically to the lab right across the street, at the medical center. They can draw the blood anytime today. Just tell them Dr. Piet sent you. The results should be back within 2-3 business days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day. Something like CeraVe or Cetaphil. That might help with the dryness and relieve some of the itching. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect. I can go to the lab today. And yes, I've heard of CeraVe. I think my daughter used that once. I’ll pick some up on the way home. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It's a relief to have a plan, at least. Should I stop taking the Lisinopril or anything before the blood work?
DOCTOR: No, please continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed. We need that information for the blood work. Do not stop taking any medication unless I specifically instruct you to. I'll give you a printed sheet with the lab order and some information about hypoallergenic moisturizers. It also has my contact information if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you back here in a few days. Does that cover everything, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Yes, that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your help. I feel much better knowing what we're going to do. I appreciate it. I'll go to the lab today and pick up the moisturizer. I'll see you in a few days. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could help. Get some rest, and don't hesitate to call the office if anything changes or if you have any concerns before your follow-up. Take care.
