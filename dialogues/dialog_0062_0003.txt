DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, you know. It’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now. Gets worse when I try to…well, when I try to do things. Not that I do much these days. It’s just…annoying. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start, Mr. Baide. “Shaking, mostly in your hand, getting worse with activity.” That definitely gives us something to work with. When you say “a while now,” could you give me a rough idea – weeks, months, longer?
PATIENT: Rough idea? Honestly, who keeps track of that stuff? Months, I suppose. Maybe longer. It comes and goes, see? Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times…well, other times it's a nuisance. Look, I'm not one for details. It just is. Is there a test or something? Can you just…fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It can be frustrating when symptoms are unpredictable. We can definitely look into it. There are tests we can do to help figure out what’s causing the shaking, and hopefully find a way to manage it. To get a better idea, though, could you tell me a little more about the shaking itself?
PATIENT: Manage it? Hmph. That's what they all say. Look, it’s just a tremor, alright? Like an old engine sputtering. It happens when I… when I try to do something precise. Holding a fork, writing…used to be good at writing, you know. Directed a few pictures in my time. But that was a lifetime ago. Now it just…wobbles. And it’s embarrassing. Do I have to explain every little detail? Honestly.
DOCTOR: No, you absolutely don’t have to explain every little detail if you don’t want to, Mr. Baide. I apologize if my questions are feeling tedious. It’s just that even small details can sometimes be helpful. So, it sounds like the tremor is worse when you're trying to do fine motor tasks – things like holding a fork or writing. Is it present even when your hands are resting at your side, or does it only appear with movement?
PATIENT: Movement, mostly. When I’m just sitting here, it’s not so bad. Though sometimes… sometimes I feel a little twitch, even then. But it’s nothing compared to when I try to, say, pour a glass of water. Ends up all over the place, you know? Makes a mess. My wife…she used to fuss about it. But she’s gone now. Look, are we getting anywhere? Because I really don’t have a lot of patience for this.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere, Mr. Baide. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated. So, to clarify: the tremor is primarily with movement, but you do sometimes notice a slight twitch even when resting. Does anything seem to make the tremor better or worse – like caffeine, stress, or certain positions?
PATIENT: Stress? Everything stresses me out these days! Look, I used to be a director, alright? I had control. Now…now I just sit around. Caffeine… I have a little coffee in the morning. Doesn’t seem to make much difference. And positions? No. It just…is. Honestly, it's like a bad habit my hand picked up. Is that enough? Can we please just get to the bottom of this? I don't want to spend all day talking about my shaking.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. And you’re right, we should move forward. It sounds like the tremor isn't consistently affected by anything specific, which is helpful to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic neurological assessment, to look at your reflexes, coordination, and muscle strength. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. Just…don’t poke around too much. And don't expect me to do any fancy exercises. My balance isn’t what it used to be. I’ll just sit here, alright? Don't make me stand up. Honestly, the whole thing is a bother. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. We'll keep everything simple and you can remain seated. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then quickly check your reflexes and coordination while you're sitting. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Finger taps are a little slow and hesitant on the left hand. And I observe some mild resting tremor in both hands, more pronounced on the right. Mild resting tremor noted in both hands, more prominent on the right. Finger taps are slightly slower and hesitant on the left. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Overall, strength appears intact. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing essential tremor. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests and potentially a thyroid stimulating hormone level. Would that be alright?
