DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I got a letter, you see. Said my cholesterol was a bit high. Hyper… something or other. I don’t really understand all that fancy talk, but the nurse said I should come in and talk to you about it. It’s a little worrying, getting old, you know? Things start breaking down.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit anxious when you receive news like that. And you're right, as we age, things do change. "Hyperlipidemia" is the term the nurse likely used – it simply means you have higher than optimal levels of cholesterol in your blood. We want to understand why, and what, if anything, we should do about it. To start, can you tell me if you’ve experienced any symptoms that have been concerning you recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not really. I feel… well, I feel about as good as an eighty-eight-year-old man can feel, I suppose! A little stiff in the mornings, takes a bit to get going, but that's just old age, isn't it? No chest pains, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. I walk to the store most days, still manage my little garden. I eat pretty well, I think. My wife, bless her soul, always made sure I had good food. It’s been two years since she passed, though, and I’ll admit I haven’t been as strict with myself since then. Maybe a few more cookies than I should have…
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you're still active and independent, Mr. Bohnett. It’s wonderful you’re able to maintain your garden and walk to the store. And it’s completely understandable to adjust your routines after a loss, it takes time to find a new normal. Let's talk a little more about your overall health history. Do you have any known medical conditions – perhaps diabetes, heart problems, or anything else your previous doctors have diagnosed?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it was well-controlled with pills for many years. I stopped taking them a few years back, the doctor said it was okay, said I was doing so well. Other than that… nothing much, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. A few colds, a bad case of the flu now and then, but nothing serious. I used to go to Doctor Henderson, but he retired a while back. Haven’t really had a regular doctor since. I just went to the walk-in clinic when I needed something. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Bohnett. It’s good to hear you've been generally healthy and that your blood pressure was well-managed. It's not uncommon to drift without a regular doctor after retirement. Now, regarding your family history – are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she lived to be ninety-three, very strong woman. She always said it was the Swedish blood. She had arthritis, bad in her hands. My father… he passed away when I was fairly young, heart trouble, I think. A sudden thing. My sister, she’s still alive, thankfully, but she’s got diabetes. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, just like me. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Bohnett. Thank you. Knowing about your family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and arthritis gives us some important clues. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take a baby aspirin every day, just a low dose, Doctor Henderson started me on that years ago, said it was good for the heart. And I take a calcium supplement, for my bones. My wife always reminded me to take that. Other than that… not really. I tried some of those arthritis creams, but they didn't seem to do much good. I don’t believe in taking a lot of pills if I don’t need them, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Bohnett. It's good to be mindful of what you put into your body. So, to confirm, just a daily baby aspirin and a calcium supplement?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Just the aspirin and the calcium. And sometimes a little prune juice, if you want to get really specific! Keeps things… regular, you know?
DOCTOR: I appreciate the thoroughness, Mr. Bohnett. That’s good to know. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. My wife was allergic to shellfish, had to be very careful when we went out to eat, but I’ve never had any trouble with allergies myself. I can eat just about anything. Well, except maybe Brussels sprouts. Never liked those. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a dislike!
DOCTOR: No, a dislike for Brussels sprouts doesn't count! It’s good to know you don’t have any known allergies. Okay, Mr. Bohnett, with all this information, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a general assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind a little poking and prodding. It's good to know what's going on inside, even if I can’t feel it myself. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please just relax, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing as I go along. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/82. That’s slightly elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not necessarily concerning at this age, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Your pulses are a little weak, especially in your ankles. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally stable, but the slightly elevated blood pressure, murmur, and weak ankle pulses are things we'll need to investigate further. Now, do you have access to your medical records, or would you like me to order some bloodwork and potentially an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Well, that doesn’t sound too bad, Doctor. I don’t have any of those fancy records you’re talking about. I just went to the walk-in clinic when I needed something, they didn’t bother with records. Ordering some bloodwork and an EKG sounds like a good idea. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to make sure I’m not about to fall apart, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bohnett. It’s good we're being proactive. Ordering some tests is definitely the right course of action. We'll do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. We’ll also do a lipid panel to get a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol. And the EKG will assess the electrical activity of your heart, which will help us evaluate the murmur. I'll write the orders for those tests now. You can go to the lab just down the hall, and they should be able to draw the blood and perform the EKG right away. Once the results are back – typically within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A couple of days is no problem at all. I’ll go down to the lab right away. Is there anything special I need to do to prepare for the tests? Should I fast beforehand, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, good question, Mr. Bohnett. For the lipid panel – the cholesterol test – you do need to fast for at least 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. The other tests don’t require fasting. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions. The lab technicians will also be able to answer any questions you have. Do you have any questions for me before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience and taking the time to listen to an old man like me. It's a relief to finally be getting this checked out. I’ll go down to the lab now and get this done. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to ask if any questions arise while you’re at the lab, or when you receive the results. We’ll figure out what’s going on and create a plan to keep you feeling your best. Here’s the requisition form, and the lab is just down the hall to your left. Take your time, and please let the receptionist know if you need any assistance. I’ll see you in a couple of days for your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Bohnett.
PATIENT: .
