DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr… Nahrwold, is it?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning. It’s Ms. Nahrwold, actually. Jase Nahrwold. It’s… a bit of a long story, honestly. I don’t really remember how it got messed up on the paperwork. Sorry about that!
DOCTOR: Yes, well. These things happen. Though one would think a simple name… Regardless. Ms. Nahrwold. Please, do tell me what brings you in today. And try to be concise, if you wouldn’t mind. My schedule is rather…full.
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Um… it’s my stomach. I’ve been having… a lot of trouble with diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s just… not stopping. I think… I think the doctor a few years back said something about… IBD? Or maybe celiac? Something like that. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. It’s just… really uncomfortable and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: IBD… celiac… Right. And how long precisely has this “trouble” been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a hard question. It comes and goes, you know? But this recent… bout? Probably a couple of weeks, at least. Maybe longer. It's hard to keep track, to be honest. It feels like it’s been happening on and off for months, but this is the worst it’s been recently. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are…unhelpful, Ms. Nahrwold. A couple of weeks, on and off for months… Do you experience any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever accompanying this diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, definitely some pain. It’s mostly… cramping, I guess? Like, really uncomfortable twists in my stomach. And sometimes I feel a little nauseous, but I haven't actually thrown up. No fever, though. Definitely not a fever. I just… feel really tired a lot, if that counts for anything. I mostly just want to lie down.
DOCTOR: Tiredness is, predictably, a rather common symptom. And this cramping… is it constant, or does it come and go with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: It mostly comes and goes with it, I think. When I have to go to the bathroom, that’s when it gets really bad. Then it eases up a little when… well, when I’m done. It’s not always there, but it's definitely worse when the diarrhea is happening. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. I just feel really… unsettled.
DOCTOR: Unsettled. Right. And have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s… a bit of a personal question. I… I think so? Maybe? It’s hard to tell, honestly. Sometimes it looks a little… different, I guess. Not like, bright red blood, but… darker? And sometimes it’s a bit… slimy? I don’t really like looking, so I haven’t paid super close attention. Sorry. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It could be indicative of inflammation. We shall proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything. I’m not very good with medical stuff, so… I’ll just try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is tender to palpation in the lower left quadrant. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Now, have you had any recent travel outside of the country?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Not in… a long time. Let me think… The last time was probably… a few years ago, when I went to visit family in Pakistan. But that was ages ago. I haven't been anywhere else since. Just… around here, mostly. Nothing exciting. Does that help?
DOCTOR: And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My diet… it’s… not great, honestly. I work a lot, and sometimes I just grab whatever’s easiest. Fast food, sometimes. A lot of bread, I think. Not a lot of vegetables. My husband tries to get me to eat better, but it’s hard. I do drink a lot of water, though! Is that good? I’m not really a cook, if that helps.
DOCTOR: A diet consisting primarily of… convenience foods is rarely conducive to optimal health. Very well. I'm ordering a stool sample analysis and blood work – a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. This will help rule out certain infections and assess for signs of inflammation. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. My husband usually handles the medicine stuff, so I don't really pay attention. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. But… let me think for a second. No, I don’t think so. But if something pops into my head, I’ll let you know, okay? I'm not great with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Right. We will proceed as cautiously as possible. You'll receive instructions from the nurse regarding the stool sample collection. Please return in one week with the results. We’ll discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet - no dairy, fried foods, or excessive caffeine. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that's clear. No dairy, fried foods, or caffeine. Bland diet. I think I can manage that. One week, and then we’ll talk about the results. Thank you, Dr. Jules. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the laboratory to provide the sample container and instructions. Do try to adhere to the dietary recommendations. One week. Do not be late. .
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I will. Thank you again. Bye. .
