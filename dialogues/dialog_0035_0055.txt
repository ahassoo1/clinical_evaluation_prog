DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I’m not entirely certain why I had to come all the way out here for this. My husband suggested it, you see. He’s been reading things… about medical marijuana. Apparently, it’s all the rage now. I’m here to get… a certificate, I believe he called it. For it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your husband suggested you come in regarding medical marijuana. A certification, yes. That’s perfectly alright. To be clear, we evaluate patients for qualifying conditions here. It’s not simply a matter of requesting it. So, let’s start with why you are interested in medical marijuana. Do you have any specific health concerns you’re hoping it might help with?
PATIENT: Well, honestly, Doctor, I don’t have concerns, per se. I’m a very healthy woman for my age. Always have been. But my joints… they aren’t what they used to be. A bit creaky, you understand. It’s just… getting old. My husband reads these articles about it helping with aches and pains, and he worries about me. I mostly just want to appease him, if I’m being truthful. Though, if it could help, I suppose it wouldn’t hurt. Is that… sufficient reason, Doctor? I don’t understand all these conditions you speak of.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, primarily joint discomfort related to age, and you're exploring medical marijuana as a potential option, encouraged by your husband. That's perfectly valid. We do need to document this properly, though. “Joint discomfort” is a bit broad. Can you tell me more about where specifically you’re experiencing pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my knees, certainly. Especially when the weather changes. And my hips… they ache when I walk too much. I used to be quite the dancer, you see. Not professionally, but I loved it. Still do, when I can manage it. And… my hands, sometimes. A bit of stiffness, particularly in the mornings. It's not debilitating, Doctor. Truly. I can still do most everything I need to. But it's… there. It’s annoying, mostly. Though, my husband makes quite a fuss about it, as husbands do. He's convinced I’m suffering terribly. Honestly, I think he just enjoys reading about these things. Is there a form for all this documenting, Doctor? This is rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a form, and we'll get to it. I just need a little more information for my records, and to determine if you meet the criteria for a certification. So, to clarify: knee pain, hip pain with walking, and hand stiffness in the mornings. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your typical knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Numbers. My husband is always asking me to rate things on a scale. It’s terribly imprecise, isn't it? Well… on a good day, perhaps a two. A three on a chilly morning, or after a bit too much gardening. I do enjoy my roses, you see. Though, I haven’t been able to get out as much this year. The weather hasn’t been cooperating. It’s rarely a seven or above, Doctor. I assure you. I'm not one to complain, but… gardening is important to me, and I do miss it. Is this what you need to know? If it's about the roses, I can tell you all about them…
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. No, I don't need to know about the roses, though I appreciate the offer! We just need to establish a baseline. So, typical pain level of 2-3, increasing to perhaps 3 on chilly days or after activity. Have you tried anything for the pain so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Everything, really. My mother always swore by liniment. I used it for years. And I've tried those over-the-counter creams. The ones with the menthol, you know. They provide a bit of temporary relief, but it doesn’t last. My husband bought me one of those heating pads. That helps, too, but I don’t like using it all the time. It feels… unnatural. And I took some of those pills, years ago. The ones my general practitioner prescribed. They made me drowsy, so I stopped. I prefer to manage on my own, if possible. Though, frankly, getting older is proving to be rather… difficult. Do you have any recommendations, Doctor? Besides this… marijuana, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you've tried liniments, topical creams, a heating pad, and some oral pain medication in the past, but you're looking for something else. The drowsiness from the pills is understandable. Before we discuss medical marijuana further, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to assess your joints and rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, I didn’t expect that. I thought this would be a simple matter of paperwork. I’m not… particularly fond of being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind my saying so. I'm a woman of a certain age, you see. My bones aren’t as… pliable as they once were. Though, I suppose if it’s necessary… I just hope it won’t be too uncomfortable. How long will it take? And will I have to… undress?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It will be a very brief exam, focused only on your knees, hips, and hands. We just need to check your range of motion and look for any swelling or tenderness. You won’t need to undress, Doctor. We can do it through your clothing. It should take no more than five to ten minutes, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Would you like me to have a chaperone present, if that would make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… rather considerate of you, Doctor. A chaperone isn’t necessary, I suppose. As long as it’s quick, and you explain what you're doing. I do dislike surprises, you see. My husband will be most displeased if I’m gone for too long. He's already made a rather elaborate lunch. Though, I doubt he'd approve of me getting poked and prodded either. Very well. Let's get it over with, shall we? But gently, please. My bones are rather fragile. And do let me know if you see anything alarming. I haven’t noticed anything… truly concerning, but one can never be too careful, can one?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be very gentle. If anything feels painful, please let me know immediately. Let’s start with your knees. If you could just sit on the edge of the table and extend your legs in front of you, that would be great. Okay, I’m just checking for any tenderness or swelling here. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: A little, Doctor. Just a twinge, really. It’s always a bit stiff when I first move them. Like a rusty hinge, you know? Though, it loosens up after a bit. It's more uncomfortable than painful, truly. My mother always said a good walk was the best medicine, but these days… walking isn’t quite as easy as it used to be. And my husband insists I take it easy. He worries terribly, you see. He's convinced I’m wasting away, despite my protests. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m being fussed over more than a child. Is this going to take much longer? My knees are beginning to ache from… being examined. And do be careful, please. I don’t want to end up with a pulled muscle.
DOCTOR: Alright, hips now. Just lie down on your back, if you can. I’m going to gently move your legs around to assess your range of motion. Again, please let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, I’m just checking for any restriction in movement. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: A little, Doctor. Just on the right side. A bit of a creaking sound, you know? Like… old wood protesting. It's not a sharp pain, more of an… annoyance, really. And it feels a bit tight, perhaps. I do try to stretch, but it doesn’t seem to help much these days. Honestly, I think it’s just… age. My husband keeps suggesting physical therapy, but I’m not keen on the idea. All that bending and stretching… it sounds dreadful. Do you think this is serious, Doctor? I'm rather worried now. I don't want to end up with a hip replacement. I've heard those are terribly painful. And the recovery time… Oh dear. I’m starting to feel quite anxious. Perhaps I shouldn’t have come all this way.
DOCTOR: Alright, and finally, let’s just take a look at your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me, and spread your fingers apart?
PATIENT: There. Though it's a bit stiff, you see. Especially in the mornings. Like… trying to unstick glue. And it's not as strong as it used to be. I used to be quite the knitter, you know. But these days… holding the needles is becoming rather difficult. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… discomfort. And it's a bit achy, particularly at the base of my thumb. Honestly, Doctor, it's just the hands of an old woman, I suspect. Nothing to worry about. Are we finished now? I'm feeling quite tired, and my knees are aching terribly. And my husband will be wondering where I am. He's a very punctual man, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Ellan. That was very helpful. So, to summarize: mild discomfort and stiffness in both knees, more pronounced in the mornings and with activity; mild discomfort and creaking in the right hip with range of motion; and mild stiffness and discomfort in the hands, particularly in the mornings and at the base of the thumb. Based on my exam, there’s no indication of any serious underlying pathology, such as severe arthritis or injury. It appears to be typical age-related wear and tear. Now, regarding medical marijuana. While it may provide some relief for your symptoms, it’s not a cure-all, and it does come with potential side effects. Given the mild nature of your symptoms, and your preference for avoiding medication, I don’t believe it’s absolutely necessary at this time. However, if you still wish to pursue it, I can certainly write you a certification. We would start with a low dose and monitor your response. But I also recommend considering some conservative measures first, such as gentle stretching, low-impact exercise, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… rather disappointing, isn't it? I mean, I came all this way, and you’re saying I don’t need it? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure what to think. My husband will be terribly disappointed. He’s been reading all these articles about the benefits, you see. And he’s convinced it will solve all my problems. But… you’re right. I don’t want to take anything I don’t need. And I’m not keen on side effects. And frankly, the thought of stretching and exercising… well, it doesn't appeal to me. Perhaps… perhaps I’ll just tell my husband I tried. That you said it wasn’t necessary. He’s a reasonable man, ultimately. Though he will likely insist I try the stretching. So… no certificate, then? Just… your recommendation for stretching? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure that’s enough to appease him. But… it seems the sensible thing to do. Yes. No certificate. Just… your recommendation. And perhaps a note, saying I’ve been examined and it's just age-related wear and tear. Would that be possible?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's a summary of your exam findings, stating that it appears to be typical age-related wear and tear in your knees, hips, and hands. I've also included some gentle stretching exercises you can try, and recommended over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. I understand your husband may be disappointed, but I believe this is the best course of action for your health. If your symptoms worsen or you find that you're unable to manage with conservative measures, please don't hesitate to come back and see me. We can re-evaluate at that time. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And for not poking and prodding me too much. And for the nice summary. Perhaps this will be enough to satisfy my husband. Though I doubt it. He’s a very determined man, you see. Oh, one thing. Do you… accept cash? I don't believe I have a credit card with me. And I’m not quite sure what the cost of all this was. My husband usually handles the finances. Yes, just the cost. If you could tell me, that would be lovely. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old woman and her aching joints.
DOCTOR: Of course. The cost for the consultation is $120. And yes, we do accept cash. Here’s your receipt. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. It was my pleasure meeting you, Ellan. I hope you have a good day, and that you and your husband enjoy your lunch. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And perhaps… perhaps I should mention the roses to my husband. He does enjoy gardening, you see. Though he’s rather preoccupied with these… medical remedies these days. Well, good day to you, Doctor. And thank you again for everything.
