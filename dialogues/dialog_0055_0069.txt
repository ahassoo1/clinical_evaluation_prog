DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiо. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 47 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, 47. I’m here for a vaccination, if that’s okay. Just trying to keep up with things, you know? I think it’s just a regular one I need.
DOCTOR: A vaccination, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I got a notice in the mail… something about boosters, I think? Honestly, I don’t always remember what they all are for. It just said I was due for one. Do you know which one it is?
DOCTOR: Well, those notices can be… imprecise. To ensure we administer the correct vaccine, could you perhaps recall when you last received a vaccination, and if so, which one?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had the flu shot last October, definitely. And before that… hmm. I got the COVID booster, I believe, in… April of 2023? I remember because it was right before my cousin’s wedding, and my arm was a little sore for a couple of days. I’ve been pretty good about keeping up with those, but the specific names… they all blur together, you know?
DOCTOR: Very good. Flu in October and COVID booster in April of 2023. It’s… common for patients to find the specifics difficult to recall. We’ll need to review your vaccination record to be certain. Let me pull up your electronic health record… just a moment. Hmm. It appears we have records confirming the influenza vaccine and the COVID-19 booster as you stated. However, there's an indication here that you are due for a Tdap booster – that is Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis. Is that something you’ve discussed with your previous physician?
PATIENT: Tdap… no, I don’t think so. I don’t recall discussing that, no. Pertussis… is that whooping cough? I think my niece had that when she was little. I just go wherever the doctor tells me to go, to be honest. Is that something I need to have? What’s the reason for it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Pertussis is whooping cough. It’s a highly contagious respiratory illness, and while it’s often mild in adults, it can be quite serious, particularly for infants. The Tdap booster protects against all three diseases – Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis – and the immunity from the previous vaccinations does wane over time. It’s generally recommended every ten years, or with each pregnancy, and after exposure to a confirmed case. Given your age and the time since your last Tdap vaccination, it is advisable. Do you have any known allergies that might preclude you from receiving it?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much! No reactions to any medications either, as far as I remember. So if you think it’s best, I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to stay healthy. Is it a bad shot? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: Well, “bad” is subjective, Mr. Paguiо. It is an intramuscular injection, so you will feel a brief pinch. Some patients experience mild soreness at the injection site for a day or two, perhaps some fatigue or a low-grade fever. However, these side effects are usually self-limiting and far less severe than contracting the diseases the vaccine prevents. We will administer it in your deltoid muscle. If you could please roll up your sleeve, we can proceed. We will monitor you briefly afterwards to ensure no adverse reaction occurs.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. Just get it over with quickly, if you could, Doctor. I’m not a fan of this part, but I understand it’s important. Which arm is best?
DOCTOR: The left arm is preferable, Mr. Paguiо. It’s standard practice to administer injections in the non-dominant arm, should any rare, but significant, reaction occur. This allows continued use of your dominant arm. This will sting momentarily. Please try to relax your arm. There. All done. Keep that bandage on for at least fifteen minutes. Now, just sit here quietly for a few moments, and I will check your vitals and ensure you aren't experiencing any immediate adverse reaction.
PATIENT: Okay. That wasn't too bad, actually. A little pinch, like you said. Feels a bit warm already, though. I’ll sit here and relax. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, I won’t feel awful later. Is there anything I should avoid doing afterwards? Like, heavy lifting or anything?
DOCTOR: Your vitals are stable, which is reassuring. Mild soreness is to be expected, and a low-grade fever is possible, though unlikely. It’s advisable to avoid strenuous activity for the remainder of the day. Heavy lifting, or any activity that unduly stresses the injected arm, could exacerbate the soreness. Otherwise, you should be able to resume your normal activities tomorrow. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just take it easy, avoid heavy lifting. I can manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I should probably get going then. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Paguiо. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms. A follow-up appointment is not necessary unless you develop a significant adverse reaction. Have a good day to you as well. .
