DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about my ear. It just…stopped working, practically overnight. And my face feels a bit droopy on one side. It's rather inconvenient, if you must know. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum. It’s certainly concerning when something changes so suddenly. Droopiness on one side of the face along with hearing loss is something we need to investigate promptly. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was…Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was getting ready for my book club – terribly important, you know – and I couldn’t hear a thing out of my left ear. I thought the television was just quiet, but then I realized it wasn’t working at all. And then my friend, Beatrice, commented on my face looking…odd. That’s when I noticed it. Really, it’s quite upsetting. I haven’t had a single health problem in years, and now this.
DOCTOR: Tuesday morning… and your friend Beatrice noticed some facial droopiness. Okay. And has anything like this happened before, even a little bit?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. I’m a very healthy woman. I eat well, I keep active… well, as active as one can be at my age. And I certainly don’t go around with things drooping. It’s just…not done. I’ve never experienced anything remotely like this. It’s simply dreadful. Do you need to know about my book club? It's a very serious discussion group.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nissenbaum, the details of your book club aren’t necessary, although I appreciate you offering. It’s good to hear you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle. Okay. To get a better picture of what’s happening, could you describe the facial droopiness a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… difficult to explain. It’s not like my entire face collapsed, if that’s what you’re thinking. It's mostly on the left side. My mouth feels… weaker, I suppose. And when I try to smile, it doesn’t look quite right. It’s very subtle, but Beatrice has a keen eye for these things. She used to be a theatre actress, you know. Very observant. It's just… asymmetrical. Dreadfully asymmetrical. I don't appreciate asymmetry.
DOCTOR: Asymmetry… and feeling weaker on the left side of your mouth. Okay. And besides the hearing loss and facial weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No dizziness, thankfully. And no headache. My taste is alright, I had a lovely mango this morning. No fever, as far as I can tell. I haven't been sick in ages. Oh! Wait a moment… my left eye feels a little…gritty. Yes, gritty and dry. It's rather annoying, actually. But that's all. Really. Just the ear, the face, and this bothersome eye. Is that it? Are we getting anywhere? I have a luncheon to attend later.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness, no headache, good taste, no fever, but a gritty, dry feeling in your left eye. That’s helpful information. Given the sudden hearing loss, facial weakness, and eye irritation, it’s important we rule out a few possibilities. It sounds like we need to consider something affecting a nerve. Would you be comfortable if I do a quick neurological exam?
PATIENT: A nerve? Honestly, that sounds… alarming. What sort of nerve? And what does "neurological exam" entail? I’m not keen on poking and prodding. I have sensitive skin. And I really must be at that luncheon. I’m supposed to be discussing a very important novel. Is it a long exam? And will it leave a mark? I simply cannot abide marks.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nissenbaum. It's natural to feel anxious when you're not sure what's happening. The nerve we're most concerned about is the facial nerve, which controls movement of the face and also affects taste and sometimes hearing. The neurological exam is quite simple, and I assure you it won’t involve any painful poking or prodding. I’ll be checking your reflexes, strength, sensation, and coordination – mostly just asking you to follow my instructions. It won’t leave any marks at all. It should only take about 10-15 minutes. We’ll quickly assess what's going on and decide on the next steps. It’s important to get this checked out promptly, so we can rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Ten minutes, you say? And absolutely no marks? Fine. But if it gets too…invasive, I shall stop you immediately. I do have a rather important schedule, you know. And please be gentle. My skin is extremely delicate. Proceed, but quickly. I have a novel to discuss. Honestly, the inconvenience of this is… substantial.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s have you close your eyes. Can you tell me if I can lift each eyelid equally?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, close my eyes. Fine. Go ahead. But be careful! Don’t pull too hard. Honestly, the sensitivity… I'm blinking to keep it moist, you know. Proceed… carefully.
DOCTOR: Okay. On the left side, it seems a bit difficult to lift the eyelid fully. It's subtle, but noticeable. Now, can you try to close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There! Closed tightly. Perfectly closed, I assure you. Though it is rather straining, I must say. My eyelids are not what they used to be. Is this taking long? I really must get going soon. The luncheon… it’s terribly important. And Beatrice will be most displeased if I’m late. She's very punctual.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed a little bit of difficulty closing your left eye completely. Now, can you try to smile for me?
PATIENT: There. A smile. Perfectly pleasant, I assure you. Though, as you can see, it's not my most dazzling expression. It's… difficult to maintain, actually. This is rather tiring. Are we almost done? Honestly, the inconvenience…
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. The left side of your smile is weaker than the right. Now, I’d like you to puff out your cheeks.
PATIENT: There! Cheeks puffed. Perfectly round, though it requires considerable effort, I must say. It’s rather… exhausting, really. And I do believe my lipstick is smudging. Honestly, the indignity of it all… Is this going to be much longer? I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you try to wrinkle your forehead, like you're raising your eyebrows in surprise?
PATIENT: There! Wrinkled. Or, attempting to wrinkle, I should say. The left side is… resistant, I suppose. It simply won’t cooperate. Honestly, this is quite frustrating. I look ridiculous. Are we finished yet? I simply must get to my luncheon. Beatrice is expecting me, and she does not tolerate tardiness. It's a very serious discussion about a very important novel. I can't possibly be late. And my lipstick… it's a disaster!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nissenbaum, thank you for your patience. I believe that’s all I need for now. Based on the exam findings – weakness on the left side of your face, difficulty closing your left eye fully, asymmetry with smiling and wrinkling your forehead, and the gritty feeling in your left eye – it’s most likely Bell’s palsy. This is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face due to inflammation of the facial nerve. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke or a tumor, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly! More poking and prodding? And a brain scan? What exactly are you implying? I assure you, my brain is perfectly functional, thank you very much. I have a very active mind. I read extensively, I engage in stimulating conversation… I simply don't understand why this is necessary. And what about my luncheon? Will this interfere with my luncheon? Beatrice will be furious. This is all terribly inconvenient. Are you certain this Bell's palsy isn't just… a temporary facial tic? It could be stress, you know. I’ve been under a lot of pressure lately. Perhaps a nice cup of tea and a calming novel would suffice. I simply do not want an MRI.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nissenbaum. I assure you, I'm not implying anything about your cognitive function. The MRI isn't to assess your mental state, but to rule out other rare, but serious, causes of facial weakness. It's a standard precaution in cases like this. The scan itself is painless, and you'll be able to listen to music during the procedure. It takes about 30-45 minutes. However, if you are strongly opposed to the MRI at this time, we can proceed with a treatment plan for Bell’s palsy, which typically involves a course of corticosteroids and antiviral medications. But, I do strongly recommend the MRI to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis. If we proceed with treatment without an MRI, it's important to be aware that we won't be able to completely rule out other possibilities. Would you like me to explain the treatment options in more detail?
PATIENT: Corticosteroids? Antiviral medications? Honestly, that sounds dreadful. I do not take medications. I prefer natural remedies, thank you very much. A warm compress, perhaps? And a soothing herbal tea? That's all I need. And I simply will not have an MRI. I have a luncheon to attend, and I do not have time for elaborate medical procedures. You are making me anxious, and anxiety is terrible for the complexion. So, no MRI. Warm compress and herbal tea. That's my treatment plan. And if it doesn’t improve, then perhaps we can discuss it further. But for now, no MRI. Do you understand? I am a very busy woman. Beatrice is waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nissenbaum. I respect your decision. However, I must advise you that without an MRI, we cannot definitively rule out other causes of your facial weakness. If you choose to proceed with warm compresses and herbal tea, it’s important to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as difficulty speaking, changes in vision, or severe headache, you should seek immediate medical attention. I can prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids, which can sometimes help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. However, it’s ultimately your decision whether or not to take them. Do you wish for me to write a prescription for corticosteroids?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A short course, you say? Fine. A short course of… whatever those pills are. But if they interfere with my novel reading, or give me a rash, I’m stopping them immediately. And no, do not mention this to Beatrice. She'd be most displeased. I don't want her thinking I'm unwell. Write the prescription. Quickly, please. I have a luncheon to attend, and I simply must look my best. And do remind me again what these pills are for? Just so I can explain it to Beatrice, should she ask. Though, I sincerely doubt she will. She's a very understanding friend. But one must be prepared, you know. Write the prescription, and let me be on my way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. Here is the prescription for a 7-day course of prednisolone. This is a corticosteroid that helps to reduce inflammation around the facial nerve, which is thought to be the cause of Bell's palsy. It may help to improve your facial weakness. Possible side effects can include temporary fluid retention, mood changes, and difficulty sleeping. If you experience any concerning side effects, please contact the office immediately. As we discussed, monitor your symptoms closely. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as difficulty speaking, changes in vision, or severe headache, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. Just… one more thing. Will this… condition… affect my smile? Beatrice is very particular about my smile. It's considered one of my best features. And I have a rather important social engagement next week. One simply must be presentable, you know. Will my smile return to normal? That is all I want to know. And please, be reassuring. I simply cannot abide a lopsided smile. It would be dreadful. I need to get going now. Beatrice is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concern. The good news is that most people with Bell's palsy experience a full recovery, and their facial function returns to normal, including their smile. The recovery process can take time – it can range from a few weeks to several months – and sometimes physical therapy can be helpful to regain full control of your facial muscles. It’s difficult to predict exactly how your recovery will progress, but the sooner you start treatment, the better your chances of a full recovery. I recommend following up with me in two weeks to assess your progress. And if you are concerned about your smile, we can discuss options for facial exercises or physical therapy at that time. I wish you a speedy recovery, and I hope you enjoy your luncheon with Beatrice. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose that will have to do. A speedy recovery, you say? One can only hope. And yes, the luncheon… it's terribly important. I believe that is all. Good day to you.
