DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… oh, let me think… more than two days now, I think. It's really quite annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: More than two days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, more than two days. Started… Tuesday, I believe. I was having tea with a friend, and then hic just started. And they haven’t really gone away since. I’ve tried… well, I’ve tried a lot of things people told me, you know? Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… nothing seems to work. hic It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Exhausting is a good word for it, I suppose. Holding your breath and drinking water... those are common remedies, certainly. But clearly not effective in your case. Do you recall anything specific happening before they started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Before Tuesday… nothing really out of the ordinary. Just the usual. I was preparing for a show at the community center – we’re doing a little Egyptian dance revue, you know? A lot of running around, making sure costumes fit, that the music was right… I was a bit stressed about it, maybe? But nothing majorly upsetting. hic I don't know if that would cause hiccups.
DOCTOR: Stress can contribute to… various things. Let’s go through a bit more detail about these hiccups. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being barely noticeable and 10 being incredibly disruptive, how would you rate their intensity?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Hmm… I’d say maybe a 6 or 7? They aren’t painful, exactly, but they come on quite frequently and they make it hard to… concentrate, or have a normal conversation, or even just relax. hic Especially when I’m trying to sleep. It’s really interfering with everything.
DOCTOR: Interfering with sleep is concerning. And frequent hiccups… alright. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside these hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. No pain anywhere, no trouble breathing, no heartburn… nothing like that. I’ve been eating normally, though I admit I haven’t been very hungry, just because it's annoying to eat with the hiccups, you know? hic Everything else feels… normal, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: "As far as you can tell" isn't particularly helpful, Ms. Redeye. We need specifics. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, goodness, you're right. I get flustered easily. No, no nausea or vomiting. Definitely not. And no fever, no dizziness… honestly, just the relentless hiccups! hic It’s just… so frustrating. I apologize for not being more clear. I haven’t been feeling ill, otherwise. It's just these… these spasms.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my gallbladder out… oh, about fifteen years ago now? And I had a bad bout of the flu last winter, but that's about it. Nothing chronic, no diabetes, no heart problems… I’m generally a pretty healthy person, I think. hic I try to be, anyway. I used to dance professionally, you know, so I always kept myself in good shape.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal fifteen years ago… Alright. And any surgeries other than the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the gallbladder. And I’ve had the usual vaccinations, tetanus boosters and such. I try to stay up to date on those. I don't think I’ve had anything major in years, honestly. hic I'm not a big fan of doctors, so I tend to avoid them when I can. But these hiccups... they’re just not going away.
DOCTOR: Avoiding doctors is… not advisable, Ms. Redeye. However, we'll focus on the present. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don’t really take anything. I prefer to just… deal with things, you know? I’ve got some pain relievers in the house, for headaches, but I haven't used them in months. And no herbal supplements, no vitamins, nothing like that. hic I'm trying to keep things natural, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: No medications… Good. Now, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m a bit sensitive to dust, sometimes makes me sneeze, but that's not an allergy, really, is it? hic I've never been told I have any serious allergies. I eat a lot of different foods, especially when I'm preparing for a show, trying new recipes...
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, I think, and my father… he had arthritis, badly, in his knees. Nothing else, really. No history of anything… unusual, anyway. No heart disease, no cancer… hic They both lived to be quite old, actually. Late eighties. So, I don’t think I’m predisposed to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never have, never will. My mother smoked, and I saw what it did to her. Absolutely not. hic I try to eat healthy, and I avoid alcohol, mostly. A small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: A small glass of wine… occasionally. And do you live alone, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I was divorced… oh, about ten years ago now. My husband… well, it wasn’t a good match. I live in a small apartment downtown. It's quite quiet, which is nice. hic I keep busy with the community center and the dance group, so I don't get lonely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll just take a quick look at your throat. Please sit back and relax. hic Though I suspect it will be difficult to assess much, given the… persistent spasms.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. hic Though I warn you, they're not cooperating today. I'll try to stay still. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything. hic I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles noted. hic Now, open your mouth and say "ah." Throat appears normal, no obvious signs of infection or inflammation. hic Reflexes are normal. No palpable lymphadenopathy. hic Overall, a remarkably unremarkable examination, despite the… unfortunate symptom.
PATIENT: Well, that's… reassuring, I suppose. hic But also a little frustrating! Everything looks normal, but these hiccups just won't stop. hic What does that mean? Are you sure there's nothing… physically wrong?
DOCTOR: The fact that the physical exam is unremarkable suggests the cause is likely benign and self-limiting, Ms. Redeye. However, persistent hiccups – and by persistent, I mean lasting more than 48 hours – warrant further investigation. We'll need to rule out some less common causes. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Oh. A chest X-ray? hic That sounds… serious. What are you looking for? Is it something to be worried about? hic I just want to know what's going on. This is really starting to scare me. hic And all those tests… how long will that take?
DOCTOR: Please don't panic, Ms. Redeye. A chest X-ray is simply a precautionary measure to rule out any underlying lung issues or mediastinal abnormalities, such as tumors or inflammation. It's standard procedure in cases of prolonged hiccups. As for the blood tests, we're checking for electrolyte imbalances, kidney function, and signs of infection. The blood draw will take only a few minutes, and the results should be available within 24-48 hours. We will also review your EHR. The lab will notify me when the results are available. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we must be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay. Thorough sounds… good. hic I suppose. So, what do I do in the meantime? Just… wait for the results? Is there anything I can do to help it along? hic And where do I go for the blood work and the X-ray? hic I don’t want to spend another two days like this. It’s really exhausting.
DOCTOR: While we await the results, continue to stay hydrated. Avoid carbonated beverages, spicy foods, and alcohol. There are a few anecdotal remedies, such as holding your breath, gargling with water, or sucking on a lemon, but I do not endorse them, as their efficacy is not scientifically proven. You can have the blood work done at the lab located in the medical building across the street. I'll send the order electronically. The X-ray can be done at the radiology center next door. I'll also send the order there. Should the hiccups continue beyond 72 hours, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or fever – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. hic Hydrate, avoid certain foods, blood work across the street, X-ray next door, and come back if it gets worse. hic It sounds like a lot, but… okay. Thank you, Doctor. hic I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. Even if it’s probably nothing. I’ll go get the tests done right away. hic
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them. Do not hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. And please, try to remain calm. It is likely nothing serious. .
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you again. hic
