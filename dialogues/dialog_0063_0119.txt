DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s what one comes to a doctor for. It’s… a problem. A delicate problem, if you catch my drift. My… companion is experiencing some… discharge. It’s not pleasant. And frankly, it’s quite concerning.
DOCTOR: A… companion?
PATIENT: Yes. A companion. A… gentleman friend. It’s not something I readily discuss, you understand. But it’s… coming from him. A sort of… fluid. It’s not normal, is it? And he’s rather… bothered by it. Though, naturally, I am as well. It’s… unhygienic, to say the least. I do try to keep things tidy, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with all due respect, are you referring to a human companion?
PATIENT: Well, of course a human companion, Doctor! What did you think I meant? Honestly, the questions some doctors ask these days… It’s perfectly reasonable to have… close relationships. It’s not as if I’m bringing in a… a pet with a problem. Though, goodness knows, some people's standards… No, a perfectly respectable gentleman. And he has this… discharge. It's simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand you're…discreet. However, to provide any sort of medical assistance, I require clarity. Is this gentleman friend experiencing this discharge from… the urethra?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens! You don’t need to be so… graphic, Doctor! Must you use such… vulgar terms? Urethra! Really! I simply told you he’s experiencing a… a leaking. A… a dampness. Is that not enough information? It’s… below. Where it shouldn't be leaking, naturally. Honestly, I expected a bit more… sensitivity from a medical professional. You’re making me quite uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I apologize if my line of questioning is…unpleasant. But I assure you, it is necessary. To ascertain the cause of this "leaking," as you put it, I need specifics. Has he any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Well… he grumbles a bit. And he’s certainly not himself. A bit… irritable, you might say. He doesn’t want to be touched, naturally. It's very awkward. He says it… stings a little when he… you know. When he uses the facilities. But he’s a stoic man, generally. Doesn’t complain much. Just… grumbles. And the smell, Doctor. The smell is quite unpleasant. It's not a gentlemanly aroma, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It started… after the holiday, I believe. We went to Majorca. Lovely island, truly. But… perhaps the water wasn't quite right? Or perhaps it was that paella at the beach restaurant. He did have a rather large portion. It's been… a few weeks now. Maybe three? It’s difficult to say precisely. I don't keep a calendar of his… bodily functions, you understand. Just a dreadful nuisance, really. It's ruining our evenings.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no. He’s a robust man, generally. A bit of a grumbler, as I said, but not prone to illness. Chills… well, he complained about the air conditioning in the cinema last week, but that's hardly a chill, is it? And abdominal pain… he does complain about his digestion sometimes, but that's just his fondness for rich food. Honestly, Doctor, are you going to ask about every little discomfort? It's a discharge, not a full-blown epidemic! It's simply… bothersome. And increasingly embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I believe I have enough information, though frankly, it's rather…sparse. I suspect this is a case of urethritis, likely due to a bacterial infection. I will need to examine him. Is he here today?
PATIENT: Examine him?! Good heavens, Doctor, are you serious? You want me to… facilitate an examination? That is simply out of the question! I brought him to the doctor, I didn’t bring him with the doctor! He’s… rather private, you see. And I’m certain he would be… mortified. Absolutely mortified! No, no, that won’t do at all. Absolutely not. He'll need to come himself, another day. When he has… built up the courage, perhaps. It's a delicate matter, you understand. A very delicate matter.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your… concerns. However, a proper diagnosis requires a physical examination. I cannot provide appropriate treatment without one. I strongly advise him to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I can prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but this is not ideal. Are you willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: A… broad-spectrum antibiotic, you say? Well… I suppose that’s better than nothing. If it will at least… contain the problem. But please, nothing too… potent. He has a sensitive stomach, you see. And it must not interfere with his… evening activities. We have a bridge club meeting on Wednesday. A very important meeting! Yes, prescribe the antibiotic. But a mild one, please. And perhaps a leaflet about… hygiene. For him, of course. I’ll ensure he reads it. This is all rather… inconvenient, you know. But I suppose one must do what one must.
DOCTOR: Very well. I am prescribing Ciprofloxacin, 500mg twice daily for seven days. And I will print out a pamphlet on basic male hygiene. Now, if there are no further questions… I have other patients waiting. I trust you understand.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, perfectly. I understand. You’re very busy, I’m sure. Thank you, Doctor. Though I must say, this hasn’t been the most… pleasant experience. I’ll ensure he takes the medication as directed. And reads the pamphlet. Good day to you.
