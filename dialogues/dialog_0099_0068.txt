DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer treatment, you see? It’s mostly in my legs and feet. It’s… not comfortable. I hope we can figure it out quickly, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, "things to do" doesn't change the need for a proper assessment. Cancer treatment, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. About… six months ago now? It was for… well, it was in my breast. They did the surgery and then… the radiation. It went well, they said, but this swelling started a few weeks after. It gets worse if I stand too long. Does that make sense? I don't know all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Six months post-radiation breast cancer treatment with subsequent lower extremity edema… Right. And you say it's worse with prolonged standing. Any pain associated with the swelling, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain. It’s more… heavy. Like my legs weigh a ton. And sometimes… a little bit itchy. Not all the time, though. Just when it's really bad, you know? It's… annoying, mostly. I have to put my feet up a lot. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a… relative term. Itching can be associated with venous insufficiency, which sometimes develops after surgery and radiation due to lymphatic disruption. Let's have a look at these legs. Could you please sit on the examination table, and I'll take a look?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, of course. Examination table… right. It’s a bit high, but I’ll manage. Just… be gentle, please? It's sensitive. And… is it going to take long?
DOCTOR: I'll be as efficient as possible, Ms. Queener. Now, let's start with your right leg. Please extend your leg flat. Hmm. And how about the left leg?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. Oh, that’s a little uncomfortable… Yes, the left one is… pretty much the same. Swollen, heavy. Feels… tight, too. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: There is significant pitting edema bilaterally, as you’ve described. Skin appears intact, no signs of ulceration at this point, which is good. I also notice some slight discoloration around your ankles. Have you had any history of blood clots, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh dear… No, not that I know of. I’ve never been told I had one. I had some trouble with my veins once, a long time ago, when I was younger, but that’s all. They just… looked bumpy, that’s all. It was nothing serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: History of varicose veins, noted. Alright. Let's check your pulses to ensure adequate circulation. Pulses are present, though somewhat diminished in the right foot. And how about any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, no, not at all. I walk to the market every day, you know? A little out of breath going up the hill, perhaps, but that’s just old age! And no chest pain. Definitely not. Are you… worried?
DOCTOR: "Worried" is not a clinical term, Ms. Queener. Diminished pulses coupled with edema post-cancer treatment… warrants investigation. We need to rule out a few possibilities. I’m ordering a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your legs and rule out deep vein thrombosis. I’ll also need to review your oncology records. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, goodness… I don’t think so. I’ve had… injections before, for my arthritis, but they never asked about dye. I don't feel allergic to anything. But… what if it is something serious? Will I need to be in the hospital?
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Ms. Queener. The ultrasound will provide us with more information. It’s a non-invasive procedure. We'll schedule it for tomorrow morning. If it is a DVT, treatment usually involves blood thinners and compression stockings. Hospitalization may be necessary, depending on the severity, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Tomorrow morning… right. Medications… let me think. I take something for my arthritis, it’s… Voltaren, I think? And a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, the doctor prescribed it a few years ago. That’s all I can remember, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Voltaren and Lisinopril. Alright. And any other medical conditions besides arthritis and hypertension?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had a gallbladder removed, a long time ago. And… I get a bit of heartburn sometimes, but that's just from eating too much chocolate, probably. Nothing serious, really. Is that important? I’m not sure why you need to know all this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, a thorough medical history is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Every piece of information is potentially relevant. Cholecystectomy noted. Alright, I think we have enough for now. We’ll get the ultrasound scheduled and review your oncology records. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs whenever possible and avoid prolonged standing. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. No, I don’t think so. Just… try not to worry, you said? I hope it's nothing too bad. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We'll do what we can, Ms. Queener. .
