DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s… unsettling. I apologize if that isn’t a very clear explanation. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Unsteady, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's not a constant thing, thankfully. More… episodes, I suppose. Sometimes it feels like the room is spinning, but not always. And other times, it’s just… a loss of balance. Like my feet aren’t quite under me. It’s hard to describe. I do my best to be careful, but it’s worrying.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long have these "episodes" been going on, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. It feels like several months, perhaps? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Things have been rather… blurry since… well, since my husband passed. I apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. It’s not that I want to be unclear, it’s simply that the details… escape me. Was it after the winter? Or before? I truly can’t say with any certainty.
DOCTOR: Alright. Several months… we’ll try to narrow it down. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I’ve been trying to think about that. No, not that I’ve noticed, truly. They seem to happen… randomly. I work out on the rigs, you see, and it hasn't seemed to happen more when I'm working, or less. Though, the work is physically demanding, so perhaps I’m simply not noticing them as much then? I do take breaks, of course. Safety first, as they say. I’m truly at a loss, Doctor. It’s just… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Working on the rigs… physically demanding work. Okay. And when you say unsteady, are you experiencing any dizziness alongside it?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Not every time, but often. It’s not a constant spinning sensation, like when you stand up too quickly, but a sort of… light-headedness. And sometimes, I feel a bit nauseous when it happens. Not enough to actually be sick, usually, but… uncomfortable. It’s all rather unpleasant, to be frank. I do try to sit down when I feel it coming on, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lightheadedness and nausea… and you're careful to sit down when it occurs. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… That’s… another good question. I hadn’t really thought about it, to be honest. Let me think… Now that you mention it, sometimes things seem a little blurry, but I just assumed it was because I work long hours and don't get enough sleep. I wear glasses, you see, and I get them checked regularly. Perhaps it’s just a need for a new prescription? I can't say for certain. It isn't something I’ve actively noticed changing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Regular glasses checkups... good. Let's move on. Now, are you experiencing any headaches along with these episodes?
PATIENT: Headaches… Yes, sometimes. They aren’t terribly severe, usually just a dull ache at the back of my head. They don't happen every time I feel unsteady, but they do occur occasionally. It’s… difficult to say if they’re connected, though. I often get tension headaches from stress, you see, and things have been rather… stressful lately. So, it's hard to tell if they are related to this unsteadiness. I take over-the-counter pain relievers when they occur, and they usually help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get a bit of your medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Please do. I’ll do my best to recall everything accurately. I do apologize in advance if I am a little… vague. I was quite healthy before… before my husband’s passing. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. And I have had the usual vaccinations, I believe. Is there anything specific you’d like to know? Perhaps about past illnesses or surgeries?
DOCTOR: Private insurance… good. Alright, let's start with past illnesses. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always been quite healthy, as I said. I have had… the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing serious. My blood pressure has always been good, according to the doctors who did yearly check-ups. And I’ve never been told I have any heart problems. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, but that was easily treated. And… and I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably fortunate, health-wise. Though, I feel rather less fortunate these days, with this unsteadiness, of course.
DOCTOR: Appendix removed, no other significant medical history… and good blood pressure. Have you ever experienced any neurological problems, like seizures, strokes, or migraines?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. Nothing like that. I’ve never had a seizure, and I’ve never been told I had a stroke. And while I do sometimes get tension headaches, I wouldn’t classify them as migraines. They are… manageable, with over-the-counter medication. I’ve never had anything severe or debilitating. My memory… well, my memory has been a little… foggy lately, as I’ve mentioned, but I hadn’t associated it with anything neurological. It’s probably just stress, I suspect. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: We'll get to the memory issues later. Let’s stick to the neurological for now. How about any history of falls, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: That's… a sensitive question, Doctor. I haven’t fallen fallen, if that makes sense. But I’ve had a few… near misses, I suppose. Times where I’ve stumbled or felt like I was going to lose my balance, but caught myself. It's been more frequent lately, of course, which is why I’m here. I haven't broken any bones or had any serious injuries, thankfully. But it’s made me rather… cautious. I try to be very careful when I walk, especially on uneven surfaces. I wouldn’t want to hurt myself.
DOCTOR: Near misses, cautious walking… Alright. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any regular prescription medications. As I said, I've always been quite healthy. I occasionally take over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, as I mentioned, but that’s the extent of it. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either. I prefer to… let my body handle things naturally, if that makes sense. Though, I am beginning to think perhaps I need to be taking something to help with this unsteadiness.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medication… good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I’m not allergic to any foods or animals, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had any trouble with insect bites or pollen. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. Though, I do try to avoid shellfish, as my husband didn't care for it. But that’s a matter of preference, not allergy.
DOCTOR: No allergies. Alright, Lilyanna. Let’s move on to your family history. Do you have any family members who have experienced similar symptoms, like dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me think… My mother… she had some trouble with her balance in her later years, yes. I believe she was diagnosed with something… something to do with her inner ear? It wasn't as severe as what I'm experiencing, but she did stumble a bit more often as she got older. And my grandfather… he had some heart problems, I believe, and he was often dizzy. But other than that, I don’t recall anyone in my family experiencing similar symptoms. It’s been a long time since I’ve thought about this, truthfully. I apologize for my vagueness. Would it be helpful if I spoke with my relatives to gather more information? Perhaps they would recall something I’ve forgotten.
DOCTOR: Perhaps. We can discuss that later. Let’s try to get a bit of your social history, Lilyanna. What do you do for work?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, I work as a rotary drill operator in the oil and gas industry, Doctor. It's… physically demanding work, out on the rigs. Long hours, often in challenging conditions. It requires a lot of strength and stamina. And… and a good sense of balance, of course. Which is why I'm so concerned about this unsteadiness. I've been doing this for several years now, and I’ve always enjoyed it. But lately, it's been… more difficult. I worry about making a mistake or… or hurting myself. It's a good job, though. Provides for me. I have to provide.
DOCTOR: Rotary drill operator, physically demanding work… and I'll note the concern about balance. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I believe in taking care of my health, and I avoid anything that could compromise it. I always have. I find strength in a clear mind and a healthy body, and I wouldn't want to jeopardize that. I suspect my husband would agree, were he still here.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs… Good. Now, Lilyanna, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Please do. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I trust your expertise. I understand a physical exam is necessary to determine the cause of this unsteadiness. I just… I hope it isn't anything serious. I’m ready when you are. Perhaps you could explain what you'll be doing as you go along? Just to ease my mind a little?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’d like to check your eyes. Pupils are equal and reactive. Next, I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Okay, close your eyes. Just stand still for a moment. Hmm. Some mild swaying, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, I want you to walk a straight line, heel to toe, for a few steps. Okay, good. A little unsteady, but you’re managing. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Alright, Lilyanna. Everything seems… within normal limits, though your balance is a little off. This doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it does warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: That… that’s a relief to hear, Doctor. Though, I am still rather worried about this unsteadiness. What sort of further investigation do you recommend? Will I need any tests? I’m… I’m not very fond of tests, if I’m honest. But I understand they may be necessary to determine the cause of this problem. I just hope it isn’t something too serious. Perhaps it’s just… stress? Or a vitamin deficiency? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: It could be stress or a vitamin deficiency, yes. But we need to rule out other possibilities first. I recommend a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia. Second, a vitamin B12 and vitamin D level to rule out any deficiencies. And third, an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. The MRI is the most important test, to be frank. It will give us a clear picture of your brain and help us identify any potential problems. I know you're not fond of tests, Lilyanna, but this is the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. It's a non-invasive test, and it will only take about 30 minutes. We'll also need to rule out any issues with the inner ear. I will refer you to an audiologist. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… That sounds… rather daunting, Doctor. Is it… painful? And you mentioned something about the inner ear… what sort of tests would that involve? I must admit, I am growing increasingly anxious about all of this. I understand it’s necessary to determine the cause of the problem, but it’s… unsettling. I suppose I have no choice, if that's what you recommend. But… could you perhaps explain the MRI procedure in more detail? And what are we looking for, specifically? Just to ease my mind a little. I trust your judgment, Doctor, I truly do. But I confess, I’m rather frightened. Perhaps I should bring someone with me for the tests? A friend? Or a relative?
DOCTOR: The MRI is not painful, Lilyanna. It uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will be quite noisy. You’ll need to remain very still during the procedure. It's a bit claustrophobic for some people, but we can provide you with headphones and earplugs. And we'll have a technician monitoring you at all times. As for the inner ear tests, the audiologist will perform a few simple evaluations to assess your hearing and balance. They may also perform a tympanometry test, which measures the movement of your eardrum. It's a quick and painless procedure. We're looking for any structural abnormalities in your brain, such as tumors or lesions. We're also looking for any signs of inflammation or damage to your inner ear. It’s highly unlikely to be anything serious. Yes, it’s perfectly acceptable to bring a friend or relative with you. In fact, I encourage it. It will help to ease your anxiety. I'll write you a referral to the audiologist and schedule the MRI. We’ll get this sorted out. Don’t worry.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that does ease my mind a little. Knowing that someone can come with me is a great comfort. And the explanation of the tests is… helpful. I suppose I should prepare myself for the worst, but I am hoping for the best. I will schedule the tests as soon as possible. And I will let you know if I have any questions or concerns before then. I do appreciate your patience, Doctor. And your expertise. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously. I just… I want to get back to normal, you see. To be able to work without worrying about falling. To be able to live without this constant anxiety. Perhaps… perhaps this will all be over soon.
DOCTOR: That's the goal, Lilyanna. We'll do everything we can to get you back to normal. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will. Thank you again. I suppose… I should be going then? I have a bit of a drive ahead of me.
DOCTOR: Yes, go ahead. Get some rest, and schedule those tests as soon as possible. I'll see you when the results are back.
