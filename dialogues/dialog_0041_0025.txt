DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I want to know more about where my family come from. My people, you know? I hear you can do a test… with spit… to find out? I want to see if that can help me.
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. You're interested in genetic ancestry testing. Yes, that's something we can discuss. It’s not a medical test per se, but it can provide information about your heritage. It involves a saliva sample, you’re right. Before we go further, just to be clear, these tests aren’t always 100% accurate and can sometimes be a bit… complex to interpret. It’s more about giving you a broader picture, and it won’t tell you everything about your family history. But, yes, we can certainly explore that option. Do you have any particular regions you're curious about, or are you just hoping to get a general overview?
PATIENT: Hmm… complex? I don’t want too much trouble. Just… my grandmother, she always talk about the islands. Beautiful islands. She from the Marshall Islands. I think that’s where I want to look. Maybe see if I got family still there? I don’t know much about my grandfather side. Just want to know… you know? I just want to know where I come from.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. It’s wonderful that you're interested in learning about your roots. And you're right to be curious. "Complex" just means the results can sometimes be a little ambiguous, or show mixtures of ancestry. It's not like a simple yes/no answer. So, focusing on the Marshall Islands is a good start. We can order a test specifically geared towards Pacific Islander ancestry, if you'd like. It can give you a percentage breakdown of your likely heritage from different islands, and potentially connect you with distant relatives if they’ve also taken the test. Before we proceed, just so I have a complete picture, do you have any significant health concerns we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Health? Not much, Doctor. Old age, I guess! I get a little tired sometimes, but what old person doesn’t? I got Medicare, if that’s what you mean. No big sicknesses. I try to eat good fish, lots of it. My bones need it. I don’t smoke, never did. And I don’t drink much anymore. Maybe a little beer sometimes with friends. But that’s it. Mostly just… old.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Scobie. That sounds like a very sensible approach to staying healthy. It’s wonderful that you’re active and mindful of your diet. And Medicare is perfectly fine to know. Just to confirm, no history of heart problems, diabetes, or any other major illnesses that run in the family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… hard to say, Doctor. My grandmother, she die old too, but she just… stop. Not much sickness before. My mother, she get a little weak at the end, but the doctor say just old age. My father… he work hard on the boats. He strong, but he die in a storm. I don’t remember anyone having… what you call it… the sugar sickness? Or the heart trouble? I think not. Mostly just strong people, working hard. No, I don’t think so. Nothing much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Mr. Scobie. So, generally good health, no strong family history of major illnesses. Good. Now, about the ancestry test. It typically involves sending a saliva sample to a lab. The results usually take about 4-6 weeks to come back. The cost is around $100-200, depending on the company. Would you like me to go ahead and order the test for you, or would you prefer to think about it a little longer?
PATIENT: Four to six weeks? That’s okay. I got time. And $100, you say? That’s not too bad. Yes, Doctor. Go ahead. Order the test. I want to know where I come from. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the paperwork started. We'll need a bit of information from you – your full name, date of birth, insurance details, and a signature. It’s fairly straightforward. I’m also going to order a basic blood panel just to get a baseline of your current health status while we wait for the ancestry results. Nothing to worry about, just a standard check-up. It'll give us a good starting point for your overall health management. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood test too? You want to know everything, eh? Okay, Doctor, you do what you think is best. I trust you. Just… don’t poke me too much! I don’t like needles. But yeah, do the blood test too. I guess it’s good to know everything. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: I certainly will be, Mr. Scobie. I promise. Our phlebotomist is very skilled and gentle. It's just a small prick, and it’s over quickly. Okay, let me get these orders processed. While I do that, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Routine? Not much to it, Doctor. I wake up, eat some fish and rice. Sit on the porch, watch the people go by. I make small boats out of wood, you know? Sell them to the tourists sometimes. Walk down to the store for groceries. Visit my friends in the afternoon. Eat dinner, watch a little TV. Go to bed. Simple life. Not much excitement. But I like it. Peaceful.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Scobie. A peaceful life is a good life. It’s wonderful that you have hobbies and friends to keep you company. Okay, I’ve got everything I need. The blood test orders are sent to the lab, and I’ll have the ancestry test kit shipped to your address. It should arrive within a week. The kit will have instructions on how to collect the saliva sample. It’s very simple, don’t worry. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You been very helpful. I’m excited to see what the test say. Thank you for ordering it. I appreciate it. Maybe I’ll see you again in a few weeks, when the results come in?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. And yes, please do come back in a few weeks when the results arrive. We can go over them together and discuss what they mean. In the meantime, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your peaceful life.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye now.
