DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be straight with you, a friend of mine suggested I come talk about… preventative things. About staying safe, you know? Something about a pill you can take. I don’t really understand all the details, but she said it could be good. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Helaina! Absolutely, that’s a big part of what I do – preventative care. It’s fantastic you’re thinking about staying healthy. Your friend is likely referring to options like hormone replacement therapy, or perhaps bone density screenings, depending on your age and health history. There are several things we can discuss to help keep you safe and feeling your best. Before we dive into specifics, could you tell me a little more about what concerns you most, or what your friend specifically mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It wasn’t hormone replacement, no. Definitely not that. She kept saying “PrEP.” Something about a pill to… well, to stop you from getting sick if, you know, things happen. She said it was really good, very effective, but I don’t… I don't really know anything about it. She just said I should come talk to someone. I mostly just want to understand if it’s something I should even be thinking about, and if it’s… safe? I'm a bit old fashioned, I suppose. I like to know everything before I agree to anything.
DOCTOR: Ah, PrEP! Yes, that’s pre-exposure prophylaxis. Your friend is right to suggest we talk about it. It’s a very effective medication to prevent HIV, and it's becoming more common as a preventative measure. It’s completely reasonable to want to understand everything before making a decision, and I’m happy to explain it thoroughly. Before we get into the details of PrEP itself, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle and relationships?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work as a parking attendant, mostly. Long hours on my feet. Single, always have been, really. Never found the right person. I… I do date occasionally. Online, mostly. It’s hard meeting people these days. Not a lot of… excitement, let’s say. And, well, that’s about it, honestly. It's pretty quiet. I guess I'm just trying to be careful. That's why my friend suggested this. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Helaina. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re being thoughtful and proactive about your health, which is wonderful. Dating can definitely be…complicated these days! Just to clarify, when you say “careful,” are you concerned about sexually transmitted infections with your dates?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That's it. I mean, you hear stories, don't you? And you can't really know anyone these days, even if you’ve known them for a while. It’s just… unsettling. I want to enjoy myself, but I don’t want to take risks. So yes, STIs are definitely a concern. And if this PrEP thing can help with that… well, I’m willing to listen. But I really want to know how it works. And what the side effects are. I don't want to trade one problem for another.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Those are very valid concerns, and it’s smart to be asking those questions. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a daily pill that contains medications used to treat HIV. When taken consistently, it’s incredibly effective at preventing HIV infection, even if you’re exposed to the virus. Think of it like wearing a seatbelt – it doesn't eliminate all risk, but it significantly reduces the chances of getting seriously hurt. Before we talk about side effects, let’s quickly cover how it works on a biological level. HIV attacks a certain type of immune cell in your body. PrEP medications prevent the virus from establishing an infection if you are exposed. Now, regarding side effects, the most common ones are generally mild. Some people experience nausea, fatigue, or headache, especially in the first few weeks. These usually subside as your body adjusts. We’d monitor your kidney function with regular blood tests while you’re on PrEP, as these medications can sometimes affect kidney function, though it's rare. To get a clearer picture of whether PrEP is right for you, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your sexual history and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Honestly, the kidney thing worries me a bit. My mother had some problems with her kidneys when she was older. But if the side effects are usually mild, that's good. And I understand needing blood tests. Ask away. I'll answer what I can. Just… try not to make it too personal, alright? I'm not comfortable with getting too detailed.
DOCTOR: Of course, I completely understand and respect your boundaries, Helaina. We’ll keep everything as general as you’re comfortable with. No pressure to share anything you don’t want to. Let's start with this: On average, how many sexual partners have you had in the past six months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a bit awkward. Let me think. Um… honestly? Two. Maybe three. It hasn’t been very active, like I said. Just a couple of dates that… went further than coffee. That’s it. And it’s been spread out over the last year, really. Nothing continuous.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful to know, thank you. And have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very careful. I always insist on… protection, when things happen. And I haven’t had anything happen recently enough to worry about it. I suppose. I always figured being careful was enough.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Helaina. It sounds like you’ve been very conscientious about your sexual health. Being careful is a great start, and it’s wonderful that you prioritize protection. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I take a daily vitamin, but that’s it. No prescriptions, no reactions to anything. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose. Although, if this PrEP thing has side effects, maybe my luck is about to change!
DOCTOR: Well, even if you experience some mild side effects, they're usually manageable, and we'd be monitoring you closely. Okay, last few quick questions. Do you have any underlying health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I get a little tired sometimes, but that's just from the work, I think. Parking attendant work is harder than it looks! Blood pressure is fine, according to the doctor at the yearly check-up. And no diabetes or anything like that. I try to eat healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s great news, Helaina. It sounds like you’re in good overall health. Okay, so based on what you’ve told me – your sexual history, no history of STIs, no underlying health conditions, and no known allergies – PrEP could be a very good option for you. Before we proceed, it's important to get some baseline bloodwork to check your kidney function, confirm you’re HIV-negative, and rule out any other underlying health concerns. We'd also need to discuss the importance of consistent medication adherence and regular STI screenings. If the bloodwork comes back normal, we can start you on PrEP. It’s usually a daily pill, but there's also a newer injectable option available. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in exploring further?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. The bloodwork sounds reasonable. I'd rather be safe than sorry, and if everything checks out, I'm willing to try it. The pill sounds easier, honestly. Injections… I don't know. I'm a bit squeamish. So, what happens next? Do I get the bloodwork done here, at the clinic? And how long does it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that. Yes, we can do the bloodwork right here at the clinic. It's just a standard blood draw, and it usually takes about 10-15 minutes. I’ll write you a lab order now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can get you in right away. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and, if everything looks good, start you on PrEP. Do you have any questions about the blood draw process or anything else we've discussed so far?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. It sounds straightforward enough. Just a normal blood draw. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. And you didn’t rush me, which I appreciate. I'll go do the bloodwork now. Let me know if you need anything else.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help. Take your time, and please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions at all. We're here to support you. I'll be in touch as soon as the results come back. Have a good day.
