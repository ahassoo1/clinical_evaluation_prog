DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I am Dr. Bradelee Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Please, call me Nicoletta. Well, to put it simply, I feel… a little run down. I’m getting on in years, you see, and I just want to feel a bit more… myself again. A sort of reset, if you will. A jumpstart to get my energy back. Is that a reasonable thing to ask for?
DOCTOR: A “reset,” you say. While I appreciate the… poetic phrasing, Nicoletta, it's important we define what “run down” means medically. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. I apologize for being… vague. It’s just hard to explain. It’s not any one thing. I tire easily, even after a good night’s sleep, which isn’t as frequent as it used to be! And my joints ache a bit, especially in the mornings. I used to be quite active, you see, gardening and walking, but I don’t have the stamina for it anymore. It’s… a general slowing down, I suppose. And truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Though, at my age, isn’t that to be expected?
DOCTOR: Yes, Nicoletta, some slowing down is typical with age. However, “fatigue,” “joint ache,” and “memory issues” are rather broad complaints. To best assist you, I need a more precise understanding. Let's start with the fatigue. On a scale of one to ten, with one being no fatigue at all and ten being completely debilitating, how would you rate your fatigue on most days?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A scale of one to ten… That’s a bit difficult for me. I don’t often think in numbers. Let me see… I wouldn’t say it’s completely debilitating, no. I can still manage my day, mostly. Perhaps… a six? Yes, a six feels about right. It’s enough to make me choose to not do things, rather than being unable to. It’s a… a lack of enthusiasm, if that makes any sense. I just don't feel like doing much.
DOCTOR: “Lack of enthusiasm” is… descriptive, Nicoletta. I will note that. Now, regarding this fatigue, has anything changed recently that might be contributing to it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. Well, my dear friend, Eleanor, moved away last month. We used to have tea every Tuesday, and I do miss our chats. And the weather's been rather warm, hasn't it? I don't do well in the heat. I tend to stay indoors more when it’s so humid. I suppose… those are the only things that come to mind immediately. Oh! And my grandson, Daniel, started a new job, so I haven’t seen him as often. He’s very busy, which is wonderful for him, of course, but… it's a little quiet around here without him popping over.
DOCTOR: So, recent social changes and the weather. While those factors can certainly contribute to a diminished sense of well-being, we must rule out any underlying medical causes for your fatigue. Now, let’s discuss these joint aches. Where exactly are you experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knees, Doctor. And my hips. They ache when I first get out of bed in the morning, or after I’ve been sitting for a while. It eases up a bit after I move around, but it’s always there, a dull ache, you understand? It's not sharp, not like a sudden injury. Just… old. It feels like old age settling in. Though, I try not to think about that too much.
DOCTOR: "Old," you say. While that may be a comforting explanation, Nicoletta, it’s important we consider possibilities such as osteoarthritis or other inflammatory conditions. Have you experienced any swelling or redness in these joints?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no swelling or redness. Just the ache. And sometimes a bit of stiffness in the mornings, but that goes away fairly quickly once I get moving. I do try to do my exercises, you see, the ones the physical therapist showed me a few years back, but… it's harder to motivate myself these days. It just doesn’t seem to help as much as it used to. I suppose I’m just… getting older.
DOCTOR: I see you previously underwent physical therapy for some knee pain in 2020. Let’s move on to your memory issues. Can you describe what you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, it's nothing too serious, Doctor. Just… forgetting things. Names, mostly. Or where I put my glasses. Or why I walked into a room. Little things like that. It doesn’t happen every day, and I always remember eventually, it just takes a moment longer than it used to. It’s frustrating, of course, but I wouldn’t call it debilitating. My daughter keeps telling me I should write things down, but… I forget to do that too!
DOCTOR: “Frustrating” is understandable, Nicoletta. However, even seemingly minor memory lapses warrant investigation, especially given your age. Do you experience any difficulty with tasks that require planning or problem-solving?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not really, I don't think. I still manage my finances, and I enjoy doing crossword puzzles. It takes me a bit longer to finish them than it used to, perhaps, but I still enjoy them. And I can still follow a recipe when I’m cooking. It’s just… remembering little things, names and places, that seems to be the problem. It’s more embarrassing than anything else, really. I used to have such a good memory!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a quick physical assessment. Blood pressure is 138 over 76. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Pulse is 72, regular rhythm. I will now listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and again… Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are regular. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and range of motion. Please extend your arm for me…
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Oh, that’s a little stiff today. It must be the weather. There we go. Is that alright? It does feel a bit… creaky.
DOCTOR: Knees demonstrate mild crepitus with flexion and extension. Range of motion is slightly limited bilaterally. Hips exhibit some tenderness to palpation, particularly in the groin. No evidence of effusion or warmth in either joint. Based on your symptoms and this brief examination, Nicoletta, it appears you are experiencing age-related changes contributing to fatigue, joint discomfort, and mild cognitive slowing. However, to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I would like to order some routine blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. We’ll also check your sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to assess for inflammation.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood work, you say? Is that very painful? I don't like needles, you see. But if it will help to figure out what's going on, then I suppose I can manage it. When would I need to come back for the results? And will I need to fast beforehand? Oh dear, there are so many questions, aren’t there?
DOCTOR: No, Nicoletta, it is not painful. It's a quick prick, and then it's over. You’ll barely feel it. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. No food or drinks, except for water. As for the results, the lab usually takes a few days to process them. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today. That should give them enough time. We’ll discuss the results and formulate a plan at that time. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, one week from today sounds perfectly acceptable. And fasting… I can manage that. Though I do enjoy my breakfast! So, just no food for eight hours beforehand. And then we’ll talk about the results next week. That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with my questions. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any exercises I should avoid? Perhaps a good book to read while I’m fasting?
DOCTOR: In the interim, continue with your gentle exercises as tolerated. Avoid any activity that exacerbates your joint pain. As for a book… That is beyond the scope of my medical expertise, Nicoletta. However, maintaining social engagement and adequate hydration are always advisable. If your symptoms worsen significantly before our next appointment, do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and your patience. I appreciate you listening to me. One week from today, then. I’ll be sure to fast. And I’ll try to find a good book. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please see the receptionist to schedule your follow-up appointment and obtain the lab requisition form. .
