DOCTOR: Hello Chellsea, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone.
DOCTOR: Cancer… yes, I see. It’s… difficult to remember everything, but I believe I do have some notes here. Could you tell me a little more about what you were told, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Um… they said it was in my… my lung, I think. And that I needed to see someone special. I don’t really remember much else, to be honest. It all happened so fast. I just know it’s… bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly alright if things are fuzzy right now. Lung… yes. And you were referred to me specifically. That's good, that means someone thought a family medicine doctor could help coordinate things. Do you happen to know when you were told about this, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… July, I believe. Maybe the middle of July? Around the time of my husband’s… his memorial. Everything is a bit mixed up, I apologize. It was a very difficult time.
DOCTOR: July, around your husband’s memorial… that certainly explains things being mixed up. My deepest condolences, Chellsea. It’s perfectly alright, truly. We’ll take our time. I see here there is a report from July 18th… a chest X-ray followed by a CT scan. It does show some… a nodule in the right lung. It's small, but it's there. Have you had any symptoms, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… I’ve been… tired a lot, I suppose. More than usual. And I've had a cough, but… I’ve always had a bit of a cough, especially in the mornings. It hasn't been different, not really. Just… there. Is that helpful? I’m not sure what to look for.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a chronic cough… that is helpful, thank you. It’s good you’re trying to recall everything. A chronic cough is common, so the fact it hasn't changed significantly is good to know. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me see. Oh! My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don't really feel hungry much of the time. And… sometimes I get a little short of breath, but I thought that was just… being out of shape. I haven’t been doing much since… well, since my husband passed.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite and shortness of breath… okay. And attributing the shortness of breath to decreased activity is very reasonable. Chellsea, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions, just to get a better picture of things. Have you had any fevers, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fevers… not really. I might have felt a little warm sometimes, but nothing I thought was a fever. Night sweats… no, I don’t think so. And… I think I have lost a little weight, now that you mention it. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t been weighing myself. I haven’t had much reason to. I apologize, I’m not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Chellsea. It's alright not to remember everything. We'll piece it together. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. And… I broke my arm once, when I was younger. Nothing major, I don’t think. My husband… he had heart problems. That’s why… that’s why he… But I haven’t really had much trouble with my health, until… well, until now.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, broken arm… good to know. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband’s heart problems. That must have been incredibly difficult. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she’s still living. She’s healthy, as far as I know. My father passed away when I was young. He… he had diabetes. And my husband’s mother… she had cancer. Breast cancer, I think. That was a long time ago, though. I don't remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother healthy, father with diabetes, husband’s mother with breast cancer… good information. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I've never really had an allergic reaction to anything. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. I apologize, I'm not much help, am I? I'm just… worried.
DOCTOR: You are not not much help, Chellsea. You're doing a great job telling me what you know, and it's alright to be worried. That's perfectly normal. Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and feel your lymph nodes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, I’m just going to listen to your breathing, front and back. Take nice, deep breaths for me. Heart rate is normal, a little elevated, but that's understandable given the circumstances. Lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged, but not significantly. Overall, the exam is within normal limits, but the slightly enlarged lymph nodes warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation…? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… is it bad? I’m sorry, I’m probably asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: It's alright to ask questions, Chellsea, and they're not silly at all. "Further investigation" just means we need to get a little more information to understand what's going on. Based on the imaging and the exam, I'd like to order a few tests. A CT scan of your chest and abdomen, to get a better look at the lungs and see if anything has spread. And a biopsy of the lymph node, to see what's causing the enlargement. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A biopsy…? That sounds… scary. What exactly is a biopsy? And what if… what if it’s bad news? I don’t know if I’m strong enough to hear bad news.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel scared. A biopsy is a small procedure where we take a tiny sample of the lymph node and send it to a lab to be examined under a microscope. It helps us determine exactly what’s causing the enlargement. It is the best way to know for sure what we’re dealing with. And yes, it’s possible the news won’t be good. But knowing what we’re up against is always better, because it allows us to make the best plan of action. I will be with you every step of the way, Chellsea. And we'll take things one step at a time. Would you like me to explain the details of the procedure?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Please explain it to me. The more I know, the… the less scared I’ll be, I think. What does it involve? Will it hurt? How long will it take? I apologize for all the questions.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Chellsea. It's good to ask questions. Okay, so the biopsy itself is usually done as an outpatient procedure. That means you come in and go home the same day. A small area of skin will be numbed with a local anesthetic, so you won't feel any pain during the sample collection. The doctor will make a small incision and remove a tiny piece of the lymph node. You might feel some pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. The whole procedure usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour. After the biopsy, we'll send the sample to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. I will call you as soon as I have them. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail, and make a plan based on the results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes more sense, thank you. So, it’s not a major surgery, it’s just a small sample? And I’ll know soon… a few days? What about Medicare? Will that cover the cost? I don’t have much money, to be honest. Losing my husband… it’s been difficult financially.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s not major surgery, just a small sample. And yes, you'll know within a few days, usually 3-5 business days. Let me check your insurance coverage for you. Okay, it looks like Medicare will cover the cost of the CT scan and the lymph node biopsy. There may be a small co-pay or deductible, depending on your specific plan, but our billing department can help you understand those costs. They are very good at working with patients to make sure they get the care they need. I will write the orders for the CT scan and the biopsy now. The radiology department will call you to schedule the appointments. I will also give you a referral for an oncologist, a cancer specialist, just so we have all our bases covered. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s wonderful, thank you so much, Doctor. An oncologist… that sounds scary, but I understand. Having all our bases covered is… good. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. I think… I think I’m ready to schedule those appointments.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Chellsea. And you're right, it is a little scary, but having an oncologist involved is a good thing. They're experts in their field and can help us make the best decisions for your care. I’ll write down the contact information for the radiology department and the oncologist for you. And I’ll also give you a card with my direct number, so you can reach out with any questions or concerns. Here you go. The radiology department will call you within 24-48 hours to schedule your CT scan, and the oncologist’s office will contact you shortly after to set up a consultation. Please don’t hesitate to call me if you have any questions, Chellsea. I want to make sure you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me right now before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all for now. I’m still processing everything, but you’ve answered all my questions so far. Thank you again, Doctor Kamahele. You’ve been very kind. I… I think I’ll go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Chellsea. And you take care of yourself. Get some rest, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. I'm here for you. Take care, Chellsea.
