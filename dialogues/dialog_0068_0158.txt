DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it's about this… letter. For a pet, you see. Some place wants a letter saying I’m fit to own one. It’s all a bit silly, really. I mean, obviously I’m fit. I’ve had pets before… well, I think I have. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Right, a letter confirming your suitability for pet ownership. And you said you've had pets previously?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, pets. Dogs, I think. Or maybe a cat? It’s… fuzzy. It was before the divorce, definitely. He… he liked animals. Always going on about responsibility and all that. Honestly, I can't remember the specifics. It was just… pets. Normal, everyday things. Why do they even need a letter for this? It's not like I’m applying for a mortgage, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, requirements can be… particular these days. Let’s focus on you, Ms. Wrye. To properly complete this letter, I need a little more information. Just to be thorough. Have you had any significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Medical issues… hmm. Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had a bad back once, years ago. Lifting something heavy, I believe. And… and the usual things, you know? Colds, flu. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty healthy person. I eat alright, I sleep when I can, and I don't go causing trouble. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And just to clarify, when you say "eat alright," are there any dietary restrictions or allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I like my food! I enjoy a good stew, some jollof rice… anything, really. No, no restrictions. Unless you count my daughter trying to get me to eat more vegetables. But that's just her fussing, not an allergy. Honestly, Doctor, I'm very… adaptable when it comes to food.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh! I take something for my… for my joints. Sometimes they ache, you know? Old age, I suppose. A small blue pill. I think. My daughter helps me with those. She puts them in one of those little boxes with the days on it, so I don’t have to worry about it. I really don’t pay much attention, to be honest. Is it important what it is?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. Do you happen to know the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Names aren’t my strong suit. It’s… a little bottle. Blue, like I said. And the pills are… small. Round, I think. She gets it from the pharmacy down the street. It helps with the… the stiffness. That's all I know, really. Honestly, Doctor, I leave the medical things to the professionals. That's you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just one more thing, if you don’t mind. Any significant family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That's a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… well, he was a strong man, always working. I don't recall him being sick much. Lots of uncles and aunts, you see. Too many to keep track of. Honestly, Doctor, we weren't a family that talked about ailments. More interested in… celebrations, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Ms. Wrye. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to be thorough. It’s standard procedure, even for a letter like this. Could you please step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A quick look-see, you say? Fine by me. As long as it doesn’t take too long, I have a hair appointment later. Honestly, I hope I haven’t put on too much weight. It's the stew, you know? It’s just so good.
DOCTOR: 77 kilograms. And your height is listed as 174 centimeters. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Joints feel slightly stiff, as you mentioned. No significant swelling or redness.
PATIENT: Oh, well, that doesn’t sound too bad, does it? A little stiff, you say? That’s just… getting older, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me to do more exercise. Honestly, I prefer a good cup of tea and a sit-down. So, are you going to give me the letter, Doctor? Or do I need to answer more questions about my family’s… celebrations?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye. Based on our conversation and the brief examination, I can confirm that you appear to be in generally good health. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range, and the joint stiffness is likely related to age. This letter states you are medically fit for pet ownership. I would recommend continued monitoring of your blood pressure and discussing potential exercise options with your daughter. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s lovely! Thank you, Doctor. That’s all I needed. A bit of paper to say I'm allowed to have a furry friend. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a fuss over nothing, hasn’t it? No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time. And you have a good day now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. If you have any concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh, I will, Doctor. I will.
