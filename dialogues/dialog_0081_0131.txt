DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's actually S-L-A-V-E-N, Mykeisha Sladen. And, well, the blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, according to the machine at the pharmacy. That's why I made the appointment, really.
DOCTOR: Sladen, yes, my apologies. Pharmacy readings, you say?
PATIENT: No worries at all, Doctor. Yeah, I went a couple of times, just to check, and both times it was up a bit. I don’t usually pay it much mind, to be honest. I’m not one for fussing over numbers if I feel alright, you know? But the pharmacist kept looking at me funny, so I thought I better get it checked out proper.
DOCTOR: "Feeling alright" is a good starting point, certainly. But numbers do matter, Ms. Sladen. It’s best to understand what they mean, even if you feel perfectly healthy. So, can you tell me roughly what those readings were, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The first time, I think the top number was around 140, maybe? And the bottom was… around 90, I think. The second time was similar, maybe a little higher on the top, like 145. I didn't write them down or anything, just remember roughly what the lady said. She kept repeating them, so they stuck in my head a bit. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. Those numbers are… elevated. Now, just to get a better picture, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is all new to me, really. No doctor ever told me anything was wrong with my pressure before. I go to the doctor for my regular check-ups and stuff, but they usually just say I'm doing fine. I’ve never had to worry about this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of hypertension—high blood pressure—or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had something with her heart, I think. She was always a bit sickly, and I remember her taking pills, but I don’t really know what they were for. And my uncle, he had a stroke a few years back. I’m not sure if that's related though. He didn’t take care of himself, always smoking and drinking.
DOCTOR: Family history is important. A stroke can be related to hypertension, but lifestyle factors definitely play a role, as you mentioned. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never have. I can’t stand the smell of it, honestly. My mother always told me it was bad news, so I never even tried it. I drink sometimes, but not much. A glass of wine with dinner maybe, once or twice a week. Nothing crazy.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't say I go to the gym or anything. But I do a lot of walking. I live not too far from town, so I walk to the shops most days. And I help my neighbor with her gardening sometimes, which is good exercise, I suppose. It’s not strenuous or anything, but I keep moving, if you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Now, tell me about your diet. Do you watch what you eat?
PATIENT: Hmm… I try to, but it's hard sometimes. I like to cook, and I eat a lot of Caribbean food, which is delicious, but it can be a bit… heavy, you know? Lots of rice and peas, plantains, things like that. I try to eat my vegetables, but I’m not perfect. I definitely enjoy a good bake sometimes. I don't really eat a lot of processed foods or fast food though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before we move on, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Just the usual pain reliever when I have a headache, but I don’t get them very often. And sometimes vitamins, like Vitamin D in the winter, but that's about it. Nothing regularly. I try to stay away from pills if I can, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It's a quick examination, and it will give us a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m happy to get it checked out. I’m trusting you to figure out what’s going on with me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just follow me over to the examination table. Please have a seat. I'm going to start with your blood pressure, then listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. 152 over 98. A bit elevated, unfortunately. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Not concerning at this moment, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Pulses are regular and present.
PATIENT: Okay. That… doesn't sound very good, does it? Is that bad? What does that mean, a murmur? I don't like the sound of that at all. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Ms. Sladen. A murmur can be many things, and often it’s perfectly harmless—a normal flow of blood through the heart valves. However, given your elevated blood pressure readings, we need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. We should also do an electrocardiogram—an ECG—to look at your heart's electrical activity. And finally, I’d like you to wear a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours to get a better idea of your blood pressure throughout the day and night. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a lot. But, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, that sounds acceptable. I just want to know what’s going on. All these tests sound a bit scary, though. Will they hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I really hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, I understand. But it’s best to be thorough, to get a clear picture. The blood work is a simple prick of the finger—a bit of discomfort, but nothing significant. The ECG involves placing some sticky patches on your chest—no pain involved. And the 24-hour monitor is a small device you wear on your arm—you won’t even notice it most of the time. The results should be back within a few days. Once I have them, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your salt intake, get regular exercise, and manage any stress in your life. These lifestyle changes can have a positive impact on your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that… sounds a little less scary when you explain it like that. No, I think I understand. Reducing salt, exercise, stress… I can definitely try to do that. Just one thing… is there anything I should be worried about? Like, is this something that could lead to a heart attack or a stroke? I’m not trying to be dramatic, but I like to know the worst-case scenario, so I can be prepared.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking these questions, Ms. Sladen. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and other serious health problems. However, it’s important to remember that you haven’t been diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension yet. These tests are to determine if you have a problem and, if so, how best to manage it. The good news is, high blood pressure is often treatable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. We will work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. So it's not a definite heart attack or stroke or anything, just a possibility if it's not treated? And you think we can get it under control with changes and maybe pills if needed? That's good to know. I can definitely try to eat better and walk more. I'm just a bit worried, you know? It's just… I don't want to end up sick. My mother always said taking care of your health is the most important thing. Okay. So, what happens next? Do I schedule the tests now?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's not a definite anything at this point, Ms. Sladen. And yes, high blood pressure is often very manageable with the right approach. We will work together to get it under control. I’m going to have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the blood work and ECG for you. She’ll also explain how to use the 24-hour blood pressure monitor. She's very efficient and will explain everything clearly. Do you have any other questions for me before I let Sarah in?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, and you've put my mind at ease a bit. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not brushing me off. Some doctors just tell you what's wrong and don't explain anything. Okay. Let me know when Sarah comes in, and I’ll let her take over. I’m sure she'll get everything sorted out for me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sladen. I'm glad I could help. It’s important to me that my patients understand their health and feel comfortable asking questions. I’ll just go and let Sarah know you're ready. Sarah?
