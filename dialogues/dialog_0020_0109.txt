DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for... maybe three days now. Not real bad, but… always there. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for about three days. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it don’t come and go real fast. Just… stays. I try to ignore it, but it makes it hard to think sometimes. I used to work with the trains, you know? Lots of noise. Maybe that has something to do with it? I was a rail yard man, a dinkey operator… hostlers too. Lots of different things. But I’m retired now. Old man.
DOCTOR: Retired rail yard work... that could be relevant, yes. We'll definitely explore that. And just to clarify, when you say it makes it hard to think, can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well... it's not like I forget things. I remember everything, you know? Dates, names… everything. But… focusing is hard. Like… if I try to read, my mind wanders. Or if someone is talking, I have to really try to listen. Not that I don't want to, you know? Just… hard. It’s like… a fog. Not a bad fog, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty with concentration, a sort of “foggy” feeling… not memory loss, but trouble maintaining focus. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache and difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really. I sleep okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m an old man. I eat… okay. Not much appetite lately, but that could be the heat. It’s been very hot, you know? No dizziness. No… seeing things. No blurry vision. Just… the headache and the foggy thinking. Oh! And sometimes my neck feels stiff. But not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in sleep, vision, or balance. Reduced appetite, possibly related to the heat. And occasional neck stiffness along with the headache and difficulty concentrating. Have you had any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. Not sick to my stomach, no. Just… tired. Like I said, old man tired. This headache… it worries me a little, you know? I don’t like feeling like my mind isn’t working right. Even if it's just a little bit. My wife… she always took care of me when I felt sick. But she’s… gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely reasonable to be concerned when you notice changes, especially when you're used to feeling well. And it’s especially hard when you don’t have someone to lean on. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Brum. Now, regarding your medical history… have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Never been sick much of anything. Always been strong. I worked hard, you know? Trains… lots of lifting, lots of walking. Never a sick day if I could help it. No blood pressure. No sugar sickness. Just… old. And I don't take any pills, Doctor. Never have. Don't like them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, and you don't take any medications. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Not even as a kid. Just a few scrapes and bruises from working on the trains, but nothing serious. My wife… she had her gallbladder out once, but I didn’t. I’m a strong man. Always been lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. And just to be complete, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any allergies. Not to food. Not to… bees or anything. Nothing. My wife was allergic to cats, but I wasn't. Can't think of a thing I’m allergic to. Though, sometimes dust makes me cough. But that's just dust, you know? Everyone coughs in the dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, only a mild cough with dust exposure. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family… Do you know of any family members who have had similar headaches, neurological problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a hard one, Doctor. My family... we didn't talk much about sickness. My father... he worked on the railroad too. Strong man, but he died young. Heart trouble, I think. My mother… she died old. Just… wore out. Never heard of any headaches or anything like that. My wife's family… they lived far away. Didn't see them much. Can't say I know of anyone with headaches. Mostly just… strong people who worked hard and died old.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of similar headaches or neurological problems. Thank you for that. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she tried it once, when she was young. Didn't like it. Said it made her cough. I always told her it was bad for her. Always been good about my health, you know? Always been careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not much of a drinker. A little beer sometimes, with dinner, when I was younger. But not much. My wife didn’t like it. So I didn’t either. Didn't want to upset her. Not much point in drinking alone, you know? Mostly just drank water with my meals. Always been good about staying hydrated, especially working on the trains. Lots of sweating in the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, minimal alcohol consumption. One last question about your social habits - are you currently working, or are you retired?
PATIENT: Retired, Doctor. Been retired for… oh, maybe fifteen years now. Used to be a rail yard man, dinkey operator, hostler... lots of different things with the trains. Now… I mostly just stay home. Read the paper. Watch TV. Sometimes I go to church. Mostly just… quiet. It gets lonely sometimes. But... that's okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired and mostly stay at home. Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Brum. That gives me a good picture of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological exam to assess your strength, coordination, and balance. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just tell me if it hurts or anything. I'm an old man, but I can still feel things, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Another deep breath… and out… His heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. This won’t hurt much, just a quick tap. Reflexes are a little bit diminished, but still present. And finally, I’m going to check your strength and coordination. Can you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Squeezing… like this? Not as strong as I used to be, you know? But I can still do it. Used to lift heavy things with the trains… lots of work. I’m squeezing as hard as I can right now.
DOCTOR: Strength is a little bit diminished, as you said, but symmetrical. Coordination is intact. And finally, I’ll check your gait. Would you mind walking a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Walking… Just a few steps… like this. Not as steady as I used to be. Gets harder when you get old, you know? Balance ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. That was very helpful. Overall, your exam shows some expected age-related changes – slightly diminished reflexes and strength, and a slightly unsteady gait. However, there are no gross neurological deficits. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you are experiencing headaches with difficulty concentrating and occasional neck stiffness. Given your age and history, several possibilities could be contributing to this. It could be something as simple as tension headaches related to stress or muscle strain, or it could be something more serious. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? I don't like tests. Are they going to hurt? I’m an old man, you know? Don’t bounce back as quick as I used to. I just want to feel better… that’s all. Tell me what you need to do. I trust you, but I don’t want anything complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. I wouldn’t recommend anything unnecessary. The tests I’m thinking about are relatively simple. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. I also recommend a CT scan of your head, just to rule out any structural problems. The blood test is just a simple prick of the finger or a draw from your arm. The CT scan is a painless imaging test that takes a few minutes. You'll lie on a table while a machine takes pictures of your head. It doesn’t hurt at all. These tests will help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A scan… of my head? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? You think there’s something wrong with my brain? I'm an old man. It could just be… old age, couldn’t it? I don’t like the sound of that scan. But… if you think it’s necessary… I guess I’ll do it. But please… tell me everything. Don’t hide anything from me. I trust you. I just want to know what’s going on. And I don't want any unnecessary tests. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Brum. It’s perfectly normal to be worried when you hear about a scan. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was necessary to get a clear understanding of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong. A CT scan helps us rule out things like bleeding, tumors, or other structural problems that could be causing your headaches. It’s a precautionary measure. We need to rule out the serious things before we can determine if it's something less concerning, like tension headaches or age-related changes. I promise to explain everything to you in detail, every step of the way. I won’t hide anything from you. And if the scan comes back normal, we’ll explore other possible causes and focus on managing your symptoms. We'll take it one step at a time. So, if you’re comfortable with it, I’ll order the blood tests and the CT scan. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or anything else?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Blood tests… I guess I can handle that. And the scan… if you think it’s necessary. Will it take long? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And who will tell me the results? You? I want to talk to you when I find out. Not some… nurse or something. You’ve been very kind to me. I want to hear it from you. And… will it cost a lot of money? I don’t have much money, you know. Just… social security. I don’t want to get a big bill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. Let me address each of your questions. The blood tests will only take a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. They’ll make it as quick and painless as possible. As for the CT scan, it usually takes about 15-20 minutes, including the preparation time. I will personally review the results and discuss them with you in detail. I won’t delegate that to anyone else. I want to make sure you understand everything and feel comfortable with the plan. Regarding the cost, I understand your financial situation. Let me check if there are any financial assistance programs available. I can also talk to the billing department to see if we can work out a payment plan. I don’t want the cost to be a barrier to your care. I’ll have my assistant schedule the blood tests and the CT scan for you. She’ll also provide you with information about the financial assistance programs. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Financial help... that would be good. Very good. I… I think that's all for now. Just… please tell me everything. Don't hide anything. And… thank you. You've been very kind to an old man. It's… nice to have someone who listens. I guess I’ll let your assistant schedule the tests. And… I’ll wait to hear from you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. And you can rest assured, I will tell you everything, every step of the way. I understand your concerns, and I want to work with you to get to the bottom of this. My assistant will be right in to schedule the tests and provide you with the necessary information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Brum. I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: Nice to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you again. I'll see you soon.
