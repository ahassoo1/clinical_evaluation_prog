DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I suppose I am here about… my skin. It’s gotten rather…dark. And I tire easily. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this, Doctor. Is this going to be a lengthy process? My wife is expecting me for tea.
DOCTOR: I understand you're concerned about changes to your skin and feeling more tired than usual, and that you have time constraints. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these changes to your skin?
PATIENT: Goodness, when didn’t I notice? It’s been… gradual. Perhaps a few months? It’s difficult to say. I don’t spend my days examining myself, Doctor. I have work to do. Reinforcing iron doesn’t build itself, you know. Is it absolutely necessary to pinpoint the exact date? It feels… darker, that's all. And the fatigue… always lingering.
DOCTOR: I understand it's been gradual and pinpointing an exact date isn't easy. That’s alright; a general timeframe is helpful. When you say "darker," can you describe what you mean?
PATIENT: Darker as in… not pale. Like… tanned, perhaps? Though I haven’t been in the sun, mind you. It’s simply… a discoloration. A rather unpleasant one, I might add. Are you a medical doctor or an art critic? Because frankly, describing skin tones feels… beneath me.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was unclear, Mr. Drahota. I’m trying to understand the specific nature of the changes you’ve noticed. Is it a uniform darkening all over, or are there specific areas that are more affected?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor! Honestly. It’s not as if I have patches of white! It's… a general dullness, accompanied by this perpetual weariness. It’s quite bothersome. And I’ve told you, I haven’t been basking in the sun. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. A man in my profession must be… presentable. Are we getting anywhere with this or am I wasting my time?
DOCTOR: Okay, a uniform darkening all over, with fatigue. And no recent sun exposure. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the skin darkening and tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, what kind of symptoms are we discussing? I feel…old, Doctor. Is that a symptom? I ache a bit, naturally. I'm eighty-five years old. And I get… forgetful. Though I distinctly remember telling you I haven't much time. Perhaps a bit of dizziness now and then. Is that helpful? I honestly can’t recall anything particularly noteworthy beyond that. This is all rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some aching, forgetfulness, and occasional dizziness in addition to the skin changes and fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite? Hmm… I suppose I haven't been eating as heartily as usual. My wife does most of the cooking, and she's been making smaller portions. Said I wasn't finishing my plate. As for weight… I haven’t stepped on a scale in decades, Doctor. What does it matter? I feel… lighter, perhaps. But that could simply be the exhaustion. Frankly, I’m not one to obsess over such trivialities.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite with smaller portions, and possibly some weight loss. Now, have you had any problems with your bowel movements or noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you attempting to gather details for a… a biographical account? I find your line of questioning quite… intrusive! Must you delve into such personal matters? I assure you, my digestive system is functioning perfectly adequately. And no, there has been absolutely no… blood. This is becoming rather upsetting. I think I’ve answered enough questions. Is there a diagnosis? Or am I simply to be interrogated for the remainder of the afternoon? I have tea to attend! .
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Mr. Drahota. I assure you, I’m only trying to gather enough information to understand what might be causing your symptoms. Given your symptoms—the darkening skin, fatigue, decreased appetite, and possible weight loss—along with your age, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll also need to order some blood work to check for potential underlying causes. Would that be acceptable?
