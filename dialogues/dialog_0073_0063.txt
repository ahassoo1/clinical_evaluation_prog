DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my back. Real bad pain. It started, oh, maybe three, four days ago? It just… got worse and worse. It feels like something is stuck, or broken, maybe? I don’t know. It’s hard to even stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Three or four days ago, and progressively worsening. And you describe it as feeling "stuck" or potentially broken... I see. Can you pinpoint where exactly the pain is located?
PATIENT: Right… here. Not my sides, not my hips. Right in the middle. And it goes down a little bit, to my… bottom, I guess you’d say. Not my legs, though. Just the bottom of my back. It hurts when I try to bend over, or even twist a little. Even coughing makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, mid-lower back, radiating slightly to the buttocks, not the legs. Aggravated by bending, twisting, and coughing. And just to clarify, is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… both, I think. It started as a dull ache, but when I do move, it gets really sharp. Like a stabbing. And then it goes back to the ache when I’m just sitting. It's a mean pain, Doctor. It doesn’t let up much. You know... I have the cancer, too. Is this... is this from that?
DOCTOR: I see. And you’re currently undergoing treatment for cancer, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am. They’re… doing what they can. But it's the pain, you know? It’s always something. They said the treatment might have side effects, but I didn't think it would hurt this much. It’s… different than the other pain from the cancer. That one is more… everywhere, if that makes sense? This is just… right here.
DOCTOR: Right. It's helpful to differentiate this pain from the pain associated with your cancer treatment. And to be clear, we need to determine the source of this new back pain independently. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No numbness. No tingling. And my legs feel… normal, I think. They hurt a little from standing, but that’s just… me. Old age, maybe? No, I can walk okay. I can even climb the stairs, slow, but I can do it. It’s just… the hurting. That’s the problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. No neurological symptoms, which is reassuring. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Besides the cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had the usual… colds, the flu. High blood pressure, for a while, but the pills keep that under control. And… arthritis in my hands, a little bit. But that’s about it. Nothing major. I used to be really strong, you know? Worked hard all my life. This… this back pain is new. And scary. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and some arthritis in your hands. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication, and do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: I take the pills for the blood pressure, like I said. And… the cancer medicine, of course. They gave me something for the nausea, but I don’t use it much anymore. I got used to it, I guess. Allergies… hmm. I think I’m allergic to penicillin, but that was a long time ago. When I was a kid, maybe? My mother always told me to stay away from it. I don’t remember exactly, but that’s what she said. Nothing else, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy noted, though a remote history. We will confirm that on your chart. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to have you lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with some simple range of motion tests and I’ll palpate your back to assess for tenderness and muscle spasm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds fine. Range of motion… is that bending and twisting? I’m not so good at bending, but I can try. Whatever you need. I just want to feel better, you know? This pain is… wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Yes, bending and twisting. Just go slowly, and let me know if anything causes significant pain. Alright, if you could just lie flat on your stomach for me, please. We’ll start by feeling around in your back. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Okay. That's a little sore just laying down, Doctor. But I’m okay. Go ahead. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noticing tenderness right here, along your spine. And there is some muscle spasm present on both sides. No step-off deformity noted. Range of motion is limited in all directions, particularly with forward flexion. And I don’t detect any neurological deficits at this time. Can you tell me specifically what movement causes you the most pain?
PATIENT: Ugh… That… that right there. That’s the worst. And bending over… trying to touch my toes… forget it. Just thinking about it hurts. It feels like something is locked up, you know? And twisting to the side is bad, too. It’s like a… a sharp stab. But that spot, right where you’re touching… that’s the worst of it. It feels… deep. Not just the muscle, like something inside.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep pain, localized tenderness. We will need to rule out a few things. Given your history of cancer, and the nature of the pain, it's prudent to obtain some imaging. I’d like to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine to assess for any fractures or other structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If it helps find out what’s going on. An X-ray… will it show if it’s the cancer? Is that what you’re checking for? I'm a little scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: An X-ray will show us if there are any bony abnormalities, like fractures or signs of instability. It won't definitively tell us if the cancer has spread to your spine, but it’s a good starting point. If the X-ray is inconclusive, we may need to consider further imaging, such as an MRI, which provides a more detailed view of the soft tissues and bone marrow. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes… more sense. X-ray first, then maybe an MRI if we need to see more. Okay. I understand. I just… I really hope it’s not the cancer. It's always something, isn’t it? What do I do after the X-ray? Do I just wait?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll start with the X-ray. We’ll get that ordered right now, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms. It won’t solve the problem, but it should provide some temporary relief. We'll also need to rule out any other possible causes. Do you have any other medical conditions that might be related to this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else that I can think of. I told you, high blood pressure and the arthritis, but that's it. I don't have any… problems with my kidneys or anything like that. And I don't smoke or drink, never have. Just this pain. And the cancer. It feels like a cloud hanging over me, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. I'm also going to order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any other potential causes. We'll review the results of the X-ray and blood work together and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity and try to rest as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you explained everything pretty clearly. Just… when will I hear about the X-ray? And what if it is something bad? I’m just scared, to be honest. I don't want this to be… more cancer.
DOCTOR: You will receive a call from the radiology department to schedule your X-ray. Once the images are taken, the radiologist will review them, and the results will be sent to me. I anticipate having the results within 24 to 48 hours, and I will contact you immediately to discuss them. If the X-ray reveals any abnormalities, we will discuss further testing and treatment options. It's important to remember that we don’t know what's causing your pain yet, and we need to gather more information before we can make any definitive conclusions. I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that we will work together to develop the best possible plan for your care. Do you want me to write down the numbers for the radiology department?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be… helpful. Just in case I forget. It's been hard to remember things lately. And thank you. For explaining everything and… not rushing me. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Here you go. And you’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. We'll take this one step at a time. Now, let me just finalize the prescriptions for the muscle relaxant and pain reliever, and we’ll get those sent to your pharmacy. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again. You’ve been… really kind. I’ll call when I get the appointment for the X-ray. And I hope… I hope it’s nothing bad.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. Take your time getting dressed, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day.
