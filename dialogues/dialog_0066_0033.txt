DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… honestly, I’d rather not be here. It’s just… things aren’t working properly, you see. My vision… it’s gone blurry, and sounds are… muffled. It all happened quite suddenly. I have very important things to attend to, so if we could just… get on with it, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’d like to get straight to the point, Ms. Julie. Sudden changes in vision and hearing are definitely something we need to look into. To help me figure out what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, do I have to? Dates… details… they simply slip my mind these days. It was… a few days ago, perhaps? I was at a luncheon, a very important luncheon with the ladies, and I noticed everything seemed… distant. The conversation was a blur, and then the sights… well, they weren’t as sharp as they should be. Honestly, it was terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand it's frustrating to recall specifics, Ms. Julie. "A few days ago" is a good start. Was this change in vision and hearing gradual, or did it happen all at once during the luncheon?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. Must you interrogate me like this? It was… sudden. Abrupt. One moment everything was perfectly acceptable, the next, it wasn’t. It wasn’t a slow fading, if that’s what you’re implying. Honestly, I have a very good memory for important things, and this was… unsettlingly quick. Now, is there something you can do about it? I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Okay, sudden onset is important to know. And I apologize if my questions seem tedious – I just need to gather all the information I can to help you. Now, has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. I take excellent care of myself. I eat properly, I get enough rest… well, as much as one can with all my social obligations, of course. This is… unprecedented. Honestly, I suspect it’s just… a temporary affliction. Probably stress. Now, can we move this along?
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, Ms. Julie, do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! What do you mean, “other symptoms”? I feel… unwell, naturally. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be wasting my time here. Is that what you’re asking? I haven’t been feeling quite myself, a little… off. But I assure you, Doctor, I’m not prone to dramatics. It's probably just this… disruption. Honestly, I can't imagine why it's taking so long.
DOCTOR: Okay. "A little off" is helpful. Can you describe that feeling more specifically?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly! It’s… difficult to explain. A general sense of… malaise. Perhaps a slight… dizziness? Nothing dramatic, mind you. And a bit of a headache, though I suspect that’s from all the questioning. Honestly, I’m not a medical professional, I wouldn’t know the proper terminology. It simply feels… unpleasant. Can we please get to the examination now? I have a very important charity event to attend this evening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. I understand your frustration, and we'll move onto the physical exam. Just a few quick questions first, to rule out anything serious. Do you have any ringing in your ears, or any pain in your ears?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting to the tedious part, are we? Honestly, Doctor, the thought of poking and prodding… It's simply barbaric. Ringing? Perhaps a little… a faint hum, if you must know. And a slight ache, a dull throb, nothing to write home about. Honestly, I’ve endured far worse at the salon. Can we just… begin? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a faint hum and a dull throb. And you mentioned a headache - where is the headache located?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's all over! It's not localized, Doctor. It's… a general throbbing sensation. Around my head, primarily. It comes and goes, really. It's probably just tension. Honestly, I have a very active social life, you know. So many engagements, so many people to see. It’s bound to cause a little… stress. Now, are you going to examine me or are we going to continue this endless interrogation?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. I understand. Let’s move on to the exam. I'm going to check your ears, your vision, and do a quick neurological assessment, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Okay, your ear canals appear clear, and your eardrums look normal. There's no sign of infection or fluid buildup. Now, let’s check your vision. Can you follow my finger as I move it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I have perfectly adequate vision. I can see just fine. I attend the opera, you know. And the theatre. I wouldn’t be able to enjoy those things if my vision was impaired. Just… get on with it. I’m sure it’s nothing serious. A temporary inconvenience, perhaps. Now, what's next? I haven’t got all day to be poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your confidence in your vision, Ms. Julie. But sometimes even seemingly minor changes can indicate an underlying issue. I'm just going to check your peripheral vision, and then we'll do a quick balance test. It's just a standard part of the exam. Okay, I'm noticing some slight difficulty with your peripheral vision on both sides, and your balance is a little unsteady. Nothing alarming, but it warrants further investigation. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you? All this poking and prodding is simply undignified. I assure you, my heart is perfectly fine. I lead a very active life, as I’ve mentioned. And my lungs… well, I don’t smoke, if that’s what you’re implying. Honestly, I’m beginning to feel quite faint. Can we perhaps speed things along? I really must get home to prepare for my event. It's a charity gala, you know. A very important one. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Okay. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm and your breath sounds are a little quiet. Your reflexes are also a bit slower than expected. Given these findings, and the changes in your vision and hearing, I think it's important to do some further testing to figure out what’s going on. I want to order a CT scan of your brain and some blood work, just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
