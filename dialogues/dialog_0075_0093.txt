DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. Look, to be honest, I don't really do details, alright? My wife… she used to handle all this stuff. But she's… not around anymore. Anyway, the paperwork said something about sleep and getting… fitter? That sounds right. I just feel… blah, most of the time. Not exactly tired, just… not on. Does that make sense? It’s probably nothing, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Chanz. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now, and that things are difficult. It’s good you came in. “Blah” is a perfectly valid way to describe feeling unwell. Let’s try to get a little more information so I can understand what’s going on. You mentioned feeling not "on." Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, "not on"... it’s like… everything takes effort. Getting out of bed, even. I used to just jump up, ready to go. Now? It's like wading through mud. And I don't have the energy to do much. My work… repairing instruments, that’s alright, because it’s quiet, you know? But even that feels… heavy sometimes. Socializing? Forget about it. I just… sit. A lot. It’s not sadness, exactly. Just… empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, wading through mud and feeling empty... that gives me a better picture. And it sounds like this has been impacting your energy levels and motivation. How long have you been feeling this way, Chanz?
PATIENT: Honestly? I couldn’t put a date on it. It’s been… a while. After… well, after my wife passed, things just sort of… blurred. It’s probably been over a year, easily. Maybe longer. Time doesn’t really mean much these days. I just sort of… exist, you know? And it’s not getting worse, exactly. Just… consistently… this.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely normal to feel disoriented and have a distorted sense of time after a significant loss. It's good you're recognizing this has been ongoing for over a year. To help me understand if there's anything else contributing, let's do a quick review of your health. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Not really. Had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. Illnesses… the usual colds and flu, I guess. Nothing major. I used to be pretty robust, actually. Didn't even think about doctors unless it was something broken. My wife was the hypochondriac in the family, always getting checkups. I just… avoided it. Honestly, I can’t remember the last time I was truly sick, sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries or illnesses. That’s good to know. And it sounds like you generally have been quite healthy in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Not a fan of pills, never have been. My wife… she had a whole cabinet full of them. Vitamins, maybe, sometimes? She’d try to get me to take those. But I’d usually forget. Or just… not bother. I get by on coffee, mostly. Black coffee. Lots of it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Black coffee… noted. Alright, Chanz. And no allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My wife was the picky eater, always checking labels. I just… ate. Never had any reactions or anything. Dust maybe? But everyone sneezes a bit in the spring, right? Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family’s health history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. That’s a tough one. My wife’s family was… complicated. Lots of little things, you know? High blood pressure, a bit of diabetes here and there. My side… my parents were pretty healthy, I think. Lived a long life. My grandfather had something with his heart, maybe? Honestly, I don't really… keep track of that sort of thing. It’s all a bit of a blur. Does it really matter?
DOCTOR: It can matter, Chanz, but I understand it's difficult to recall. We can skip it for now if you prefer, and perhaps revisit it later. Let's talk about your daily routine for a moment. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: A typical day… Well, I wake up. Eventually. Coffee. Lots of coffee. I go to the workshop. Repair instruments. Quietly. Lunch is usually something simple - a sandwich, maybe. More coffee. Back to work. I come home. Sit. Watch TV. Maybe read. Go to bed. Eventually. Repeat. It’s… not exciting, to say the least. And it’s all very… slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet routine centered around your work. And it sounds like you spend a significant amount of time sitting. Do you exercise at all, or do any kind of physical activity?
PATIENT: Exercise? Ha. No. Not really. I walk to the workshop, that's about it. It’s not exactly a marathon. Used to enjoy gardening, a long time ago. But… haven't really felt up to it lately. Too much effort, you know? Honestly, I'm more likely to find something to sit on than something to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just routine things – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general physical condition. It will help me get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m not a fan of doctors, but… I’m here, aren't I? Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular, and lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Throat is clear, ears look normal. I'm also going to check your weight and height. You're 190 centimeters and 105 kilograms. Overall, your physical exam doesn't reveal anything immediately concerning, but the elevated blood pressure and weight are things we should address.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, huh? Figures. Probably all the coffee. And the… everything. Look, I’m not exactly surprised. I’m not exactly a picture of health, am I? So, what does this mean? Pills? I really don’t want pills.
DOCTOR: Not necessarily pills, Chanz. It’s good you brought that up. Elevated blood pressure, combined with your weight, can contribute to a lot of things, but it's often manageable with lifestyle changes. We can discuss those first, and see how you do. I'd like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and to get a baseline understanding of your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… Ugh. Fine. As long as it doesn’t involve a lot of poking and prodding. And you promise no lectures about diet and exercise? I mean, I know I should probably be doing more, but… it’s just… hard. Really hard.
DOCTOR: No lectures, I promise. I understand it's hard, and my job isn't to scold, but to support you. The blood work will give us some information, and then we can talk about realistic steps, if you’re open to it. We can take it one step at a time. I'll order the blood work now. It will check your complete blood count, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. You can have it done at the lab across the street. They’ll need a requisition form, which I’ll print for you. In the meantime, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: Vitamin D… Honestly, I haven’t seen the sun properly in months. No, I don’t think there’s anything else. Just… this general blah-ness. And the feeling of being… stuck. I guess that’s it. Just… stuck.
DOCTOR: "Stuck" is a very powerful word, Chanz. And I understand that feeling. We can certainly address that, and the blood work will help us figure out if there are any underlying physical factors contributing to it. Let’s focus on the basics for now. I’ll give you the requisition form for the blood work. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you’re feeling overwhelmed or having difficulty coping, I can provide you with some resources for mental health support. Here’s the form. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. Just… try not to find anything too awful, alright? I’ve had enough bad news lately. I’ll… I’ll get the blood work done. And I guess I’ll see you again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. We'll take things one step at a time. Don't worry, we'll address whatever we find. And remember, I'm here to support you, not to judge. You can make the appointment for the follow-up on your way out at the reception desk. Please feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Thank you for coming in today, Chanz. Take care of yourself. .
