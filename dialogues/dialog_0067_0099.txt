DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pfennig. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, I believe, and they weren’t quite right. The clinic called and said I should come in to discuss them. It was something about my… digestive system, I think? An “endo” test, they called it. I’m a little unclear on the specifics, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis. That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you had an endoscopy – a procedure where we look at your digestive system with a camera. And you received some results back that we need to discuss. Let’s go through this together. To start, can you tell me a little more about why you had the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, for the past few months, I’ve been having some… discomfort. Not pain, exactly, but a persistent feeling of fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much. And a little bit of… well, I suppose you could call it queasiness. It comes and goes, but it’s been enough to worry me. My primary care doctor thought it best to investigate, and she ordered the test. She mentioned something about ruling things out, but I didn’t want to bother her with too many questions at the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s a very reasonable approach – to get it checked out. Fullness and queasiness are certainly symptoms worth investigating. So, this has been going on for a few months, and it's not really pain, but more of a persistent fullness and queasiness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Perhaps three, maybe four months now. It’s not constant, thankfully. Some days I feel perfectly normal, and other days… well, it’s just there. Like something is…off. It doesn’t interfere with my daily life too much, but it’s unsettling. And, truthfully, it’s been worrying me more and more lately. I find myself thinking about it quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I’ve tried to pay attention to that, actually. At first, I thought it might be something I was eating – perhaps a certain spice or a particular type of vegetable. But I haven’t been able to identify any clear link. It seems to happen…randomly. Though, now that I think about it, it might be a little worse after I’ve been standing for a long time. I do a fair amount of metalwork, you see, and I'm often on my feet for hours. But even then, it’s not a consistent correlation. It’s… confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand – it sounds frustrating when it’s not clear what’s causing it. The fact that it might be worse after standing for long periods is helpful information. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, I must confess. But I don’t think so. If anything, I’ve perhaps lost a very small amount, but I attribute that to the warmer weather. It’s been quite hot lately, and my appetite hasn’t been quite as robust. I haven’t noticed any significant changes in my clothing, or anything like that. I’m generally a fairly… slender build, you see. Perhaps 58 kilograms, give or take. It’s difficult to say with certainty, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant weight loss. That’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? I suppose it’s necessary, though, if we’re trying to understand what’s going on. Um… yes, actually. I’ve noticed… a little less regularity lately. Not diarrhea, exactly, but… less frequent. And sometimes… a little more difficult to pass. It’s not severe, mind you, but it’s noticeable. And the color hasn’t been quite right either. A little paler than usual, I think. I haven’t paid particularly close attention to it, if I'm honest. It’s not something I normally dwell on.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Denis. It’s important information, and you're right, it's not always easy to discuss. And it's good you’re being so thorough with your answers. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no blood. And no… tarry stools, as you say. That hasn't happened. I was quite concerned when I first started experiencing the discomfort, and I've been… discreetly checking, if you understand my meaning. I haven't seen anything like that. That would be… very alarming. So, no, no blood or tarry stools. I am relieved to say that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Denis. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was younger, perhaps thirty years ago, but I recovered fully. And I’ve always had slightly high blood pressure, but it’s generally well-controlled with diet and exercise. My primary care doctor monitors it regularly. Other than that… no, nothing significant. I’ve always been quite… robust, if I may say so myself. I’ve always been a very active person, and I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Though, I haven’t been feeling quite as energetic lately, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past and slightly high blood pressure, well-controlled. Good. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any need for them, thankfully. I’ve always been rather… careful, you see. I take precautions, and I avoid unnecessary risks. I’ve always been of the opinion that if something isn’t broken, you shouldn’t fix it. So, no, no surgeries. I’ve managed to avoid them thus far, and I hope to continue to do so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated. My family… well, we don’t have a strong tradition of discussing medical matters, if I’m honest. My parents passed away some time ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to my siblings. I know my father had some issues with his stomach, but I don’t recall the specifics. And my mother… she passed away from a heart condition, I believe. But beyond that… I don’t have much information. It’s not something we ever talked about, really. I apologize for my lack of detail. It’s not that I’m deliberately withholding information, it’s simply that I don’t have much to share.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. It’s very common for families not to discuss these things. We’ll work with what we have. And finally, let's talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I can eat just about anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I don’t take any medications regularly, other than a small dose of a blood pressure tablet, as I mentioned earlier. Occasionally, I’ll take something for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing ongoing. I pride myself on being rather… resilient, if I may say so myself. I’ve always been a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies and only a blood pressure tablet occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about the endoscopy results. I’ve pulled them up here. The report indicates some mild inflammation in your stomach and duodenum – that’s the first part of your small intestine. And there were a few small polyps found. They were small enough that we didn’t need to remove them during the procedure, but we’ll want to monitor them. The biopsy results show no signs of cancer, which is excellent news. However, the inflammation suggests something is irritating your digestive tract. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Inflammation… and polyps. That doesn’t sound… pleasant. Polyps, I’ve heard of those. My aunt, she had some removed years ago. But no cancer, you say? That is… a relief, truly. Very good news. So, something is irritating my digestive tract? What could that be? Is it something I’m eating? Or… something else? And what does “monitoring” entail? Will I need more tests? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. It’s just… a little unnerving to hear all this.
DOCTOR: You have every right to be anxious, Denis, and please, ask as many questions as you need. It’s my job to explain everything clearly. The inflammation could be caused by a number of things. The most common causes are Helicobacter pylori – a type of bacteria – or certain medications like NSAIDs – nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen or naproxen. Sometimes, it can be caused by diet, or even stress. We'll need to do a test to check for H. pylori. As for the polyps, they are quite common, and most are harmless. However, some can develop into cancer over time, which is why we want to monitor them. "Monitoring" in this case means repeating the endoscopy in a few years to see if they've grown or changed. Since you aren’t taking any NSAIDs, we’ll start with a stool test to see if H. pylori is present. If that’s positive, we can treat it with antibiotics. If it’s negative, we may consider further testing, such as a blood test to rule out celiac disease, or an allergy panel. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… somewhat more sense. H. pylori… that sounds unpleasant as well. And antibiotics… I suppose that’s manageable. A stool test… that’s not too daunting. So, we're starting with the stool test to check for the bacteria. And if that's negative, we'll consider other possibilities, like celiac disease or allergies. You mentioned celiac disease… is that something that could cause these symptoms? And what sort of allergies are we looking at? Food allergies, specifically? I apologize for the barrage of questions, Doctor, but I’d rather be informed than in the dark.
DOCTOR: You're not barraging me with questions at all, Denis. It’s good you're being proactive and want to understand what’s going on. Yes, celiac disease could cause these symptoms. It’s an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten – a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It damages the small intestine, leading to inflammation and malabsorption of nutrients. The symptoms can include fullness, queasiness, and changes in bowel habits, similar to what you’ve been experiencing. As for allergies, we would start with a basic food allergy panel to see if you have any sensitivities to common allergens like dairy, eggs, soy, wheat, and nuts. It’s less common for allergies to cause this type of inflammation, but it’s worth ruling out. We’ll get the stool test ordered today, and I’ll give you instructions on how to collect the sample. It’s a relatively simple process. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… quite reasonable, Doctor. A stool test, and then a follow-up appointment. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It eases my mind to have a plan, and to understand the potential causes. And yes, instructions for the stool test would be most helpful. I confess, I haven’t had much experience with… collecting samples. I’m ready to proceed with the test whenever you’re ready. And thank you again for your patience and kindness. It truly makes a difference.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Here are the instructions. It’s important to follow them carefully to get an accurate result. Basically, you’ll collect a small sample of stool in this container, and then bring it to the lab within 24 hours. The lab will send the results to me, and I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. Do you have any questions about the instructions, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Hm… yes, it seems straightforward enough. Collect the sample, store it properly, and deliver it within 24 hours. No, I don’t think I have any questions about the instructions themselves. I believe we’ve covered everything for now, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful and informative. I appreciate your patience with my numerous questions, and your kind demeanor. I feel much more at ease knowing what steps we’re taking. I believe that will be all for today, Doctor Pfennig. Thank you again for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day, and please try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. And thank you for your reassurance. I will endeavor to remain optimistic. Have a good day as well, Doctor Pfennig. And thank you once again for your kindness and expertise. .
