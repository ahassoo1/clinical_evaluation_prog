DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, Doctor. Well, it's this… shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Been happening for… oh, goodness, I don’t even know how long. A while now. It’s just… annoying, mostly. Makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaking… mostly in your hands. A while now, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. It comes and goes, you know? Not constant. Hard to say when it started, really. I’ve been… busy. Always something with the plant. Water treatment, you know. It’s… important work. But lately, it’s been harder to do things. Holding a cup… that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Right, plant work. Okay. And is it just your hands, or do you notice it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I… don't think so. Mostly the hands. Maybe a little… unsteady sometimes when I walk, but I figured that was just… old age, you know? I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly hands, maybe a little unsteadiness with walking. And does anything seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Well, stress, definitely. When things are going wrong at the plant… that makes it worse. And… uh… sometimes if I try to do something really precise. Like, threading a needle? Forget about it. That’s impossible. But just… regular things… it varies. I don’t really know what sets it off, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stress and tasks requiring precision make it worse. Do you notice anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Better… now that you mention it… sitting down helps. When I'm just relaxing in my chair, it's not so bad. And… a cup of tea, maybe? Calms me down. But I don’t know if that’s the tea, or just… being still. It’s hard to say. I’m not a scientist, Doctor. Just an old fella who fixes water.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting and relaxing seems to help. We'll keep that in mind. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I've been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But I'm 79 years old! I expect to be tired. And… my memory isn’t what it used to be, but that’s nothing new either. I forget things… all the time. Is that what you mean by symptoms? It’s probably just… old age. I really can’t say. I’m not noticing anything new, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some memory issues, but those are things you've experienced for a while. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any major medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… oh dear. Let me see. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That was… unpleasant. And… high blood pressure, I think. The doctor told me something about that. But I don’t really remember the details. I don’t go to the doctor much, if I’m being honest. Just when something really bothers me. I've always been a strong fella, you know? Didn’t want to bother with it. I don’t think there’s much else. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, high blood pressure… We'll try to get some records if possible. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Nope. Not anymore. The doctor took me off everything years ago. Said I didn’t need it. Something about… side effects, I think. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel… funny. So, no, I don't take anything regularly. Just… tea, when I’m stressed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a kid, but I grew out of that. And… I think I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin once, a long time ago. But it wasn’t anything serious. Just a rash, I think. Nothing major. I've always been pretty good with food and… everything else. I eat just about anything. Honestly, I don’t spend much time worrying about allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, hay fever as a child and a minor reaction to penicillin. Let's just take a quick look at your reflexes and coordination. Can you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Like this? It's a bit hard to hold them still, Doctor. This shaking… it's worse when I try to be precise. I hope you don't mind. I’m not as steady as I used to be. I'm afraid you’ll see that pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a slight tremor in both hands, more prominent on the right. And now, can you tap your finger to your nose repeatedly with each hand?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks, Doctor. This shaking… it makes it hard to coordinate. I used to be able to do this perfectly, years ago. When I was… well, younger. I’m sorry. I’m not meaning to be difficult. I’m just… not as steady.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see some difficulty with coordination. Now, let's check your gait. Would you mind standing up and walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Like this? It’s… a bit wobbly, Doctor. I have to be careful. I don’t want to fall. I used to walk perfectly straight, years ago. Now… well, now it’s a bit different. I hope you don’t mind. This shaking… it makes it harder to balance. I just… want to get this sorted out. It's getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, I see some unsteadiness with your walking. Okay, please have a seat. Now, based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you're experiencing a tremor. There are many potential causes, and it’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out a few things. I'm thinking Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and medication side effects – though you said you aren’t on any medications currently. We should also consider other possibilities. I want to order some blood work to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels. We may also need to consider a neurological consultation and possibly an imaging scan of your brain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Parkinson's…? That sounds… serious. Imaging scan…? Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I just… want to know what’s going on. This shaking… it’s interfering with my life. I just want it to stop. Blood work is fine, I suppose. And… if you really think a neurological consultation is needed, then yes. Do what you think is best. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. It's getting harder to do things, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. We'll get this sorted out. I'll order the blood work right away. I'll also get a referral to a neurologist for you to see. It’s important to rule out anything serious, and they'll be able to give you a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. I'll have the lab orders and referral information ready for you before you leave. In the meantime, try to avoid anything that makes the shaking worse. And, if it gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I just… want to get back to fixing water. It’s important work, you know? I just hope it’s not… serious. I really do. I’ve lived a long life, but… I still have things I want to do. Thank you again, Doctor. And… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I’m anxious to get this sorted out. .
