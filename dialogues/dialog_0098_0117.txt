DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. It's… my cough. Been coughin' up stuff. Not just regular stuff, you know? There's… red in it. Blood. Makes me worried. I smoke, if that matters. Want to get this over with quick, if we could.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some blood, and you smoke. Yes, that does matter. We definitely want to take a look at that. I understand you'd like to get this sorted out quickly, and I'll do my best to be efficient. First, let's talk a little more about this cough. When did it start?
PATIENT: Um… honestly? I don’t really remember when exactly. A while back, I think. Maybe a couple months? Things get… fuzzy sometimes. It wasn’t bad at first, just a regular smoker’s cough. But it’s gotten worse lately, and that’s when I saw the… red stuff. I ain’t been feelin’ too good either, kinda tired all the time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A couple of months, starting as a regular smoker's cough and worsening recently, with blood now and fatigue. Okay. And would you say the fatigue is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant, I think. Like… always just a little bit tired. Not like sick tired, just… heavy. Hard to explain. And it doesn't really get better when I rest. I try to take it easy, but it’s still there. You know? I just want to know if it’s somethin’ serious. I don’t really like doctors much, if I'm bein’ honest. Too much pokin' and proddin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have that constant fatigue. We will only do what’s necessary to figure out what’s going on, Mr. Reyno. I promise. Now, let's talk a bit about the cough itself. Is it a dry cough, or do you bring up any mucus with it?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not dry. There’s mucus. Lots of it, usually. And that’s when I see the blood. Not a whole lot, but… enough to worry me. It’s kinda… brownish sometimes, mixed in with the mucus. Does that matter? I never really paid attention to it before, just coughed it up and… well, you know. I just noticed the red getting more obvious. Sorry, I ain't good at explainin’ things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly fine, Mr. Reyno. Brownish mucus with increasing amounts of blood… that's helpful information. Okay. And do you have any other symptoms along with the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Uh… lemme think. No fever, I don't think. No chills. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but I figured that was just from the coughin’. And… no chest pain. No weight loss, I don’t think. I haven’t really been weighin’ myself. I eat okay, I guess. I forget things easy, though. Been forgettin’ things a lot lately. Like… names, or where I put stuff. Is that somethin' to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, chest pain, or weight loss. Shortness of breath with coughing, and some forgetfulness. The forgetfulness is something we should definitely keep in mind. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Doc told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but I ain't been to a doctor in… a long time. He gave me some pills, I took ‘em for a while, then… I just stopped. Too many pills, if you know what I mean. And… I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But that was when I was a kid. I don’t really remember much about it. Never had nothin’ serious, I don't think. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication that you stopped taking, and pneumonia as a child. That's helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries?
