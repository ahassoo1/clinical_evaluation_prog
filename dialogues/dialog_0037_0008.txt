DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my ears, mostly. Feels blocked, you know? Like there's something stuffed in there. Been happening for a bit now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. It’s just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, “blocked” is a good way to describe it. And you said “a bit now”—can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Maybe… a couple of weeks? Could be more. Time just…blurs, you know? I haven't been keeping track, I suppose. It wasn’t sudden, it just…gradually got worse. Sorry I can’t be more precise.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. It’s common to not remember exact dates when it comes to symptoms. Gradually worsening over a couple of weeks is helpful information. Is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Or, it feels like both. Maybe one is a little worse than the other, but honestly, I can’t really say for sure. They both feel…full. Like when you’re on an airplane and your ears pop, but…they don’t pop. They just stay like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fullness in both ears that hasn’t resolved with popping, and has been ongoing for a couple of weeks. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really, no. Well… I suppose I’ve been a little more tired than usual. But that could just be…everything, really. I haven’t noticed any pain, or dizziness, or…ringing. Just the blocked feeling. And it’s a bit frustrating, to be honest. Makes it hard to hear sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, dizziness or ringing, just the fullness and some mild difficulty hearing. And the fatigue you mentioned might be unrelated, but we’ll keep that in mind. Have you experienced any recent illness – a cold, the flu, even just a minor upper respiratory infection?
PATIENT: Recent illness… now that's a good question. Hmm… I think I had something back in… June, maybe? A bit of a sniffle, a cough. Nothing major, just a few days. I didn’t even bother going to the doctor for it. Just stayed home and drank some tea. Could that be it? I really don’t remember much about it. It was…a while ago.
DOCTOR: It very well could be. A lot of ear issues start after a viral infection. Okay, and just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any fluid draining from your ears?
PATIENT: Fluid… no, no fluid at all. Not that I've seen. I haven't really… looked closely, if that makes sense. But I haven’t noticed anything on my pillow, or anything like that. Definitely no discharge. I'd remember that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You absolutely would. Okay, no fluid drainage. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. My wife… my late wife, she had some pollen allergies. But I never really bothered with that sort of thing. Never had any issues myself, as far as I can remember. I haven't had any trouble with food allergies or anything like that either. Just… nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins. A multi-vitamin, and something for my joints, because they get a little achy sometimes. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, just things I pick up at the store. Oh, and I take something for my blood pressure, a small dose. It’s been the same for years. Doctor prescribed that, years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multi-vitamin, a supplement for your joints, and medication for blood pressure. What’s the name of the blood pressure medication, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: Let me think… it's a small white pill. Honestly, the names all blur together after a while. I just ask the pharmacist to refill it every few months. My wife always handled that sort of thing. I think it starts with an 'A'? But I really couldn't say for sure. Sorry. I’m not very good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it’s common. We can look it up in your records. Okay, it looks like you're on Amlodipine 5mg daily for your blood pressure. Now, before we do a quick exam, do you have any history of ear infections, or any other medical problems that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s right! Amlodipine. See, it’s always something that starts with an 'A'! And no… no history of ear infections, not that I remember. I was a pretty healthy kid, to be honest. Just… the usual bumps and bruises. Nothing serious. My wife always said I was too stubborn to get sick. I had some trouble with my back a few years ago, but that's about it. Is that… is that helpful? I'm not sure I'm giving you very good information. I just want to get this sorted out. It’s… annoying.
DOCTOR: You are giving me plenty of information, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Everything you tell me is helpful. Alright, so no history of ear infections or significant medical issues, aside from some back trouble. Okay, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears, and maybe check your hearing a little bit. It won’t take long. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Anything to get rid of this feeling. Go ahead, Doctor. Just… try not to poke too hard, if you could. And… if I flinch, it’s not because it hurts, probably just…sensitive. I don’t like things near my ears. But go ahead. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a look... I’m seeing a little bit of redness on both sides, and the tympanic membranes—that’s the eardrum—look slightly…dull. There’s also some fluid behind the eardrum on both sides. Your hearing seems a little reduced, but not significantly. Okay, so it looks like you have some fluid buildup in both middle ears, which is likely causing the fullness you’re feeling. It’s consistent with an ear infection, or fluid from a prior infection that hasn’t fully cleared. The redness suggests there’s still some inflammation present.
PATIENT: An infection? Oh. Well… that explains it, I suppose. My wife always said I should take better care of myself. Should we… should we do something about that? Do I need… medicine? I just want it gone, Doctor. I really do. It’s just… irritating. And I’d like to be able to hear properly again. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that we were able to identify the cause. It sounds like you likely have a middle ear infection, often called otitis media. While it’s not usually serious, it can be quite uncomfortable, and it’s best to treat it. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think a course of antibiotics would be a good idea. I’m also going to recommend a decongestant, like pseudoephedrine, to help clear up any congestion in your nasal passages. Sometimes congestion can contribute to fluid buildup in the ears. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… alright. Yes, that sounds… good. Better than just sitting here feeling blocked. Pseudo… pseudo-whatever-it-was? Will that make me… jittery? I don’t like feeling jittery. My wife… never mind. Yes, alright, let's do it. As long as it gets rid of this feeling. Just…tell me what I need to do. And how long it will take. I’ve got…things to do. I just want it fixed quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so I’m going to prescribe you Amoxicillin, 500mg, three times a day for ten days. And Pseudoephedrine, 120mg, twice a day, as needed, for congestion. The pseudoephedrine can cause some jitteriness or a slight increase in heart rate, but it’s usually mild and temporary. If you experience any significant side effects, stop taking it and let me know. It’s important to finish the full course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before the ten days are up, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. Here are your prescriptions. You can fill them at your usual pharmacy. And I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, just to make sure the infection has resolved and your hearing has returned to normal. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. Yes, that works. As long as it's not too long. Amoxicillin… and the… other one. Finish the course, even if I feel better. Got it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Just… getting this sorted out is a relief. Is there… anything else I need to know? Or… anything I should be looking out for? I don't want this to come back. My wife… never mind. Just… tell me what to do if it gets worse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I’m glad we could come up with a plan. As for what to look out for, if you experience a high fever, severe ear pain, drainage from your ear, dizziness, or worsening hearing loss, please contact me immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious complication. It’s also important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest, to help your body fight off the infection. As for it coming back, completing the full course of antibiotics and following up with me will help minimize that risk. And if you develop any new symptoms in the future, don't hesitate to come see me. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And… I appreciate your patience. It’s… hard to remember things sometimes. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get well soon, and have a good day. .
