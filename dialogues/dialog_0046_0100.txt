DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um, let me see… right. They told me it was for some sort of… check? A drug test, I think? Honestly, things are a little fuzzy these days, you know? My memory ain't what it used to be. Something about work, I believe. They needed it for… paving, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It sounds like this is a required test related to your employment. That's perfectly alright. We can certainly get that done for you today. Just to clarify, and to ensure I have everything correct for the documentation, is this a pre-employment screening, a random drug test requested by your employer, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, that’s where it gets tricky. I really don’t recall. It wasn’t… new employment, definitely. I’ve been paving roads for… a long time now. It felt more like… a routine thing? Like they just do it every so often. Random sounds right, maybe? I don’t think anyone told me about it beforehand, if that makes sense. It just… happened. Medicare covered it, I think? Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Medicare coverage does suggest a medically-ordered test, or perhaps one covered under a specific employment health program. And the fact that it was unexpected supports the idea of a random screening. To get a clearer picture, and to make sure we're fulfilling the requirements for the test, do you happen to know the name of the company requesting the test, or perhaps the name of the medical testing facility they use?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You’re asking a lot of my memory, Doctor! Let me see… the company… it’s… Blackwood. Blackwood Paving, I think? Yes, that sounds right. And the facility… hmm. It was… clean. White walls, lots of chairs. I don’t think I remember a name, though. They just… took my sample. I don't recall signing anything specific, either. I mostly just filled out paperwork about my health, you know, the usual stuff. Does that help narrow it down at all? I feel bad not being more useful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Hughston. Blackwood Paving… Okay, it appears they frequently use a facility called "MediCheck Diagnostics" for their employee screenings. And yes, MediCheck typically has a white-walled waiting area and requires standard health questionnaires. To confirm, was the test collected on July 25th, 2025?
PATIENT: July 25th… …That… that rings a bell! Yes, I think so. It was hot that day, I remember. Really hot. And I had to wait a little while, I think. Lots of people there. Yes, July 25th sounds right. That must be it! My brain isn’t working like it used to, but that date… yes. That’s probably the day.
DOCTOR: Excellent! That confirms it. I see the order here, requested by Blackwood Paving, performed at MediCheck Diagnostics. It appears it was a standard ten-panel drug screen. Now, Ms. Hughston, the results are back, and they showed a slightly elevated level of… let me see… diphenhydramine. Do you take any over-the-counter medications, such as Benadryl or sleep aids, that contain diphenhydramine?
PATIENT: Diphenhydramine… …That sounds familiar. Is that… for allergies? I do get terrible allergies sometimes, especially in the spring. And… oh! Now you mention it, I think I took something for a bad rash a couple of weeks ago. A lotion, and then… yes! A little pill to stop the itching. It was pink, I think. I don't usually take anything regularly, just when I get really bothered. Could that be it? I don’t really pay attention to the names of things, just that they make me feel better.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Hughston. Diphenhydramine is a common ingredient in many allergy medications and anti-itch creams. A low level elevation like this is often explained by over-the-counter use. To be thorough, can you recall the name of the lotion or pill you used for the rash?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is where it gets tricky again, Doctor. I bought it at the drugstore… the big one down on Elm Street. It was a blue bottle, I think… or maybe green? The brand… hmm. It wasn't anything fancy. Just a generic sort of thing, I think. They had a whole aisle of creams and pills, and I just grabbed one that said “itch relief” on the front. I really don't remember the specific name, I'm afraid. It was a few weeks ago now, and… well, you know how my memory is. It all blurs together. I just wanted to stop itching!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. It’s very common to forget the specifics of over-the-counter medications. And based on your description, and the low level of diphenhydramine detected, it’s highly likely that was the source. To document this accurately for Blackwood Paving, I’ll note that you used an over-the-counter anti-itch medication a few weeks prior to the test. This result is unlikely to impact your employment, but I want to be as thorough as possible. Do you have any other medications you take, even occasionally, that we should discuss?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just the allergy stuff when I need it. Nothing regularly. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible, you know? They always make me feel… foggy. And I get enough of that already! I mostly just drink a lot of water and try to get enough sleep. That's my secret to staying healthy, I think. Except for the allergies, of course. They are a real nuisance. Is there anything else I need to tell you, Doctor? I don’t want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hughston, I believe we’ve covered everything. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate your patience with my questions. To summarize, the drug screen showed a slight elevation of diphenhydramine, which is likely due to your use of an over-the-counter anti-itch medication. I will document this result for Blackwood Paving. I will also send a copy of the test results to your primary care physician, just for their information. Do you know who your primary care doctor is?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. My primary care doctor… hmm. That’s another one I'm fuzzy on. I used to see Dr. Abernathy, but I haven't been there in… a long time. Years, probably. I mostly just go to urgent care when I need something. I don’t really have a regular doctor anymore, I guess. You can probably skip sending it to anyone, then. That’s perfectly fine. As long as Blackwood Paving is happy, that's all that matters. I’m not very good at keeping track of things these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. We can certainly document that you do not have a designated primary care physician. I'll finalize the report for Blackwood Paving and it should be available to them within 24 hours. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very helpful, Doctor. And patient! I appreciate you taking the time to sort everything out, even when I couldn’t remember much. It's a relief to have it all figured out. Thank you again for everything. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It was my pleasure. I'm glad we were able to clarify everything. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and please take care.
