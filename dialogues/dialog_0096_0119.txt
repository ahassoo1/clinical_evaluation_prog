DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Burlingham, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s a personal matter, and frankly, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t… necessary. It concerns… a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may add. It’s from… well, from him. My… friend. It started a few days ago, and it's quite concerning. Honestly, I’ve never dealt with anything like this before.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A… a leaking. It’s not… normal, is it? And it smells… well, let's just say it’s not roses. He’s a bit… sensitive about it, naturally. And I am quite worried it could be… something serious. I mean, a gentleman should not be leaking, should he? I’ve tried to discreetly clean it, but it keeps… returning. It’s rather… distressing, for both of us.
DOCTOR: Right. And how old is your… friend, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, he’s… a bit older than myself, actually. He’ll be sixty-three next month, if he’s still around, that is. He’s not been himself lately, you see. A bit sluggish, and prone to napping. But he insists he's perfectly fine. Men, honestly. They rarely admit when something is amiss. Though this… this issue is rather difficult to ignore, even for him.
DOCTOR: And what exactly does this discharge look like, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, it’s… not clear, Doctor. It's… a sort of whitish-yellow, and a bit… thick, I suppose. Not like water, certainly. And sometimes there are… little flecks in it. I don’t want to be too graphic, but it’s rather unpleasant to look at. It stains, too. I’ve had to throw out a perfectly good washcloth. Honestly, it’s most unhygienic. It’s… it’s like curdled milk, if you can imagine. A rather unfortunate comparison, I admit, but it’s the closest I can get. Do you… understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Right. And is there any pain associated with this… discharge?
PATIENT: Well, he hasn’t complained of pain, exactly. He’s a stoic man, you see. But he does… wince a little when he… uses the facilities. And he’s been a bit… quieter than usual afterwards. Just… subdued, if that makes any sense. He also seems to have a bit of… difficulty, let's say. Straining, perhaps. He won't admit it, of course. Men and their pride, honestly. Is that… concerning, Doctor? Because it’s all rather worrisome, and I simply want to ensure he’s alright. He's… a good companion, despite everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like your… friend may be experiencing some prostate issues. It’s common at his age, honestly. We need to do a quick examination to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll need to check his prostate, which involves a digital rectal exam. I know it's not pleasant, but it’s the best way to assess the situation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a digital exam? Goodness gracious. You mean… you will have to…? Oh dear. That… that sounds rather intrusive, Doctor. Is there absolutely no other way? I mean, surely there's a machine or something? He would be mortified! And frankly, I am not particularly keen on the idea either. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps we could just try some… medication, initially? A cream, perhaps? Anything to avoid… that. Honestly, the very thought is… distressing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with all due respect, a proper diagnosis requires a physical examination. A cream won’t tell us why your friend is experiencing these symptoms. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be something more serious. We need to rule out infection, inflammation, and other potential causes. A digital rectal exam is a standard procedure, and it's the most accurate way to assess the size and texture of the prostate. I understand your concerns, but without this examination, I cannot provide an accurate diagnosis or recommend appropriate treatment. I assure you, I am a professional, and I will maintain his dignity throughout the procedure. We can be as quick and discreet as possible. Are you willing to allow me to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh dear, oh dear. This is… most awkward. And undignified. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But please, Doctor, be as gentle as possible. And quick. Very quick. He won't appreciate this, I can assure you. He's… a proud man. And I… I don't wish to cause him any further embarrassment. And perhaps… could we have a curtain? For… privacy? And… is there anything I should do to… prepare him? I mean, should he… drink anything beforehand? Or… avoid anything? I really don't know the proper etiquette for such a thing. This is all most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. We will use the curtain for privacy. He doesn’t need to do anything special to prepare. Just needs to relax as much as possible. And I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I have a chaperone who can be present during the exam if you’d prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, a chaperone? That… that might be best, actually. Yes, please. Perhaps a nurse? Someone… discreet? I wouldn’t want to cause any… undue attention. He’s a bit sensitive, you see. About… everything. And honestly, I'm feeling rather flustered myself. This whole situation is… most improper. I suppose if you assure me everything will be conducted with the utmost professionalism, and with complete discretion… then yes, a nurse would be most appreciated. And perhaps… could we dim the lights? Just a little? It might… ease the tension. Oh dear, this is all so… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I’ll have Nurse Davies prepare the room. She’s very experienced and discreet. We will dim the lights, and I assure you, we’ll maintain complete professionalism and privacy. Please, have your friend come in when he’s ready. I will explain the procedure to him as well. I’ll step out while you both get settled. Let me know when you're ready, and I’ll return with Nurse Davies.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that is most reassuring. I do appreciate your patience. Honestly, I feel rather dreadful about all of this. I just want to ensure he's alright. I’ll… I’ll let you know when we’re ready. .
