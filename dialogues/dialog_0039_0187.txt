DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Sobkowic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor, yes. Okay. My chest… feels funny. Like… thump-thump, you know? And wife, she says blood pressure is high. Always checking. Just want to be quick, okay? Old man, no time to waste.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Funny” feeling in your chest and your wife has been monitoring your blood pressure… that’s good information. And you'd like to keep things brief, absolutely. We can do that. When did you first notice this “thump-thump” feeling?
PATIENT: Few days, maybe? Hard to say. Everything feels… same these days. Not strong pain, just… annoying. Like little bird in chest. And wife makes big deal of everything. Always “Henry, your pressure!”
DOCTOR: A few days, alright. Not a strong pain, more of an annoyance, like a little bird fluttering… I see. And it sounds like your wife is very attentive to your health, which is good. Is the “thump-thump” constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. When I walk up hill, worse. Or… when I argue with wife. She stresses me out, you know? Makes heart beat faster. It's her fault, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be brought on by exertion – walking uphill – and stress. That's helpful to know. And it's understandable that stress can affect your heart. Besides the chest feeling and your wife's concerns about your blood pressure, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… No. Just tired. Old man tired. Always tired. And sometimes… little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But that happens all the time. Nothing new.
DOCTOR: Alright, so tiredness and occasional dizziness when standing up quickly. Those have been happening for a while. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Mr. Sobkowic?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Wife would say something if my feet were big. She notices everything. Always looking, always checking. No swelling. Everything is… normal, I guess. Just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, no swelling. Good. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure, of course. And I'll take a quick look at your ankles just to be sure. It won't take long. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Just be quick, Doctor. I have things to do. Don't poke around too much. Old man fragile.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150/90. Your heart sounds… a little fast, and I hear a slight murmur, which isn’t necessarily concerning, but something we should investigate further. Lungs sound clear. Ankles do look normal, no swelling. Now, I want to run a few tests just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to do an EKG – that’s a quick, painless scan of your heart’s electrical activity. And I’d also like to order some blood work. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Hmph. What for? I told you, just old man. Everything is… slow. Slow heart, slow everything. No need for tests. Waste of time, waste of money. Just tell me if I’m going to die, Doctor. That’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowic. It’s true, some symptoms can just be part of getting older. However, these tests aren't about confirming you’re just getting older; they are about ruling out anything serious. The EKG and blood work will help us see if there’s anything specific causing your chest discomfort and rapid heartbeat. It’s always better to be safe, especially when it comes to your heart. We can discuss the results thoroughly. Knowing what’s going on allows us to manage things appropriately, whether that means simple lifestyle changes or, if needed, further treatment. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it gives us peace of mind. Would you be willing to consider those tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick. And no needles if you can help it. I hate needles. Wife always makes me get shots. Very annoying. Just get it over with, okay? No long wait, no poking around. Quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, quick and no unnecessary poking, I promise. We’ll do our best to make it as comfortable as possible. The blood draw will be necessary, but we can minimize discomfort. And the EKG is completely painless – just some sticky pads on your chest. Okay, I’ve ordered the EKG and the blood work. The EKG technician will be in shortly to get that started. And we'll have a phlebotomist come in to draw your blood. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes for both. In the meantime, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any questions you have?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes? Hmph. Long time. Just get it done. No. No questions. Just old man. Tired. That's all. Just… when can I go home? Wife is making dinner.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. We’ll try to make it as quick as possible. Once the tests are done, I’ll review the results with you and we can discuss next steps. If everything looks good, you should be able to head home shortly after that – hopefully in under an hour. Ah, here’s the EKG technician now. She’ll explain everything to you. Please let me or any of the staff know if you have any discomfort during the tests. We are here to help.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Just get it over with. Tell wife I’ll be late.
