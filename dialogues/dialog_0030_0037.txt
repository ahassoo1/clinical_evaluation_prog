DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Quicksey. It is very nice to meet you too. I… well, I have been having some trouble breathing. It feels like a whistle… a wheezing sound, when I try to take a deep breath. It’s been happening for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kilton. I understand you’ve been experiencing some difficulty breathing with a whistling or wheezing sound, and that this has been going on for a few days. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. It happens mostly when I walk, or when I try to do… my exercises. I like to keep active, you see. I used to be an athletic trainer, so I am used to moving. But even just walking to the shops now… it makes it harder to breathe. It doesn't happen when I am sitting still, usually. But sometimes, even then, if I get excited… it starts up. It's a little frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly concerning when breathing becomes difficult, and it's good that you're paying attention to it. It sounds like it's triggered by activity, and sometimes even excitement. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what you mean by “trouble breathing”?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I cannot breathe, Doctor. It’s more like… I have to work harder to get the air in. It feels tight in my chest, and then the whistling sound comes. It’s not painful, not really. More… uncomfortable and scary. I have to stop and rest sometimes, to catch my breath. And I feel a little… shaky after it happens. Does that make sense? I am sorry, I am not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mrs. Kilton. You're describing shortness of breath accompanied by wheezing and a sensation of tightness in your chest. It’s not uncommon to feel shaky afterward as well. Now, let’s go through a little more detail. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, besides walking and excitement?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think. I think… dust makes it worse. If I am doing some cleaning, or if it is a windy day, and the dust comes in… it makes it much harder to breathe. And… cold air too. When I go outside in the cold, it seems to trigger it more quickly. I try to cover my mouth with a scarf, but sometimes it still happens. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust and cold air seem to be triggers. That’s very helpful information. Have you had this happen before – perhaps in previous years?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. Not every year, but… when I was younger, I had something similar. The doctor at the time… he said it was my “chest.” He gave me a little pump, a blue one, to breathe into. I used that when it got bad. I haven’t used it in many years, though. I thought it had gone away. I… I am not even sure I still have that pump. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've experienced similar symptoms in the past and were given a blue inhaler. Do you recall what the doctor called it, or what he said about your "chest"?
PATIENT: I’m afraid not, Doctor. My memory is not what it used to be. I remember the blue pump… and I remember him saying something about my “airways.” He said they got… narrow sometimes. And that the pump would help open them up. He explained it, but I was much younger then, and… I don’t remember the details. I just remember it helped when I was struggling to breathe. I think he also told me to avoid dust and smoke. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mrs. Kilton. It sounds like you may have a history of asthma, or something similar, and that the symptoms are recurring. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any other medical problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have been very lucky, I think. I don’t have any of those problems. My blood pressure is usually quite good, and the doctor always says my heart is strong. I eat a healthy diet, mostly vegetables and fish. And I try to get plenty of exercise, when I am able. I have had a little arthritis in my knees, but that is all. Nothing serious, really. Just a little stiffness in the mornings.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mrs. Kilton. It sounds like you take very good care of yourself. Just the arthritis in your knees then. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. And I haven’t been in the hospital since… well, since I had my son, many years ago. Everything has always been quite straightforward, thankfully. I’ve always been a healthy person, until this breathing trouble started again. It worries me a little, to be honest, because I like to be independent and active. I don’t want to have to slow down.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely. It's good that you've been healthy for most of your life, and I want to help you stay that way. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had something with her lungs when she was older. I think it was… emphysema, maybe? She smoked for many years, you see. And my father had a heart problem, but he didn’t take care of himself very well. He liked rich foods and didn’t exercise. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. He lives far away, so we don’t see each other very often. He doesn't have any problems, as far as I know. Is that helpful, Doctor? It is hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. A history of lung problems in your mother and heart issues in your father. We'll keep those in mind. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, but that is all. I am very careful about what I put in my body. I don’t like to take unnecessary risks.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be fine. I trust your judgement. Please, do whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what is causing this breathing trouble. It is… unsettling, to not be able to breathe properly. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. Please take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly. Okay. I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, particularly when you exhale. Your breathing sounds a little labored, but there are no obvious signs of distress. Your heart sounds regular. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within the normal range, but on the lower end of normal. Your chest feels clear to percussion. Based on what you've told me and my exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing a flare-up of asthma, or perhaps another obstructive lung disease. The wheezing, your history of similar symptoms, and the triggers you mentioned all point in that direction. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a spirometry test to measure your lung function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If you think a test will help, then please, go ahead. I would like to know for certain what is going on. A spirometry test… is that painful? I am a little nervous about anything involving my breathing, to be honest. But I trust you, and I want to get this sorted out. If it will help me breathe easier, then I am willing to do it.
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Kilton, a spirometry test is not painful at all. It simply involves breathing into a tube connected to a machine. I’ll ask you to take a deep breath and exhale forcefully, and the machine will measure how much air you can breathe out and how quickly you can exhale. It takes just a few minutes. I'll have the nurse schedule you for a spirometry test this week. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler – albuterol – to help open up your airways when you're experiencing symptoms. It’s the same type of inhaler you used many years ago, I believe. It should provide quick relief. I'll also prescribe a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid to help reduce inflammation in your lungs, which can prevent future flare-ups. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. The blue inhaler… I remember that. And the other one, if it will help prevent more trouble, then yes, please. I am relieved to hear there is something we can do. I just want to be able to breathe normally again. Could you explain to me how to use the inhalers? I am a little worried I will do it wrong, and it won’t work properly. And are there any side effects I should be aware of? I want to be prepared. Thank you, Doctor, for taking such good care of me. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. I’m glad we have a plan. Okay, so with the inhaler, you want to first shake it well. Then, you’ll exhale completely, and put the inhaler in your mouth, forming a tight seal with your lips. As you begin to inhale slowly and deeply, press down on the canister to release the medication. Continue inhaling for as long as you comfortably can, and hold your breath for about 10 seconds. After each puff, rinse your mouth with water to prevent thrush. I’ve also given you a sheet with detailed instructions. As for side effects, the albuterol can sometimes cause a slight tremor, nervousness, or a rapid heartbeat. These are usually mild and go away on their own. The inhaled corticosteroid can sometimes cause a sore throat or hoarseness. If these side effects become bothersome, please let me know. I want you to use the albuterol as needed when you experience shortness of breath or wheezing. And use the inhaled corticosteroid twice daily, even when you're feeling well, to help prevent future flare-ups. Do you have any questions about the inhalers or the medication?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all makes sense. Shake it, breathe in, hold, rinse… twice a day for the other one. I think I can manage that. And be aware of the tremor and sore throat. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. When will I get the results of the spirometry test? And will I need to come back for another appointment after that? I just want to know what to expect. I appreciate your thoroughness. It makes me feel much better knowing we are getting to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. I'm glad I could ease your mind. The spirometry test results usually take about a week to come back. The nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they're available. At that appointment, we'll review the results together and discuss the best course of treatment for you. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing at rest, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
