DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do. It's my stomach, alright? It’s…bloated. Just feels full of air, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Don’t really know why it’s happening, that's why I’m here, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're busy and want to get to the bottom of this quickly. Bloating can be really uncomfortable. “A bit now” is helpful, but could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, weeks, maybe? Honestly, I don't keep track of that stuff. It comes and goes. Some days it's bad, some days I barely notice. It's just…annoying. Look, I eat normal, work hard. It’s not like I'm sitting around worrying about how my stomach feels, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, completely understandable. "Comes and goes" gives me a better picture. And you mentioned eating “normal.” Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: What am I, a food blogger? Fine. Look, breakfast is usually something quick – toast, maybe an egg if I’m feeling fancy. Lunch is a sandwich, usually. Something from the deli down the road. Dinner… depends. Sometimes my sister brings over food, sometimes it's just leftovers, sometimes I grab something easy. I don't know, just regular stuff. Not a lot of…fancy salads or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No fancy salads! Just trying to get a sense of things. Do you notice if the bloating seems to be worse after any particular foods?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I haven't really paid that much attention. Like I said, I don’t sit around analyzing my stomach all day. If I eat something bad, I just…feel bad. Doesn’t necessarily mean my stomach gets bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's fair. Let's move on then. Besides the bloating, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I dunno. Maybe…tired sometimes? But that’s just from the work. Pile driving ain't exactly a desk job, you know? And, uh…I guess I burp a bit more than usual. But that could just be the coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and increased burping. Good to know. And how about bowel movements?
PATIENT: Look, do you really need to know about that? This is getting ridiculous. Fine. They’re…regular. I go when I need to go. Sometimes a bit…soft, but nothing major. Happy now? Seriously, I’m wasting my whole afternoon here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. It’s just important to get a full picture. “A bit soft” is good to know. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in its color?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Look, I'm not dropping any hints about…that. And no, the color hasn't changed. It’s…brown. What do you expect? I told you, just normal stuff. Honestly, I think I'm good. Is there something you can do about the bloating or not? Because if not, I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I hear you. No blood is good. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possibilities. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and just gently press around to see if anything feels tender. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Just…be gentle. And don’t take all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, take some deep breaths. I'm just feeling for any areas of tenderness. …Okay, a little discomfort here on the lower left side, but nothing significant. Bowel sounds are present, normal activity. No masses felt. Okay. Everything feels relatively normal, but the discomfort you mentioned and the bloating warrant some further investigation. Given the fatigue as well, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We can also do a stool sample to rule out any infection or parasites. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Look, I really don’t have time for this. Can't you just give me something for the bloating now? Like, an antacid or something? I don’t need a full workup over a little gas. But…fine. If it’ll get me out of here faster, do the tests. Just…don’t expect me to be happy about it. And can I get the results quickly?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I wish I could just prescribe something right now, but it’s important to be thorough. An antacid might offer temporary relief, but it won't address the underlying cause. I'll write you a prescription for some over-the-counter simethicone—that can help with the gas. As for the tests, the lab is right across the hall, and they usually have results back within 24-48 hours. We can schedule a quick follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, try to avoid carbonated drinks and foods that you know tend to cause you gas. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Simethicone, whatever. Just… get this over with. 24-48 hours? That's ages. Look, if I'm not feeling any better by then, I'm just going to ignore it. I got work to do. And yeah, I’ll avoid the fizzy drinks. Don’t need you telling me what to do. Just…write the prescription.
DOCTOR: Okay, prescription for simethicone is sent to your usual pharmacy. I've also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you on August 5th at 10:00 AM. We can review the results then and decide on the next steps. Here’s a lab requisition form for the blood work and stool sample. The lab technicians will guide you through the process. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, there isn't. Just...thank you. I guess. I'm going to go do the tests. And hopefully this actually helps and I don’t have to come back.
