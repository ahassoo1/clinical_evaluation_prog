DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 51 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, that's right, 51. Look, I'm here 'cause... well, the military. They want me to take a test before they even think about letting me join up. Seems silly, but that's what they said. Figure I should get a doctor to say I'm not falling apart before I waste my time. Don't see what they need a doctor for, honestly. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I see. A pre-enlistment physical, then. While you feel fine, Mr. Hartness, the military has certain standards they need to uphold, and a thorough examination is, regrettably, a standard procedure. It’s… prudent. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, doc, it's not much to tell. I've broken a bone or two, like anyone who’s actually done something with their life. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, mumps, all that. Nothing serious. No big diseases or anything. Just… normal. I don't go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. Waste of time, most of it. Is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. While you describe it as “not much”, it’s still important to document everything. We’ll try to be efficient. You mentioned broken bones... could you elaborate on those, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What's to elaborate? I was a kid, I climbed things. Fell out of a tree once, broke my arm. Another time, playing football, busted a collarbone. Both healed up fine, perfectly fine. I was young and dumb, okay? Doesn’t mean my bones are weak now. They're solid. I work with machines all day, you think I could do that if I was fragile? Don’t see the point of listing every little scrape and bruise from when I was ten. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, while I appreciate your… robustness, we need to establish a complete record. The military will require this information, regardless of how minor you believe them to be. The dates of these injuries, if you recall them, would be helpful. And were there any complications with the healing process?
PATIENT: Dates? Seriously? It was… a long time ago. Maybe… the arm was when I was eight? Nine? The collarbone… maybe twelve? Thirteen? I don't keep a diary, doc. They healed. No casts for months, no fancy surgeries. The doctor patched me up, and I got back to playing. That's all I remember. Look, I'm a practical man. I don’t dwell on things that happened when I was a child. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just wasting time? I'm starting to feel like I'm in a school detention.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then. Any significant illnesses or hospitalizations as an adult?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Not a one. I had the flu a couple of times, but who doesn't? Never been in a hospital, not even for an overnight stay. I eat right, I stay active, I don't mess around with… bad habits. Honestly, I'm probably healthier than half the doctors out there. I’ve always been able to shake things off. I don't need coddling, doc. I just need you to sign off on this test so I can get on with my life. What kind of test is it, anyway? Is it hard?
DOCTOR: The nature of the test isn’t my primary concern, Mr. Hartness. Your medical history is. Now, have you had any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I told you, I don't need doctors. I fix things myself. If something’s broken, I fix it. If I need something done, I do it. I haven’t had anything taken out, put in, or messed with. Honestly, I think you're trying to find something wrong with me just to justify your job. Is this about insurance, or something? I don’t have any, so don’t try to sell me something. Just tell me if I'm good to go, or not.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s discuss your family history, then. Do either of your parents have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My dad… he had a bad heart, I think. Died when I was pretty young, heart attack, something like that. Mom was okay, lived a long life, but she got… old. Just general wear and tear, you know? Arthritis, the usual. Neither of them were particularly healthy, to be honest. They didn’t look after themselves like I do. Didn’t exercise, ate all sorts of junk. Is this really important? I mean, I'm not my parents. I'm a different person. What good does knowing what happened to them do for me?
DOCTOR: It’s important to establish potential predispositions, Mr. Hartness. Now, do either of your siblings have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Siblings? I got one brother. He… well, he's not the healthiest. Always been a bit… soft. He had some problems with his weight, diabetes, I think. And he smokes. A lot. Never been good with taking care of himself. Not like me, that's for sure. He's always been… well, let’s just say he's not the sharpest tool in the shed, either. Doesn't matter though, I don't see him much. We're… different. Is this getting us anywhere? I'm starting to lose patience, doc. Honestly, I could be building something right now instead of sitting here answering pointless questions.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to social history, then. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Are you serious? Look at me, doc. Do I look like someone who messes around with drugs? I'm a working man. I need a clear head to do my job. No, I don’t do drugs. Never have. As for drinking… I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, a couple on a Friday night. Nothing excessive. And no, I don't smoke. Never liked it. Makes you cough, smells awful. I keep myself in shape, remember? This is ridiculous. You're asking me about things I wouldn't dream of doing. Are we done yet? I'm pretty sure you have everything you need.
DOCTOR: Very well. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take anything. I’m a pretty tough guy, honestly. I’ve never had to worry about checking labels or anything. Not like some people. I think that's it, isn't it? You've asked me about everything. My parents, my brother, my childhood… it's been a whole life story, and for what? So you can tick some boxes on a form? Look, doc, are you going to sign off on this test, or not? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, then. Blood pressure… 110 over 70. Not bad. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing seems clear, heart rate is regular. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are… somewhat diminished. That’s… concerning.
PATIENT: Diminished? What do you mean, diminished? I feel fine! I've been lifting heavy things all my life. My reflexes are probably just… relaxed. You're going to tell me I'm falling apart now, aren’t you? After all these questions about my parents and my brother? I knew it. You were looking for something wrong. This is a waste of time. Look, I’m a strong, capable man. I can handle myself. Don’t tell me I’m too old or something. I’m perfectly fit for the military. You’re making a mistake.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I am not attempting to find something wrong. I am attempting to gather sufficient information to make an informed assessment of your overall health. Now, range of motion… slightly limited in the shoulders. Muscle strength… somewhat reduced in the upper arms. This, combined with the diminished reflexes, is… suggestive of some underlying muscular weakness. Now, given your weight of 53 kilograms and your reported height of 187 centimeters, your Body Mass Index is significantly below the healthy range. This indicates you are underweight. I’m not saying you cannot join the military, but I need to be thorough. I am concerned about potential malnutrition and underlying muscular weakness. I recommend a complete blood workup, including a nutritional panel, and a consultation with a neurologist to further investigate your neurological function. I also recommend a referral to a registered dietitian to assess your nutritional needs. It’s better to be certain, Mr. Hartness. For your own health and well-being.
PATIENT: Neurologist? Dietitian? Are you serious? This is ridiculous! I eat perfectly fine, I've told you that. And my muscles are just… relaxed. I haven't been lifting as much lately, that's all. You’re telling me I'm weak and malnourished? After a lifetime of hard work? This is insulting! I came here for a simple sign-off, not a full medical investigation. Look, I'm not going to see a neurologist or a dietitian. I don't need them. This is a waste of my time and money. I'm perfectly healthy enough to join the military. You're overreacting, doctor. I’m leaving. I’ll find another doctor who will sign off on this test. This is a complete and utter waste of my time. And don’t bother sending me any bills. I'm not paying for this nonsense.
