DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this…feeling full really fast, see? I don’t eat much as it is, bein' an older fella, but now… a few bites and I just stop. Like somethin's tellin' me to. It's been goin' on for a couple months now, I'd say. Not gettin' any better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Obarr. Feeling full quickly, even with a small amount of food, and that it’s been ongoing for a couple of months. That certainly warrants investigation. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it's not…pain, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Like my stomach's sayin' “enough!”. And it happens pretty quick, even with stuff I usually like. Toast, soup…doesn’t matter much. It's just…full. And then I don't want to eat anymore, even if I'm still hungry, kinda. Does that make sense? It's a strange feelin'.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Obarr. An uncomfortable fullness that comes on quickly, even with foods you typically enjoy, and a diminished appetite despite still feeling hungry… I appreciate you describing it so clearly. Now, has this fullness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it… sometimes I get a bit of heartburn, after I eat. Not bad, just a little burnin' up in my chest. And…well, I've been a bit tired lately, too. But I figured that was just bein' eighty-eight years old, you know? I don’t know if that’s connected. Could be nothin'.
DOCTOR: It's good you mention both of those, Mr. Obarr. Heartburn and fatigue are both relevant details. It's important to consider everything, even if you think it might not be related. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man, but that was ages ago. And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a bit high a few years back, so I take a little pill for that every day. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. My wife, Elsie, she keeps me goin', though.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Obarr. It sounds like you've led a healthy life. And it's wonderful to have a supportive partner. Just to clarify, you mentioned a pill for high blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of the medication, and how much you take each day?
PATIENT: Let me see… Elsie handles most of that for me. I think it’s…Lisinopril? Yeah, that sounds right. Lisinopril. And I take…ten milligrams, I believe. Every mornin' with my breakfast. She fills up those little pill boxes for me, so I just take what’s in there. I don't bother tryin' to keep track of it all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. That’s very helpful. And it’s good Elsie assists with your medication management. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or digestive issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had…stomach trouble, I remember that. Not sure what exactly, it was a long time ago. Spent a lot of time in the hospital, she did. And my father, he had heart problems when he got older. He had to watch his salt, I think. Other than that… nothin’ I can really think of. My family wasn’t big on talkin’ about health stuff, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Obarr. Many families aren't. It's often difficult to gather that information. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? Well, I’m retired, of course. Used to work at the radio station, doin' a little bit of everything. Now I mostly just putter around the house and garden. Elsie and I like to watch TV, play cards… the usual. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little bit of beer, but I don't bother much with that anymore. Not much call for it. I try to stay active, walkin' around when I can, but my knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very pleasant and active lifestyle, Mr. Obarr, even with the limitations of your knees. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies, thankfully. Elsie always checks when she's gettin' me somethin' from the store, though. She's very careful. I’ve eaten pretty much everything over the years and never had a reaction. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to somethin’, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would, Mr. Obarr. That's excellent. Alright, Mr. Obarr, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently feel your abdomen to see if I can identify anything that might be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. Elsie always says I'm too trusting, but what's the harm in it? I'll just lay here and do as you say.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Obarr. Thank you. Your heart rate is regular, and I don't hear any murmurs or unusual sounds. Your lungs are clear, with good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I'm gently pressing on your abdomen. Do you feel any pain or discomfort in any particular area?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little tender, maybe, up high, right under my ribs. But that's probably just from age, I reckon. Not sharp pain, just…a bit uncomfortable if you press on it hard. Like a dull ache. It’s not somethin’ I usually notice.
DOCTOR: I do detect some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, specifically in the epigastric region – that's the area right below your breastbone. It doesn't seem to be causing acute pain, but it is sensitive to the touch. I don’t feel any masses or organomegaly. Your bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. Alright, Mr. Obarr, that concludes the physical examination. Based on the information you’ve provided and my findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing early satiety – feeling full quickly – along with some mild epigastric tenderness and diminished bowel sounds. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing this without further investigation. However, several possibilities come to mind. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Trouble swallowin’…hmm. Not really. I mean, sometimes I gotta chew a little more, bein’ old and losin’ teeth, but nothin’ serious. Food goes down okay. I haven't choked or nothin’ like that. I can still enjoy a nice bowl of Elsie’s soup, even if I don't eat much of it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Obarr. No difficulty swallowing is a reassuring sign. Given your symptoms and examination findings, I suspect several possibilities. It could be related to gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining – or potentially a mild peptic ulcer. It’s also possible that this is simply related to age-related changes in your digestive system. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order a few tests to help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I recommend a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a stool test to check for blood. I’d also like to order an upper endoscopy, where a small camera is used to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This will allow us to directly examine the lining of your digestive tract and rule out any serious abnormalities. Does that sound agreeable to you, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute, Doctor. A camera down my throat? That sounds…unpleasant. Is that really necessary? I mean, I just feel full quick. Is it somethin' serious? I don’t want to go through all that if it's just old age, like you said. Could we try somethin' else first? Maybe some medicine or somethin'? I’m not a big fan of tests, especially ones that involve cameras.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Obarr, and I would never recommend a test unnecessarily. You are right to question it. The endoscopy is the most definitive way to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out more serious conditions, such as esophageal cancer or a bleeding ulcer. However, we can certainly proceed in a more conservative manner if you prefer. Before we consider the endoscopy, we could try a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, a medication that reduces stomach acid. This might alleviate your symptoms if they are related to gastritis or an ulcer. We would need to monitor your response to the medication closely. However, if your symptoms don't improve with the medication, or if they worsen, we would need to reconsider the endoscopy to ensure we haven’t missed anything serious. It's also important to remember that early detection is key when it comes to these conditions. The endoscopy is a relatively quick and painless procedure, and it can provide us with valuable information. What are your thoughts on starting a trial of medication, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Hmm… medication sounds better than a camera. If it might just be my stomach bein' grumpy, I reckon I could try that. But how long would I have to take it? And what if it doesn't work? Would I have to get the camera thing then? And… what are the side effects of this medicine? Elsie always worries about side effects.
DOCTOR: Those are all very reasonable questions, Mr. Obarr, and Elsie is right to be concerned about side effects. We would typically start you on a proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole, for a course of eight weeks. This should give us enough time to see if it improves your symptoms. We would start with a standard dose, likely 20 milligrams once daily, and adjust it if needed. If your symptoms don't improve significantly after eight weeks, or if they worsen at any point during the trial, we would strongly recommend considering the endoscopy. It's important to rule out any underlying causes that require more aggressive treatment. As for side effects, proton pump inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. However, some people may experience mild side effects, such as headache, diarrhea, or constipation. Rarely, long-term use can increase the risk of certain nutrient deficiencies or bone fractures, but these risks are relatively uncommon. We would monitor you closely for any side effects during the trial and adjust your treatment accordingly. I will write you a prescription for omeprazole, and I will also give you a handout with more information about the medication, including potential side effects. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in eight weeks to assess your response to the treatment. Does that sound like a plan you're comfortable with, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds alright, Doctor. Eight weeks of pills… I can handle that. And a follow-up appointment to see if it works. Just promise me you won't push that camera thing if the pills are helpin'. Elsie would be awful worried. And thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. It's nice to have a doctor who takes the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I promise you I will not push for the endoscopy if you are feeling better with the medication. My goal is to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes respecting your wishes and concerns. I'm glad I could explain everything clearly. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable and informed about your treatment plan. Here is your prescription for omeprazole, and this handout with more information about the medication. Please read it carefully, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We'll see you back here in eight weeks. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again. And tell Elsie I said hello.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I will certainly tell Elsie hello. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get well soon, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you need anything. .
