DOCTOR: Good morning, Derick. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, nice to meet ya too, I guess. It’s... well, my face and legs are all puffy. Been that way a bit now. Not sure why though. It's just... uncomfortable. Don't really know what to do about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy face and legs, you said. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm... geez. Time kinda blends together, ya know? Widowed now, what, seven years? Maybe... a couple months, I reckon? It started slow, didn't really pay it much mind at first. Thought I just ate something salty, maybe. Now it's... well, noticeable. It's not painful, just... swollen.
DOCTOR: Right, a couple of months. Not painful, just swollen. Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really. Same routine as always. I go to work, do my welding... eat my dinner... watch some TV. Not much excitement, thankfully. I haven't been travelin' or nothin'. Don't have the energy for that. Everything's pretty much the same, Doc. That's the problem, isn't it? Why now?
DOCTOR: That is the question, isn't it?
PATIENT: Exactly! And I don't go in for these things, ya know? Always been healthy as a horse... well, mostly. A little arthritis here and there, but that's just gettin' old. This puffiness… it’s different. I just figured it’d go away on its own, but it hasn’t. Honestly, I thought I was just eatin' too much salt. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: It is possible, though usually there'd be other things going on with that. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Do you notice it's worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, yeah. Seems worse in the evenin', after work. My feet really ache then, and my face feels kinda tight. Mornin's a little better, but not by much. I usually just put my feet up and try to ignore it. Doesn't always work, though. This whole thing is just… annoyin', ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Annoying is a good way to put it. Alright, let’s do a quick exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and feet. It’ll give me a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds fine, I guess. Can't hurt, right? Just... don't poke too hard. My legs are a little tender, as I said. Do whatever ya need to do, Doc. I trust ya.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax as much as possible. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not terribly so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your legs and feet. Could you please point to where you're experiencing the most swelling?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Right here, mostly. Both legs feel kinda the same, though. And it goes up my shins a bit, see? Not just the ankles. Feels kinda... soft, if that makes sense? Not hard and tight, just… squishy. And red, a little. Hurts a bit when I push on it, too. Just a little pinch.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see what you mean. There is some pitting edema present, meaning the swelling leaves an indentation when I press on it. That indicates fluid buildup. And you're right, it's not particularly hard. The redness is mild, but worth noting. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Hmm... geez, Doc, ya ask a lot of questions! Not really. Same as always, I guess. Normal color, normal amount… haven't noticed anything different. No pain when I go, nothin' like that. Just… normal. I don't really look at it, if ya know what I mean. Is that somethin' I should be doin'?
DOCTOR: It's good you haven’t noticed any pain or changes, that’s reassuring. And no, you don't need to scrutinize your urine every time, but it's good information to have when we’re trying to figure things out. Alright. I think we need to run some blood tests. It'll help us get a better understanding of what's going on with your kidneys, liver, and electrolytes. We'll also check your albumin level, which can tell us about your protein levels. That can sometimes be related to swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Well, can't really avoid 'em, can ya? Alright, fine. Do what ya gotta do. I just... don't like needles. Always been a bit squeamish. But if it helps figure this out, I guess I can tough it out. How much blood are we talkin' about here? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: It's just a standard amount, a few vials. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the test, so no breakfast or snacks. Just water is fine. I’ll give you a requisition form with detailed instructions. While we're waiting for the results, I also want you to monitor your fluid intake and output. Keep track of how much you drink and how often you urinate. That can give us some important clues. I’ll also have you weigh yourself every morning before breakfast, and let me know if you notice any significant changes. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Monitorin'… weighin'… Seems like a lot to keep track of, Doc. But alright, I'll try. I'm not very good at rememberin' things, as I said, but I'll do my best. What if I forget to weigh myself one day? Is that gonna ruin everything? And how long will the results take to come back? I just wanna get this sorted out, ya know? It's kinda annoyin', havin' to worry about all this.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Derick. Don't worry about being perfect. Missing one day of weighing yourself won't ruin anything. It’s just about getting a general idea of trends. I understand it’s a lot to remember, and it's perfectly fine to ask for help from a family member or friend. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. I'll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden worsening of the swelling, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Okay?
PATIENT: Emergency room… Alright. 2-3 days, huh? Sounds like a lifetime. I'll try to remember everything ya said. Monitorin', weighin', no food… emergency room if it gets worse… It's just… a lot. Well, thanks, Doc. I appreciate ya tryin' to figure this out. I guess I'll go home and try not to worry too much. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Derick. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and try to rest. .
