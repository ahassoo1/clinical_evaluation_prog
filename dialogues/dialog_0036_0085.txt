DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s gotten a bit… off-color, you could say. Not a pleasant sight, really. It’s rather alarming, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, “off-color” is a good starting point. Can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a rash, or anything like that. It’s… patches, really. Sort of a dull, grayish tone. And it's mostly on my arms and hands. I suppose it could be anywhere, but that’s where I notice it, naturally. I do try to keep covered up, you understand, but it’s… difficult in this heat. It just looks rather… unhealthy, doesn’t it? And it wasn’t like this last year. I distinctly remember having a perfectly normal tan.
DOCTOR: I understand. Patches of grayish tone on your arms and hands, and it’s a new development—you didn’t notice this last year when you had a tan. That’s helpful. And you mentioned it’s more noticeable when you’re exposed to the heat. Before we go further, have you noticed any itching, pain, blistering, or scaling associated with these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Thankfully. No itching, no pain, no… bubbling, or peeling, or anything dramatic. It’s just… the color. It’s terribly unsettling. I mean, one expects a bit of fading after the summer, but this isn't fading. It’s… changing. And frankly, I’ve always taken very good care of my skin. Good creams, sunscreen… the whole nine yards. It’s not as if I’ve been neglecting it, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, it sounds like you've been diligent with your skincare, which is good to know. Just the color change, no other symptoms. Okay. Let's get a little more information. Have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, my husband keeps saying I’ve been a bit more… tired, perhaps. But honestly, who isn’t tired these days? I wouldn’t say it’s anything significant. And my appetite’s been normal, I suppose. I did have a bit of a cold last month, but that’s hardly relevant, is it? It was just a common cold. Nothing unusual. I certainly haven’t been feeling unwell, if that’s what you’re getting at.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a bit of fatigue noted by your husband, but otherwise you feel generally well. No other systemic symptoms. And you had a cold last month, but feel it's unrelated. Good. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Nothing… major, no. I have a touch of… well, the doctor back home called it “mild hypertension” a few years ago, but it's well-controlled with a small pill each morning. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be fifteen years ago now. Otherwise, I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I’ve always been quite strong, you know. Ukrainian women are built to last. I really don’t understand what’s causing this skin issue. It’s quite… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mild hypertension, well-controlled with medication, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – fifteen years ago. That’s helpful. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… my husband handles most of the… paperwork, you understand. But I believe it’s… Lisinopril. Yes, that's it. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, every morning. I haven’t missed a dose in… well, I couldn’t tell you precisely, but a very long time. And it keeps everything perfectly stable, the doctor assures me. I have regular check-ups, you see. I’m not one to neglect my health. This skin discoloration is just… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. And you have regular check-ups. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication… until perhaps a slight drowsiness with some cold remedies, but nothing serious. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. A bit of a stubborn streak, perhaps, but strong nonetheless. I truly can’t fathom what’s causing this. It’s quite… unsightly. And my sister is visiting next month. I do try to present a… presentable appearance, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you haven't experienced any significant reactions to medications. I understand your concern about your sister's visit. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any skin conditions, or any other significant illnesses, that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a difficult one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had something with her skin… a sort of… scaling, I think, on her hands. But she lived in the countryside, you understand, and did a lot of gardening. It was probably just from the soil and the weather. My father’s side… well, they were mostly farmers. Heart trouble, perhaps, but nothing specific. No one ever really discussed these things openly, you understand. It wasn’t considered proper. It’s hardly relevant, is it? A bit of heart trouble and some gardening-related skin issue. This is something entirely new.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of scaling on your grandmother's hands, likely related to gardening, and some heart trouble on your father’s side. Noted. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to take a look at your skin. What about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you mean? I’m a married woman, I live a quiet life… I volunteer at the local library, I enjoy reading… I don’t go out much. Is that what you’re asking? It’s hardly relevant to my skin, is it? I haven't been travelling anywhere exotic, or engaging in any… risky behavior. I assure you. I simply want to understand what’s causing this discoloration. It’s rather unsettling, and I’d like to get it sorted out as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I apologize if the questions seem intrusive. When I ask about social history, I'm looking for things like smoking, alcohol consumption, occupation, and any potential exposures to chemicals or toxins that might be relevant. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a time, years ago, but he quit. A very sensible decision, he assures me. It’s a dreadful habit, really. And alcohol… well, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps. But nothing excessive. Certainly not enough to cause… skin discoloration. I work as an archivist, you understand. Dust and old paper, mostly. No chemicals, no toxins. It’s a very quiet profession. Very safe. I simply want to know what’s happening to my skin. It’s terribly unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional glass of wine, and you work as an archivist. That's good to know. Now, before we proceed, do you recall any recent changes in your laundry detergent, soaps, or lotions?
PATIENT: Oh! That… that's a good question, actually. Yes, now that you mention it… My usual brand of hand cream was out of stock at the market last week, so I purchased a different one. A lavender scent, I believe. It was on sale. I suppose I hadn’t thought much of it… Could that be it? It does smell rather… strong, now that I think about it. It’s rather unusual for me to change brands. I’m quite particular about my skincare routine, you understand. Perhaps that’s the culprit? I certainly hope so. It would be a rather simple solution, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful piece of information, Gabbrielle. It's possible the new hand cream is causing a contact dermatitis. Alright, let’s take a look at your skin now. If you wouldn’t mind rolling up your sleeves and extending your hands, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here you are. Do you see it? It’s rather… distressing, isn’t it? It’s not as noticeable in this light, perhaps. But it’s there. A dull, grayish tone. And it’s mostly on the backs of my hands and forearms. I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is a subtle grayish discoloration on the dorsal surfaces of your hands and forearms. The skin texture appears normal—no rash, scaling, or blistering. There's no edema or warmth. It’s rather symmetrical, which is good. Based on the appearance and your history, the change in hand cream is a very likely culprit. While it's possible this is a simple irritant contact dermatitis, I would like to rule out a few other possibilities, just to be thorough. Do you mind if I ask a few more questions about your overall health?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Ask whatever you need to. I want to get to the bottom of this. It’s just… unsettling, you understand. A simple hand cream causing all this… it seems rather improbable, doesn’t it? But if that’s all it is, I’d be very relieved. I just want to be sure. Ask away. I’ll answer to the best of my ability. It’s not as if I’m hiding anything. I simply want to restore my hands to their normal color. It’s… distressing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Let's start with your thyroid. Have you ever been diagnosed with a thyroid condition, or had any symptoms like fatigue, weight changes, sensitivity to cold or heat, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never. My mother always said I had a perfectly normal metabolism. I’ve never had any trouble with my weight, and I certainly don't feel particularly cold or hot. My bowel habits are… regular, shall we say? I’ve never experienced any issues in that regard. The doctor did do some blood work a few years ago, during my annual check-up, and everything was perfectly normal, as usual. I really don’t think it’s my thyroid. It seems rather… unrelated, doesn’t it? A grayish discoloration and a perfectly normal thyroid… It simply doesn’t make sense. I’m quite sure it’s something else. Perhaps a vitamin deficiency? I do try to eat a balanced diet, but one can never be too careful, can one?
DOCTOR: You’re right to think about those possibilities. A vitamin deficiency is something we should consider. Do you take any supplements currently?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I’ve always believed in getting my nutrients from a proper diet, you understand. My grandmother always said supplements were a waste of money. “Eat your fruits and vegetables,” she used to say. “That’s all you need.” And I’ve always followed her advice. I do try to eat a balanced diet – lots of fresh produce, lean protein… the whole nine yards. I really don’t think it’s a vitamin deficiency. It seems rather… improbable. Perhaps it’s something to do with my circulation? My husband does worry about my hands being cold sometimes. Though I don’t feel particularly cold myself. It’s just… perplexing, isn’t it? This grayish discoloration… it simply doesn’t make sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history and the examination findings, I still suspect the new hand cream is the most likely culprit. However, to be thorough, and to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. These tests will give us a better picture of your overall health and help us rule out any underlying causes for the skin discoloration. In the meantime, I recommend you discontinue using the new hand cream immediately. Switch back to your usual brand, and see if that makes a difference. Also, keep your hands well-moisturized. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Yes, that’s perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. I'll discontinue the hand cream immediately, and switch back to my usual brand. I’ll also make sure to keep my hands well-moisturized. I just… I just want this to go away. It’s rather distressing, you understand. And… what if the tests come back normal? What then? Will we have to investigate further? I just… I don’t want this to be something serious. I’m quite sure it’s just the hand cream, but one can never be too careful, can one? It’s just… unsettling, really. What if it’s something else?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Gabbrielle. If the tests come back normal, it will strongly support the diagnosis of irritant contact dermatitis from the new hand cream. We can then discuss strategies for repairing your skin barrier and preventing this from happening again. However, if the tests are abnormal, we’ll investigate further to determine the underlying cause. Depending on the results, that might involve a referral to a dermatologist or another specialist. But let's not jump to conclusions. Let's start with these tests, see what they reveal, and go from there. It’s very likely this is a simple issue with the hand cream, and easily resolved. In the meantime, if the discoloration worsens, or if you develop any other symptoms – itching, pain, blistering – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That sounds… reassuring, actually. Yes, let's start with the tests. I’ll discontinue the hand cream immediately, and I'll contact the clinic if anything changes. I suppose I’ll just have to wait and see. It’s… frustrating, really, to have to wait, but I understand that’s sometimes necessary. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. And thank you for listening to my concerns. It’s… unsettling, you understand, to have something change with your body without knowing why. I suppose I’ll just go home now and… wait for the results. I hope it’s just the hand cream. I really do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gabbrielle. I understand your frustration, and I’m glad I could address your concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I hope the discoloration resolves quickly.
