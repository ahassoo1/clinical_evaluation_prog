DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need a “clearance” before I can get it done. Honestly, seems like a lot of fuss over a little smoothing out. She worries too much, that one. But here I am. It's for my face, if you must know.
DOCTOR: A cosmetic procedure, then. Very good. While I understand your daughter’s concern, it is prudent to ensure you are medically fit for any elective surgery, however minor it may seem. It’s not simply about “fuss,” Mr. Orwin; it’s about mitigating potential risks. Now, could you tell me more about this procedure?
PATIENT: Mitigating risks… right. Look, I just want some wrinkles fixed. That’s all. A little tightening. Dr. Svenson – a perfectly good doctor, mind you – says it’s a simple lift. Not a full overhaul, just… tidying up. He’s a specialist, you know. Doesn’t mean I need to be poked and prodded by you about every little thing.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Orwin, I am not attempting to be intrusive. Dr. Svenson is a skilled surgeon, I’m certain. However, as your primary care physician, it is my responsibility to assess your overall health before authorizing you for any procedure, even a relatively minor one. It's a standard protocol. To that end, let's begin with a brief medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Alright, alright. Chronic conditions… Let me think. No diabetes. Blood pressure… it was a bit high years ago, but I watch my salt. Take a little pill sometimes, if I remember. Mostly I just avoid salty foods. And my heart… the doctor said something about a murmur, but he said it wasn't anything to worry about. Old age, he said. Everything’s getting old, isn't it? Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: A history of elevated blood pressure, even if intermittently managed, is pertinent information. And a heart murmur, regardless of its presumed etiology, requires further clarification. "Old age" is not a diagnosis, Mr. Orwin. Now, are you currently taking any medications regularly, besides the occasional blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Honestly, you’re making me nervous now. It was a long time ago, the blood pressure thing. And the murmur… really, it was just a comment. Fine. I take a little something for my arthritis. It’s in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to… well, to do my work. It's a brown pill, I think. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of those… what are they called? Melatonin, I think. My daughter buys them for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we have a history of hypertension, a heart murmur, arthritis managed with medication – and melatonin as needed for sleep. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your arthritis, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Ugh. Names. I never remember names. It’s… the orange one. No, wait, the white one! No, it’s a small pill… and it comes in a bottle. Look, my daughter handles all that. She fills the little pill organizer every week. I just take what she gives me. She’s very organized, you see. I really don’t bother with the details. Is this absolutely necessary? It's just a facelift!
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, this is necessary. You are entrusting me with your well-being prior to a surgical procedure. Knowing the specific medications you are taking is crucial to avoid potentially dangerous interactions during and after the surgery. I understand your daughter manages the medications, but I need to verify those details with you. Perhaps we can call her now to confirm the names?
PATIENT: Oh, for Pete’s sake. Fine. Call her. She’ll probably want to tell you my whole life story, too. Her number is… 555-1212. But don’t let her run on about everything. Just the pill names. Please. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I will focus on obtaining the medication list. Hello?
PATIENT: Honestly, she answers everything...
DOCTOR: Hello, this is Dr. Paraskevopoulos calling from Werner Orwin’s appointment. I am verifying his current medication list prior to a scheduled procedure. Is this Mrs. Orwin?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go… She'll be asking about my diet next.
DOCTOR: …Yes, I understand. And just to confirm, that's… Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure, and… Melatonin 3mg as needed for sleep. And the arthritis medication is… Naproxen 220mg twice daily, correct?
PATIENT: Naproxen... yes, that's the one. Sheesh. It’s just a little lift, you know. A little smoothing out. All this fuss over…
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Orwin. Now, Mr. Orwin, I’ve confirmed your medications. Given your history of hypertension, the heart murmur, and the use of Naproxen – which can increase the risk of bleeding – I need to perform a brief physical examination and order some bloodwork before I can authorize you for surgery. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Now you want bloodwork? Honestly, this is getting out of hand. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't keep me all day. I have things to do, you know. And tell Dr. Svenson I said hello. He's a very good doctor. Better than some, I'll tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin with your vital signs. Please sit back and relax. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. I detect a mild murmur consistent with age-related changes, though it warrants further investigation. Lungs are clear. Now, I’ll quickly palpate your abdomen and check your reflexes. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are normal. I'd like to draw a small sample of blood now for a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Latex? No. Never had a problem with latex. Look, can we hurry this up? My arm's getting sore just thinking about needles. And I really don't like the smell of hospitals. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Just get it over with, please. And tell that nurse to be gentle. I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in momentarily. She will draw the blood. I have instructed her to be as gentle as possible. Now, while we wait, I want to briefly discuss your expectations for the procedure. Dr. Svenson has explained the risks and benefits, I presume?
PATIENT: Of course he explained it! He's a professional. He said it was a simple lift. A little tightening. He showed me before and after pictures. Looked easy enough. Honestly, I don’t need a lecture about risks. I’m 81 years old. I've taken risks my whole life. Just tell me when I can get it done. I have a fishing trip planned in two weeks. Don’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your desire to proceed quickly, and I respect your autonomy. However, my responsibility is to ensure your safety. The bloodwork is essential to identify any potential complications. While Dr. Svenson may deem the procedure "simple," it is still a surgical intervention. I will review the results as soon as they are available. I will also contact Dr. Svenson to discuss his surgical plan in detail. Once I have all the information, we can determine if you are a suitable candidate and schedule the procedure accordingly. In the meantime, please refrain from taking any aspirin or other blood-thinning medications. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just get it done. I’m wasting my time here. And tell that nurse to hurry up with the needle. Honestly. This is ridiculous. .
