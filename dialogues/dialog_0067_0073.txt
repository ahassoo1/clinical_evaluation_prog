DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’m not sure why I even had to come in. It’s…it’s my stomach. It’s been going on for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. I’ve tried…things. Over-the-counter stuff. And it just…won't stop. It’s embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re here, even if you’re not sure what’s going on. It’s definitely better to get things checked out, and you don't need to be embarrassed – these things happen. “Weeks now” is helpful, but could you tell me a little more about what “it” is?
PATIENT: Diarrhea. Okay? Just…constant diarrhea. I really don’t want to get into the details, but it’s…bad. And frequent. I’ve already told you it’s been weeks. I just keep…going. And I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested. It's disruptive, is what it is. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Constant diarrhea for weeks is certainly disruptive, and I appreciate you telling me that. It’s good you’ve tried over-the-counter remedies. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe a typical day with this?
PATIENT: A typical day? Ugh. It means constantly planning around where the nearest restroom is. I can’t go anywhere without knowing. I wake up and…well, usually have to go. Then it’s just…a series of bathroom trips all day. I eat something, and then I have to go again. It's just…constant vigilance. And it’s not like it’s just a little bit. It’s…a lot. I’m exhausted from it, honestly. It’s ruining my life.
DOCTOR: I understand how exhausting and disruptive that must be. “A lot” is helpful, but can you estimate how many times a day this is happening?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not counting bathroom trips! Do you really need a number? It's... frequent. More than normal, okay? I'd say…at least six times a day. Sometimes more. It's… it’s embarrassing to even think about. And it’s not solid, if that matters. It’s… watery. A lot of it. Are you writing all this down? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Ms. Woodring. It is helpful information. Six or more times a day, and watery stools, that gives me a better picture. Is there anything that seems to make it worse – certain foods, stress, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, maybe dairy? I don’t drink a ton of milk, but if I have ice cream or something, it seems to…exacerbate it. But honestly, it happens regardless. Stress doesn't help, obviously, but I’m a widow. There’s always stress. It just…is what it is. I don’t know what you want me to tell you. Nothing makes it go away, and nothing seems to reliably make it worse. It’s just…random misery.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It’s helpful to know dairy might be a trigger, and I understand your stress level. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. I was perfectly healthy until this started. Just…normal aches and pains for someone my age. I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. My late husband took care of all that. I don't have anything serious, I assure you. This…this stomach thing is new. And irritating. Is this going to take much longer? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other medical conditions. And I appreciate you letting me know your husband handled your medical care previously. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… No. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was…ages ago. And I think I had a mole removed once, but it was tiny. That's it. Really. I'm not a surgical case. I’m just trying to get this…problem…fixed, so I can get on with my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a child and a mole removal. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food?
PATIENT: No. None. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I barely take anything. Painkillers if I absolutely have to. That's it. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything. People make a big deal out of allergies these days. It’s…overblown. Can we get this over with? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And I understand your frustration. Let's talk about medications, just to confirm. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things regularly?
PATIENT: I told you, just painkillers when I need them! And occasionally, I take something for… indigestion. But that’s not regular! It’s just…when my stomach is acting up. Which, lately, is…all the time. But no, I don’t take anything regularly. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel…weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional painkillers and something for indigestion. Thank you for clarifying. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone who has had similar stomach problems, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. Honestly, I haven't really kept up with all that. My mother had…something. Some kind of stomach trouble, maybe? But I was young. I don't remember. And my father…he was a stoic. He never complained about anything. I doubt he ever told anyone if he had a stomach ache. So, no. Not that I know of. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of similar stomach problems. Thank you for trying to recall that. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…be quick about it. And don’t poke too hard. I have a low tolerance for…invasiveness. Honestly, I still don’t see why I had to come in for this. It's just diarrhea! It’s not like I have…the plague.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I'll be as gentle as possible. I'm just checking for any areas of discomfort or unusual sounds. Okay. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any significant tenderness. I do hear some increased bowel sounds, which is consistent with diarrhea, but nothing particularly alarming. I don’t feel any masses or enlarged organs. Your vital signs are stable as well.
PATIENT: See? I told you there was nothing wrong! It's just…my stomach. Honestly, I could have told you that without all this poking and prodding. Is that it? Can I go now? I really have things to do. I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: While the exam didn’t reveal anything acutely concerning, the persistent nature of your diarrhea for weeks warrants further investigation. Increased bowel sounds alone aren't enough to rule out an underlying cause. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a stool sample test. It can help us check for infection or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A…stool sample? You want me to…bring you a sample of my diarrhea? Are you serious? That’s…demeaning. And disgusting. I refuse. I came in here expecting a quick diagnosis and maybe some pills, not…this. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I'm leaving. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for any feeling of indignity. However, a stool sample is a common and important test to help determine the cause of persistent diarrhea. It's the best way to rule out infection and other potential issues. Without it, I am hesitant to prescribe medication, as we don't know what's causing the problem and could potentially worsen it. If you are unwilling to do a stool sample, I recommend that you consult a gastroenterologist who can offer alternative diagnostic options and treatment plans. I can provide you with a referral if you'd like. .
