DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, good to see you. Or, uh… good to meet you. I'm Dr. Gorga. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Doctor… Gorga, you say? A pleasure. Well, it’s… a delicate matter, really. Not something one readily discusses. It’s… there’s been a bit of… discharge. Yes. A leakage, if you will. Quite bothersome, actually. It's been going on for… some time now, I suppose. Though pinpointing exactly when is… difficult. Old age, you know. Things blur.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Discharge. Okay. And you said it's been… some time?
PATIENT: Yes. Some time. Not recently, not very recently. Weeks, perhaps? Months? It’s hard to say. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a keen eye for these things. Though she exaggerates, usually. “Constant dripping!” she said. I assure you, Doctor, it wasn’t constant. Just… present. Occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay. Present occasionally… We'll get to the bottom of it. And just to be clear, is this coming from… well, is it a urinary discharge, or something else?
PATIENT: Urinary? Good heavens, no! It’s… down there. Below. Where it always is, naturally. I’m not incontinent, Doctor. I assure you. Perfectly continent. It’s… emanating from the… the manhood. Is that… appropriate terminology? My wife wouldn’t approve of such bluntness.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Emanating from the manhood. Thank you for clarifying. That's… helpful. And has there been any pain, burning, itching, or any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. Perhaps a… slight discomfort. A sensitivity, one might say. It’s not debilitating, mind you. Barely noticeable, really. Itching… occasionally. But that could be the laundry detergent. My wife insists on using those scented ones. Dreadful things. Burn? No, nothing burning. Just… a general feeling of… uncleanliness. That’s the best way to describe it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Slight discomfort, occasional itching, a feeling of uncleanliness… No burning or pain. And has there been any change in your urination – any difficulty, frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: Urination… hmm. Now you ask me something. I… I suppose I go as often as usual. No difficulty, no. The stream is… adequate, let’s say. Not a torrent, certainly, but perfectly acceptable for a man of my age. Urgency… occasionally, perhaps. But that’s simply because I enjoy a good cup of tea, and tea has… effects. No, no change to speak of, really. Unless one counts the tea.
DOCTOR: Right. Adequate stream, occasional urgency due to tea… Okay. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Goodness no, it’s August! Far too warm for chills. Body aches… well, I am eighty-three years old, Doctor. A few aches and pains are to be expected. My knees complain when it rains, and my back… well, my back always complains. But nothing out of the ordinary. Just the usual… creaks and groans of an aging machine.
DOCTOR: Right, aging machine… Okay. And just one more question, before we move on to a quick exam, if you don’t mind. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Such directness! At my age? Really! Well… my wife and I… we maintain a… companionable relationship. Let’s leave it at that. It’s not as vigorous as it once was, naturally. But yes, we are… occasionally intimate. Though I fail to see what that has to do with… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being open with me. It’s important information. Alright, Mr. Krok, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, just to take a closer look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Well, I suppose it’s necessary. Though I must confess, Doctor, I’m not particularly fond of poking and prodding. But if you insist… just be… gentle, please. And brief. My patience, you understand, is not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Gentle and brief. I'll be as quick and discreet as possible. If you could just lie down on the examination table, that would be great. Alright. I do see some mild inflammation and a small amount of discharge. It doesn’t appear to be anything immediately alarming, but we do need to rule a few things out. I'd like to order a urine sample and a swab to test for any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Inflammation? Oh dear. Infection? Well, that doesn't sound promising, does it? A swab? What exactly does that entail? I’m not particularly fond of things being… taken from me. But if it’s necessary… yes, I suppose. Do what you must, Doctor. Just be… quick about it, please. And explain everything beforehand. I dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. The swab will just be a quick collection of a small sample from the affected area. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. The urine sample is just a regular one – you'll simply provide a sample in the cup when you're able. The nurse will guide you through both procedures. It's standard practice to rule out common infections. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend practicing good hygiene – gentle washing with mild soap and water. We'll have the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well, what choice do I have? A swab and a sample… it all sounds rather… invasive. But I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Gentle washing, you say? Yes, I can manage that. Though my wife insists on those scented soaps. Dreadful things. I’ll have to be firm with her. A few days, you say? Very well. I’ll try to be patient. Though patience, as I’ve mentioned, is not one of my virtues.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get this sorted out, Mr. Krok. The nurse will be in shortly with the collection materials. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Unless… could you perhaps write down the name of the… affliction you suspect? Just so I can… prepare my wife. She tends to panic. And perhaps a list of… suitable soaps? Ones that won't cause… irritation? But other than that, no. I think that is all. Thank you for your… thoroughness. Though I still maintain this whole ordeal is rather unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. This sheet lists the potential causes we’re ruling out – urethritis and balanitis are the most common. It also has recommendations for mild, unscented soaps – Cetaphil and Dove for Sensitive Skin are good options. And I understand your concern, Mr. Krok. We’re being thorough to ensure we get the correct diagnosis and treatment. The nurse will be in with the collection materials. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Urethritis… balanitis… Dreadful names. And Cetaphil… Dove… I’ll have to remember those. My wife does all the shopping, you see. I’ll have to write them down. No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… please be swift with the results. I dislike lingering uncertainty. And tell the nurse to be… gentle. Very gentle. Thank you… again. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll sit here and try to… compose myself.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I'll let the nurse know. And I assure you, we’ll get back to you as soon as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
