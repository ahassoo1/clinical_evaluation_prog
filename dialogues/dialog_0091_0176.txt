DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and honestly, it’s getting really annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be disruptive. Over two days, you say. Could you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Yes, over two days. And they’re… regular hiccups, I guess. You know, that little jerk of the chest, and the ‘hic’ sound. They come every few minutes, sometimes faster, sometimes a little slower. It's not painful, just… incredibly irritating. And it's making it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, “regular hiccups” is a helpful starting point. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or anything that makes them better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed a trigger, not specifically. I tried drinking water really fast, like you always see in movies. Didn’t help. And holding my breath… no luck there either. Actually, lying down seems to make them a little worse, if anything. Standing up doesn’t change them, really.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. No pain, no trouble breathing, no heartburn… nothing else. I was a little tired yesterday, but I think that’s just because I didn’t sleep well because of the hiccups, you know? It's just… the hiccups are the problem. They’re driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Ms. Redeye. It's helpful to know there aren't any other accompanying symptoms. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever experienced hiccups that lasted this long before?
PATIENT: No, never. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they always go away pretty quickly. Maybe five minutes, ten minutes at the most. This is… different. Really different. I’ve never had them last this long, not even as a child. And I definitely haven’t been to the doctor for hiccups before! It feels a bit silly, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Ms. Redeye. Persistent hiccups can sometimes indicate an underlying issue, and it's always best to investigate. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. I like a good Egyptian meal – lots of beans and rice, sometimes some grilled chicken. And I drink a lot of tea, black tea, with a little sugar. But I haven't changed anything in the last few days. I had my usual breakfast yesterday, and the day before… same thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. I just… don't like them. I had some pain relievers a couple of months ago for my back, but I finished those, and I haven't taken anything since. Nothing regularly, and nothing at all in the last few days. Just tea. Lots and lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, pretty much. Never had a reaction. And I can take most medications without any problems, if I have to. But like I said, I try to avoid them. It's just a preference, really. I’ve never had a rash or trouble breathing or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but they both lived to a good age, thankfully. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. No one that I remember ever had anything… like persistent hiccups, or anything similar. I don't think it runs in the family. It's more about the usual things, you know? Heart problems, diabetes… not hiccups.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean exactly? Do you want to know about my work? Or… relationships? I'm divorced, if that's what you're asking. And I work at the amusement park, managing some of the entertainment. Otherwise, I don't really have a wild social life. Mostly just quiet evenings at home with a cup of tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing, Ms. Redeye. I was primarily interested in your work and any habits that might be relevant, such as smoking or alcohol consumption. You mentioned working at the amusement park - is that a physically demanding job?
PATIENT: No, it's not too physically demanding. I mostly do paperwork, scheduling performers, and making sure everything runs smoothly. A lot of walking around, checking on things, but nothing strenuous. And no, I don't smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that's about it. I prefer tea, as you know! It's a much better habit, I think.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, if you'll permit me, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs and palpate your abdomen, just to rule out any obvious causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want these hiccups to stop, honestly. Do what you need to do. I hope it doesn't take too long. It's making me a little anxious, thinking about this, you know? But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please have a seat on the examination table. I will begin by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. No apparent issues there. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78. I will also check your neurological reflexes. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears within normal limits, physically. However, given the persistence of the hiccups, and to rule out any less common causes, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It will give us a broader picture of your overall health and help us determine if there’s any underlying cause for the hiccups. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. If you think it's necessary, then yes, go ahead and order the tests. I just want to know what’s causing this! And I want it to stop. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Where would I go to get these tests done? I don’t have insurance, so I hope it’s not too expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Ms. Redeye. I will write the orders for the tests now. The closest lab that offers affordable options is City General Lab, located at 123 Main Street. I will also provide you with a form outlining the costs, so you know what to expect. Their phone number is 555-1234. Once the results are available, typically within 24-48 hours, you can have them faxed directly to my office at 555-5678. Alternatively, you can pick up a copy and bring it with you. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and try to rest. While we await the results, if the hiccups worsen or you develop any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It is always best to err on the side of caution. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. 123 Main Street, fax them to 555-5678… I’ve got it. And, yes, I’ll come back if they get worse, or if anything else happens. It’s just… frustrating. But thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. Hopefully, these tests will show something. I just want my life back. And to be able to sleep!
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Redeye. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, we will do everything we can to determine the cause of your hiccups and find a solution. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I will be sure to review the results as soon as they are available. I will call you to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, focus on resting and staying hydrated. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
