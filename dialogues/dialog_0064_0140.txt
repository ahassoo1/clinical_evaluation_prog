DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's rather… unpleasant. I have something going on in my mouth. Frankly, it's quite bothersome and I haven't much time to be dealing with this. I’d appreciate a quick diagnosis if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. "Something going on in your mouth"... can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: It’s… white patches, mostly on my tongue. And it hurts to eat, especially anything sweet or acidic. It’s not like a sore, exactly, more of a burning sensation. It just feels… dirty, if that makes any sense. I haven't been able to eat properly for days. It's really impacting my appetite.
DOCTOR: Okay, white patches on the tongue, burning sensation with sweets and acids, and it's affecting your appetite. That does sound unpleasant. Has this been happening suddenly, or has it been developing over time?
PATIENT: Suddenly, really. Perhaps three, four days ago, it just… appeared. I hadn’t noticed anything beforehand. I thought it might clear up on its own, but it hasn't. And I’m not one to bother doctors unless absolutely necessary, you understand. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you coming in despite that, Antoine. Three or four days... that’s fairly recent. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t felt generally unwell. No fever, no chills, nothing like that. Just the discomfort in my mouth. And the… the taste. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Like old milk, perhaps. It’s difficult to describe. Honestly, it’s quite embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Antoine, you’re safe here. No need to be embarrassed. These things happen. A bad taste…okay. And have you been experiencing any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not difficulty, precisely. It’s more… uncomfortable. I find myself avoiding certain foods, just because of the pain. I wouldn’t say I can’t swallow, just that I don’t want to. It's not ideal, and my wife is starting to complain about my lack of appetite, so… that’s why I’m here. It’s becoming a nuisance.
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding foods due to pain is certainly a sign it’s worth investigating. Would you mind if I take a quick look inside your mouth?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with, then. I have a rather important meeting this afternoon. Please be quick about it. And try not to poke too hard, if you would.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. I see the white patches you mentioned. They appear somewhat…raised. And there’s a little redness around some of them. It doesn’t look terribly alarming, but we need to consider a few possibilities. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing significant. I am perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I don't take any regular medication, either. I lead a very… disciplined life. No time for illnesses. My wife keeps trying to get me to take vitamins, but I refuse. Complete nonsense, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies, no medications, generally healthy. Good to know. Have you ever had anything similar happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. As I said, I rarely get ill. This is… unprecedented. I suspect it’s something I’ve eaten. Perhaps a bad oyster. My wife insisted on buying them from that new fishmonger… I told her it was a mistake. She doesn’t always listen to my advice.
DOCTOR: Okay. A bad oyster is a possibility, certainly. Based on what you’ve described – the recent onset, the white patches, the burning sensation – it could be something like oral thrush, or possibly a mild fungal infection. However, we can't rule out other things without a closer look. I'd like to do a quick swab of the patches to send to the lab. It’s a simple test, shouldn’t cause any discomfort. It will help us identify exactly what we’re dealing with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Really? Must we? I told you, I have a meeting this afternoon. It’s a very important meeting. Will this test delay me significantly? And what if it’s… contagious? My wife would be furious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Antoine. It’s a very quick procedure, shouldn’t take more than a minute or two. As for contagion, it’s unlikely, but we’ll take precautions. We’ll use gloves and a sterile swab, and you can rinse your mouth afterward. It’s best to get a definitive answer so we can get you treated and prevent any potential complications. If it is a fungal infection, it's easily treatable with an antifungal medication. Would you prefer to reschedule, if you're truly concerned about the time?
PATIENT: Reschedule? No. Absolutely not. I’ve already wasted half the morning here. Just… get it over with. Quickly, please. And try not to poke around too much. I’m a busy man, Doctor. A very busy man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. Just relax, and this will be over quickly. There we go. All done. No discomfort, I hope?
PATIENT: Slightly unpleasant, yes. But tolerable. Now, can I be on my way? I really must be going. What do we do now? Wait for… results? How long will that take? I suppose I'll have to cancel my lunch meeting. This is highly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll send the sample to the lab. The results usually take about 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid sugary foods and acidic drinks, as those can irritate the area. Also, try to maintain good oral hygiene – brush your teeth gently twice a day. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild antifungal mouthwash, just in case. It's unlikely to cause any harm, and if it is a fungal infection, it might start to provide some relief. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three business days to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Three days? Very well. A mouthwash, you say? Fine. Just… make it a discreet prescription. I don't want my colleagues to think I'm… unwell. And schedule the follow-up for as early as possible. I have a very demanding schedule, you understand. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must be going. This has taken up far too much of my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. I’ve made a note for a morning appointment in three business days. The prescription is for a discreet formulation, as you requested. If you experience any worsening symptoms – difficulty swallowing, fever, or increased pain – please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. I hope you feel better soon, and have a productive day despite the inconvenience. .
PATIENT: Yes, well. Thank you. .
