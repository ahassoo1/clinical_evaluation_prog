DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cantoran. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. It's… it’s this tiredness. Just so tired. And… and I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I crave it. Clay, mostly. It’s… hard to explain. Honestly, I don't even remember when it started, just that it's getting worse. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Dirt! Clay! From the ground! I don't know why I'm telling you this, it's embarrassing. Look, I just want something to make me feel better. I got things to do, you know? I program machines, it’s important work. Not that you’d understand. And I can't do that when I'm falling asleep standing up and… and wanting to eat rocks. Is this going anywhere?
DOCTOR: Right. Programming machines. Important. And you're… craving clay. Okay. Let's try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific how? It's clay! Red clay, usually. Sometimes it’s darker, I don’t know. From… outside. The yard, I guess? I haven't really been looking at the label, okay? It just... feels good in my mouth. Don't judge me. It’s…hard to describe the feeling. Is that what you want to know? Look, can we hurry this up? I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: "Feel good" isn't a medical term, Mrs. Cantoran. And I assure you, I am not here to judge your… dietary habits. But we need information. When did this start?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is what I mean. I told you I don't remember! Maybe… a few months ago? Longer? It's all blurry. Things just… started feeling off. Tiredness first, then… well, then the dirt. Honestly, it could have been longer than a few months. It just gradually got worse, and I figured I was just getting old. My husband… he passed a while back, and things haven't been the same. Is that what you want to know? Because I don’t know, okay? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get emotional, Mrs. Cantoran. Loss is… unfortunate, but doesn’t explain the clay. So, tiredness and this craving…any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… I get headaches, a lot. And my stomach… it’s always upset. Not, like, throwing up, just… uncomfortable. Bloated, I guess. And I’m always cold, even when it’s warm. Honestly, probably just old age again. Is that helpful? I really need to get back to work. My boss is already breathing down my neck about these projects. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Headaches, stomach upset, feeling cold… Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel…what now? Look, I don't talk about that with strangers, okay? Honestly, that's just… inappropriate. I’m a professional woman. Do you really need to know about my… bathroom habits? Is this even legal? I think I want a second opinion. This is ridiculous. You’re just trying to embarrass me.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cantoran, it is essential information. Changes in bowel habits can indicate a number of things. I'm trying to understand what's going on with your body. Are you experiencing constipation, diarrhea, or anything else unusual?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine! Yes, okay?! Everything’s… messed up. Sometimes it’s hard to go, sometimes it’s… not. And it’s never… normal. Okay?! Happy now? It’s just… a mess. Can we please just give me something for the tiredness and stop asking about my… private stuff? This is getting me nowhere. I feel like I’m talking to a wall. Honestly, I don’t know why I even came here.
DOCTOR: Right. Inconsistent bowel movements. Now, have you experienced any dizziness or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. I get lightheaded, especially when I stand up too fast. And… yes, sometimes I feel breathless. Like I can’t get enough air. But honestly, it could be anything. I’m not exactly a spring chicken anymore. Look, can we just skip to the part where you give me a pill and send me on my way? This is a complete waste of my time and energy. I have important work to do. Machines aren’t going to program themselves, you know? .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cantoran, I need to ask you some questions about your diet, beyond the… clay. Do you eat a lot of red meat?
