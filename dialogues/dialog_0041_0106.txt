DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Though I must say, you’re a rather… young doctor, aren’t you? Never mind that. I’ve got this foot. It’s just awful. A sore, really. And it won’t heal. It’s been bothering me for weeks now, and it's getting worse, not better. It's a diabetic thing, I'm told.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s not healing, and you've been told it might be related to diabetes. I understand. It's good you're getting it checked out. We definitely want to take care of that. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, “getting it checked out.” That’s what my daughter said. She worries too much. Anyway… it’s on the bottom of my left foot, right about where the arch is. It started small, just a little red spot, really. I didn't think much of it. Now… well, now it’s bigger. And it hurts. Not all the time, but when I walk, especially. And it’s… damp, if you know what I mean. It just seems to always be a little wet. And there’s a smell. Not a good smell, naturally. I try to keep it clean, but… it's a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s on the bottom of your left foot, near the arch. Started small, now bigger and painful with walking. And you’ve noticed it’s damp and has an odor. That’s helpful information. Do you remember how long ago it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was after my grandson’s birthday. He turned… oh, goodness… twelve, I think? Twelve in April. So, that would be… about three months ago, maybe a little longer. Yes, definitely after his birthday. We had a big luau, lots of people. I was on my feet all day, helping with everything. I suppose that's when it started, now that I think about it. Standing and walking a lot. I haven’t been as strong since my husband passed, you know. Everything just feels… harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, about three months ago, after your grandson’s birthday party. And you were on your feet a lot that day. It’s understandable that would put some strain on your feet. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It's completely normal to feel things are harder after a loss. Now, have you noticed any other changes to your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, changes? Well… it’s a bit red around the sore, I suppose. Not a terrible red, but definitely redder than the rest of my foot. And… sometimes my foot feels a bit tingly. Not numb, exactly, just… a strange feeling. Like pins and needles, maybe? It comes and goes. And… I think the skin around it is a little… swollen. Just a little, mind you. I wouldn’t call it puffy, but… thicker, perhaps? Is that what you mean by changes? I try to look at it every day, you know, to make sure it’s not getting worse. A girl’s gotta keep an eye on these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, redness around the sore, some tingling, and slight swelling. That's all very good information to have. And it's very smart of you to keep an eye on it. Now, do you have diabetes, or have you been told you're pre-diabetic?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I do. Type 2. Been managing it for… goodness, almost fifteen years now. I try to watch my sugar, but it’s hard sometimes. Especially with all the good food we have at family gatherings. My daughter, she's always telling me what I can and can't eat. And the doctor, he keeps changing the medication. It’s all rather confusing, to be honest. I take Metformin, I think. And something else… a pill that’s orange. I'm not very good with remembering names, you know. But I take them every day, faithfully. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, you have Type 2 diabetes, managed with Metformin and an orange pill. That's helpful. It can be confusing with medication changes. We can review what you’re currently taking if you'd like. Now, besides the diabetes, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… my blood pressure’s a bit high, the doctor says. He put me on a pill for that too. A little white one, I think. And… I had a hip replacement about ten years ago. That’s been alright, mostly. It aches sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And… oh, and my eyesight isn’t very good anymore. I have glaucoma, the doctor says. That’s why I have trouble looking at my feet so closely. I have to get my daughter to help sometimes. Is that what you want to know? I feel like I’m always going to the doctor for something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, a previous hip replacement, and glaucoma. It sounds like you've been through quite a bit, and it's perfectly normal to have lots of medical appointments when you're managing multiple conditions. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergic… let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve taken so many pills over the years, I can’t even remember. I used to get a little rash when I took penicillin as a child, but that was a long time ago. And I get a bit of heartburn sometimes, but that’s not an allergy, is it? No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. My daughter always asks me that question too. She worries so much. But no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to any medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a childhood rash with penicillin. And no current medications other than those we’ve already discussed. Alright, Louine. I’m going to take a look at your foot now. Could you please take off your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just a moment. These old bones aren’t as nimble as they used to be. There. Be careful, it's a bit… tender. And don't mind the wrinkles, I haven't been as diligent about pedicures lately. It's just… harder to bend over these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I see the sore here. It is red and swollen, and there is some drainage present. Your pulses feel a bit weak, but I can still detect them. The skin is also warm to the touch. I'm going to gently palpate around the area to assess the depth and extent of the sore. It may be a little uncomfortable, so please let me know if it becomes too painful. Does this cause you significant pain?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that’s… tender, Doctor. Very tender. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It feels a bit deeper than it looks, if that makes sense. Like it's not just on the surface. And… yes, right there, that’s the worst of it. Oh, goodness, that’s quite sore. It feels… angry, somehow. Is that what you call it? Angry? It’s just… uncomfortable. And a bit frightening, to be honest. I don’t want to lose my foot, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern, Louine. It does seem a bit deeper, and there is some tenderness. It’s good that you’re bringing this to my attention. Based on what I’m seeing and feeling, and knowing you have diabetes, I’m concerned about a possible infection and a potential diabetic foot ulcer. We need to take this seriously to prevent it from getting worse. To get a better understanding of the extent of the problem, I’d like to order some tests. We’ll need to check your blood sugar levels and do a wound culture to identify any bacteria present. We may also need to get an X-ray to rule out any bone infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Infection? Bone infection? That doesn’t sound good at all. Well… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? Tests… yes, alright. Whatever it takes to fix it. Blood sugar, wound culture… an X-ray… Yes, do whatever you need to do. Just… please tell me what it means, you know? I don’t understand all those medical terms. And… is it going to hurt? A lot? I just want it fixed, Doctor. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything clearly as we go. The blood sugar test is just a simple finger prick, like you might get at the pharmacy. The wound culture involves taking a small sample of the drainage from the sore. It might sting a little, but it shouldn’t be too painful. The X-ray will just involve standing for a few minutes while the machine takes a picture of your foot. It doesn’t hurt at all. I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood now, and then we’ll do the wound culture. After that, we’ll get an order for the X-ray. While we wait for the results, it’s important to keep pressure off your foot as much as possible. I recommend avoiding walking on it unless absolutely necessary. We’ll also need to keep the wound clean and covered. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I think. Just… please be gentle. And… explain everything. I hate surprises, you know? My daughter says I worry too much, but… it’s hard when you don’t know what’s going on. And… Will I have to go to the hospital? Please don't tell me I have to go to the hospital. I haven’t been to the hospital in years, and I don't want to go now. Just… fix it, Doctor. That’s all I ask. And be gentle. Really gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Louine, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. We will absolutely start with the least invasive options. At this point, I don't believe a hospital stay is necessary. We'll assess the results of the tests first, and then we'll decide on the best course of treatment. I'm going to call the nurse now to draw your blood and get the wound culture supplies. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Well… a glass of water would be nice. And… perhaps a blanket? I get cold easily these days. It’s just… all this talk about infections and tests… it makes me a bit shaky. Thank you, Doctor. You seem very kind. It’s… reassuring to have someone explain things. My daughter means well, but she just… tells me what to do. You listen, you know? And you explain. That makes a big difference. A blanket and some water, if it’s not too much trouble. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. A blanket and some water are absolutely no trouble at all. I’ll get the nurse to bring those right away. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have, no matter how small they may seem. I’ll be right back with the nurse.
