DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm… brings me in… My wife, she… she wants a baby. We… we old, you know? I think she wants to make sure everything okay before… before trying. I make little things with metal, little models. She does… she does things with people, helps them. But we want baby. Is that… is that right? I forget sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You and your wife are considering starting a family, and you'd like to ensure everything is medically safe before proceeding. That’s very responsible of both of you. Just to clarify, you’re coming in with your wife today, or are you here initially to discuss this and then she’ll come in separately?
PATIENT: No, no. Just me today. She… she busy. Very busy with people. I… I come see if… if old man like me can still… you know. Make baby. She sent me. She said you good doctor. I… I hope so. My memory… not so good these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, just you today, and your wife sent you to get things checked out. We can definitely do that. It’s good she’s thinking ahead. To get started, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly over the years?
PATIENT: Hmm… regularly? Not… not really. I… I go when something broken. You know, when metal bends too much, or I fall. Old man falls sometimes. But… not for check-ups. I feel okay, mostly. A little tired, maybe. But who isn't? I have Medicare, if that… if that helps. What kind of things you need to know? I forget all the things I should remember.
DOCTOR: Medicare is fine, thank you. It just helps with billing. Okay, no regular check-ups. That’s alright, we’ll start from scratch then. Let’s talk about any past medical problems you have had, even if they don't seem important now. Have you ever been diagnosed with things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High… high blood… Oh, the nurse, she checked it. She said it was… a little high, maybe? Not very high. She gave me a paper. My wife… she keeps the papers. She knows all that. I… I don’t remember what she said. Diabetes… no, I don't think so. Heart… I get a little chest pain sometimes, when I lift heavy metal. But old man pain, you know? It passes. Nothing… nothing serious. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible high blood pressure, and chest pain when lifting. We'll definitely look into those. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me think. Long time ago… when I was young, I cut myself bad. With metal, of course. They… they stitched it up. That's all I remember. Small surgery. Not big. My hand. My wife… she might know more. She remembers everything. I was… I was working on a little elephant, I think. A metal elephant. Very small. But I got a bad cut.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small surgery to your hand, a cut you sustained while working with metal. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat… I eat everything my wife makes. She is a very good cook. I… I don't break out in rashes or… or stop breathing. I think. I used to work with… with some paints, metal paints, but not anymore. Long time ago. No, I don’t think I have allergies. My wife would tell me if I did, wouldn’t she? She’s very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Just… sometimes, when my back hurts, I take… a little white pill. My wife gives it to me. She buys it at the… the store. For the pain. But not every day. Only when it… it aches. I don't know what it is called. She handles all that. I… I just take it when she tells me to. It helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little white pill for back pain when needed. We’ll try to find out what that is later. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family. Are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she… she had problems with her feet. Very bad problems. Always walking. I think she had… something with the bones. My father, he… he was strong. Very strong man. He didn't get sick. Not that I remember. I don’t… I don't know many other people in my family. I came here a long time ago. My wife knows more. She… she keeps track of things. I just make little models. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had foot problems, father was healthy. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I work in my workshop. I make little metal things. Elephants, birds… sometimes I fix things for people. I sit a lot. Not much… walking. My wife, she walks everywhere. She is very active. I drink tea. Sometimes coffee. I don't… I don't smoke. I used to, a long time ago, but not anymore. Very bad for you, she says. I eat… whatever she makes. Mostly healthy, I think. I like quiet. It's a… peaceful life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Sometimes, when I wake up, I… I feel a little dizzy. Not very often. Just sometimes. And… and I snore. My wife says I snore very loud. She… she sleeps in the other room sometimes. She says it’s… very noisy. Is that important? I forget things easily. I told you that already, didn't I? I… I hope I haven’t forgotten anything important. I just want to make sure everything okay for… for the baby. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dizziness and snoring. Yes, that's all helpful information. We'll look into those things. It is good you're thinking about all this. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… try to be quick, if you can. My back… sometimes it aches. And I get a little nervous when people touch me. Old man thing, you know? But I’m okay. Just… quick, if possible. For the baby.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Can you please sit here and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Relax… I’ll try. My wife always tells me to relax. She says I worry too much. It's hard, you know? Old man things. Here… is this good?
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 86. We'll need to monitor that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Those are normal as well. Finally, I’m going to just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Everything looks good there too. Now, I'd like to get some blood work done to get a better picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Blood work is fine. Whatever you need. A little prick, right? I’m okay with a little prick. My wife always says I’m brave. Even when I bend the metal wrong, she says I’m brave. As long as it helps with… with the baby, I’m okay. Will it hurt much? Just a little prick, you say? I trust you, Doctor. And thank you. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: Just a little prick, yes. It will be very quick, and the nurse is very good. We’ll send the blood work to the lab, and we should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a few things. First, let's try to get your blood pressure under control. I'd like you to try reducing your salt intake and getting a little more exercise, even just a short walk each day. Second, given your report of occasional dizziness and snoring, I'm going to recommend a sleep study. It can help us rule out sleep apnea. And finally, let’s get a list of the medications you take, even that little white pill, and bring it to your next appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. Less salt… I can do that. My wife is a good cook, she’ll help. And a little walk… I can try. Even if my back aches. And the sleep study… is it scary? I don’t like being… trapped. But I’ll do it. For the baby. And I’ll ask my wife for the list of pills. She keeps everything. She’s very organized. You are very thorough, Doctor. Thank you very much. When is my next appointment? I need to remember to tell my wife. She does the calendar, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s not scary, Mr. Carlotta. It just involves wearing a few sensors while you sleep. The nurse will explain everything to you in detail. Let’s schedule your next appointment for two weeks from today, August 16th, so we can discuss the blood work results and the sleep study. That gives you time to get everything arranged. I’ll have the nurse make a note for you, and your wife can confirm the appointment time. Does that work?
PATIENT: August 16th… Yes, that sounds good. Two weeks… I think I can remember that. August… the eighth month. My wife will write it down. She always does. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little less worried now. Maybe I can still make a baby. She will be so happy. Thank you again. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or… should I just wait for the nurse?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was my pleasure. No, you don't need to do anything else right now. Just wait here, and the nurse will come to go over some discharge instructions and schedule the blood work and sleep study. She’ll also give you a copy of my notes. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before your next appointment. And best of luck to you and your wife.
PATIENT: .
