DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite a lot recently. More than usual, certainly. I don’t… I don’t really know when it started, to be honest. Everything feels a bit hazy these days.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Keoni. It's not unusual to have trouble pinpointing exactly when something started. Frequent urination can be caused by a number of things, so we'll try to figure it out together. When you say "quite a lot", could you give me a rough idea of how often you're needing to go?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s difficult. I suppose… every couple of hours during the day? And then… maybe two or three times during the night? It’s disrupting my sleep, which isn't helping with the… the fogginess. I apologize for being so vague. I just… don't have a very good memory these days. Is that… normal, to forget things like this?
DOCTOR: No, Keoni, it's perfectly alright. And it's good you're bringing this up – changes in memory can be important, and we should definitely discuss them. Frequent urination every couple of hours, and waking up two or three times a night… that does sound disruptive. And yes, it's not uncommon to experience some memory changes, especially as we get older, but we want to rule out anything else that might be contributing. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… not exactly pain, Doctor. More of a… discomfort. A sort of burning sensation, yes, you’re right. It’s not constant, thankfully. It’s usually just at the very end of going to the bathroom. And it’s not terribly severe, but… noticeable. I hadn’t really thought much of it until you asked. Is that… bad? I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: No, Keoni, you're not being unhelpful at all. This is all very helpful information. Discomfort and a burning sensation at the end of urination… that’s certainly something we need to investigate. Do you notice any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear… I… I think so, yes. Just a tiny bit, a couple of times. It’s very faint, and I wasn't sure if it was just my imagination. Or perhaps something I ate? It’s… rather unsettling to think about. I really don’t like the sound of this at all, Doctor. I apologize for being so dramatic.
DOCTOR: Keoni, you’re not being dramatic at all. It's perfectly normal to be concerned when you notice blood in your urine. It’s good you mentioned it. We need to rule out a few things. Now, have you been having any fever, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't think so. I haven't felt unwell, not exactly. Chills, either. And lower back pain… sometimes, yes. A dull ache, really. It comes and goes. I assumed it was just from… well, from getting older, and sitting at my desk all day. It’s not constant, and it’s not very severe. I do apologize for being so vague. It’s just… hard to remember everything, and to pinpoint what's important. I hope I'm not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Keoni, you are not wasting my time. It’s important to me that we gather all the information we can, and you’re doing a good job of telling me what you’re experiencing. The dull back pain, along with the other symptoms… It's good we’re talking about this. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… That’s… difficult. I was divorced several years ago, and my ex-husband handled most of the paperwork and doctor’s appointments. I believe I had… high blood pressure, at one point? But it wasn’t very serious, and I think it was under control with medication. I stopped taking it a while ago, though. I really can’t remember the details. And… I had a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing else comes to mind. I apologize for my lack of knowledge. It’s truly frustrating. .
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Keoni. It’s not uncommon for details to get lost over time, especially with changes in life circumstances. High blood pressure, even if controlled, is good to know. And the flu… that’s helpful too. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
