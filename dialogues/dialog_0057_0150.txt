DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I’m not one for wasting time, Doctor. I want a baby. A perfectly healthy one. And I’d like to know what I need to do to make that happen, without any…complications. I’m 51, not decrepit. I expect things to work as they should.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s wonderful you’re considering starting a family. And you're right to be proactive about ensuring a healthy pregnancy. While age can be a factor, many women have successful pregnancies later in life. To give you the best advice, I need a little more information. First, have you been trying to conceive for a while now?
PATIENT: “Trying”? Doctor, I came here because I want to avoid all that messy “trying”. I want a plan. A medical solution. I’m not interested in…natural methods. And no, I haven’t been “trying”. I’m divorced. It’s…complicated. Frankly, I’d rather just skip to the successful pregnancy part, if that's possible. Is it?
DOCTOR: I understand. You're looking for assisted reproductive technology options. That’s perfectly reasonable. Before we discuss those, it’s important to assess your overall health to see which options might be the most suitable and safe. Could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, now we get to the tedious part. Fine. I’ve always been healthy. I eat well – mostly. A bit of chocolate, certainly. I don't smoke, never have. Had the usual childhood illnesses. Divorced, as I mentioned, so no recent pregnancies. No major surgeries. I have Medicare, if that's relevant. Is that sufficient? I really don’t see what my medical history has to do with having a perfectly good baby, but if you need to know about every sniffle I had in 1978, I suppose I can…try to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s a good start, Ms. Shteynberg. Knowing about the childhood illnesses, no smoking, and your current health is helpful. The chocolate is noted – a little indulgence is perfectly fine! And yes, knowing about your Medicare coverage is relevant for potential testing and procedures. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you have any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, do you think I would be here if I had any of those things? I’m a sensible woman. I go to the dentist. I don’t eat junk food all the time. No, I don’t have high blood pressure. No diabetes. And my thyroid… well, I don’t even know if I have a thyroid. Why would I? Are you suggesting I’m unwell? Because if you are…
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize if my questions seem…thorough. It’s simply standard procedure to rule out any underlying conditions that could affect a pregnancy. I'm not suggesting you are unwell, just gathering information. Okay. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, family history now? Really. My mother had…arthritis, I think. And my father… he had a bad back. He was a carpenter. Lots of lifting. My grandmother had something… old age, probably. Honestly, Doctor, we’re not talking about a lineage of Nobel laureates here. Just… normal people. Is this going to take all day? I have an appointment with my hairdresser later. And frankly, I find this line of questioning…demeaning.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. It is important to gather this information, even if it seems unrelated. Family history can sometimes give us clues about potential risks. Okay, moving on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes, if my back is bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Like anyone else. I hardly think that’s relevant. Is this about trying to find something wrong with me, Doctor? Because if it is, you’re wasting your time. I am perfectly capable of having a healthy baby. I simply want to know what steps need to be taken to ensure it. Now, can we please get to the solutions? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shteynberg, it’s not about finding something wrong. It’s about creating the safest and most successful plan for you. And it’s good you’ve mentioned the ibuprofen – we need to be aware of any medications you’re taking, even over-the-counter ones. Okay. Before we discuss assisted reproductive technologies, I would like to do a brief physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? At my age? I should think my general health is perfectly obvious. But fine. If you insist. And blood tests? Just… keep it brief, Doctor. I have commitments. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I'm not here for a general check-up. I want a baby, not a medical evaluation. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I’ll keep it as brief and focused as possible. We'll start with your height and weight, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your abdomen. I'll also need to check your blood pressure. If you could step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. I know what I weigh. This is… unnecessary. But fine. Get it over with. Just don't tell me if it's gone up a pound. I really don't need to know. And please, be quick about it. My hairdresser is going to kill me if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. Your height is 186 centimeters, and your weight is 86 kilograms. Blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Now, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us assess your hormone levels, check for any underlying infections, and evaluate your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Blood tests. Just… don't lose the sample. And can we please get to the part where you tell me what options I have? I’m starting to regret coming here. It’s all just… tedious paperwork and poking and prodding. I came for a solution, Doctor, not a medical history lesson. Now, about the baby… what can you do for me? Specifically?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. Let's discuss your options. Given your age and the fact that you haven't been trying to conceive naturally, we have a few possibilities. The most common options would be In Vitro Fertilization or Intrauterine Insemination potentially with donor eggs depending on the results of your hormone level tests. IVF involves retrieving eggs from your ovaries, fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory, and then transferring the resulting embryos into your uterus. IUI involves placing sperm directly into your uterus around the time of ovulation. Both procedures are performed here at the clinic. Before we decide on the best course of action, we’ll need to review the results of your blood tests. Do you have any questions about these procedures at this point?
PATIENT: Donor eggs? At my age? That sounds… drastic. And expensive. I’d prefer to use my own, if possible. IVF sounds… complicated. And a lot of poking and prodding, I imagine. IUI… that sounds less invasive. Is there a significant difference in success rates? And what are the chances of… complications? I don’t want twins. Or anything worse. Frankly, the less invasive, the better. But I do want a healthy baby. A perfectly healthy baby. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Shteynberg. Let’s address them one by one. Using your own eggs is certainly preferable if possible, but success rates do decline with age. The blood tests will give us a clear picture of your ovarian reserve, which will help us determine if that's a viable option. IUI is less invasive than IVF, and generally less expensive. However, the success rates are lower, especially at your age. IVF offers a higher chance of success, but does involve more procedures and carries a slightly higher risk of complications. The risk of twins with IUI is low, around 5-10%, but with IVF it can be higher, depending on how many embryos are transferred. We always aim to transfer only one embryo to minimize that risk. As for complications, like with any medical procedure, there are potential risks, but we take every precaution to ensure your safety. These include ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, infection, and ectopic pregnancy. We'll discuss all these risks in detail if we proceed with either option. Do you want me to explain the procedures in more detail, or would you like me to outline the costs involved?
PATIENT: Costs. Let’s talk about costs. I’m not interested in a lengthy explanation of procedures. I understand the basics. I want to know how much this is going to set me back. Specifically. And what’s covered by Medicare? I don’t want any surprises. Frankly, if it’s going to cost a fortune, I may as well just adopt. It would be less stressful. And faster. So, give me the numbers, Doctor. And be precise. I’m a sensible woman. I need a clear breakdown. Now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. Let’s go through this together. Intrauterine Insemination : Each cycle costs approximately $2,500 - $3,500. This includes monitoring, sperm preparation, and the insemination procedure itself. Typically, we recommend 3-6 cycles. Medicare generally covers some of the diagnostic testing associated with infertility, such as hormone level assessments, but it typically does not cover the IUI procedure itself. In Vitro Fertilization : Each cycle costs approximately $12,000 - $15,000. This includes egg retrieval, fertilization, embryo transfer, and monitoring. Medicare also does not typically cover the IVF procedure. However, there may be financial assistance programs available, which we can discuss. Donor eggs would add an additional $3,000 - $5,000 per cycle, depending on the donor agency and medications required. We also have lab fees which are roughly $1,500 per cycle for both IUI and IVF. These are estimates, and the total cost can vary depending on your individual needs and any complications that may arise. We have a financial counselor available who can help you explore your options and determine if you are eligible for any assistance programs. Would you like me to connect you with them?
PATIENT: $12,000 per cycle? That’s… outrageous. And donor eggs on top of that? Absolutely not. Medicare doesn't cover it? That’s… typical. I may as well just sell my apartment. This is… unacceptable. Alright. I suppose… the least expensive option is IUI. But 3-6 cycles? That could still be a fortune. And no guarantees? I don’t want to waste my money on something that’s unlikely to work. What are my chances with one cycle? Be honest, Doctor. I don’t want sugar-coated promises. What’s the realistic probability of success, given my age? And if it doesn’t work, what then? Do I just keep paying thousands of dollars indefinitely? This is… deeply unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your concerns. It is a significant investment, both financially and emotionally. Given your age of 51, the success rate with IUI for one cycle is approximately 5-10%. That means for every 10 women your age undergoing one cycle of IUI, 5-10 may achieve a pregnancy. However, it’s important to remember that these are just averages, and individual results can vary. The cumulative success rate—meaning the chance of pregnancy after multiple cycles—increases with each attempt. After three cycles, the cumulative success rate is roughly 15-20%. However, the chance of success does decline with age, and there is a point where further cycles may not be beneficial. If one cycle is unsuccessful, we would typically recommend a thorough review of your hormone levels and potentially further testing to identify any underlying factors that may be affecting your chances. At that point, we can discuss whether to proceed with further cycles, explore other options such as IVF, or consider alternative pathways to parenthood. Before we proceed with IUI, I would like to order a few more tests to assess your overall health and ovarian reserve. This will give us a more accurate picture of your chances of success and help us determine if it’s the right course of action for you. Would you like to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, Doctor, you’re going to test me into oblivion. But fine. If it’s going to give me a clearer picture, then do them. But I want the results quickly. I don't have time for endless waiting. And I want a clear explanation of what they mean. No medical jargon. Just… straightforward answers. And what about my hairdresser? I have an appointment next week. I can’t be canceling appointments every time you want to poke and prod me. This is… deeply inconvenient. But fine. Do the tests. And then… tell me what I need to do. Quickly. I have a life, you know. And I want a baby. A perfectly healthy baby. And I’m starting to lose patience. Now, let's get this over with. Tell me what tests you want to do. And be brief.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize for the inconvenience. I assure you, I’ll do everything I can to expedite the process. We’ll need to draw some blood for the following tests: FSH : This will help assess your ovarian reserve. Estradiol: This will also help evaluate your ovarian function. AMH : This is another indicator of your ovarian reserve. Thyroid Panel: To rule out any thyroid abnormalities. Complete Blood Count : To assess your overall health. Infectious Disease Screening: To rule out any infections that could affect pregnancy. We’ll also need a transvaginal ultrasound to assess your uterus and ovaries. This is a quick, painless procedure that involves inserting a small probe into your vagina. The blood tests can be done here at the clinic today, and the ultrasound can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. The results should be available within 2-3 business days. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Do them all. Just… no surprises. And make sure the ultrasound technician is… gentle. I don’t want any unnecessary discomfort. 2-3 business days? That’s… an eternity. But fine. I suppose I have no choice. And… can I get a written copy of the results? I like to be informed. And I want to understand what they mean. No medical jargon, remember? Just… straightforward answers. And if anything is… abnormal, I want to know immediately. Don't sugarcoat it. I’m a sensible woman. I can handle the truth. Now, let’s get this over with. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. I completely understand. We'll provide you with a written copy of the results, and I’ll personally explain them to you in detail, using plain language. If anything is abnormal, we'll discuss it immediately and explore the best course of action. We’ll start with the blood draw. Our phlebotomist, Maria, is very experienced and gentle. She’ll take you to a private room and draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It should only take a few minutes. Here's a consent form outlining the blood draw procedure. Please read it over and sign it when you're ready. Once that's done, Maria will take you to the blood draw room. I’ll be available if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. It's all just paperwork, isn't it? There. Get it over with. And tell Maria to be quick. I have a life, you know. Now, let's get this over with. I'm starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I'll let Maria know to be as quick as possible. Maria, could you please come here for a moment?
