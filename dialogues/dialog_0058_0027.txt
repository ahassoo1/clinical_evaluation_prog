DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get on with it. It's this… stuff. Coming back up. Happens mostly after I eat, you know? Like, after dinner. It’s… unpleasant. Really unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. "Stuff coming back up," mostly after dinner. Okay. And by "stuff," are we talking about vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? No, no, not vomiting. Goodness, no. It’s not… forceful. It just… comes up. Like a tide. A bad tide. It’s… acidy. Does that make sense? You’re a doctor, you should know these things.
DOCTOR: It does… somewhat. Acidy regurgitation, then?
PATIENT: Regurgitation… yes, that sounds right. Fancy words, but yes. That's it. Look, I eat a good dinner – my wife’s cooking is excellent – and then a little while later… up it comes. It’s been happening for… well, a few months now, I suppose. Not every night, thankfully. But enough to be annoying. Very annoying. And it burns.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few months of intermittent, acidy regurgitation after dinner. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? I haven’t been doing anything different. Same meals, same time, same… everything. I’m a creature of habit, alright? My wife will tell you that. Don’t go looking for some grand explanation. It just started happening. And frankly, I'd like to know why.
DOCTOR: Right. No changes in diet, routine, or anything else. And is this happening only after dinner, or other meals as well?
PATIENT: Only dinner. Lunch is fine. Breakfast is fine. Just… dinner. It’s a good dinner, mind you. Roast chicken, potatoes, vegetables… proper food. Not all this… fast food nonsense. And it’s always after dinner. Like clockwork. It’s very inconvenient, you know. Ruins the evening.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, consistent post-dinner regurgitation for several months, no associated changes in diet or routine, occurring specifically after a “proper” dinner. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What sort of symptoms? I feel a bit of heartburn sometimes, I suppose. A little burning in my chest. But I’m a man of… experience. I've had heartburn before. It's not like it's new. It comes and goes. And… well, sometimes I feel a bit bloated after dinner too. But that could just be the portions. My wife makes generous portions.
DOCTOR: Okay. Intermittent heartburn and post-dinner bloating alongside the regurgitation. Any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No! No difficulty swallowing at all. I can eat a steak, you know. A proper steak. None of this… minced meat rubbish. I don't have any trouble getting food down. It's what comes back up that’s the problem, not what goes down. Honestly, are you even listening?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Altine, I am listening. It's just that I need a complete picture, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Look, I'm telling you everything I can think of. It's after dinner. It's acidy. It's annoying. And yes, a little heartburn sometimes. Is that enough detail for you? I haven't got time for a medical examination, I've got things to do. Let's just figure out what pill I need to take to stop it, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we jump to medication, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out anything serious. It will only take a few minutes. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Oh, for goodness sake. Look, I haven't got anything seriously wrong with me. I’m a perfectly healthy man, aside from this… irritation. I don’t need prodding and poking. I’m sure it's just indigestion or something. Give me something for the heartburn and be done with it. Really, I haven't got all day. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand you're frustrated, but refusing a basic physical exam is not in your best interest. I am unable to prescribe medication without first assessing your condition. I recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with a specialist in gastroenterology. I can provide a referral. .
