DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. They’re really bothering me, especially when I’m walking. They’re on my shins, you see? Red and kinda painful.
DOCTOR: I see. Bumps on your shins that are red and painful, and they bother you when you walk. Okay. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe a couple of months ago? I thought it was just from working, you know, being on my feet all day. I do a lot of moving things around at the warehouse. But they haven’t gone away, and they seem to be getting a little worse. I don’t remember anything special happening before they started, though. Just… normal work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months ago, gradually worsening, and associated with your work at the warehouse. No specific injury or event you recall that triggered them?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just… slowly started noticing them. They’re not itchy, thankfully. More… achy. And they get worse the longer I’m standing. My wife, Elena, she noticed them first, actually. She’s always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good of Elena to look out for you. Alright, so achy, not itchy, and worse with prolonged standing. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the pain in my legs. No fever, no swelling anywhere else, nothing like that. I haven’t felt sick or anything. And they’re just on my shins, both legs pretty much the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, no swelling, just localized to your shins. Now, have you tried anything to treat them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, just the usual. I put some ointment on them, like for bruises. And I try to put my feet up when I can, but with the work… it’s hard to rest them for long. It didn’t really help much, though. That’s why I figured I should come see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, so ointment and rest haven’t been very effective. Mr. Aluia, I see here you have Medicare, and you're 71 years old. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with a pill I take every morning. And my knees, they bother me sometimes, just old age, I guess. But nothing else really. Elena keeps me going to the doctor for check-ups, so I think she’d tell me if there was anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure and some knee pain. That’s helpful to know. And you're diligent with your check-ups, that's excellent. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees when they’re really acting up. It’s an over-the-counter thing, ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Nothing else, I promise. I try not to take too many pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knees. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Elena always asks when she gets me new things, and I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. She's very careful about that. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You would, absolutely. It’s good Elena is so attentive. Alright, Mr. Aluia, let’s take a look at those bumps on your shins. Would you mind if I examined your legs?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully you can tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see several raised, reddish bumps on both shins. They are firm to the touch and tender when I press on them. There's no warmth or redness extending beyond the bumps themselves, and no swelling in your ankles or feet. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it’s possible these are shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work just to be sure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Shin splints, you say? I’ve heard of those. From working too hard, right? Blood work sounds fine to me, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this figured out, so I can get back to work. And maybe not be in so much pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, shin splints often occur with overuse or repetitive stress, like from being on your feet a lot at work. The blood work will help us rule out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms. While we wait for the results, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible, applying ice packs for 20 minutes at a time several times a day, and wearing supportive shoes. We can also talk about some over-the-counter pain relievers if the ibuprofen isn’t providing enough relief. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Resting is hard, but I’ll try. Ice, I can do that. Elena will be glad to hear that. And maybe some stronger pain relief would help. How long will the blood work take to come back, Doctor? And will I need to come back here to get the results?
DOCTOR: The blood work usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to come back. We can call you with the results, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment if you'd prefer to discuss them in person. It’s up to you. In the meantime, if the pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any fever, swelling, or redness, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Calling me with the results would be great, if that’s okay. I appreciate you taking the time to look at my legs, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Elena is going to be so relieved.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get those results to you as soon as they’re available. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before then. Here’s a printed summary of our discussion and the blood work order. Have a good rest of your day, and try to take it easy on those legs. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Stop.
