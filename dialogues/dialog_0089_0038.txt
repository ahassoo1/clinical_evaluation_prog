DOCTOR: Hi Evann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I requested some paperwork… concerning future care? It’s rather difficult to recall precisely, I’m afraid. Something about making sure my wishes are known… should the need arise. I think it was called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? It was suggested to me, and I… well, I wanted to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes! The Advance Directive and POLST forms. Excellent foresight, Evann. We can definitely get that sorted out today. It’s smart to think ahead. Before we dive into that though, is there anything else bringing you in today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is the entirety of my visit, I believe. Just this matter of the forms. I apologize for my… vagueness. My memory isn't what it once was. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. But the paperwork is the important thing, isn't it? Ensuring things are as I intend them to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Evann, no need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal to have questions or feel unsure, and we'll take our time. We have both the Advance Directive – which outlines your overall wishes for care – and the POLST form, which is more specific for serious illness. Do you have any initial thoughts about either one, or would you like me to walk you through them step-by-step?
PATIENT: Step-by-step would be… most appreciated, Doctor. I confess, I haven't a clear understanding of the distinctions between the two, or what exactly is involved. Perhaps beginning with the Advance Directive would be best? The more general one, you said? I want to be certain I’m making informed decisions, even if my recollection isn't perfect.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The Advance Directive is a legal document that allows you to specify your desires for medical treatment if you become unable to communicate them yourself. It covers a broad range of situations – everything from end-of-life care to what kind of interventions you'd want, or not want, in various medical emergencies. It also allows you to name a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to. Do you already have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… That’s… a good question. I believe my sister, Anya, would be the most appropriate choice. She’s… reliable, and understands my general disposition, even if we don't speak frequently. It’s been some time since we’ve connected. But she’s always been… level-headed. Is there paperwork involved in designating her, as well? Or is simply stating her name sufficient? I apologize for the constant questioning; I simply wish to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Evann, thoroughness is excellent! There is a section on the form requiring both your signature and Anya’s acknowledgement that she’s willing to serve as your proxy. We'll need to witness both signatures, of course. It’s a fairly standard process. Now, the Advance Directive covers a lot of ground, but it’s fairly broad. It asks questions like, "Do you want life-sustaining treatment if you have no chance of recovery?
PATIENT: Life-sustaining treatment… That is… a difficult consideration. I believe… I would prefer to forgo it, if there is absolutely no prospect of recovery. Prolonging suffering… doesn’t seem… desirable. But it’s hard to be certain, isn’t it? What constitutes ‘no prospect’? It feels… absolute. Is there room for nuance within the form? Or is it simply a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ proposition?
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful question, Evann, and you're right to ask about nuance. The form does allow you to specify under what conditions you would or would not want life-sustaining treatment. We can add language like "only if there is a reasonable expectation of recovery" or "if treatment would significantly improve my quality of life." It doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision. We can tailor it to your specific wishes. It’s your document, and it’s about making your preferences clear. Would you like me to add something along the lines of “treatment only if reasonable expectation of recovery”?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… most appreciated. “Treatment only if reasonable expectation of recovery” sounds… appropriate. Perhaps also, a clause regarding pain management? I would wish to be kept comfortable, regardless of the prognosis. A significant priority, that is. This is… reassuring, to be able to express these preferences. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. Pain management is absolutely a priority, and we’ll definitely include that. We can add something like, “I want to receive aggressive pain management to ensure my comfort, even if it may have side effects.” Does that accurately reflect your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… precisely what I intend. “Aggressive pain management to ensure my comfort, even if it may have side effects” is… a suitable phrasing. It feels… good to be having this conversation. It’s a rather… weighty topic, of course, but you’ve made it… manageable. Now, you mentioned the POLST form earlier… Is that something we should address now, or would it be best to revisit it at a later date? I confess, I’m beginning to feel somewhat… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Evann. It is a lot to process. Let’s hold off on the POLST form for today. It’s a bit more specific and is often used when someone is already seriously ill. We can revisit it at a later date if you’d like. Right now, let's focus on getting this Advance Directive finalized. We just need your signature and Anya’s acknowledgement. Would you like me to print it out so you can review it one last time before signing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… most helpful. A final review would… ease my mind. And then, instructions for obtaining Anya’s acknowledgement? Is there a specific procedure, or simply a matter of her signing the document as well? I apologize for my… nervousness. It’s simply… a significant undertaking.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann, no apologies needed at all. It is significant, and it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. Here you are. Take your time reviewing it. As for Anya’s acknowledgement, she simply needs to sign the form, attesting that she understands she's been designated as your healthcare proxy and agrees to fulfill that role. It doesn’t need to be notarized, but it’s best if it's witnessed. And, of course, she should keep a copy for her records. I’ll also provide you with a copy, and we’ll keep one here in your file. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds… straightforward enough. Witnessed signatures, copies for all parties… I believe I can manage that. I… I think this covers everything, yes. It's… remarkably thorough. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. You’ve been… exceptionally patient and understanding. I believe I’m ready to sign, if you would be so kind as to provide a pen. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. Take your time. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. I'm happy to be of assistance. .
