DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Bombara. Well, it’s this nausea I’ve been gettin’ most mornings. It’s been botherin’ me, and… well, the specialist told me it’s somethin’ to do with my heart, so I thought I best come get it checked out. It's just… unpleasant, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Yes, unpleasant is a good way to put it. The specialist mentioned something about your heart… Alright. Can you tell me a little more about this nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, sure. It usually starts pretty soon after I wake up. Not right away, but within an hour or so. It’s not… violent, if ye know what I mean. More like a queasy feelin’, a rollin’ in the stomach. And it doesn’t always end with… well, anything. Sometimes it just… sits there. It's been goin' on for about a month now, maybe a bit longer. I’ve been tryin' to eat somethin’ small when I get up, toast usually, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s most prominent in the mornings, within an hour of waking, and doesn't consistently lead to vomiting. Toast doesn't seem to alleviate it. And it’s been going on for roughly a month… Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don't know if anything specifically makes it worse, not that I’ve noticed. Lyin’ flat seems to make it a bit more noticeable, maybe? I find I need to sit up for a bit. And… oh, this might be somethin’. I've been sleepin’ on a new pillow lately, a bit thicker than the last one. Could that have somethin’ to do with it? It’s a bit of a long shot, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Not a long shot at all. Changes in sleeping position can sometimes contribute to nausea. And you mentioned lying flat exacerbates it… Alright. Aside from the nausea, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Well… now that ye mention it, I’ve been a wee bit more breathless than usual. Not like I'm gaspin’ for air, mind ye, but just… takin’ deeper breaths than I used to when I’m walkin’ up the stairs, or carryin’ groceries. And… my ankles have been a bit swollen at the end of the day. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest, it's been fairly warm these past few weeks. I haven't really paid much attention to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased breathlessness and some ankle swelling… Those are important things to note. And the timing, with the heat… it's good you're mentioning these details. Do you notice the swelling is worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Aye, it’s definitely worse in the evenin’. After I’ve been on my feet all day. By the time I sit down for supper, my ankles are quite puffy. I usually put my feet up for a bit, and it helps a little. I haven't said anything to anyone about it before, really. I just figured it was part of gettin’ older, ye ken? But with the nausea and now the breathlessness… I thought I best come get it looked at.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to come in. It's always best to get these things checked out, especially with multiple symptoms appearing. Now, let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. The specialist told me I have heart failure, a few years back now. It’s been… manageable, mostly. I take some medication for it, a couple of different pills, I can tell ye the names if ye need. And… I had a touch of pneumonia last winter, but that cleared up alright. Apart from that, not much. I've always been a fairly healthy man, all things considered. Though I do have a bad habit of readin' late into the night, which can’t be good for my eyes! But I don’t think that’s relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Heart failure, managed with medication, and a bout of pneumonia last winter. That’s important information. We'll definitely want to discuss the medications you’re taking. And yes, reading late at night probably isn't ideal, but we’ll focus on the more pressing concerns for now. Do you recall the names of those medications for your heart failure?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. Let me see… there’s Lisinopril, and… Furosemide, I think. And… oh, and Digoxin. I take one tablet of Lisinopril every mornin’, one of Furosemide every other day, and a wee half a tablet of Digoxin on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I’ve been takin’ them for… oh, must be five years now, maybe a bit longer. I usually get the prescription filled at the chemist down the road, Mr. Abernathy, a good man he is. Always checks everything’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Furosemide, and Digoxin. That’s very helpful. And you've been on those for approximately five years. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to be a bit sensitive to pollen when I was a lad, but that’s long gone now. No, I can’t think of any allergies at all. I’m a fairly simple man, really. Not much bothers me. Except maybe a bad cup of tea! But that’s not a medical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a bad cup of tea is not a medical condition. Good to know you have no known allergies. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not any major surgeries, no. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago now. And… oh, I had a wee bit of a skin tag removed from my back a few years back, but that was just a quick thing, the doctor snipped it off in the office. Apart from that, nothin’. I've always been lucky enough to avoid the need for serious operations.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy as a child and a skin tag removal. That's good to know. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a tricky one. My father had a touch of high blood pressure when he got older, but he lived to be 85, so it didn't do him much harm. My mother… she had some trouble with her joints, arthritis I think it was. And… my older brother, he had a heart attack about ten years ago, but he’s doin’ alright now, he takes medication for it. Apart from that, not much history of serious illness on either side of the family, really. A lot of hardy Scots folk, ye see. We tend to keep goin’.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother, and a heart attack in your brother. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once when I was a young lad, didn’t like it at all. Made me feel sick, to be honest. Always been a healthy man, I tell ye. I do enjoy a wee dram of whisky now and then, but only a small one, and not every day. Mostly just on special occasions.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional whisky. And do you drink alcohol frequently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Maybe a glass of wine with my supper on a Friday night, or a wee dram on a special occasion like I said. I don't drink every day, and I certainly don't drink to excess. I'm a fairly moderate man, ye see. I prefer a good cup of tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be very active. I used to go hillwalkin' most weekends, but my knees aren't what they used to be, so I don’t do that anymore. I still try to get out for a walk most days, a gentle stroll around the village, maybe half an hour or so. I do a bit of gardenin', keepin' the weeds at bay. And I like to read, of course. It keeps the mind active, ye ken. But I wouldn’t say I’m very active these days, not like I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gentle daily walk and gardening. Now, one last thing before we move on to a physical exam. Are you currently employed, and if so, what do you do?
PATIENT: Aye, I am. I work at the library, mostly helpin’ folk find books and keepin’ things tidy. It’s a quiet job, not much stress. I’ve been doin’ it for… oh, must be twenty years now. It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it. Mostly just a few hours a week, mind ye, not a full-time job. Gives me plenty of time for my gardenin’ and my readin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. That’s very helpful. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It shouldn't take too long. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Dr. Bombara. Go ahead. Do what ye need to do. I’m used to doctors pokin’ and proddin’ these days, with my heart and all. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and some mild crackling sounds in the bases of both lungs. This could be fluid build-up. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. And your ankles do have some noticeable pitting edema – swelling that remains after I press on them. Alright, Mr. Benic. I’ve noted some irregularities in your heart rhythm, mild crackling in your lungs, elevated blood pressure, and pitting edema in your ankles. These findings are consistent with possible worsening heart failure. I would like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Dr. Bombara. Blood tests and an X-ray… go ahead. Whatever ye think is best. I trust yer judgement. I'm not one to argue with a doctor, especially with my heart bein’ the way it is. I just want to feel better, ye ken? This nausea is really gettin’ me down.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Benic. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and chest X-ray now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and we can schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend reducing your salt intake as much as possible, and keeping a close eye on your weight. Any sudden weight gain could indicate fluid retention. Also, if you're feeling particularly short of breath or experiencing chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. Less salt, watch my weight, and go to the emergency room if I’m short of breath or have chest pain. Got it. I'm fairly good at watchin’ my weight, always been a bit of a worrier about that sort of thing. And I'll try me best with the salt. It’s just… I do enjoy a wee bit of seasoning on my roast potatoes! And the chest X-ray tomorrow… that’s fine. Will I need to do anything to prepare for that?
DOCTOR: No, no special preparation needed for the chest X-ray. Just wear comfortable clothing, and remove any jewelry that might interfere with the image. Now, I'm also going to prescribe you a low-dose diuretic, a water pill, to help reduce the fluid build-up. It's called Furosemide, and it's the same medication you were already taking, but we might need to adjust the dosage based on the results of the blood tests. The nurse will explain the dosage and potential side effects. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Aye, just one, Dr. Bombara. Ye said adjust the dosage… could that mean I’ll need to come back more often for check-ups? I do live a wee bit out of the way, and gettin’ to the clinic isn’t always easy. And… what about the nausea? Will this water pill help with that, or is that somethin’ separate?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Benic. Yes, it's possible we may need to adjust the dosage of Furosemide and monitor you more closely initially. We can discuss telehealth appointments to minimize the need for travel if that becomes necessary. As for the nausea, it's difficult to say definitively whether the water pill will help. Nausea can have many causes, and it’s often related to heart failure, as it can affect digestion. If the fluid build-up is contributing to your nausea, the diuretic may provide some relief. However, if the cause is different, we may need to investigate further. If the nausea persists despite the diuretic, we can consider other medications or referrals to a gastroenterologist. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood tests and X-ray done. We'll review the results together and develop a plan based on what we find. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Dr. Bombara. Get the tests done and see what they say. That’s always the best approach. I trust yer judgement. Telehealth appointments would be grand, if we need them. That would save me a fair bit of travel. Right then. I suppose the nurse will be along shortly to poke me with a needle. Thank ye for yer time, Dr. Bombara. I feel a wee bit better now, just knowin' what's bein' done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be with you shortly. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next appointment.
