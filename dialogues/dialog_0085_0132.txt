DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I suppose. It's this heat, see? Can't stand it anymore. Always been alright with a bit of warmth, but this…this is ridiculous. Makes me feel awful, just awful. Like I’m melting.
DOCTOR: I see. It has been quite a stretch of hot weather, hasn't it?
PATIENT: Quite a stretch? That's putting it mildly! I've lived a long life, seen a few summers, and this is the worst. And I spend my days outside, you know? Painting, fixing things... can't exactly hide in an air-conditioned room all day, can I? Though I'm starting to think I might have to. What is it about this heat, though? Never bothered me this much before.
DOCTOR: Well, it's good you're recognizing it's different this time around. It’s important to pay attention to changes in how your body responds. When you say "awful," could you describe what that feels like specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Hmph. Alright. It’s…everything feels heavy. Like wading through thick soup. And I get these spells, you know? Dizzy. Sweaty, even when I'm just sitting. And then I get…cranky. Very, very cranky. My nephew was over helping me with the roof last week, and I nearly sent him packing just for breathing too loud. It's not normal, I tell you. Not normal at all. I don't usually lose my temper like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a much clearer picture. Heavy feeling, dizziness, sweating even at rest, and increased irritability... those are all things we need to explore further. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting with these spells, or any changes in your thirst or urination?
PATIENT: Nausea? No, thankfully. I hate being sick to my stomach. Vomiting, no. But the thirst…yes. Always thirsty. Like the Sahara desert in my mouth. And I'm going to the bathroom a lot more than usual. Thought it was just…well, you know, getting older. But maybe it’s connected to this heat nonsense. Everything feels connected now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're noticing those connections. Increased thirst and frequent urination can definitely be related to what’s going on, especially with the heat. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmph. Medical conditions. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Always thought it was a waste of time. But…well, my old family doctor, back in Nepal, he said my blood pressure was a bit high, years ago. He put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t feel like they were doing anything, and I didn't like the way they made me feel. As for diabetes or heart problems…no, never been told that. I'm a pretty strong fella, always have been. Still do a lot of heavy lifting, you know? Though it's getting harder with this heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure in the past is important to know. And you’re right to mention the pills not feeling right – it's important to be comfortable with any medication you’re taking. Do you remember the name of the blood pressure medication you were on?
PATIENT: Name of the… honestly, no. It was ages ago. Small white pill, I think? Maybe pink? They all look the same to me. I didn’t pay much attention to it. I just stopped taking it when I didn't think it was helping. I remember the doctor being very… insistent I stay on it. But I just didn't feel right, you know? Fuzzy headed. And my nephew, he told me to stop, said those pills weren't good for you. He reads a lot of things online.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to not remember medication names, and it’s good you listened to your body and how you were feeling. It's also good to be cautious, but it’s always best to discuss stopping a medication with a doctor first. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family, huh? My mother... she had problems with her legs. Swelling, mostly. Doctor said it was something with her circulation. Didn't know much about it, to be honest. My father... he was a strong man, lived a long life. Never really seemed sick a day in his life. Just…old age finally got to him. As for diabetes or kidney problems... no, can't say that anyone in the family had those. Mostly just…old age. Tough stock, my family. Except for my mother’s legs. That was always a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. Swelling in your mother's legs could be related to circulation issues, which we’ll keep in mind. Let's talk about your current medications. Aside from that blood pressure pill you stopped taking years ago, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements right now?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, I don’t believe in all that medicine nonsense. I get by just fine on my own. A bit of hard work, a good meal, that's all you need. Maybe a cup of strong tea. No pills, no vitamins, no supplements. Waste of money, if you ask me. I’m a practical man. I build things with my hands, not swallow pills. Though… my nephew keeps trying to get me to take those vitamin D things. Says everyone needs them, especially in the winter. But I told him no.
DOCTOR: Alright, I appreciate your honesty and your preference for a natural approach. No current medications or supplements, that’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I can eat anything. I've lived a long life, traveled a lot, tried all sorts of things. Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a bit of heartburn if I eat something too spicy, but that's not an allergy, that's just common sense. No, I don't have any allergies. Never have. Though… I don’t much care for shellfish. But that's just a matter of taste, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look at your skin and check for any swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. But don’t expect much. I'm a pretty tough specimen, you know? My blood pressure might be a bit high, since I haven't been taking those pills, but I'm sure it's nothing serious. Just get it over with. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 160 over 95. That is elevated. Your pulse is 88, regular. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit strong. Lungs are clear, but you're breathing a little faster than normal. I notice some mild swelling in your ankles and feet. Your skin feels warm and dry. Overall, you appear generally healthy, but the elevated blood pressure and ankle swelling are things we need to address.
PATIENT: 160? See? I told you it was high. But it's not that high. And what do you mean, “strong” heart? It's a strong heart, that's why I can do the work I do. And swelling? Well, I've been on my feet a lot, it's bound to happen. It'll go down when I rest. Honestly, I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I don't need any fancy treatments or pills. Just tell me what I need to do to get through this heat. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Coby, and I appreciate your active role in your health. However, 160/95 is significantly elevated and increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney problems. While you feel strong now, consistently high blood pressure can damage your organs over time. The ankle swelling could be related to the heat and being on your feet, but it could also indicate fluid retention related to your blood pressure. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, you're going to run me into the poorhouse! All this poking and prodding and blood drawing… I haven't got time for all this! And what good will it do? I told you, I feel fine. A bit warm, a bit cranky, maybe a little tired, but that's just the heat. I don't want to waste my time and money on things I don't need. Look, I'll tell you what. Just tell me how to stay cool. Lots of water, stay in the shade... is that too much to ask? I've lived a long life without all these fancy tests. And I intend to keep living it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby, and I respect your wishes. However, I'm concerned about your significantly elevated blood pressure. While staying hydrated and seeking shade are important, they won’t address the underlying issue. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to serious health complications, even if you feel fine now. Given your reluctance to undergo testing at this time, I want to provide you with some strict guidelines to help manage your blood pressure and minimize your risk. I will also document your refusal of blood tests and EKG in your chart. First, I strongly recommend limiting your activity during the hottest part of the day. Second, reduce your salt intake significantly. Third, monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. We can discuss how to do this properly. And finally, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or vision changes, seek immediate medical attention. Would you be willing to agree to those guidelines?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. I’ll try to follow your guidelines. No salt…that’ll be hard. And monitoring my blood pressure…where am I supposed to get one of those things? And what do the numbers even mean? But…yes. I'll try. Just…don't expect miracles. And don’t keep calling me back for more tests. I've got work to do. But I'm telling you, Doctor, if I end up collapsing from heatstroke because I'm not allowed to work, I'm holding you responsible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Coby, and I assure you my goal is to help you stay healthy and safe. I’m not asking you to stop working, just to modify your activity and take precautions. I can provide you with a list of resources for affordable blood pressure monitors and a simple guide on how to read the numbers. I'll also write a prescription for a mild diuretic – a water pill – to help reduce some of the fluid retention. It’s a low dose, and it may help lower your blood pressure slightly. It's important to understand that this is not a long-term solution, and we should revisit the possibility of further testing if your blood pressure doesn’t improve. Before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: A water pill? Now you’re just trying to get me hooked on medicine. I don’t want any pills. I'll try reducing my salt intake and staying cool, but I'm not taking any pills. Look, I'm a practical man. I know my body. I'll be careful. I’ve survived this long, haven’t I? Just…write down what you said about the salt and the numbers, and I’ll see what I can do. And don't expect me to come running back if I feel a little tired. No, I don't have any other questions. I've wasted enough time here already. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. I’ve documented your refusal of the diuretic and your plan to reduce salt intake. Here’s a handout with information on monitoring your blood pressure and recognizing the symptoms of heatstroke. Please read it carefully. I truly hope you take care of yourself and stay safe during this heatwave. If you experience any changes in your condition, or if you develop any concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention, even if it means coming back to see me. I wish you all the best. .
