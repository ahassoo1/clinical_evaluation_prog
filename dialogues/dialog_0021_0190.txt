DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Havird, is it? Yes, well, it’s… this unsteadiness. I’ve been feeling quite off-balance, and it’s a little concerning. It’s hard to explain exactly when it started, to be honest. Things… feel a bit hazy, you understand?
DOCTOR: Hazy, alright. It’s not uncommon to feel a bit unclear on timing when things are…developing. “Off-balance” is a good start, though. Can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a constant thing, thankfully. But sometimes, when I’m walking, it feels like… like the floor isn’t quite steady. Or perhaps I am not steady. It’s difficult to say which. I haven't fallen, not yet, but I have to hold onto things sometimes, just to be sure. Especially when I turn quickly. It’s… unsettling. Is that helpful? I apologize if I’m not being very precise.
DOCTOR: It is something, yes. Holding onto things is a good detail. And it's good you haven’t fallen. “Unsettling” is a perfectly valid description, honestly. Do you notice it happening more in certain situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It seems… worse when I'm tired, definitely. My work is quite physical, you see. Rotary drill operation… it’s demanding. Long hours. So, if I’ve had a particularly long shift, or haven't had enough rest… it’s much more noticeable. I also… I think it's a bit worse in crowds. All the movement around me, it makes it harder to… focus, I suppose. Though, I haven’t been in many crowds recently. It’s all a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Physical work, long hours… that could certainly be contributing. And crowds making it harder to focus, that makes sense too. We’ll need to rule out a few things. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Oh… other symptoms? Let me see. I… I sometimes feel a bit dizzy, yes. Not spinning, exactly. More like… lightheadedness. And occasionally… my vision feels a bit blurry. But I wear glasses, so I just assumed that was them needing adjustment. I haven’t had any headaches, or nausea, or anything like that. Nothing major, at least. Is blurry vision something I should be concerned about? I'm afraid my memory isn't the best, so I may have overlooked something.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision with the unsteadiness is good to know. It's worth investigating. You’re right to point out you wear glasses, that’s important. And no headaches or nausea is helpful. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to check your ears, your eyes, and do a few balance tests. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, proceed. I apologize if I am not a very easy patient, with this… fog, you see. It's just… difficult to recall things clearly. I want to cooperate fully, though.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, we’ll work through it. It's perfectly acceptable to be uncertain. It helps to have a starting point. Alright, if you could just sit up here for me… Let me take a look in your ears first. Any pain or tenderness when I touch around here?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. I don't believe so, at least. It doesn't hurt when you… touch it. Just a bit… strange, perhaps? I’m not used to having things so close to my ear. Is everything alright so far? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I simply want to be certain I am providing you with all the necessary information.
DOCTOR: No, no pain is good. And questions are encouraged, don't apologize. I want you to feel comfortable. Now, I'm going to shine a light in your eyes. Just follow my pen with your gaze. Don't strain, just move your eyes naturally. Okay, good… good… Now look straight ahead. Still following the light?
PATIENT: Yes, I am following the light, Doctor. It’s… a little bright, perhaps? But manageable. I can see it clearly enough. And yes, I'm still looking straight ahead. I'm trying my best to be still, although I fear my focus isn’t always the most… reliable. Is everything appearing normal to you? I’m afraid I can’t see what you’re looking at, of course. Just hoping I'm not making things more difficult.
DOCTOR: A little nystagmus with horizontal gaze. Not significant, but worth noting. And a slight blurring with focus, but again, you do wear glasses. Alright, now if you could just stand up for me… feet together, arms at your sides. And when I say “close your eyes”, just close them, and try to maintain your balance. I'll be right here to catch you if needed. Okay… Close your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh, right. Feet together… arms at my sides. …Here we go. Closing my eyes now. It feels… precarious, Doctor. I'm trying to be very still, but… it’s difficult. I can feel myself swaying a little. I haven’t fallen, but I am definitely less steady. Are you seeing what you expected? I apologize for my lack of grace. It's quite embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Swaying is noted. Mild unsteadiness. Okay, you can open your eyes now. Good. Now, just place one foot directly in front of the other, heel to toe, like you're walking a tightrope. Keep your eyes open. Let’s see how you do with this…
PATIENT: Oh… dear. This is… significantly more difficult than the last one. My apologies. I am having a great deal of trouble with this, Doctor. I feel… quite unsteady. I am trying my best, but it seems my balance is… compromised. I’m afraid I need to hold onto something. May I? I don’t want to fall and… disrupt things. It’s rather humiliating, I must confess.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. It's perfectly alright to sit down. Don’t worry about “disrupting things”. We’re getting information, and this tells me quite a bit. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed in the exam, it could be a few things. The mild nystagmus, the unsteadiness, particularly with tandem stance… it suggests a possible issue with your vestibular system – your inner ear balance. However, it could also be related to fatigue, dehydration, or even medication side effects. We'll need to rule out a few more possibilities. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, inner ear balance… that sounds… concerning. I'm not particularly familiar with that. I certainly hope it’s not anything too serious. Medications… let me see. Just a low-dose blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And occasionally, an over-the-counter pain reliever if I have a headache. But that’s infrequent. Nothing else regularly. I haven’t started anything new recently, to my knowledge. It's hard to keep track, honestly. Everything is… rather blurry. I did have a brief hospital stay a year ago, after… an accident. They gave me some pain medication then, but that was temporary. Does that information help, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril can sometimes cause dizziness as a side effect, although it's less common. And the prior hospitalization is good to know. To be cautious, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check electrolytes, and a referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive vestibular function test. That will help us pinpoint the source of the unsteadiness. In the meantime, I want you to focus on hydration. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. And try to get adequate rest when you can. Are you able to limit any particularly strenuous activity at work?
PATIENT: Oh, testing… that sounds… thorough. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. I would certainly like to know what's causing this, if possible. Hydration… yes, I can focus on hydration. That seems… manageable. And rest… well, that’s a bit more challenging. My work is quite demanding, as I mentioned. Rotary drill operation isn't exactly a restful profession. However, I can certainly try to pace myself a bit more, and perhaps request a lighter workload if possible. My supervisor is usually quite understanding. Will the results of the tests take long to come back, Doctor? And will you contact me directly when they are available? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I am rather anxious about this, you see. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing what’s happening.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be anxious. It's perfectly normal to want answers. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. The audiologist appointment may take a little longer to schedule, depending on their availability. Yes, my office will contact you directly when the results are available. We’ll discuss them in detail and formulate a plan from there. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience severe dizziness, vomiting, or difficulty walking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other concerns I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, a few days… that sounds… reasonable. I suppose I can manage a few days. I will certainly be sure to contact you if anything changes. And yes, I understand about going to the emergency room if things worsen. Hmm… I don't think so. No, I believe that covers everything. I am… quite grateful for your time and attention, Doctor Havird. And I apologize again for being such a… vague patient. I truly appreciate your patience. Perhaps one final question, if you don't mind? Would this unsteadiness… could it worsen over time, if left untreated? I am rather concerned about losing my job, you see. It’s… important to me.
DOCTOR: It could worsen over time, depending on the underlying cause. That's why it’s important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan in place. Ignoring it is not recommended. The sooner we identify the issue, the better the chances of managing it effectively. We’ll do everything we can to help you maintain your current level of function, and address any concerns you have about your job. Alright. I’ll have the lab orders and referral sent to the front desk. If you have any questions before you leave, don't hesitate to ask. Get some rest, Lilyanna, and stay hydrated. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes.
