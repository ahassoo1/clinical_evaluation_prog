DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… the words. They are… not coming so easy anymore. It’s difficult to… find them, you understand? It's been… a little while now. Not every time, but often enough to be… troubling.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating when words don’t come as easily as they used to. “Troubling” is a good word for it. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s been going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this difficulty with finding words?
PATIENT: Hmm… When… that is… a good question. It wasn’t… sudden. It was… gradual. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe longer. It's… difficult to recall precise dates, you see. Things… blur. It started with… small things. Forgetting… a name here and there. Then… it became… more frequent. And… not just names. But… the right words for… things. For… everyday things. It’s… a little embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating when memory isn’t cooperating, and it’s perfectly okay to feel embarrassed – it happens to all of us. The fact that it started gradually is good information. And you're doing great remembering as much as you can, don’t worry about pinpointing exact dates. So, six months or so ago, starting with occasional forgotten names and progressing to difficulty finding words for everyday things. Can you give me an example of what that looks like now?
PATIENT: Yes, an example… Well… just yesterday, I was speaking with my neighbor, a very nice woman, Mrs.… ah… I know her name, it’s on the tip of my tongue… anyway! I was telling her about the… the flowering bush in my garden. The… red one. And I couldn’t… I couldn’t say the word for… the bloom. Not the leaf, the… the colorful part. It was… very frustrating. I kept saying ‘the… the pretty thing’ and she looked… confused, understandably. It took me… a long moment to remember it was a… a rose. A red rose. And things like that happen… often.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a really helpful example, thank you. So, difficulty recalling specific words, even common ones like “rose”, and you find yourself using phrases like “the pretty thing” instead. It sounds like it's impacting your ability to communicate smoothly. Now, beyond the difficulty with words, have you noticed any other changes in your memory or thinking?
PATIENT: Hmm… Other changes… That is… a thoughtful question. I do… sometimes feel… a little more… scattered. Not often, but… I might go into a room and… forget why I went there. Or… I’ll be telling a story and… lose my train of thought. It’s not… complete memory loss, just… little gaps. And… I find myself… repeating things. Asking the same question twice, even if someone just answered it. It's… a little worrisome. My wife… she used to say I was always forgetful, but… this feels different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're noticing some increased forgetfulness beyond just word-finding – like going into a room and not remembering why, losing your train of thought mid-story, and repeating questions. And you’re right to say it feels different than your usual forgetfulness. That's important information. Let's talk about other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision…? Hmm. No, I don’t believe so. I have… always needed glasses, of course. But my vision… hasn't worsened, I think. I had an examination… maybe a year ago? The doctor said it was… stable. No… no changes that I am aware of. I can… see clearly enough. Unless… unless I am very tired, then things… become a little blurry. But that is… normal, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No recent changes in vision, just normal blurriness with fatigue. That's helpful. Now, sometimes difficulties with thinking and memory can be related to things like stress or mood. Have you been feeling particularly stressed or anxious lately, or have you noticed any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Stress…? Well… the last few years… have been… difficult. My wife… she passed away two years ago. It… still feels very recent. I miss her terribly. And… I live alone now. It is… quiet. Sometimes… very quiet. I try to… keep busy. Gardening, reading… but… it can be lonely. I wouldn’t say I am… anxious, exactly. More… sad. And… tired. Very tired. It is… a heavy feeling, Doctor. A heavy feeling.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry for your loss, Sherrell. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling sad and tired after such a significant loss. Grief can have a huge impact on so many things, including our memory and concentration. To help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Ah, medical history… Well… let me see. Years ago, I had… a touch of high blood pressure. But… it was well-controlled with… medication. I stopped taking it… perhaps five years ago? The doctor said it was… under control. And… I had some… cholesterol issues. But… also managed with… pills. I don’t… I don’t think I have any… serious conditions now. I see my primary doctor… regularly. Though… it feels like a long time since my last… thorough check-up. I do have… Medicare, if that is… relevant.
DOCTOR: That is relevant, thank you. And it's good to know you have Medicare. So, a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both previously managed with medication but now under control. I’m going to quickly check your electronic health record here to see your past lab results and doctor's visits. Okay, I see your last comprehensive metabolic panel was about a year ago, and everything looked within normal limits at that time. No recent visits to a neurologist. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any head injuries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Head injuries…? Hmm… that is… a good question. Not… nothing significant. As a young man… I played football. A little. I had a few… bumps to the head. Nothing… serious enough to require a trip to the hospital. Just… little knocks. And… a few falls when I was… older. But… nothing that I remember causing… lasting effects. A few bruises, perhaps. But… no concussions. No… memory loss from any head injuries. I don’t think. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of minor head injuries from football and a few falls, but no documented concussions or significant memory loss from those incidents. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, Sherrell. Just to check your reflexes, balance, and strength. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just as a routine part of the assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is… best. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Everything seems generally okay physically. Your vital signs are good, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good, though a little weaker in your right hand. Your balance is a little unsteady, but nothing too concerning. I did notice some mild difficulty with your balance, and a slight weakness in your right hand. Given your history and the findings of the exam, I think it's important to consider a few possibilities. The difficulty with your memory, word-finding, and slight balance issues could be related to a number of things, including normal age-related changes, stress and grief, or potentially something more. We need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a more detailed look at your brain structure and rule out any abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI…? An MRI… is that… necessary? It sounds… rather… involved. I do… worry about… enclosed spaces. Blood tests… yes, that is… reasonable. But… an MRI? Is there… another way? I understand you are the doctor, and I trust your judgment… but… it does sound… concerning. What… what are we looking for, exactly? And… is it possible it could be… something serious?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Sherrell. It's important you feel comfortable and informed. An MRI is a more involved test, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about enclosed spaces. We can discuss options for managing that anxiety – medication, an open MRI if one is available locally, or even breaking the scan into shorter segments. As for what we're looking for, the MRI helps us rule out several possibilities. It can detect signs of stroke, small bleeds, tumors, or other structural abnormalities in the brain. It also helps us identify changes associated with vascular dementia or other neurodegenerative conditions. I understand your concern. We don’t necessarily expect to find something serious, and I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was important to get a clear picture of what's going on. Your symptoms could be related to grief, stress, and normal aging, but it's important to rule out other possibilities first. Would you like me to explain the MRI procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Explain it… in detail. What… what will it feel like? How long will it… take? And… is it painful? I worry about… being closed in. Will I… be able to breathe? I… I apologize for all the questions. I just… I don't like feeling… trapped. And… if I choose not to have it… what then? What… what are the risks of… not knowing?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. These are excellent questions, and it’s good you're asking them. It’s very common to feel anxious about MRIs. Let’s start with the procedure itself. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It's important to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, even dentures – as they can interfere with the magnet. You'll be alone in the machine during the scan, but I'll be right outside the entire time, and you'll be able to communicate with me through an intercom. You'll also have an emergency call button if you need anything. The scan itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on the details we need to see. During the scan, you’ll hear loud knocking and buzzing sounds. We’ll provide you with headphones to help block out the noise. As for how it feels, the MRI isn’t painful. Most people describe it as lying in a warm, enclosed space. However, if you’re claustrophobic, being closed in can be difficult. We can discuss options for managing that anxiety, such as a mild sedative or an open MRI if one is available locally. Regarding the risks, the MRI itself is very safe. However, if you have any metal implants, it’s important to let us know beforehand. If you choose not to have the MRI, we can proceed with further evaluation based on your symptoms and medical history. That might include more detailed neurological exams, cognitive testing, and blood tests to rule out other possible causes of your memory issues. However, without an MRI, it’s more difficult to get a clear picture of what's going on in your brain. We'd be missing valuable information that could help us make a more accurate diagnosis and develop the best treatment plan for you. Ultimately, the decision is yours. I want you to feel comfortable and informed, and I'll support you either way. Would you like me to provide you with some resources about MRIs, or perhaps discuss other options for managing your anxiety?
PATIENT: That was… very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. Resources… yes, that would be… good. To read about it… in my own time. And… the open MRI… is that… a possibility? If it’s… less enclosed? I… I think I would feel… more comfortable with that. If it’s… available. And… about the anxiety… what kind of… medication would you suggest? Just… something to… calm me down? I do… worry about… the feeling of being trapped. It… it brings back… unpleasant memories. I just… I want to know what’s going on. But… I don’t want to be… frightened.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherrell. Let’s see what we can do. Here are some resources about MRIs that you can read at your own pace. It explains the procedure in detail and addresses common concerns. And here’s a pamphlet about managing anxiety. If you decide to proceed with the MRI, we can discuss options for medication to help you relax. A mild sedative like lorazepam is often used to reduce anxiety during the scan. It's usually very effective, and the effects are temporary. We can also explore non-medication options, like deep breathing exercises or guided imagery. Let me check the availability of an open MRI in the area. Ah, it looks like there is an open MRI facility about 30 minutes from here. It’s less enclosed, which may be more comfortable for you. However, the image quality is slightly lower than a traditional MRI, but it should still provide us with valuable information. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you at the open MRI facility?
PATIENT: Yes… please. The open MRI… that would be… good. Much better. Thirty minutes… that is… manageable. Schedule an appointment… yes. And… if I… if I feel overwhelmed… during the scan… can I… stop it? I just… I need to know I have… control. That I can… stop it if it becomes… too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherrell. You absolutely have control. You can stop the scan at any time, for any reason. The technician will be monitoring you closely throughout the procedure, and you’ll be able to communicate with them through an intercom. If you start to feel overwhelmed, simply tell them to stop, and they will immediately halt the scan. I'll schedule an appointment for you at the open MRI facility. Let me see... how does next Tuesday at 10:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: Next Tuesday at 10:00 AM… that sounds… acceptable. Yes, that is… good. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… very patient and understanding. I appreciate it. Is there… anything else I should know… before the appointment? Any preparation I need to do? Or… any questions you have for me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. I'm glad I could help. Regarding preparation, just make sure to remove any metal jewelry, watches, or dentures before the appointment. You can wear comfortable clothing. Also, please let me know if you have any metal implants in your body, such as a pacemaker or surgical staples. As for questions, I think we've covered everything for now. However, if anything comes to mind before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. We'll also send you a reminder email with detailed instructions before your appointment. For now, I'll order the blood tests and schedule the MRI appointment. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. Blood tests, MRI, follow-up… yes. I feel… much better now. Knowing… what’s going on. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. I appreciate your time and… your kindness. Have a… a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. You have a good day as well, and please take care. .
