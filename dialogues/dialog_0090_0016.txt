DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this… bruising. Seems like I’m getting it from nothing these days. Just a little bump here, a little scratch there, and boom, a purple mess. It’s… concerning, frankly. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, since… well, since my wife passed. And it feels like it’s doing too much.
DOCTOR: Right. The bruising. And you’re concerned it’s related to your anticoagulant. I see you're on warfarin. How long have you been noticing this increased bruising, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get me wrong, I understand why I’m on it. Doctor insisted, and she was a good doctor, my wife’s physician. But honestly, it feels like it’s been getting worse the last… oh, I’d say three, maybe four months? It used to be just the occasional thing, but now… I practically turn color if I look at something wrong. It’s embarrassing, really. And my daughter worries. She keeps telling me to call someone, but I didn’t want to bother you unless it was really… something.
DOCTOR: “Practically turn color…” Right. We need to investigate this properly, Mr. Farson. It’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. We certainly don't want to dismiss your concerns, and your daughter is right to be cautious. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. No bleeding gums, no blood in the urine, nothing like that. Just… the bruising. And, well, a bit of fatigue, but honestly, who doesn’t have fatigue these days? I’m 58 years old, Doctor. That comes with the territory. It’s not like I’m dropping dead from exhaustion or anything. But yeah, the bruising is the main thing. It’s… unsettling, the way it happens so easily. And it's darker than it used to be, I think.
DOCTOR: Darker bruising, and occurring with minimal trauma. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, Mr. Farson. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and then I’d like to take a look at some of these bruises. And I’ll need to palpate your abdomen, just to rule out any internal issues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Palpate my abdomen? Honestly, Doctor, is that really necessary? I mean, I'm not complaining of any stomach pain or anything. It just feels a little… intrusive. But alright, if you think it’s important. I suppose I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, please? I’m a bit sensitive. And please, explain what you’re looking for. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I understand your concern. Palpating your abdomen will allow me to check for any enlargement of the spleen or liver, or any tenderness that might indicate internal bleeding. It’s a standard part of assessing unexplained bruising, particularly in someone on warfarin. It's quite routine, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your vital signs. Can you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But don't go poking around too much. Honestly, Doctor, I don't know why they make doctors so… hands-on these days. Seems like half the appointment is just being prodded and poked. It’s not very dignified. But go ahead. Just… be quick about it. And tell me what you’re looking for, like you said. I need to understand what all this is about.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/85, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Normal. Now, let's take a look at these bruises. Can you point to where you've been noticing them most frequently?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… Here, on my forearm, I bumped it against the doorframe yesterday, and this is what happened. And here, on my shin, I just brushed against the coffee table. And there's one starting on my thigh, I think I just… sat down too hard. It's ridiculous, really. They seem to be everywhere, and they're getting bigger. And darker. It's starting to worry me, Doctor. It really is.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean, Mr. Farson. These bruises are indeed significant in size and discoloration. And they do appear with minimal trauma, as you’ve described. I’m also noting some tenderness to palpation on this one here, on your forearm. Now, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a PT/INR to check your blood clotting levels. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes for this increased bruising and to ensure your warfarin dosage is appropriate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, of course. More poking and prodding. Honestly, Doctor, is this all absolutely necessary? I feel like you're jumping to conclusions. I just bumped into things, maybe I'm getting older, maybe my skin is more fragile. I don't know! Alright, fine. Do the blood work. But if it comes back normal, I want you to explain why you put me through all of this. I don't like being a guinea pig, you know. And what about my daughter? Can she get the results too? She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I understand your frustration. It's my responsibility to rule out any potential causes for your concerns, and the blood work is a necessary step in that process. It’s not about jumping to conclusions, but about being thorough. And yes, your daughter can absolutely receive a copy of the results. We'll need her written consent, of course, but that can be arranged. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take long. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual bleeding – such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool, or any signs of internal bleeding – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… yes, alright. Unusual bleeding. I understand. You know, my wife was always so careful about her health. She’d have all her tests done on time, she’d follow the doctor’s orders to the letter. I’m just… not very good at this sort of thing. I keep putting things off, I forget appointments, I don’t bother the doctor with every little ache and pain. Alright, alright. I’ll go get the blood work done. Just… try to be patient with me, Doctor. I'm doing the best I can.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I understand. And I will do my best. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns. The lab technician will guide you through the process. And thank you for coming in today. It’s important to address these concerns. .
