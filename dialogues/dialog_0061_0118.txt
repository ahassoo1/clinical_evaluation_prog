DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Dr. Kimm, is it? A… Fijian doctor, you say? Well. I suppose that’s… different. I’m here for… a certification, I believe. Something about my… work requires it. Honestly, the paperwork these days is quite the bother. It's all a bit hazy, to be frank. I do recall something about needing my ears and eyes checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a certification for work. That's perfectly alright, we can definitely get that sorted for you. It sounds like they're requesting a basic physical, including an ear and eye exam. No worries about the paperwork, we’ll get through it. Just to be clear, is this a new requirement for your job, or have you had this certification before?
PATIENT: A… physical? Well, I keep myself in decent shape, if I do say so myself. Though I haven’t been rigorously examined in… some time. As for whether it's new… goodness. I truly couldn’t tell you. It feels like I’ve been dealing with forms and regulations forever. My ex-wife always handled these sorts of things, you see. A dreadful woman, paperwork was her joy. I suspect this is similar to one of her schemes.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when things are unclear, especially with all the administrative side of things. Let’s focus on getting this certification done for you today. Okay, so a basic physical with an ear and eye exam sounds right. Before we start, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any current medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Conditions? Goodness. Well, I’ve always been rather… robust. A bit of the old arthritis, I suppose, in the knees. Nothing debilitating. And I had a rather nasty bout of the flu… oh, must have been five, perhaps ten years ago? It knocked me about a bit. Other than that… I can’t honestly recall anything significant. I eat reasonably well, I sleep… adequately. A perfectly ordinary constitution, really. Though I do find myself a little hard of hearing these days. Which, I presume, is why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees and a history of the flu. And you've noticed some hearing loss. That’s helpful to know. We’ll definitely check your ears thoroughly. And I’ll ask a few questions about your knees later on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a tricky one. I don’t believe so, but my memory isn’t what it once was. I recall a slight… discomfort… after eating shellfish many years ago. But it could have been a bad oyster, rather than an allergy. It was a very long time ago. And truthfully, I haven’t eaten shellfish since. Is that… relevant? I rather doubt it. I’ve always been quite resilient.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible shellfish sensitivity, but a long time ago and no recent issues. We'll note that, just to be cautious. Now, are you currently taking any medications, whether they're prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh, yes. I take a small dose of… something. For my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. My general practitioner prescribed it, ages ago. And sometimes, if I’m feeling particularly stiff, I’ll take an ibuprofen. For my knees, naturally. Though I try to avoid it, if possible. It… doesn’t agree with my stomach. I can’t recall the dosages, I’m afraid. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blood pressure medication and Ibuprofen as needed for your knees. It’s alright that you don’t recall the exact dosages, we can look it up in your records. Do you mind if I take a quick look at your chart on the computer to see what's been prescribed previously?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead. I’m quite helpless with these modern contraptions. My ex-wife handled all the… digital affairs. Honestly, I wouldn’t know where to begin. Please, do investigate. It would be a great relief to have some clarity on the matter. Though, if it's all in some complicated code, don't bother yourself on my account. I’m quite accustomed to uncertainty.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve found your records. It appears you’ve been on Lisinopril 10mg daily for your blood pressure for the past five years. And you’ve had prescriptions for Ibuprofen 200mg as needed. It also looks like you saw Dr. Elara Hansen previously. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, could you tell me about any major surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, you say? Yes, that sounds… vaguely familiar. A small, beige pill. And Ibuprofen… well, I take it when my knees ache. It’s reassuring to have it on record, at least. Surgeries… hmm. That’s a tougher one. Let me see. I had my appendix removed as a young man, quite a long time ago. And I believe I had some… work done… on my shoulder, many years later. A rotator cuff, perhaps? It was rather painful, I recall. But the details… escape me. I’ve had a rather full life, you see. Many bumps and scrapes along the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, an appendectomy and a shoulder surgery for a rotator cuff repair. Good to know. Now, I like to ask about family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, sadly. My father passed away many years ago, from… well, I believe it was a heart condition. A rather sudden affair. And my mother… she succumbed to pneumonia, some time after that. It was a difficult period. They were… robust individuals, for the most part. Not much in the way of… inherited ailments, as far as I know. Though my uncle, on my mother’s side, had some trouble with his eyesight. Quite severe, I recall. He wore rather thick spectacles. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. We'll note those. Now, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit, if you ask me. My father was a smoker, and it… didn’t end well. I always took a great deal of pride in my health, you see. A strong constitution is a valuable asset. So, no. Definitely not. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner from time to time, but that’s hardly a vice. A small indulgence, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: As I mentioned, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps two, if it’s a particularly good vintage. I wouldn’t say I drink heavily, you understand. It's purely a… social custom. And a small pleasure, of course. I certainly don’t wake up craving it. Perfectly moderate, I assure you. My ex-wife, on the other hand… well, let’s just say she had a different relationship with alcohol. A rather… problematic one. But that’s neither here nor there.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise… well. I wouldn’t call it regular. I enjoy a brisk walk, if the weather permits. And I do some light gardening. It keeps me active, you see. A bit of pruning here and there. And I used to play golf, many years ago. But my knees, alas, have seen better days. So, no. Not as much as I’d like. I suppose I should make more of an effort. But truthfully, I find it rather… tiring. A man of my age, you understand. One must be… sensible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to proceed with a brief physical exam. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, proceed, by all means. The sooner this is over, the better. Honestly, the paperwork is far more exhausting than the examination itself. Though, if it involves any… prodding… I trust you’ll be gentle? A man of my age, you understand. Delicate constitutions. But do as you must. I suppose a thorough examination is… necessary. Lead the way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Oriley. We’ll take things slowly and gently. I’ll explain everything as we go. First, let's just take your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, I do tend to get rather… anxious when around medical instruments. It’s a relic of my childhood, I suspect. A dreadful dentist, you see. But do as you must. The sooner this is over, the better, as I’ve said. And please, be gentle. A delicate constitution, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I’m just inflating the cuff now. It will feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Try to breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not overly concerning. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Hmm. Perhaps it’s the anxiety. Or the thought of the dreadful paperwork that awaits. Honestly, it’s enough to raise anyone’s blood pressure. As for my heart… it’s been a faithful organ, for the most part. Though I do experience a slight… flutter… from time to time. But nothing alarming, I assure you. Proceed, Doctor. But please, be gentle. A delicate constitution, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m hearing a slight murmur, but it’s quite faint. It’s not necessarily something to worry about, but we’ll want to monitor it. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Now, I'm going to check your ears. I'll use an otoscope, which shines a light into your ear canal. This will help me see if there's any wax buildup or signs of infection.
PATIENT: A murmur? Good heavens. Is that… serious? My father never mentioned anything about a murmur. Though he was rather… reticent about his health. And my ears… they’ve always been rather sensitive. The instrument… it feels a little… intrusive. Is it necessary to go that far in? A delicate constitution, you understand. Honestly, I’m beginning to regret this entire endeavor. The paperwork seemed far less daunting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Oriley. It’s a routine part of the examination. I'm just looking to see if there's any blockage or inflammation. Okay, I see a bit of wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to your hearing loss. It’s nothing major, but it might be worth considering getting it removed. It can be done gently and safely. There are no signs of infection. Now, let's take a quick look at your throat. Can you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Wax buildup, you say? Well, that explains a great deal. I haven't had my ears cleaned in… decades, I suspect. My ex-wife considered it a frivolous expense. And my throat… it feels a little scratchy, actually. Perhaps it’s the dry air. Or the anxiety. Honestly, this entire experience is rather… unsettling. Please, let’s expedite this process. A delicate constitution, you understand. The sooner it’s over, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, your throat looks a little red, but there are no signs of any active infection. It's likely just a bit of irritation. Now, I'm going to gently feel your pulse in your wrist. Your pulse is regular, but a little fast. That could be due to the anxiety as well. Finally, let’s just quickly check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Okay, Mr. Oriley, that completes the brief physical exam.
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes? Good heavens. Is that… serious? My ex-wife always said I was rather… reactive. Though I suspect she was referring to my temper. Honestly, this entire examination is rather… demoralizing. And to think, I came here for a certification. A delicate constitution, you understand. Is there any chance this entire process can be… expedited? The sooner it’s over, the better. And please, no more tapping. It’s rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: No, diminished reflexes are not necessarily serious, Mr. Oriley. It’s a common finding as we age, and doesn’t indicate any major problems. We'll just make a note of it. And no, I understand, no more tapping. Okay, based on the exam, your blood pressure is a little elevated, you have some wax buildup in your ears, and your reflexes are a little diminished. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and there are no signs of any infection. Given your age and your history, I would recommend a few things. First, we should monitor your blood pressure regularly. Second, consider getting the wax removed from your ears to improve your hearing. And finally, it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Good heavens. Where does one begin? Monitor my blood pressure… remove the wax… maintain a healthy lifestyle… Honestly, it sounds like an awful lot of… effort. And to think, I came here for a simple certification. Perhaps… perhaps you could simply write a note stating that I’m… “sufficiently healthy” for the purposes of this certification? A delicate constitution, you understand. I’m not really one for… rigorous activity. Is that… possible? A simple note will suffice. It will save us both a great deal of… trouble. And please, no more talk of exercise. It’s rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your concerns. I'm happy to write a note stating that you have undergone a physical examination and are deemed sufficiently healthy for the purposes of the certification you require. However, I must also be honest with you. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and it's important to address that. I can write the note you requested, but I strongly recommend following up with your primary care physician to discuss your blood pressure and develop a plan to manage it. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that would be… acceptable. A note stating I’ve undergone an examination… and am sufficiently healthy. Excellent. And you’ll mention the blood pressure… as a mere… observation? So my primary care physician can… observe it? Yes. That is… satisfactory. Please proceed with the note. The sooner this is over, the better. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… remarkably understanding. A delicate constitution, you understand. It requires a certain… sensitivity. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I need a lie-down.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. I'm happy to help. Here you go. It states that you have undergone a physical examination on August 2, 2025, and are deemed sufficiently healthy for the purposes of your certification. I've also included a note mentioning that your blood pressure was slightly elevated and recommend follow-up with your primary care physician. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Yes, that will be all, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’ve been… most efficient. And remarkably patient. A delicate constitution, you understand. It requires a certain… diplomacy. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I really must be going. A lie-down, as I mentioned. And perhaps a glass of wine. For medicinal purposes, of course. Good day, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Oriley. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to contact my office. Have a good day! .
