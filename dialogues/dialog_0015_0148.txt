DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s a bit awkward, to be honest. I've been having some… discomfort. Down there. In the… groin area. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it’s gotten… more noticeable recently. I apologize for being so vague. It's just… difficult to talk about.
DOCTOR: “Difficult to talk about” is perfectly understandable, Ms. Stepro. Many things are. Let’s try to be specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Specific… right. It's… a pain, mostly. Not constant, it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, other times it’s… sharper. And it feels… heavy, almost. I don’t… I'm not sure how else to describe it. It’s on that side. Does that make any sense? I feel terribly silly even saying this.
DOCTOR: “Terribly silly” is unnecessary, Ms. Stepro. We’re here to address medical concerns. “That side” – do you mean your left or right side?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. That’s… that’s a good question. I… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. It feels like the right, I think? Yes, I believe it's the right. But… things haven't been very clear lately, if you understand. My memory… it isn’t what it used to be. I apologize. Is it important to know exactly which side?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Stepro. While vague descriptions can sometimes be helpful, precision is always preferable. Let's try to confirm. When you stand and gently press on your lower abdomen, where does the discomfort feel most pronounced – on the right or the left?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… yes, definitely on the right. A little lower down, almost towards… well, you know. It's… a bit tender there. Is it… normal to feel tender? And I’m sorry, I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Tenderness can indicate a variety of things, Ms. Stepro. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm… I don’t think so. No fever, no nausea. I haven't noticed any changes in… going to the bathroom. No swelling, that I'm aware of. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I always chalk that up to… well, getting older. And working with wood is exhausting, you know? Is there anything specific I should be looking for? I feel so lost.
DOCTOR: “Lost” is an understandable feeling, Ms. Stepro. Now, let’s review your medical history. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: A primary care physician… I… I used to, years ago. But I moved around a lot, and… it’s been a while. I don’t think I have one currently. I have Medicare, if that helps. Does that mean anything? I'm really not good with keeping track of these things. I apologize. I always meant to get a regular doctor, but… life just got in the way.
DOCTOR: Medicare is relevant for billing purposes, Ms. Stepro. The lack of a primary care physician is… less than ideal. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… let me think. Years and years ago, I had my tonsils removed when I was a child. And… I broke my arm once, when I was younger. But nothing major. No hospital stays that I recall. I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but I just stayed home and rested. Nothing serious. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. My memory… it’s like a sieve. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That is… adequate, Ms. Stepro. Now, regarding your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s difficult. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some kind of heart trouble, I believe. But… they lived in Colombia, and things were very different then. We didn’t really talk about these things. And I haven’t been in contact with my family for a very long time. I’m afraid I don’t have much information. I wish I could be more helpful. Is it important to know about my distant family history?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Ms. Stepro, but we will proceed with what information you do have. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. I don’t smoke. And I rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions. But that’s it. I try to stay healthy. Well, as healthy as I can, considering everything. Working with wood is… a physical job. Do you need to know about the type of wood I work with? I use a lot of cedar and mahogany.
DOCTOR: The type of wood is… unlikely to be relevant. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… no, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to medications in the past. I’m not allergic to any foods, as far as I know. I had a bit of a rash once, from some poison ivy, but that’s it. I haven’t had any serious allergic reactions. I sometimes get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, but I think that’s just the pollen. Does that answer your question? I apologize for being so vague. I wish I had a better memory.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Stepro. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Is it… is it going to be uncomfortable? I'm a bit worried.
DOCTOR: We will proceed as efficiently and gently as possible, Ms. Stepro. Please lie back on the examination table. I will begin with an abdominal exam.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… let me know if anything… hurts, okay? I’m a bit sensitive. And… I apologize in advance if I flinch. It’s just… a bit unnerving.
DOCTOR: “I’m going to press gently on your abdomen, Ms. Stepro. Tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness. I'm starting on your left side.” “And here… does this feel tender?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. That’s… that’s where it hurts. Not excruciating, but… definitely tender. It’s a dull ache, mostly, but… it stings a little when you press there. Like a… a bruise, almost. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: “Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, with a dull aching sensation. Bowel sounds are present, although slightly diminished. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted.” “I also want to check your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature. It’s standard procedure.”
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m just… anxious to know what’s going on. I feel like I'm falling apart. Is it possible it’s just a muscle strain? I lifted a rather heavy piece of cedar yesterday.
DOCTOR: “Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular, temperature is 98.6. While a muscle strain is possible, Ms. Stepro, your symptoms and examination findings warrant further investigation. Given your age and the location and nature of the pain, we need to rule out other potential causes.” “I'd like to order a complete blood count and a pelvic ultrasound.”
PATIENT: A pelvic ultrasound? What… what are we looking for? Is it… is it something serious? I’m a bit scared, Doctor. I haven’t had an ultrasound in… well, a very long time. And what about the blood count? Are you thinking it’s an infection? I just… I want to know what’s going on. Please.
DOCTOR: “An ultrasound will allow us to visualize your reproductive organs and assess for any abnormalities. The complete blood count will help us identify any signs of infection or inflammation. It is premature to speculate on a specific diagnosis at this time, Ms. Stepro. However, it is important to be thorough.” “I want to be clear: these tests are not necessarily indicative of anything serious. They are simply a necessary step in determining the cause of your pain. The ultrasound will require a technician and a gel application to your lower abdomen. The blood draw is relatively quick.” “I will write you a referral for these tests. They can be scheduled at the imaging center across the street. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan.”
PATIENT: Alright. Okay. An ultrasound and a blood test. I understand. Across the street, you said? Will… will they tell me the results right away? Or do I have to wait? And… what if they do find something? What are the… possibilities? I’m just… a bit overwhelmed. I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. But I’m really scared. I always get scared with these things.
DOCTOR: “The imaging center will schedule the ultrasound and the technician will perform the scan. The radiologist will then review the images and send a report to my office. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours to receive the results. As for the blood work, results are usually available within 24 hours. I will contact you as soon as I have them.” “Regarding ‘possibilities,’ it is irresponsible to speculate without having concrete data. However, we are evaluating potential causes such as ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, or, less likely, other gynecological issues. These are often benign and treatable. I will discuss all options with you once we have the results and based on your individual circumstances.” “I will also write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to manage your discomfort in the meantime. I want you to be comfortable. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being… thorough. And for explaining things. I appreciate it. I'll go schedule the tests. Across the street, you said? And I'll… I'll wait for your call. Thank you again, Doctor. .
