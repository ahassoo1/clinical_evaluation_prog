DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I'm Dr. Gorga. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. It's just… not feeling right. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Everything feels a little blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, “tummy feels big” and not much appetite… and you said it’s been going on for a while, but you’re having trouble remembering exactly when?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A while. Maybe… a few weeks? Or longer? It's hard to say. I used to be such a good cook, you know? Always making things for everyone. Now… not so much. I just don't feel hungry. And it’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly. Just… full and heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, full and heavy, not painful. No recent changes in your bowel habits, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. I… I don’t really know what that means, Doctor. I go to the bathroom… when I need to. Hasn’t changed much, I don’t think. Everything feels… slow these days. Maybe a little less than usual? But I don’t keep track of such things. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Soila. We'll take it slow. When you go to the bathroom… is it easy, or do you have to strain?
PATIENT: Oh. Easy, mostly. Sometimes… a little pushing, but nothing terrible. It's just… well, getting old, you know? Everything takes a little more effort. I used to be so strong, always working in the garden. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any… blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh my. No, no blood. Not that I’ve seen. I always… check, a little. But no, nothing like that. That sounds… scary. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: No, no, just routine questions, Soila. Don’t worry. Now, have you had any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no vomiting. No. Just… not wanting to eat. And feeling… tired. Very tired. I sleep a lot these days. More than I used to. It's hard to get things done, you know? I used to keep the house so tidy.
DOCTOR: Tired, sleeping more… Okay. Any changes in your weight, Soila?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Weight… I don't know. I haven't weighed myself in… a long time. Maybe I've lost a little? My clothes feel a little looser, but… I’m not sure. Everything is just… confusing lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Let’s do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I’ll listen to your tummy and feel around a bit. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. My tummy… it doesn’t hurt, really. Just… feels strange. Like a balloon, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's listen… take a few deep breaths for me. Okay… and now I’m just going to feel around a bit. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really tender. Just… a little bit uncomfortable when you press here. Not pain, like I said. Just… full. And… sort of… hard? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. A little firmness there… I’m also noticing some slight swelling. Okay. It doesn’t sound like anything acutely dangerous, but we need to rule a few things out. I think we should do some blood work, just to check your overall health, and maybe an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at what’s going on inside. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and… an ultrasound? Oh dear. Is something very wrong, Doctor? I don’t like the sound of that. I don’t do well with… machines. But… if you think it's best, I suppose. What will the ultrasound show?
DOCTOR: No, no, it doesn't necessarily mean something is very wrong, Soila. It's just a precaution. The ultrasound is a way to get a better picture of your organs – your liver, your gallbladder, your kidneys – and see if anything is causing your discomfort. It’s painless and non-invasive. The blood work will just tell us about your overall health – things like your blood count, your kidney function, and so on. It's just to be thorough, okay?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. A picture. Not… painful. That’s good. And just to check my health. Yes, I suppose that makes sense. I just… I don’t want any surprises, Doctor. I’ve had enough surprises in my life. Will it take long?
DOCTOR: No surprises, I understand. The blood work will take just a few minutes, and the ultrasound usually takes about 20-30 minutes. We’ll have the results back in a few days, and we can discuss them then. I'll order those tests for you now. While we’re waiting, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… let me think. Not much, really. Just… a little pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a long time ago. And sometimes, a pain reliever for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. But not every day. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I think the blood pressure pill is… white? And the other one is… small and yellow, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill for blood pressure and a small yellow pill for arthritis, taken as needed. Do you know the dosages of either of those?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dosages? No, I don't. I just take them like the doctor told me. He… he used to write it down, but I think I lost the paper. Everything gets lost these days. I just… take one of each, when I need to. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. We can try to figure it out. Do you remember which doctor prescribed those medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… Dr. Volkov, I think. Yes, Dr. Volkov. He was a very nice man. He retired a long time ago, though. I haven’t seen him in… oh, I don’t know how long. Many years. He had a practice… near the park? Or maybe it was by the river… It’s all very blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dr. Volkov… We’ll see if we can find any information on those medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Oh! Once, a long time ago, I had a rash when I ate strawberries. But that was when I was a little girl. And… I think I sneezed a lot when I was around cats, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? Nothing else that I can remember, Doctor. I don’t have many allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a rash with strawberries as a child, and some sneezing around cats. Alright, Soila, I’m going to order these blood tests and the abdominal ultrasound for you. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. After that, we’ll schedule the ultrasound appointment. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… will it hurt? The tests, I mean. And will you… will you tell me what’s wrong, if something is wrong? I don't want to be left wondering.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a quick pinch, nothing major. And the ultrasound is painless. And yes, absolutely, I will explain everything to you, Soila. Whatever the results are, we'll discuss them together, and we'll make a plan. I promise. Now, I’ll leave you in the nurse's capable hands. She’ll be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel better. Bye bye to you too.
