DOCTOR: Hi Karry, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s about some shots needed for paperwork. My daughter… she’s tryin’ to get things sorted to come live here, and I understand there are requirements for vaccinations. I need to know what all’s needed, and if I need any myself to help with the process. It’s a bit confusing, all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be confusing, all the immigration paperwork and vaccine requirements. It's good you're getting it sorted out now. So, to clarify, you're needing to determine what vaccinations your daughter needs to fulfill immigration requirements, and you’re also wondering if you need any vaccinations, potentially as part of the process or just for your own health?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly right, Doctor. My daughter is the main concern, of course. But I figure while we’re here, it wouldn't hurt to check if I am up-to-date on everything as well. I haven't had a shot in… well, a long time, I reckon. It’s mostly about making sure she can come here without any trouble, though. She’s been through enough already.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can definitely get both of you assessed. Let’s start with your daughter. Do you have any records of her previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. She… she came from a difficult situation, and records weren’t always easy to keep. I think she had some as a child, basic things… but I don’t have anything official, no. I’m afraid that’s one of the problems. We’ll likely have to start fresh, won’t we?
DOCTOR: It sounds like we will need to proceed as if she has no vaccination record, yes. That's perfectly alright; it happens frequently. We'll focus on getting her up-to-date with the recommended vaccinations for adults. To give you the most accurate information, I'm going to pull up the current CDC guidelines for adult vaccinations required for immigration purposes. Just one moment... Okay, here we are. For immigration, the required vaccinations generally include verification of immunity to measles, mumps, rubella , tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis , varicella , influenza, hepatitis B, and sometimes Haemophilus influenzae type b , depending on her age. We'll need to determine if she's had these, or if she needs a series of vaccinations. Before we start, do you know if she’s ever had chickenpox?
PATIENT: Well, that's a fair amount, isn't it? It's good to have a list, though. Helps to know what we’re dealin’ with. Chickenpox… hmm. I believe she did, as a child. She was quite sick with it, I remember her being very uncomfortable. But, like the other shots, I don’t have any proof of it. Would a doctor’s note from her previous country be accepted, do you think? Or is that too difficult?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know she likely had chickenpox. A note from a doctor in her previous country could be accepted, but it needs to be properly translated and verified. It often depends on the specific requirements of the immigration officials, and sometimes they prefer a repeat vaccination just to be safe. It can be a bit of a hassle, honestly. Since we don’t have proof, and to avoid any complications with the immigration process, we can go ahead and administer the varicella vaccine. It's a two-dose series, given 4-8 weeks apart. It’s usually well-tolerated. Before we do that, let's talk about your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: That makes sense about the note, I suppose. Better safe than sorry. And yes, doing the shot now seems the easiest path. Let me see… serious illnesses… I had pneumonia when I was younger, a long time ago, but I recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. Other than that, not much. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I try to stay active, walk every day if the weather allows. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia and gallbladder removal – I’ve made a note of both. That’s good to know you're generally healthy and stay active. Have you ever had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. Let me see… I don’t think so. No known allergies, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My daughter does have a mild allergy to penicillin, but that’s her issue, not mine. Just me, I’m clear. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had any trouble.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies is good. And thank you for letting me know about your daughter’s penicillin allergy; we’ll make sure to document that in her chart as well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my knees, Doctor. They get a bit creaky with the weather, you see. I take glucosamine and chondroitin, just the over-the-counter kind. That's it. No prescriptions, nothin' else. And I only take it when they’re botherin’ me, not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine and chondroitin as needed for your knees. Noted. Let’s just do a quick check of your vitals, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated but not concerning at this moment. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything feels normal here. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, you seem to be in good health. Given your daughter’s situation, and to cover all bases, I recommend we proceed with a tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis booster for both of you, as well as the varicella vaccine for your daughter. We can also administer the influenza vaccine when it becomes available in the fall. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so clearly. Yes, doin’ those shots seems like the best plan. And the flu shot in the fall, absolutely. I wouldn’t want either of us gettin’ sick. When can we get started? And… will this be covered by my insurance?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad we’re on the same page. I’ll order the Tdap vaccine for both of you, and the varicella vaccine for your daughter. Let’s get that done today. Regarding insurance coverage, let me check your benefits quickly… Okay, good news. Both the Tdap and varicella vaccines should be fully covered under your current plan, with no co-pay. However, it’s always a good idea to double-check with your insurance provider to confirm. Nurse, can you please prepare the vaccinations for Mr. Skarbek and his daughter?
PATIENT: That’s a relief to hear about the insurance, Doctor. Thank you for checkin’ on that for me. I appreciate it. I reckon we should get this over with, then. I don’t particularly like shots, but I know they’re necessary. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No problem at all. And I understand your apprehension; most people don’t enjoy shots! The nurse will come in shortly and explain the process. It’s a very quick procedure. You’ll just need to expose your upper arm, and she’ll administer the injection. There may be some mild soreness or redness at the injection site for a day or two, but that’s normal. If you experience any severe side effects, such as a high fever or difficulty breathing, please contact us immediately. She will also provide you with vaccination record cards documenting the vaccines you received today. It’s important to keep these cards in a safe place, as you may need them for immigration purposes or future medical appointments. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. Just get it over with, I suppose. I’m ready when the nurse is. Thank you again for your help with all of this. It’s a weight off my mind knowin’ we’re gettin’ it sorted.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It’s my pleasure to help. Here’s the nurse now. She’ll take great care of you both. .
