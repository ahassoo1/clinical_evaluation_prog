DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. Twenty-three, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though…it feels like longer than that, honestly. I apologize if I seem…scattered. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Look, we all get busy. Don’t worry about it. Just…try to focus. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s…this unsteadiness. I keep losing my balance. It’s been happening more and more lately, and it’s quite worrying, especially with my line of work. I operate a rotary drill…for oil and gas. It requires…a steady hand, you understand. It's hard to explain, it doesn't happen all the time, but when it does…it's frightening.
DOCTOR: Oil and gas, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It…was my husband’s work originally. And then…well, then it became mine. It's demanding, physically. Though, I’m not sure if that has anything to do with this. I mostly just…feel off-balance sometimes. Like the room is swaying, even when it isn’t. It's difficult to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dizziness. Happens to the best of us. Probably just dehydration, or low blood sugar. You been eating regularly?
PATIENT: I…try to. It’s hard, though. The shifts are long, and sometimes…things just slip my mind. Like remembering to eat, or drink enough water. I apologize, I know it sounds foolish. I just…haven’t been feeling myself lately, generally. It's not just the balance, though that is the most concerning part. Is it possible it’s something more serious? I have private insurance, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Private insurance doesn't cure things, Ms. Snerling. But alright, alright. Let’s not jump to conclusions. When you say “not yourself,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific…hmm. It's…difficult. Like a fog, sometimes. Trouble concentrating, I suppose. And…I've been forgetting things. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was saying mid-sentence… things like that. And a…a general feeling of…unease. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, or a sudden illness. Just…a dullness. I’m so sorry I'm not being very clear.
DOCTOR: Right. Fog. Okay. Any headaches with this “fog”?
PATIENT: Occasionally. Not…debilitating headaches, but more like a pressure behind my eyes. They come and go. It’s not constant, and they don’t usually require anything more than a little rest. Though…they have been more frequent lately, now that I think about it. And I have noticed some…ringing in my ears, sometimes. A faint hum. It’s quite bothersome when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ringing. Pressure. Look, Ms. Snerling, it sounds like stress. You're working a demanding job, long hours. Probably just need to slow down, take a few days off. You know, de-stress. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Sit back.
PATIENT: I…I suppose that is possible. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been able to take a day off in quite some time. The work…it needs to be done. And…and my husband…he would always say I was the steady one. It’s ironic, isn’t it? Of course, sir. Please, proceed. I'll do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Take a deep breath...and exhale. Again. Alright. Now, have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. I haven’t noticed anything drastic. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes things seem…a little blurry around the edges. Not constantly, but…especially when I'm tired. And…I've occasionally had a little trouble with my depth perception. It's very subtle, though. I just figured it was…fatigue. I apologize for being so vague. I’m trying to recall everything as best I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Snerling, you said you've been forgetting things. Can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: A specific example… Just yesterday, I went to refill my medication…the one for my blood pressure. And I completely forgot the name of it. I stood at the pharmacy counter for a full five minutes, trying to remember. Eventually, the pharmacist was kind enough to look it up for me. It was…humiliating, to be honest. And…and last week, I started to cook dinner, and then completely forgot what I was making. I just…stared at the ingredients, completely lost. It’s small things, mostly, but they are becoming more frequent.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, Ms. Snerling, it sounds like you're under a lot of stress, and frankly, not taking care of yourself. I’m going to order some bloodwork - just a basic panel to rule out anything obvious. And I'm going to recommend you take some time off, get some rest, and maybe see a therapist to help manage the stress. We can discuss medication if the stress is overwhelming. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Bloodwork sounds…reasonable. And I suppose…therapist. I haven't…ever considered that before. But…if it might help, then yes, that sounds alright. I understand you're busy, sir, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Though, honestly…a part of me is frightened. What if it isn't just stress? What if it’s something more serious? I apologize, I'm being quite emotional.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Snerling, we're not going to jump to conclusions. Most likely, it's stress and fatigue. But the bloodwork will give us a baseline. The nurse will draw it for you before you leave. We'll call you with the results in a few days. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. No known allergies. I… used to take penicillin as a child, but I don’t recall any reaction. Honestly, my memory is so patchy, I wouldn’t even be certain about that. But…no. No known allergies, to my best recollection. And…what kind of results are you looking for, with the bloodwork? I apologize for asking, it’s just…I worry. A lot.
DOCTOR: Standard things. Rule out anemia, check your thyroid, make sure your electrolytes are balanced. You know, basic stuff. Look, I have other patients waiting, Ms. Snerling. The nurse will explain everything more thoroughly. Here's a requisition form for the bloodwork. Just take it to the lab down the hall. Try to get some rest, and don't worry so much. Next.
PATIENT: Right. Of course. Standard things. I…thank you, sir. And…thank you for your time. I…I suppose I’ll see the nurse then. .
