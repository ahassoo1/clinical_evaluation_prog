DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Chest… feel funny. And heart… bang-bang too fast sometimes. Blood pressure… wife say it high. She worry too much, always. But… yeah. That’s why I here. Quick now, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, “chest feels funny” and palpitations… fast heartbeat. And your wife is concerned about your blood pressure. Okay. Let’s try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? What specific? It feels bad! Like… tight. Like someone sitting on my chest. And heart… just goes fast. Especially after I eat. Or when I get… upset. My neighbor, always parking in my spot… makes my heart go crazy. Is that… important? Just tell me what you need to know, quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mr. Sobkowicz, even if it's… frustrating. Okay. So, this tightness and rapid heartbeat – how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Long time. Years, maybe? Old man problems, you know? I don't keep track of these things. Wife says… since the big snowstorm last winter it worse. She always remember everything. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s been ongoing for years, but worsened since last winter’s snowstorm. And it's triggered by eating and stress – like with your neighbor. Do you feel any pain in your chest at all with this tightness, or just pressure?
PATIENT: Pressure. Not… sharp pain. Like… heavy. Like someone put a brick on me. Not a knife. Not a hurt hurt, just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And makes me tired. I nap a lot now. Old man things, I tell you. Can we get this over with? My garden needs weeding.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure, not sharp pain, makes you tired. Let’s take your blood pressure now, just to get a baseline. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It’s just a routine check, Mr. Sobkowicz. If you could just sit here and relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Relax? Hmph. Easy for you to say. Fine, fine. Get it over with. Don't take too long. My wife… she will want to know all the numbers. She always does. Hurry now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 158 over 92. That is a bit high. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths for me, Mr. Sobkowicz. In… and out…
PATIENT: Deep breaths… hmph. What are you listening for? Is something wrong? I knew I should have just stayed home and weeded. This is a waste of my time. And my wife will be mad I was out so long if you don’t find anything. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: I hear a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of crackling in your lungs, but nothing immediately alarming. To get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to see what's happening in your lungs. Also, a basic blood workup to check your cholesterol and other levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Hmph. I don't like tests. Too much poking and prodding. Can't I just take a pill? My neighbor takes a pill for everything. Is there a pill for this? Just a simple pill? I don’t want to spend all day in a hospital. My garden… Tests… always tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your reluctance, but without these tests, it’s difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms and what the best course of treatment is. A pill might help temporarily, but it won't address the underlying problem. Think of it this way: it's better to know what we're dealing with so we can get you feeling better, and prevent something more serious down the line. The tests are relatively quick and painless. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… hmph. Fine. But make it quick. And no waiting all day. I have things to do. And tell them… be gentle. I'm an old man, you know. Don't want any broken bones. And my wife… she will drive me. And she’ll want all the details. Every single detail. Can we just get this over with? Tomorrow. Fine. But quick. Really quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ve scheduled you for an EKG and chest X-ray tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. It shouldn't take more than an hour or so. I'll also send the lab order for the blood work to your wife, she can schedule that at your convenience. I want you to take it easy tomorrow, avoid strenuous activity. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Hmph. I’ll be fine. Just old man aches. No need for emergencies. Just… quick tests. And no waiting. Tell them… be gentle. And tell my wife… everything. She needs to know everything. Can I go now? My garden is calling. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Sobkowicz. Here's the information you'll need. Please let my office know if you have any questions. And please, don't dismiss any new or worsening symptoms. It's always best to be cautious. Have a good day… and try to relax a bit. Perhaps some light gardening, but don’t overdo it. .
