DOCTOR: Alright, Criston, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello. Good to meet you too, Doctor… Auelua, yes? Um, it’s my… my water. It’s orange. Like, really orange. It started a few days ago. Not sure why.
DOCTOR: Yes, Auelua is correct. And please, call me Neeraj. Orange urine, you say?
PATIENT: Okay, Neeraj. Yes, orange. It’s… hard to explain. Not a little bit orange, very orange. Like, the color of… a carrot, maybe? I drink water, and it comes out… like that. It doesn’t hurt or anything. Just… weird.
DOCTOR: Right, carrot-colored urine. That is unusual. And it's good to hear you're not experiencing any pain. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when it started exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think it was… maybe last Tuesday? Or Wednesday. It was after I worked. I do… building work, mostly. A lot of walking around, outside. I had a lot of water that day, because it was hot. Then I noticed it when I went to the bathroom that night. I didn’t think much of it at first. But it’s still happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started mid-week after a day of work in the heat with increased water intake. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the orange urine?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I’m a little tired, but… I always am a little tired from the work. Nothing else. No… pain, no fever, no… funny smells or anything. Just the water. And it’s worrying me a bit. My wife… she said I should come see you.
DOCTOR: Alright, good on your wife for encouraging you to come in. It’s always best to get things checked out when you're concerned. Let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets headaches. And my back… it’s sore from the work, like I said. But no… doctor has never told me anything bad. I take nothing for it. Just… rest. I have insurance, the private kind. My wife takes care of all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diagnosed medical conditions, and you're not currently taking any medications. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalised for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but… that was a long time ago. Just a cast. Nothing serious. Everything else… I’ve always been healthy. I think. That’s why this orange water is so strange. It’s… new.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations, just a childhood broken arm. And this orange urine is a new development. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had problems with his… his sugar. Diabetes, I think. And my mother… her heart was not so good when she got old. But… that was when she was very old. And… that’s all I can think of. Nothing else really. I don’t know much about it. My wife’s family… I don’t know them very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes in your father and heart problems in your mother. Thank you. And just to finish up with your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. I don’t smoke. I drink maybe… a little bit of tea. Sometimes coffee. But not much. And definitely no drugs. I work hard. I don’t have time for that. My wife would be very angry. She likes me healthy. And I like her happy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol or caffeine, and no recreational drug use. That’s all very helpful information. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve never needed to take many pills. My wife gave me something for a headache once, but I don’t remember what it was. It worked okay. But… no allergies. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thanks for sharing all of that, Criston. That gives me a good overview of your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin. It'll just take a few minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor… Neeraj. Just… quickly, if you don’t mind. I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as quick as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. A little… pressure, but nothing bad. It feels… normal, I think. Like always. My stomach… it sometimes feels a little… gassy, but that’s just from the food. But no, not pain. Just… a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little discomfort, likely related to gas. I’m just checking your skin now. I notice your skin tone is a bit… yellowish. It's subtle, but present. Also, your sclera - the whites of your eyes - also appear slightly yellowed. Have you noticed any change in the color of your skin or eyes recently?
PATIENT: Yellow? No, I… I didn’t notice. My wife would have said something. She notices everything. No, I haven't. Maybe… a little pale? But I work outside a lot. I get sun. I thought that was why. I don't see yellow. You're sure?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am noticing a subtle yellowing, Criston. It’s quite subtle, which is why your wife may not have pointed it out, but it's enough for me to take note of. Given the orange urine and now this slight yellowing of your skin and eyes, it’s raising my concern for something affecting your liver or gallbladder. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I would like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your liver function, bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count. We'll also do a urinalysis to examine your urine more closely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Urinalysis? What… what does that mean? Liver? Is something bad wrong? My wife… she’s going to be worried. I just had orange water… I didn’t think it was anything serious. Is it… is it something I did?
DOCTOR: Criston, try not to worry. These tests are just to get more information. Orange urine and yellowing of the skin can be signs of a problem, but they can also be caused by many things, some of which are not serious. It’s important to rule things out and get a clear diagnosis before jumping to conclusions. Regarding what caused this, it's difficult to say without the tests. It could be something as simple as dehydration, or it could be related to your liver or gallbladder. We need to investigate further. The blood tests and urinalysis will help us narrow down the possibilities. I'll explain everything to you once we have the results. And I will certainly explain everything to your wife as well, with your permission. Would you like me to call her now?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Call my wife. Her name is Fatima. She will… she will want to know. And… tell her I’m okay. Well, not okay, but… not bad. Just… tests. And… thank you, Doctor. For… not yelling at me.
DOCTOR: “Hello, Fatima?
