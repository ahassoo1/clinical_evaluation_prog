DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's not like I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure. It's good you're getting it checked out, even if you aren't feeling any symptoms. High blood pressure often doesn't cause symptoms right away, which is why it’s important to monitor it. The nurse did mention it was elevated during her initial check. Could you tell me a little more about when you found out about it?
PATIENT: Yesterday. She took it, said it was high, and now here I am. Like I didn’t have better things to do. Honestly, it's probably just the machine being wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. It is possible the machine had a temporary issue, although we calibrate them regularly. But it’s best to rule out anything serious. Do you have a history of high blood pressure in your family?
PATIENT: My grandma… on my dad’s side, I think. But she lived to be, like, ninety. So clearly, it didn’t kill her. And honestly, I barely knew her. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your grandmother. Family history is helpful information, even if the connection is distant. And yes, I do believe it's necessary to investigate this. While your grandmother lived a long life, genetics are complex. Before we go further, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Never. I eat okay, I guess. Maybe a little too much frybread sometimes, but who doesn’t? And I work. Hard. Out in the field. That should count for something. I don't need a diagnosis.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're generally healthy and active. Working in the field is certainly good exercise. And you're right, being active is important. Let's talk about your diet a bit more. When you say “eat okay”, what does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you, I eat okay. What's with all the questions? Breakfast is usually just coffee. Sometimes toast. Lunch, whatever my husband packs. Sandwich, chips, that sort of thing. Dinner… depends. We eat a lot of stew, beans. Traditional stuff. You want a whole list? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, a whole list isn’t necessary at all. I'm just trying to get a better picture of your usual diet, so we can understand your overall health. It sounds like you eat a pretty typical diet, with some traditional foods included. That’s wonderful. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I'm Navajo. We don't get allergies. That’s a white people problem. Honestly, are you trying to waste my whole day? My husband is waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Tasmia, and I apologize if my questions feel insensitive. It was not my intention to offend you. Allergies can affect people of all backgrounds, though the specific allergens might vary. It’s simply a routine question to ensure your safety. Let's move on then. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just coffee. Lots of coffee. And sometimes ibuprofen, if my back's really bothering me from work. That's it. Honestly, I'm perfectly fine. This is a waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee and ibuprofen as needed. Thank you for letting me know. To get a better understanding of your overall health, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
