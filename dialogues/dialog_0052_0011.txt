DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, yes. Doctor... Shely, you say? Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed. Something about... fixin' myself up a little. A cosmetic thing. Don't rightly remember the details. My nephew said I needed clearance. He handles all that paperwork. Is that what you do here? Sign papers?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. While I am happy to review any documentation you have, my primary role as a physician is to assess your health and ensure any procedure you are considering is safe and appropriate for you. It’s important for me to understand what procedure your nephew is referring to, and to confirm you are a suitable candidate. Could you perhaps describe what you are hoping to “fix up”?
PATIENT: Fix up? Look, I work with towers, alright? Radio towers, cell towers. Been doin' it a long time. Climbin' those things ain't easy on a man. And... well, things shift. Sag, you know? It's a personal matter, really. Don't see why I gotta explain every little detail to you. My nephew said somethin' about... tummy skin? Is that what you need to know? Honestly, I don't remember askin' for a paper signed just for that. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to discuss personal details, Mr. Honcoop, and I appreciate you sharing what you’re comfortable with. It sounds like you’re referring to possible abdominal skin laxity, perhaps following weight loss or due to the physical demands of your work. Your nephew requested medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure addressing this concern. To properly assess whether you are a suitable candidate for any procedure, and to ensure your safety, I need to gather some more information. Would you mind answering a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Heavens to Betsy. I ain't got time for all that. Look, I'm a healthy man. Work every day, climb those towers, no problems. What kind of questions are we talkin' about? I don’t remember bein' sick much. A cold here and there. Nothing serious. Just sign the paper, Doctor. My nephew said it was a formality. A simple check-up. This is gettin' to be a whole ordeal. I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop, and I apologize if this feels like a lengthy process. However, even if you feel healthy, a brief medical history is essential to identify any potential risks associated with a procedure. It’s a standard part of ensuring your well-being. Let’s start simply. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure... hmm. Old Doc Henderson, back in... oh, I dunno, '98 maybe? He mentioned somethin' about it bein' a little high. But he just told me to lay off the salt. I did that. Ain't worried 'bout that. Diabetes? No. Never had diabetes. Heart... I climbed those towers for thirty years! My heart's fine. Never had a problem with it. Honestly, I think your nephew is makin' a big fuss over nothin'. Just sign the paper, please. I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Honcoop. That’s helpful. Just to clarify, you said you were advised to reduce your salt intake around 1998, and haven’t had any further medical evaluation for high blood pressure since then?
PATIENT: No. That's right. Henderson just said salt. And I cut back! Ain't touched a salt shaker in… well, a long time. Look, I’m startin’ to feel like I’m bein’ interrogated here. What's this got to do with fixin' my tummy? It's a cosmetic thing! Not a life-or-death situation. I need a signature and I need to be on my way. You askin' me about my diet from twenty years ago is ridiculous. My nephew said you were a professional, Doctor. This ain't very professional.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. However, even for cosmetic procedures, it's important to ensure your overall health is stable. Untreated high blood pressure, for example, can increase the risk of complications during and after surgery. To proceed responsibly, I'd like to take a few basic measurements - your blood pressure and pulse – just to get a current reading. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Blood pressure now? After all this talk? Honestly... Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. But I'm tellin' ya, it's gonna be fine. I climb towers, remember? A little blood pressure ain't gonna stop me. Just hurry up. I got things to do. And don't be askin' me about salt again. It's a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Just relax your arm, please. I’m going to inflate this cuff and listen to your pulse. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, Mr. Honcoop. 168 over 92. And your pulse is 88. Given these readings, and the fact that you haven’t had a recent comprehensive medical evaluation, I'm unable to provide medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure at this time. It would be irresponsible of me to do so. I recommend you see a physician for a full work-up to evaluate and manage your blood pressure before proceeding. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a local primary care doctor?
