DOCTOR: Right. Elijiah Fratoni, 26 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, uh, it's kinda silly, to be honest. I've just been...having a hard time getting up from chairs. Like, really hard. It’s not pain, exactly, just… stuck. It started a couple weeks ago, maybe? I don't really keep track of dates well, sorry.
DOCTOR: "Silly" doesn't really have a place in medicine, Mr. Fratoni. Everything warrants investigation. A couple of weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, you're right. Sorry. It just feels… dumb, you know? Like, I'm young, I work pretty physical jobs, oil stuff... I shouldn't be struggling with a chair. It's not every chair, just... some of 'em. The ones with arms, mostly. And the softer ones, like the ones at the diner.
DOCTOR: “Oil stuff,” right. That’s… vague. What sort of physical labor are we talking about exactly?
PATIENT: Uh, well, roustabout work. Mostly moving pipes, hauling lines, that kinda thing. It’s rough, sometimes. Long hours, heavy lifting, bending a lot. Sometimes we’re up on platforms, sometimes down in the mud. It varies. Been doin' it since I was 18, off and on. It's not like that different from other jobs, though, honestly. I've done worse.
DOCTOR: And this difficulty getting up...does it happen first thing in the morning, or is it more related to how long you’ve been sitting?
PATIENT: No, definitely not first thing. I usually wake up okay. It's more… the longer I sit, the harder it gets. Like, if I sit at the diner for a while, havin' breakfast, by the time I wanna leave, I gotta really… push myself up. And sometimes I stumble a little when I do. Not fallin' or anything, just… unsteady.
DOCTOR: Stumbling, you say. Are you experiencing any pain in your joints—knees, hips, back—when you try to get up, or at any other time?
PATIENT: No, no pain, really. That’s the weird part! It's not like something hurts. It feels… tight, maybe? Like my legs are stuck or somethin'. And kinda weak, when I finally do get goin'. But no sharp pain, no achin', nothin' like that. Just… resistant. It’s really hard to explain. It just feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. And apart from this difficulty, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, no. I mean, work's been kinda crazy, so I don't really pay attention to much else, to be honest. Tired, always tired, but that's just… work. Sleep okay, I guess. Maybe a little restless sometimes. Oh! I have been feelin' kinda… off-balance when I stand still, sometimes. Just a little wobble. But I figured that was from bein' up on those platforms all day.
DOCTOR: “A little wobble," right. And this has been happening...how long?
PATIENT: Uh… at least a couple weeks, same as the chair thing. Maybe longer. It's kinda come and gone, I guess. Some days I don’t notice it at all, other days it’s a little more pronounced. Like, I’ll just be standin’ there, and feel like I need to steady myself. Doesn't happen all the time, though. It’s probably nothin', to be honest. Just bein' clumsy.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” is still something. Alright, Mr. Fratoni, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better picture of what's going on. I'll need you to stand up, and we'll check your balance, reflexes, and strength. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need. I'm used to gettin' poked and prodded, honestly. Workin' on the rigs, you gotta get checked out pretty often. Just let me know if I need to hold still or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to have you sit here for a moment. Then, I want you to stand up without using your hands, if you can. Let me see how that goes.
PATIENT: Whoa. That was… harder than it looked. Yeah, that's definitely not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to have you walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps. And then I'm going to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles.
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that was… not good. I usually have better balance than that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are… diminished, and your balance is significantly impaired. Given your symptoms—difficulty rising from chairs, instability, diminished reflexes—and your occupation, I’m concerned about possible peripheral neuropathy. It's not a definitive diagnosis, but we need to rule it out.
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Is that… serious? And what causes that? Is it somethin’ from the oil work? I don’t have insurance, so… is this gonna be expensive?
DOCTOR: Peripheral neuropathy means there's damage to your peripheral nerves—the ones outside your brain and spinal cord. It can be serious, depending on the cause and severity. Possible causes are numerous - diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, infections... and, yes, exposure to toxins is a possibility in your line of work. To determine the cause, we need to run some tests: a neurological exam, blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions, and possibly nerve conduction studies. As for the cost… without insurance, it will be expensive. We can discuss a payment plan with the lab, and I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist who may be able to offer some financial assistance programs. But first, we need to get a diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Nerve damage… from the work… that’s… not great. Blood work, nerve studies… payment plans… It’s a lot. So, you’re saying it could be from the oil stuff? Like, somethin’ I’ve been exposed to? What kinda stuff? And if it is from that… can it get worse? Like, will I… not be able to work? I need to work. I have to.
DOCTOR: It could be related to exposure to toxins at the rig. Various chemicals and heavy metals used in oil extraction can cause peripheral neuropathy. Without the tests, I cannot definitively say. If it is related to occupational exposure, the progression depends on continued exposure and the severity of the damage. Continued exposure will worsen the condition. If left untreated, it can lead to weakness, numbness, and loss of function. It's crucial to identify the cause and remove yourself from further exposure. I am referring you to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist specializing in peripheral neuropathy. She'll conduct the necessary tests and determine the best course of action. I will also provide you with a list of resources for occupational health and safety, and potential legal avenues if it is determined to be work-related. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Occupational health… legal avenues… This is… a lot more complicated than I thought. Okay. Dr. Reed, right? And you’ll write me a referral. What kinda tests will she do? Will they be… painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have work… I can’t be off for too long. I just… need to know what I’m dealing with. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Dr. Reed will likely perform a neurological examination, assessing your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. She will also order nerve conduction studies, which involve small electrical impulses to measure nerve function. It’s not particularly painful, but it can be slightly uncomfortable - a tingling sensation, similar to a mild electric shock. The blood work is standard, just a simple draw. Results typically take 5-7 business days, but the nerve conduction studies can take longer to interpret. I will write a note to Dr. Reed explaining your work schedule so she can try to accommodate you. I understand you need to work. However, if Dr. Reed determines you have significant nerve damage, you may need to take time off to prevent further injury. Ignoring the symptoms will only worsen the condition. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Five to seven days for the blood work… longer for the nerve stuff. And I might have to take time off… Yeah, I understand. I just… I don’t have a lot of options. I need this job. Okay. Referral to Dr. Reed… neurological exam… blood work… nerve studies… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. The front desk will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results with me once you have them. Remember, early intervention is crucial. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of symptoms. .
