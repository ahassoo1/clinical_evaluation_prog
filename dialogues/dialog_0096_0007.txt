DOCTOR: Alright, Lakiya. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Burlingham. It is… painful. That is why I am here. My back, mostly. It has been… difficult for some time now.
DOCTOR: “Painful,” right. And difficult for some time… Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. About… six months, I would say. Started slow, like a dull ache after a long day of work. I do fence work, you see. Lots of bending, lifting… heavy posts. It has gotten worse, steadily. Now, it’s… sharp sometimes. Even when I am not working.
DOCTOR: Fence work, hmm. That does sound physically demanding. And sharp pain even at rest… That’s not a good sign. Can you pinpoint where exactly on your back it hurts the most?
PATIENT: It is… low, on my left side. Right across where the waist is. And sometimes… it goes down my leg. Not all the way to my foot, thankfully, but… down the back of my thigh.
DOCTOR: So, low back pain, left side, radiating down the thigh… Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Sitting… makes it worse. Definitely sitting. And bending over, of course. Lying down… sometimes helps. If I can get comfortable. And… warm baths. Those soothe it a little. For a short time.
DOCTOR: Alright, sitting and bending worsen it, lying down and warm baths provide some relief… Have you tried any medications for the pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not yet. I… I don’t take much of anything. Tried some of those over-the-counter things, for headaches mostly. But nothing for my back. I hoped it would just… go away.
DOCTOR: Well, hoping it will go away is understandable, but six months is a long time to be dealing with this. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what we're dealing with. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Though I… I am not very flexible.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lakiya. We’ll take it slow. No need to force anything. Just get comfortable as you can. Okay, I'm just going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles around it. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Alright, can you try to bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. That… that is about as far as I can go. It hurts, Doctor. Right there.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. And I feel some tenderness right there as well. Okay, now can you try leaning to the left, and then to the right?
PATIENT: Left… hurts more. Right… a little better, but still not good. It feels… tight. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I do feel some muscle spasm there. And your range of motion is definitely limited, especially on the left side. Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Just relax, and let me know if you feel anything unusual. Okay, can you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes. I feel that. And that. Everything feels… normal, I think. Though… my foot feels a little numb sometimes. Not all the time. Just… occasionally. Like when I’ve been sitting for a long time.
DOCTOR: Occasional numbness in the foot… alright. That’s something we need to keep in mind. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely dealing with a lumbar strain, possibly with some nerve irritation. However, to rule out anything more serious, like a disc issue, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. And potentially an MRI, if the X-ray doesn’t give us enough information. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have no allergies that I know of. And… an MRI? What is that? Will it take long? I have work, you see. I need to get back to it.
DOCTOR: An MRI is a more detailed imaging test, Lakiya. It uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the soft tissues in your back. It’s much more informative than an X-ray. It will take about 30-45 minutes. I understand you need to get back to work, but we need to figure out what’s causing this pain before we can even think about getting you back to work safely. Look, ignoring this isn't going to make it go away. It could get worse, potentially leading to more serious problems. We need to be proactive. I'll have the nurse schedule the X-ray for you right away. We’ll review the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory to help with the pain and spasm. And I recommend you avoid any heavy lifting or bending for now. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes… alright. If it is important. And… a muscle relaxant? Will that make me… sleepy? I have things to do. I understand, Doctor. I just… I need to work. But I will do what you say. Schedule the tests. And yes, I will try to avoid lifting.
DOCTOR: Good. The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, Lakiya, so be careful driving or operating machinery. It’s best to take it at night before bed. I'll write the prescription for you now. The nurse will also give you a handout with instructions on how to take it and what side effects to watch out for. We’ll get these tests done, see what we're dealing with, and then we can formulate a proper plan to get you back on your feet. But for now, rest and avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. Do you have any questions for me before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Just… please hurry with the tests. I need to know what is happening. And thank you… for your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly with the scheduling information. Try to get the X-ray done as soon as possible. And remember, if the pain becomes significantly worse, or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, go to the emergency room immediately. We'll get this sorted out. Try not to worry too much. .
