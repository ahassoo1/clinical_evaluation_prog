DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today – could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Shely, you say? Hmm. Yes, well… I am here for a… a check-up. For the… the team. Yes, the team needs me to be checked. It’s… important. I think. A physical, that’s right. A physical before I… play.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. A physical exam is a good starting point. To clarify, you mentioned “the team” and “play.” Could you tell me a little more about what kind of team and what kind of play is involved?
PATIENT: Play? Oh. Well, it’s… sports. You know, with a ball. And running. And… other things. It’s… hard to explain. It’s been a while, see? A long while. I used to be… good at it. Very good. But now… well, I mostly just… do things. Around. It’s not… fancy. Not like the young fellas these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're getting back into a sport after a period of inactivity. That’s excellent. To help me get a better understanding of your current health status and ensure your safety, could you tell me what specific sport are you involved in, and how often you are participating?
PATIENT: Participating… hmm. That’s a good word. Well, it's… dominoes. Yes, dominoes. We have a very… serious team. Very competitive. We meet… sometimes. When the weather is nice. And… people show up. It's not every day, you understand. Old bones, you know? And… sometimes my back acts up. It's a team sport, though! Really it is. You gotta be quick, and… strategic. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Dominoes! That’s wonderful, Mr. Bartok. It’s good to stay active and engaged, and I certainly wouldn’t underestimate the strategic thinking involved. So, to clarify, the primary concern you’d like me to address today is your back pain, which seems to occur during or after dominoes games?
PATIENT: Well… yes. The back. It’s… annoying. Not all the time, thankfully. But when I lean over to… you know… set the dominoes. Or reach for them. It gives me a twinge. A sharp one. It’s not a big deal, usually. I just… rub it. But the team… they want me to be in good shape. For the tournament. Yes, a tournament is coming up. Important one. They say I need a… paper. To say I'm okay.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the team needs documentation of your physical health for the tournament, and you’re experiencing back pain with bending and reaching during dominoes games. Could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically… hmm. That’s a hard one. It’s… it’s like a… pinch. A sharp pinch. Right… low down. On the left side. And it… radiates. That’s what the… the lady at the pharmacy said. Radiates. It goes down my leg a little bit, sometimes. Not always. And… it’s worse when it’s cold. Yes, very cold. Like this morning. Woke me right up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sharp, pinching pain low on your left side that sometimes radiates down your leg, and is worse in the cold. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Numbness… hmm. No, not really. Tingling… maybe. Sometimes. When I’m sitting for too long. Like when… waiting for my turn. At the dominoes. But it goes away. Weakness… no. I can still… walk. And… lift things. Not heavy things, mind you. But I can manage. Everything feels… old, you know? But not weak. Just… achy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, tingling occasionally with prolonged sitting, but no numbness or weakness. You describe an overall achiness, but you’re still able to walk and lift light objects. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. That’s a tough one. Old man forgets, you know? I think… the doctor, a long time ago, said something about… pressure. High pressure. But I don’t remember much. And… my knees. They bother me. Always have. But I don’t think it was a… condition. Just… old knees. Arthritis… no, I don’t think so. Diabetes… no. Never heard anything about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of high blood pressure and ongoing knee pain. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure or knee pain, or any other reason?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes. I take… a little white pill. Every morning. Doctor gave it to me a long time ago. For… the water. He said my water was too thick. Something like that. I don’t really pay attention. Just take the pill. And sometimes, when my knees are really bad, I take… a little orange one. From the drugstore. It helps a little. But not much.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little white pill prescribed by a doctor for what sounds like a blood viscosity issue, and an over-the-counter orange pill for your knees. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not really. I don't think so. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes, when I eat… shellfish. But that’s just… shellfish. Everyone gets itchy from shellfish. Not a real allergy, I don’t think. And… no, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible sensitivity to shellfish. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. That’s a long time ago. When I was young. I broke my… arm. Yes, my arm. Fell off a… a ladder. Fixing the roof. They fixed it. Put it in a cast. That was a long time ago. Hospitalized… yes, for the arm. That’s it. Nothing else, I don't think. Just the arm.
DOCTOR: Alright, a childhood arm fracture. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s… tricky. My mother… she was… strong. Lived a long time. But she had… troubles with her… feet. Always complaining about her feet. My father… he was a… quiet man. Didn’t talk much. He… died young. Something with his… heart, I think. But I don’t know much about it. They didn’t talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of foot problems in your mother and a possible cardiac issue in your father. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother… she didn’t like it. Drink alcohol? Sometimes. A little bit of wine. With dinner. Just a glass. Nothing fancy. Recreational drugs? Oh, no. Never. I’m a… respectable man. Never touched those things. No. Never.
DOCTOR: Very good. Thank you, Mr. Bartok. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I just want to make sure I’m okay for the… tournament. And the team. They’re counting on me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. After that, I’ll assess your range of motion and check for any tenderness in your back. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. <stage>I begin taking his blood pressure. “Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Here you go. It's a little stiff today. The cold, you know? Old bones.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 90. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart sounds good, though I do hear a slight murmur, which is not necessarily concerning but we should keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please sit on the examination table and extend your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. They always ache. Especially in the cold. And when it’s… damp.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness on both sides of your knees, and there's some swelling. Your range of motion is a little limited, and I hear some crepitus – that's a grinding sensation – when you bend them. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up and lean forward, and then backward, and side to side. Please stop if you feel any sharp pain.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, alright. Ooh! There it is. That’s the spot. Right there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some muscle spasm and tenderness in your lower back. It seems like that's the source of the pain you've been experiencing. Now, I'm going to do a few simple neurological tests to see if there is any nerve involvement. Could you please lie back down for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, alright. Nerves… hmm. Are those the things that… tingle?
DOCTOR: They can be, Mr. Bartok. These tests will help us determine if the pain is affecting any of the nerves in your back or legs. I’m going to check your reflexes, and your strength. This won't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good in both legs. It doesn't appear to be significant nerve involvement. Based on my examination, it looks like you're experiencing muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by your activity. Your knees show some signs of osteoarthritis, which is common with age. And your blood pressure is elevated.
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? And my blood pressure? Is that… bad? I just want to play dominoes. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis simply means there’s some wear and tear in your knee joints. It’s very common, and we can manage it. And your blood pressure is a little higher than we’d like. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it is something we need to address to protect your heart. Playing dominoes is not too much to ask, Mr. Bartok! We'll work together to help you continue enjoying it. I recommend a few things. First, I want to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health. We should also repeat your blood pressure reading at a later date to confirm the initial findings. To manage your back pain, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and gentle stretching exercises. For your knees, we can try a knee brace for support. Would you be open to trying these things?
PATIENT: Ibu… what now? And stretching? I’m not very flexible, Doctor. And braces? I don’t want to look like an old man with a brace. But… if it means I can play dominoes… I suppose. Blood work… that sounds… invasive. But alright. If you think it’s best. Just… no braces, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Ibuprofen and naproxen are common pain relievers. Stretching will be gentle, and we can start slowly. We’ll focus on exercises that won’t put too much strain on your back. And we can discuss alternatives to a brace, perhaps a knee sleeve for mild support instead. The blood work is fairly routine, and it will give us a good baseline to monitor your health. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. I’ll also print out a list of gentle stretching exercises for your back. And a referral to a physical therapist who can teach you proper form. Finally, I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the lab results and your progress. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. A physical… what was it? Therapist? Will they make me do… hard things? And these… lab things. Do they hurt? I just want to make sure I can play dominoes, Doctor. That’s all.
DOCTOR: The physical therapist will assess your back and teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your flexibility. It won’t be hard, I promise. They’ll tailor the exercises to your abilities. As for the lab work, it involves a simple blood draw. There's a brief pinch, but it’s over quickly. It's a routine procedure. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant to help with the back pain. Please take it as directed and let me know if you experience any side effects. And it’s important to monitor your blood pressure at home. I'll give you instructions on how to do that. The main goal here is to get you back to playing dominoes comfortably and safely. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dominoes… yes. That’s good. All this… paperwork. It’s a lot. I don’t understand half of it. Blood pressure… how do I… measure it? Is there someone who can… do it for me?
DOCTOR: I understand it's a lot to take in. I'll have the nurse go over the instructions for measuring your blood pressure with you before you leave. It’s a simple process, and she can show you how to use a home blood pressure monitor. And don't worry about understanding everything at once. We're here to help. Before you go, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not really. I don’t think so. I get a little itchy sometimes, when I eat… shellfish. But that’s just… shellfish. Everyone gets itchy from shellfish. Not a real allergy, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, noted. A possible sensitivity to shellfish. Alright, Mr. Bartok, I think we’ve covered everything for today. Remember to follow the instructions, take your medications as prescribed, and schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you all the best and hope you get back to enjoying your dominoes games soon! The nurse will be with you shortly to review the instructions and schedule your follow-up.
