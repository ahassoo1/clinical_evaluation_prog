DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I am Venus Alvara. I have been… noticing some things with my memory. It is… concerning, and my blood pressure has been… not good. I wish to discuss this with you, if you please. I do not want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. It’s perfectly alright, and certainly no waste of my time at all. Memory concerns and blood pressure issues are important to address. Let's start with your memory. Could you describe what you've been noticing?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… difficult to explain. Small things, mostly. I will place my keys… and then not remember where I placed them. Or I will be speaking to someone, and a word… escapes me. Not often, but… enough to make me anxious. I remember when I placed the keys, usually, just… not where. It is… frustrating. And recently, I forgot a friend’s name. A very old friend. This is… new.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds unsettling to experience those kinds of memory lapses, especially forgetting a friend’s name. It’s good that you’re paying attention to these changes. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Approximately… three months ago, I believe. Perhaps four. It began slowly. Just the keys, mostly. Then… the small words. It was… around the time the weather began to warm. Early spring, yes. I remember thinking it was just… stress. My husband… passed away two years ago, and things have been… difficult. But it is… not improving. It is… worsening, slowly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Alvara. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that stress could be a factor. However, since the memory issues haven't improved and are gradually worsening, it’s important to investigate further. Now, let’s discuss your blood pressure. Do you know what your blood pressure readings have been recently?
PATIENT: Yes. My… neighbor, she is a nurse, she checks it for me. Usually… it is high. Very high. Last week, it was… 160 over 95, I think. Sometimes higher. She says I must… take medication. But I… I do not like taking pills. I worry about… side effects. She checks it often, because of my… forgetting. She says the high blood pressure can… affect my mind.
DOCTOR: That's good that your neighbor is monitoring your blood pressure and looking out for you. A reading of 160/95 is indeed elevated and does warrant attention. Your neighbor is correct—uncontrolled high blood pressure can certainly impact cognitive function. Let's get a more complete picture of your overall health. Could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had… arthritis in my knees, years ago. It is… manageable with some cream. And I had… a gallbladder removed, many years ago. But… that is all. No… diabetes. No… heart problems. I do not… smoke. I drink… very little alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine… once a month. I try to eat… healthy foods. Mostly vegetables. I am… a fairly healthy person, all things considered. Except for the blood pressure, of course, and… the forgetting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That’s helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I do not take any medications. As I said, I… dislike taking pills. I use the cream for my knees. That is all. No vitamins. No… anything. I try to avoid… unnecessary things. I believe in… natural remedies, if possible. Though… I am beginning to think I may need… something for the blood pressure. But I am… hesitant. Very hesitant.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Alvara. It’s good to be cautious about medications. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or other forms of dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had… heart problems. She passed away when she was… 78, I believe. From a heart attack. My father… he had… high blood pressure, as well. He lived to be… 85, but he… suffered from headaches. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had… some memory problems, when she was old. Not… like mine, but… she would forget things. It was… dismissed as old age. No… Alzheimer’s, as far as I know. Just… forgetfulness. It… runs in the family, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That's important information. Knowing about the family history of heart problems and potential memory issues helps me understand your situation better. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your daily life. Could you describe your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… quiet. I wake up around 7:00. I make breakfast – usually oatmeal. I read the newspaper. I go for a walk – a short walk, around the block. I do some gardening. I cook dinner. I watch the television. I… mostly stay home. I have a few friends, but… we do not see each other often. I used to… travel, but… not anymore. It is… lonely, sometimes. But I… manage. It is a… simple life. Very simple.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That gives me a good sense of your lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, including checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a neurological assessment to evaluate your memory and other cognitive functions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… fine. Whatever you think is… necessary. I wish to understand… what is happening. I do not mind the examination. Just… please be… gentle. My knees… sometimes ache. And… I am a little nervous. But… proceed, please. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll take things slowly. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 162 over 98, your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Now, let's move on to a quick neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you to follow some simple instructions and answer a few questions. This will help me assess your memory, balance, and coordination. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. Let me think. It is… August. The second of August. Yes. August 2nd, 2025. Is that… correct? I think so. I try to… keep track. It is important. Though… sometimes I… confuse the days. But today is… August 2nd, 2025. I believe.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Alvara. Very good. Now, can you tell me the name of the current president?
PATIENT: Hmm. The president… that is… difficult. I… read the newspaper, but… I do not always remember the names. I know… it is a man. I think his name is… Biden? Yes. Joe Biden. Is that… correct? It is… embarrassing to forget such things. I should know. But… my mind… it is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Alvara. You remembered correctly. It’s perfectly alright to forget things, and there’s no need to be embarrassed. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Please listen carefully: apple, table, penny. I will ask you to recall them later. Now, I'm going to test your balance. Can you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. I will… try to remember. Apple… table… penny. Yes. Now… stand up. Very well. This is… difficult. My knees… they ache. And… I feel a little… dizzy. But I can… walk. A few steps. That is… sufficient, yes? I do not wish to… fall.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, that is sufficient. Please sit down. You’re doing very well. I noticed a slight unsteadiness and a slower gait, which we’ll note. Now, let's return to the three words I asked you to remember. Can you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: Hmm. Three words… apple, table, penny? No… that is not right. Let me think. Apple… I remember apple. And… something with a wood surface? A… desk? No. Not desk. A… a place to eat? No… Oh dear. I should remember. It is… frustrating. I know I heard them. Apple… and… something else. I… I cannot recall. I apologize. My mind… it is failing me. I feel… quite foolish.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Alvara. It’s not uncommon to have difficulty recalling things, and we’re gathering information to understand what’s going on. You recalled “apple” correctly. Based on our conversation and the brief examination, you're experiencing some memory lapses and difficulty with recall, along with elevated blood pressure. The neurological assessment showed some mild unsteadiness. I recommend we order some blood work to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, a chemistry panel, and thyroid function tests. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart health. And, given your memory concerns, I would like to schedule you for a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds sensible. Blood work, EKG, MRI… whatever you think is… necessary. I wish to understand what is happening. The sooner, the better. I… I do not wish to ignore this. It is… frightening to feel my mind… slipping away. Yes, please. Order the tests. Schedule the MRI. Whatever you recommend, Doctor Shely. I… trust your judgment. Just… please let me know the results as soon as possible. I… I wish to have some… peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I understand your concerns, and I will ensure the tests are ordered promptly. I'll have my assistant schedule you for the MRI as soon as possible. We will contact you as soon as the results are available, which usually takes a few days to a week. In the meantime, given your significantly elevated blood pressure, I recommend starting a low-dose blood pressure medication to help bring it under control. We can start with a small dose and monitor your response. I understand your hesitation about taking medication, but uncontrolled high blood pressure can have serious consequences, including cognitive decline and stroke. Would you be open to discussing starting a medication?
PATIENT: That… is difficult. I truly dislike taking pills. But… you are right. My blood pressure is very high. And… you said it can affect my mind. Perhaps… a small dose. Just… a very small dose. And… if it causes side effects, I wish to be able to stop it. I do not wish to feel… worse. But… if it can help my mind, and… lower my blood pressure… yes. A small dose. Please. But… monitor me carefully. Very carefully. I… I am anxious about this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I completely understand your concerns, and we will start with a very low dose of a medication called Lisinopril, 5mg once daily. It's a commonly prescribed medication with generally mild side effects. We will closely monitor your blood pressure and any potential side effects. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your response and adjust the dosage if needed. I'm also going to recommend some lifestyle modifications to help lower your blood pressure, including a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… yes. I… I can try. Low sodium… less salt. Regular exercise… a short walk, perhaps. Stress management… that is… difficult. It is lonely, sometimes. But I will… try. No… I do not think I have any further questions at this moment. Just… thank you, Doctor Shely. Thank you for listening. And… thank you for taking my concerns seriously. I… I feel a little… better, knowing that we are doing something. Is… is there anything I should be… worried about? Anything… specific?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I'm glad I could help. Regarding your concerns, it's important to be aware of any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as severe headache, vision changes, weakness on one side of your body, or difficulty speaking. These could be signs of a stroke or other serious condition, and you should seek immediate medical attention if they occur. Otherwise, try not to worry too much. We are taking a proactive approach to address your concerns, and we will monitor your progress closely. My assistant will come in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with instructions for the blood work and MRI. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Alvara. And remember, we're here to support you.
