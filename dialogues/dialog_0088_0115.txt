DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my skin. It’s become rather… yellow. A friend mentioned something about the liver, but honestly, I’m not quite sure what’s going on. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now, I believe. I do apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing of the skin… that's something we definitely want to look into. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Perhaps a month? It’s all a bit… hazy. I was told it could be something with the liver… I’ve had some trouble with that organ in the past, though I don’t recall the specifics. It was quite a long time ago. Is that… is that what this might be?
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Let's start with your past medical history. You mentioned some trouble with your liver previously. Do you recall when that was, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When… that is difficult. It was… before I moved to this city, certainly. Perhaps… the 1980s? Or maybe the early 90s? It was a rather unpleasant time. I remember being quite sick, but the details… they’re lost to me, I’m afraid. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. Memories can be tricky. The 80s or 90s gives us a starting point. And it’s good you remember being sick – that's helpful. Were you hospitalized for that liver issue?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… I… I believe so. Yes, I think I was. A long stay, I recall. Many tests. But what they did, or found… I truly can’t say. It was so long ago, and I was quite unwell at the time. I mostly remember the bland food, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let's move on to current symptoms. Besides the yellowing of your skin, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I’ve been feeling rather tired lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And my appetite… it’s not what it once was. Everything tastes a bit… off. And occasionally, my stomach feels… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but just… unsettled.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, loss of appetite, food tasting “off,” and some stomach discomfort. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Urine… now that you mention it… I believe it is a bit darker than usual. Perhaps a brownish tinge? It’s difficult to say for certain. As for my… stool, I haven’t paid much attention, to be honest. I apologize, Doctor. I really am not very observant these days.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Annelle. It’s good you’re telling me what you have noticed. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, feel your belly, and check your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to understand what is going on with me, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening and feeling your abdomen now. I'm noticing some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Your skin does show signs of jaundice—the yellowing we discussed. I’m also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like we need to run some blood tests to check your liver function and rule out other potential causes for the jaundice. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests sound sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your professional opinion. I just want to get to the bottom of this, as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. I haven't much energy for prolonged investigations, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Annelle. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The lab is right down the hall. It shouldn't take long. While we wait for the results, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, just a small dose of something for my… for my nerves. It’s a very low dosage. My doctor prescribed it, years ago. I can’t recall the name, I’m afraid. A small, white pill. It’s not important, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Even a small dose can sometimes affect liver function. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not that I can recall. Though, sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy, but I assumed that was just… old age. I truly don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the lab results should be back within a few hours. We’ll take a look at them and discuss the next steps then. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid alcohol and any over-the-counter medications until we have a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results, then. Thank you. Perhaps… perhaps we can finish this quickly, when the results are in? I do apologize for being a bother.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all, Annelle. We'll get to the bottom of this together. The nurse will be in shortly to let you know when the results are ready. I’ll see you then.
