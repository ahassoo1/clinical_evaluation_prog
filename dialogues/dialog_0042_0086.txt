DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you don't mind getting straight to it. I’m pretty busy today.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time. You came in last week for some blood work and a check-up… Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Last Tuesday, I think it was. Everything okay? Just tell me what it says.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s go through the results. Overall, most of your levels were within a normal range, which is good. However, your Vitamin D level was quite low – significantly below the optimal range. It was at 22 ng/mL, and we generally like to see it above 30 ng/mL. Do you have any symptoms that might be related to a Vitamin D deficiency?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, honestly. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn't? Is that what it causes? I really don’t know what the symptoms are.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. Fatigue can be a symptom, but it’s a very common one and can be caused by many things. Other symptoms can include bone pain, muscle weakness, and even mood changes, though not everyone experiences them. Since your level is quite low, I'd like to talk a bit more about potential causes and how we can address it. Do you spend a lot of time indoors?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I work logistics, so I’m mostly planning shipments and on the computer. Not a lot of sunshine in an office, you know? I try to get out when I can, but it’s not often.
DOCTOR: I see. That certainly explains a lot. Vitamin D is primarily produced when your skin is exposed to sunlight. Since you're indoors most of the time, it's not surprising your levels are low. We can address this in a few ways. The simplest is starting a Vitamin D supplement. We can also discuss dietary sources, although getting enough from food alone can be difficult. Have you ever taken any vitamins before?
PATIENT: Nope, never really been a vitamin person. Always figured I got enough from what I ate. What kind of supplement are we talking? And how much do I need to take?
DOCTOR: That’s a common thought, and it's good you're asking. It can be tricky to get enough Vitamin D from diet alone, especially with limited sun exposure. I'd recommend starting with a daily dose of 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 . That should help raise your levels. We'll recheck your blood in about three months to see how you're responding. Do you have any allergies to any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Nothing I’ve ever reacted to, anyway. Is that all? Can I just pick that up at the pharmacy?
DOCTOR: Good. That simplifies things. Yes, you can pick up the Vitamin D supplement at any pharmacy. It’s available over-the-counter. Here’s a prescription for the Vitamin D3. It includes some instructions, but essentially you'll take one capsule daily with a meal. It's best to take it with food, as it’s a fat-soluble vitamin and is absorbed better with fats. Along with the supplement, I would also recommend trying to get a little more sun exposure when you can – even 15-20 minutes a day can make a difference, if possible. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just take the pill and try to sit in the sun a bit. Got it. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not keeping me all day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kahrin. I understand your time is valuable. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today to recheck your Vitamin D levels. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever’s easiest. I’m pretty flexible. Just let me know the date and time. I gotta run, though. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I've scheduled you for November 2nd at 10:00 AM. You'll receive a reminder text a few days before your appointment. If you experience any unusual symptoms, or have any concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, Kahrin, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
PATIENT: Okay, great. November 2nd. Perfect. Thanks, Doctor. You too.
