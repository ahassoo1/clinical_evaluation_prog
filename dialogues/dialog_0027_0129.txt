DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Or… is it Dawnetta?
PATIENT: Dawnetta, please. Ms. Hatchard was my mother. And good morning to you too, Doctor… Fazzina, was it? Look, I haven’t got all day. I took time off from the garage for this, you know. What exactly are we doing here?
DOCTOR: Yes, Fazzina. Sorry about that. Just confirming. Right, well… what brings you in today, Dawnetta?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s embarrassing. And probably something silly. I’ve been taking these pain pills for my arthritis – the red ones, you know, the ones the last doctor gave me – for… well, a long time. And now my… stools are black. Like, really dark. It’s been going on for a couple of days now. It's not comfortable, if you catch my drift. And I read things on the internet, and now I'm worried it’s something serious. Though frankly, people write anything online these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, black stools… that is something we need to look into. And you’re right to get it checked. It's good you came in. You said you’ve been taking these pain pills for a while… can you recall the name of the medication, or perhaps the dosage?
PATIENT: Ugh, names. No, I never bother with names. They all sound alike. Little white bottles, little red bottles… The red ones are stronger. I take… oh, let me think. Two in the morning, two at night. Sometimes three if I’ve been working on a particularly stubborn engine. Honestly, Doctor, I lift heavy things all day. Mechanics work. It's not a desk job. I don't sit around filing papers. Does that help? I’ve been on them for… oh, I don't know, five, maybe seven years now? It’s been a while. I just keep refilling the prescription.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a long-term use of pain medication, dosage varies… Let me see if I can pull up your medication list here. typing sounds Ah, yes. It looks like you've been prescribed Naproxen 500mg twice daily, and occasionally a third dose as needed. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Naproxen… yes, that sounds right. The red pills. See? I told you. Now, can we hurry this up? I’ve got a truck waiting for a new water pump. And honestly, I'm not a fan of hospitals. Or doctor’s offices. Too many germs. What does this black stool business mean? Is it serious? Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. Black, tarry stools can indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which could be from the Naproxen irritating the stomach lining. It’s not always serious, but we do need to investigate. I want to ask a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Internal bleeding? Oh, for heaven's sake. Well, I have been feeling a bit tired lately, but that’s probably just from working long hours. And maybe a little heartburn now and then. Not enough to bother me, though. I'm not one to complain. And my stomach… it's been a bit gurgly, I suppose. But I eat all sorts of things at the garage - greasy sandwiches, coffee, you name it. I don't have time for fancy meals. Is it the pills, then? Is it just the pills causing this? I really don't want to stop taking them. My arthritis is awful. Honestly, you wouldn’t believe the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, heartburn, gurgly stomach… those symptoms can be related to Naproxen use, and certainly could contribute to the black stools. It’s difficult to say for certain without further investigation. I’d like to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also check your vital signs. Then, I think we should run some blood tests to check your hemoglobin levels and rule out any anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hemoglobin? Anemia? Honestly, Doctor, you're losing me. I just want to know if I need to go to the hospital! Is this something serious or not? And can we please hurry this up? I've got work to do. Fine, fine. Check my… abdomen. Whatever. But don’t keep me all day. And no needles, if you can avoid it. I hate needles. Just tell me if it’s bad, alright? No fancy medical talk. Bad or not bad. That's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. No needles right away. We'll start with the physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your stomach with this, feel your abdomen… and I promise, I’ll explain everything in plain language. I gently palpate her abdomen, listening with the stethoscope. Your abdomen is a little tender, but nothing overly concerning at this point. I’m going to need to check your vital signs. Then we’ll discuss the next steps, including a blood test, which will help us determine if there’s any bleeding. It's a precaution, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And be quick about it. I don’t like being touched. Mechanics work on engines, not people. It feels… wrong. Just tell me what you find. And if it’s really bad, I want to know straight away. No beating around the bush. Honestly, I've never been one for doctors. Always poking and prodding. It’s a waste of time. My time, specifically. I shift uncomfortably in the chair. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 78, both within a normal range. I pause, considering how best to proceed, mindful of her anxiety. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a stool test to check for hidden blood. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend temporarily reducing your Naproxen dosage to one pill a day and seeing if that improves things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don't have allergies. I've lived a long life working with grease and grime, haven't died yet, have I? Look, can I go back to work now? I’m losing money every minute I sit here. Temporarily reduce the pills… fine. One pill. But if my arthritis flares up, I'm going straight back to the red ones. And honestly, I don’t like the idea of going back to the lab. More waiting, more poking. Can't we just… give me something to take at home? Something for the heartburn, maybe? That's all I really need. I'm a practical woman, Doctor. I don't need fancy tests. I need to fix trucks. That’s what I need. And I need to get back to doing it. She crosses her arms, looking impatient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to accommodate them. We can certainly address the heartburn. I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor, like Omeprazole, to help reduce stomach acid. It’s a common medication, and should provide some relief. typing sounds Now, about the blood test…it's important to rule out any serious internal bleeding. If the stool test comes back positive, we'll need to investigate further with an endoscopy. It's the safest way to see what's going on, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I’ll give you a prescription for the Omeprazole, and a requisition for the stool test. Can you please take that to the lab when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What's an endoscopy? More poking and prodding, I bet. Honestly, I don’t like the sound of that at all. Look, if the heartburn pills don't work, I’m going straight back to the red ones and ignoring everything you've said. I've lived a long life, and I'm not going to spend it in a hospital. I reach for the prescriptions. Fine, I’ll take the pills. And I’ll take the… requisition. But I'm warning you, Doctor, I’m not one for fuss. If things don’t improve, I’m done. Now, can I finally leave? I’ve got a truck waiting, and a reputation to uphold. She stands up, clutching the prescriptions. Don't expect me to come back if it gets worse. She heads for the door. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. Take care, and please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as dizziness, weakness, or significant abdominal pain. I’ll make a note of your concerns in your chart. I offer a small, strained smile. Have a good day. .
