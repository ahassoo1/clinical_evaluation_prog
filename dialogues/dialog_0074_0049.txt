DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Reisig, you say? A nice name. Well, now, let me think... It's my ears, I believe. They just don't seem to be workin' like they used to. Things are kinda… muffled, you know? Not sharp. It's been gettin' worse, I reckon, but when exactly… now that's a good question.
DOCTOR: Yes, muffled hearing. I understand. It can be frustrating when things aren’t as clear as they should be. And you’re right, pinpointing when it started is helpful. “Getting worse” is a good start. Could you tell me about how it's been getting worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... how it's gettin' worse... Well, it's not like it just suddenly went bad, you see. It's more like... people are talkin', and I gotta ask 'em to repeat themselves. Used to be able to hear just fine, even with a little noise around. Now, if there's a TV on or somethin', forget about it. And it feels... quieter, all the time, even when it is quiet. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. You’re explaining it very well. So, it’s a gradual decrease in hearing, more noticeable with background noise, and an overall sense of quietness. How long would you say this has been happening—this gradual decrease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're askin' a tricky one. It feels like… a while. Maybe six months? A year? It's hard to say, honestly. I mostly noticed it when my nephew visited last Christmas. He was tellin' me a story and I kept missin' bits. He said I was gettin' distracted, but I swear I was payin' attention! Now I just... I just don't know. Time gets away from you, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does, Mr. Schneer. Six months to a year is helpful, thank you. And it’s very common for hearing loss to be noticed by family members first. Now, have you noticed it in one ear more than the other, or is it about the same in both?
PATIENT: That's another good question. I... I don't think so. Feels pretty even, I'd say. Not like one ear's completely gone and the other's okay. Just... both feel a bit dull. Sometimes, when I’m on the phone, I have to hold the receiver extra tight to the right ear, but that could just be the phone, couldn't it? Old phones ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Schneer. About the same in both ears. And you’re right, phones can certainly contribute to the issue. Now, have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises – perhaps at work, or as a hobby?
PATIENT: Well, now... I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, goodness, must've been forty years. Lots of machines, clatterin' and bangin' all day long. They gave us earplugs sometimes, but I didn’t always wear 'em, to be honest. Too hot, you know? And, I used to enjoy… well, I used to, before my knees went bad… shootin' at the range with my brother. Not every weekend, mind you, but enough. So, yeah… loud noises. Probably. Didn't think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer. Forty years in a shoe factory and some recreational shooting. That information is very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, lord. Where to begin? My knees, as I mentioned, are terrible. Arthritis, the doctor says. Can’t walk much without a cane. And my blood pressure… it goes up and down like a yo-yo. I take pills for that, I think. Blue ones and white ones. And… hmm… I had a bit of a cough a few years back, but they gave me somethin' for that. Nothing serious, they said. I see Doc Henderson for my knees, and my regular doctor, Dr. Riley… but I don’t always remember what he tells me. Old age, you know. It’s a terrible thing.
DOCTOR: It is a normal part of life, Mr. Schneer, and we’ll take our time. We can review everything. It’s good you see Dr. Henderson and Dr. Riley. Do you recall the names of the medications you take for your blood pressure, or perhaps we could access your records from them?
PATIENT: Oh, that'd be wonderful if you could access my records. I wouldn't have a clue what they're called. Little white pills and little blue pills... that’s all I know. I just take 'em every morning with my breakfast. Dr. Riley’s office is just down the road. Maybe they could fax somethin' over? I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong information, and my memory... well, it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. Let me pull up your records from Dr. Riley's office. Okay, I see here you’re on Lisinopril 20mg daily and Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily for hypertension. And you’ve been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both knees. Any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Lisinopril and… Hydrochlorothiazide. Sounds like somethin' out of a science fiction movie! Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I ain't never been stung by a bee, thankfully. Used to love walkin' in the fields as a boy, but I was always careful to avoid the hives. Goodness, now that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schneer. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, focusing on your ears, nose, and throat. It will help me assess the current state of your hearing and rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. My knees aren’t as steady as they used to be, so I might need a little help gettin' up and down. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please sit comfortably. I’m going to start by looking into your ears with an otoscope. I’m seeing some cerumen – earwax – in the canal, but nothing that immediately jumps out as a cause for concern. Similar findings on this side as well. Both tympanic membranes – eardrums – appear intact. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart. Your lungs are clear bilaterally, and your heart sounds regular, although slightly increased rate which can be linked to your hypertension. Finally, I'll check your throat and neck. Your throat looks normal, and I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your neck. Based on this initial exam, I don’t see any immediate cause for your hearing loss other than potential cerumen buildup. But, to get a more definitive answer, I'd like to order an audiogram—a hearing test—to assess your hearing levels across different frequencies. How does that sound?
PATIENT: An audiogram, you say? A hearing test. Sounds sensible. If there's wax build-up, maybe cleanin' it out will help. And if it's somethin' else… well, best to know, I reckon. So yes, go ahead with the test. When can we do that? I haven't got anythin' particular planned, so I'm fairly flexible.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’ve scheduled you for an audiogram with our audiologist, Sarah Miller, this Thursday at 10:00 AM. Her office is just down the hall, Room 3. She'll explain the process to you when you get there. It's a non-invasive test, meaning it won't cause any discomfort. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe earwax removal drops. Use them twice a day for three days, and then come back to see me next week, on August 9th, so I can check your ears and see if the drops have helped. If the wax removal doesn't improve your hearing, we can discuss the results of the audiogram and decide on the next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Thursday at ten… that's grand. And ear drops… twice a day. I can manage that. I’ll have to ask my nephew to pick them up for me, if that’s alright. He usually helps with these things. August 9th… I’ll mark it down on my calendar. That all sounds very sensible, Doctor. Thank you for explainin' it all so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a bit, you have.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the prescription ready for your nephew at the front desk. If you experience any discomfort or irritation after using the ear drops, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything beautifully, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with an old man and his foggy memory. Just gotta remember Thursday at ten, and the ear drops... and August 9th. I might write that down, just to be safe. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't worry about the memory – we're here to help. Take your time getting up, and if you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day, and I'll see you next week.
