DOCTOR: Hi Velda, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start us off, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Velda Squiers. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can go. They sent a form, and I thought it best to get a proper doctor to fill it out, rather than try and do it myself. It’s all a bit… official, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you, Velda. Cruise lines can be quite particular, and it's always best to be thorough. I’m happy to help you get that form completed. It sounds like this is mostly a preventative check-up then, ensuring you’re fit to travel?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Mostly preventative, yes. I feel quite well, thankfully. I’m not on any regular medications, and I haven’t been to hospital in… oh, goodness, it must be twenty years or more. It was just for a bad knee, and that’s all mended now. I just want to make sure I have everything they need so there’s no trouble before I set sail. It’s a very exciting trip, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Twenty years is a good stretch without needing hospital care. It’s good to hear you're feeling well. Just to be completely thorough, let's go through a bit of your medical history. We'll start with allergies. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, insect stings, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I eat most things, and I’m not bothered by bees or wasps, even if they come near. My husband, bless him, was allergic to shellfish, but that wasn’t me. I suppose I'm quite lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. No known allergies is always good news. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: As I said before, Doctor, the worst of it was my knee. I twisted it playing netball, years and years ago. I had some physiotherapy, and it recovered fully. Before that… well, just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps, chickenpox – all when I was a girl. Nothing serious, nothing that left me with any lasting trouble. And, as I said, I haven’t been seriously ill since. I'm a fairly healthy person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know. Netball can be rough! It sounds like you've had a pretty smooth medical history overall. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any significant medical history in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother, bless her, had high blood pressure in her later years, and my father… he suffered from arthritis, I believe, in his hands. That was quite debilitating for him, towards the end. And my sister, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, oh, ten years ago now, but she recovered well, thankfully. Apart from that… not a great deal, as far as I know. My grandparents lived to a good age, both of them, without any major illnesses, so I suppose we’re a reasonably healthy family on the whole.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know - high blood pressure, arthritis, and a history of breast cancer in your sister. We'll keep those in mind. Now, just a couple of lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not a drop of alcohol, and certainly no smoking or… other things. My husband was a smoker, years ago, but he gave it up when we got married – the best thing he ever did, that was. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. I prefer a nice cup of tea, myself! And I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly vegetables and lean protein. I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea, mind you, but I try not to overdo it.
DOCTOR: A biscuit with tea is perfectly acceptable! It sounds like you have very healthy habits. Now, just to finish up the history part, can you tell me about your typical level of physical activity?
PATIENT: Well, I don't go to a gym or anything like that, Doctor. But I try to keep active. I enjoy gardening – I have a small vegetable patch, and I potter around in it most days. I also enjoy walking. I walk to the shops most days, and I go for a longer walk in the park at least twice a week, when the weather is good. Nothing strenuous, mind you, but it keeps me moving. And I do a bit of housework, of course – that’s exercise in itself, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly is! Gardening and walking are excellent ways to stay active. Okay, that completes the history. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I understand it’s all part of making sure I’m fit for my cruise. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. I’m just going to take a look in your ears and throat now. Ears are clear. Throat looks normal, no signs of inflammation. Finally, I’ll just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything seems to be in good working order.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very good to hear, Doctor. I’m so glad everything seems to be alright. I was a bit worried, to be honest, but that puts my mind at ease. Is there anything else you need to check? Or should we move onto filling out the form, then?
DOCTOR: No, everything sounds quite good, Velda. Given your history and the exam findings, I don't think we need any further testing at this time. We can move on to filling out the cruise line's medical form now. It just asks about any existing medical conditions, medications you're taking , any recent hospitalizations, and so on. I'll just need you to confirm the information as I go through it. First question: Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I’ve said, I don’t. I’ve never been diagnosed with any of those conditions. My blood pressure was a little high once, years ago, but it came down with a bit of lifestyle change – less salt, more walking, that sort of thing. But I wouldn’t say I have any chronic medical conditions, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s what your exam findings suggest as well. Next question: Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single one. I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I might take a paracetamol, but that’s it. Just for the odd headache, you understand, nothing permanent. I prefer to try and rest if I can, rather than rely on medication.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Next question: Have you been hospitalized or had any major surgery in the past five years?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. The last time I was in hospital was… goodness, it must be twenty years ago or more, when I twisted my knee. It wasn't a major surgery, just physiotherapy. Apart from that, I’ve been perfectly healthy, thankfully. No hospital visits or major operations in the last five years, or indeed for the last twenty!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, insect stings, or other substances?
PATIENT: As we discussed earlier, Doctor, no, I don’t have any known allergies. I eat most things, I’m not bothered by insects, and I haven’t ever had a reaction to any medication. It’s a bit unusual, I know, but I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s great! Finally, do you have any physical limitations that might affect your ability to participate in cruise activities?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I can walk easily, I can climb stairs, I can lift things… well, within reason, of course. I don’t have any problems with my mobility or my stamina. I can enjoy all sorts of activities – walking tours, swimming, dancing… I’m not a spring chicken, mind you, but I'm still quite active and independent.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, Velda, that completes the form. Here you go. I've summarized everything we discussed and confirmed that you are fit to travel. I would recommend bringing a small first-aid kit with you, just in case, and staying well-hydrated during your cruise. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor, thank you so much. Everything looks correct, yes. No, I don’t think I have any questions, actually. You’ve been very thorough and put my mind completely at ease. I feel much more confident about going on my cruise now. Thank you again for your time and your help. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. I'm glad I could help. Have a wonderful time on your cruise! Enjoy the Mediterranean, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns after you return. Safe travels!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will do that. Goodbye.
