DOCTOR: Hi Manuel, good to see you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to see you too. My wife… she wants a baby. We… we want to try. But we old now. I think… maybe need check, yes? Everything okay before? I not remember everything so well anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Manuel, that’s perfectly reasonable. It’s smart to get a check-up before starting a family, especially as you mentioned wanting to make sure everything is okay. We'll do our best to get a good picture of your health. So, just to confirm, you're Manuel Carlotta, 70 years old, and you’re here with your wife hoping to start a family. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Carlotta, yes. Seventy… I think so. Time… goes fast. My wife, she does all the remembering. I just… come with. She say is important. Medicare… we have that for insurance. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Manuel, Medicare is perfectly fine. We take Medicare here. Don't worry about a thing. It’s wonderful that you and your wife are planning this together, and it’s great she’s so involved. It’s also perfectly normal to feel a little uncertain when starting this process. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been seeing a regular doctor for a while now?
PATIENT: Doctor… yes, I see doctor. Not… always the same one. Different ones. For check-ups… and when I hurt. But… I not remember names. Old hospital… near the city, I think. Not so much problem, usually. Just… old age things. Back pain… sometimes. But nothing serious, I hope. My wife always knows. She takes notes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, you've had some back pain on and off, and you've seen doctors at a hospital near the city, but you don’t recall specific names or doctors. That's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any specific medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… blood… something? No, I don’t think so. Doctor never say that. Diabetes… is that with sugar? I like sweet tea, sometimes. No, no sugar problem. Heart… maybe a little fast sometimes when I walk up hill. But nothing the doctor worried about. I think. It was a long time ago. My wife will know for sure. She keep all the papers.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known diagnoses of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems, and occasional palpitations when walking uphill. We'll definitely look into that a bit further. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I think… yes. Long time ago. When I was young. Broken arm… when I fall from tree. And… maybe something on my leg? I not remember exactly. Is was a long time ago, in my country. Different hospital. So many years… My wife! She will remember. She keep everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm when you were younger and possibly a surgery on your leg, a long time ago in your country. We'll try to get more details on that if possible. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has any significant medical conditions like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… that is hard. I not see them much. Long ago. In Somalia. My father… he was strong. But he get sick… old age. I think. And my mother… she die young. Something with her heart, maybe? I don't remember much. It was a long, long time ago. No brothers or sisters… just me. Sorry. I not very good at remembering family things. It sad, yes?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Manuel. It's understandable that you don't have much information about your family's medical history, especially given the circumstances. We won't press it if you don’t know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. No smoke. Never. My wife, she no like smoke. Bad for health, she say. I listen to my wife. Always. She is very smart, my wife. Very healthy too. She takes care of me.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. And it's great that you listen to your wife—healthy habits are important. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. Small glass of wine with dinner. My wife, she drink too. But not much. We not drink every day. Only special occasions. It’s okay wine, yes? Not strong drink. Not like the young people! We old now. Not much need for strong drinks.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional small glass of wine with dinner. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about any medications you’re currently taking. Do you take any prescription medications, vitamins, or over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Medications… No. I don’t think so. Maybe… sometimes, for my back. But only when it very bad. Small white pill… I not remember the name. My wife, she give it to me. She keep all the pills. I just take them when she tell me. Vitamin… sometimes, for old bones. She give those too. Sorry. I not very good with pills. She take care of all that.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Manuel. It sounds like your wife manages your medications, and you take them as needed. We can ask her to bring a list of everything you take when she comes in. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline understanding of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam… okay. Yes, that is okay. But… not too much poking, please? My old bones… they not so strong. Just… quick look, yes? My wife, she always worry when I have exams. She say I break easy!
DOCTOR: Of course, Manuel. I'll be very gentle. Just a quick look, as you requested. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but we’ll want to investigate that further with an EKG. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look in your ears. Ears look clear. And finally, let’s open your mouth and say "ah." Throat looks clear as well. Everything seems okay, but the murmur and slightly elevated blood pressure warrant a little more investigation. We'll order an EKG and some blood work. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Murmur… EKG… Blood work… Is that bad, Doctor? I not like too much poking and tests. Is everything okay? My wife… she get so worried. Maybe just… take it easy? Just check I can still have a baby? I not want to worry my wife. She so happy to think about a baby.
DOCTOR: Manuel, it's understandable that you're concerned. The murmur and slightly elevated blood pressure aren't necessarily bad, but they’re things we want to investigate to make sure you're healthy and strong enough for this journey. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart, and the blood work will give us a good overview of your overall health. These tests aren't meant to scare you; they’re just a precaution. It’s like making sure the foundation of a house is strong before building on it. We want to make sure everything is safe and healthy before proceeding. And yes, we absolutely want to see if you're able to have a baby. That's our goal here. The tests will help us determine if there are any potential issues that need to be addressed first. I'll explain everything to your wife as well, so she understands what's going on. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: House… strong foundation… yes. That make sense. My wife… she will understand. She always does. Tests… okay. If you think is best. But not too much poking, please? And can we still think about baby after? She so happy… I not want to take that away. That is all I want. Just happy family.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Manuel. No unnecessary poking, I promise. And yes, absolutely. These tests are to help you achieve your goal of having a happy family, not to take it away. I’ll order the EKG and blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood and get you set up for the EKG. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet and get regular exercise, as you are already doing. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Healthy diet… regular exercise… yes. We do that. Nurse… blood work… okay. I trust you, Doctor. Thank you. You make me feel better now. Just happy family… that is all we want. Thank you for being kind. That is important. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Manuel. It’s my pleasure. And I understand. A happy family is the most important thing. The nurse will be with you shortly. Don't hesitate to let her know if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Manuel, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
