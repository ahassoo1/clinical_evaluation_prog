DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, and my friend, Carol, she said I really should get it checked out. She worries about me sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's good that Carol is looking out for you. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to address. And you’re right to get it checked. When you say “a bit high lately,” could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm...well, I don’t really keep track, to be honest. I went to a pharmacy last month 'cause my arm was feeling kinda funny, and the machine said it was a little high then. And then just last week, I was at a health fair and they checked it again, and it was up a bit too. Not crazy high, but enough for the nurse to say I should see a doctor. I don’t really feel any different, though. That’s the thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was checked at the pharmacy about a month ago, and then again at a health fair last week. And you haven’t noticed any symptoms yourself. That’s helpful to know. Do you happen to remember the numbers they gave you at either of those checks?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s the trouble with me, I never remember numbers. I wish I did! I think… I think the pharmacy one was something like 140 over… 90? Maybe? And the health fair, the nurse just said it was a little higher than normal, she didn’t give me a specific number, just a worried look. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. I really should write these things down, shouldn't I?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mykeisha. Don’t worry about it. Numbers can be tricky to remember, and that’s what we’re here for. 140/90 is a good starting point. To get a better understanding of things, I'd like to take your blood pressure now, and then we can discuss your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never diagnosed with high blood pressure before. And…let me think. I had the flu really bad a few years back, and I broke my wrist once, but other than that, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I don't go to the doctor much, if I'm honest. I usually just try to tough things out. My grandmother always said fresh air and a good attitude is the best medicine!
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful philosophy, Mykeisha! And fresh air is good medicine. However, it’s important to check things out when there’s a change, just to be safe. Alright, so no prior diagnosis of high blood pressure, and generally healthy aside from the flu and a broken wrist. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I only take a vitamin D supplement sometimes in the winter, 'cause Carol says I don't get enough sun. She worries about my bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Carol sounds like a very caring friend, Mykeisha. It’s good you have someone looking out for you. Okay, so no known allergies, just the Vitamin D supplement. And you mentioned you don’t take any other medications regularly?
PATIENT: Nope, that's it. Just the Vitamin D when I remember. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly fish and vegetables, and I drink a lot of water. My mother always made sure we had a good diet. She was a fantastic cook.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mykeisha. A good diet and staying hydrated are very important. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My mother, she had diabetes, I think. And my grandfather on my father’s side, he had something with his heart, but I don’t really know what. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about these things much back then. They just said he had a “weak heart.” Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mykeisha. Diabetes and heart issues in the family are good things for us to know. Even if the details are limited, it gives us some important information. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother would have had a fit! She was very strict about that. And I don’t really drink alcohol much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's good to hear. Now, how about exercise?
PATIENT: Well…I wouldn’t say I exercise exactly. I walk a lot though! I walk to the grocery store, I walk to visit Carol, I walk to get my hair done… I try to stay moving, you know? It's not like I go to a gym or anything.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mykeisha. Walking is a fantastic way to stay active. Any amount of movement is beneficial. Now, before we proceed, would you mind if I quickly check your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, that’s fine. No problem at all. I’m not very tall, you know. My family, we’re all kinda petite.
DOCTOR: Alright, your height is 157 centimeters, and your weight is 132 pounds. That puts your BMI in a healthy range. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Go ahead. I always get a little nervous when doctors listen to my chest, though! It feels so… official, you know?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm not hearing anything concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 142 over 94. It is a bit elevated, which is what prompted you to come in today.
PATIENT: Oh… Is that bad? It is higher than the last time, isn't it? I knew I should have written it down…
DOCTOR: It’s not an emergency, Mykeisha, but it is higher than ideal and confirms we need to address this. A single reading isn’t always definitive, and blood pressure can fluctuate. But consistently elevated readings warrant further investigation. It's considered Stage 1 hypertension. Do you have any history of headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: No, no headaches or dizziness. And my vision is fine, as far as I know. I had my eyes checked last year and everything was good. I do sometimes get a little tired, but I just figured that's from walking so much!
DOCTOR: Okay, no headaches, dizziness, or vision changes, just occasional tiredness. That’s helpful. To get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to order some routine blood work. This will help us check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your elevated blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better, and know what's going on. And I want to keep walking! Is it a lot of blood? I don’t like needles very much…
DOCTOR: It's not a lot of blood, Mykeisha. Just a standard vial or two. And we can definitely make it as comfortable as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled. While we wait for the results, I recommend starting some lifestyle modifications. These include reducing your salt intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and continuing regular physical activity, like your walking. I also recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home, if possible. Would you be interested in learning more about home blood pressure monitoring?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Salt, walking, and checking at home… I can do that. I'm pretty good at following instructions, if you give me a list! And yes, please, tell me about the home monitoring. Where would I even start? I don’t even know what kind of machine to buy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here's a pamphlet with some information on home blood pressure monitoring. It explains how to choose a reliable machine – look for one that's cuff-based, and is validated by a reputable organization. It also explains the proper technique for taking your blood pressure – it’s important to sit quietly for five minutes beforehand, and to use the correct cuff size. I recommend taking your blood pressure twice a day – once in the morning, and once in the evening – and recording the results. Bring those recordings with you to your next appointment so we can review them together. I’ll also write you a prescription for the blood work. You can have it filled at your pharmacy, and they'll schedule the appointment for you. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, that sounds pretty straightforward, actually. A machine, two times a day, and bring the numbers... I can do that! And the prescription, I'll just take it to Carol's pharmacy, she always knows what to do. She's my go-to for all things medical. So, is that everything for today, Doctor? Or should I be worried about anything in the meantime?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mykeisha. You've got a very good system in place! For now, that's everything. I don't want you to be overly worried. We’re going to investigate this, and hopefully, with some lifestyle changes and monitoring, we can get your blood pressure under control. However, if you experience any severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please seek immediate medical attention. Don't hesitate to go to the emergency room if you're concerned. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the blood work results and review your blood pressure recordings. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Two weeks is good. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for not making me feel too worried. Carol always says I overthink things, but it’s hard not to when you don't know what's going on! I think that’s everything. I’ll go get the prescription filled now. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. And you are right to ask questions and be proactive about your health. It's good that you have Carol to support you. You have a wonderful day as well. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again. Bye-bye!
