DOCTOR: Alright, Lucia Fogelstrom, 38 years old… So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor… It’s… the belching. I keep… burping. A lot. It’s embarrassing, really. It started, hmm… maybe a week ago? I don’t know exactly. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Burping, okay. A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. About a week. Not all day, but… after I eat, mostly. And sometimes… even when I’m not eating. It doesn’t hurt, just… loud. And it smells… bad, I think.
DOCTOR: Smells bad, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Not always, but sometimes. Like… onions, maybe? Or garlic. Even if I didn’t eat onions or garlic. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s just… weird.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sometimes digestion just… gets off track. Let’s see… do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… not really. No pain. No… feeling sick to my stomach. Just the burping. And… maybe a little bit of… feeling full, even when I don’t eat much? But not always. I don’t know. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what does your typical diet look like?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… I work at the factory, so sometimes it's quick things. Sandwiches, you know? Or… leftovers from home. My sister, she makes good rice and beans. I like that. And sometimes I eat… I don’t know, fast food if I’m working late. Not healthy, I guess. But I try to eat okay.
DOCTOR: Right. And any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… not really. Maybe a little more… soda lately? It's hot, you know? And it helps with work. But it's not every day. Nothing big, I don't think. Why? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Soda... yes, that could be contributing. Carbonation. Let's do a quick examination, just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. What will you do? I don't like doctors very much. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt. I’m just listening to your abdomen, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Listening… Is it cold? The thing you use? I get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out. Okay. Not much to note, honestly. Everything sounds… normal. A little gurgling, which is expected.
PATIENT: Normal? So… what does that mean? Is it something serious? I get scared sometimes, you know? About my health. My mama… she had problems.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. It sounds like a bit of indigestion, possibly exacerbated by the soda and… your diet. It’s probably just trapped gas.
PATIENT: Trapped gas? Like… beans? Is that why? I do like my sister’s rice and beans… But I eat them for a long time… and never had this problem before.
DOCTOR: Look, sometimes foods just…react differently. It doesn’t mean it’s dangerous. Try cutting back on the soda and… be mindful of what you're eating. If it continues, you can try an over-the-counter gas remedy. We’re done here. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… like at the store? What kind? And… “mindful?” What does that mean? I don't want it to get worse. And what if it is my sister’s beans? I don’t want to tell her… she’ll be sad.
DOCTOR: There are several options at the pharmacy. Ask the pharmacist. And "mindful" means pay attention to how your body reacts to food. If you are really concerned, you can schedule a follow-up appointment, but honestly, it sounds like a minor issue. Here. That’s the number for the clinic. Next!
