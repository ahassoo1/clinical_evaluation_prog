DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's lovely to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation lately, and honestly, I'm just… curious. I work on the railway – signal and track switches, you know – and it can be quite stressful. I thought maybe learning some techniques could help me manage things a little better. I’m not sure exactly what it involves, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very insightful of you to proactively explore stress management techniques, especially given the demands of your profession. While I am a physician specializing in internal medicine, and can offer guidance on the physiological effects of stress and potential medical interventions, I'm not a trained mindfulness or meditation instructor. However, I can certainly discuss how stress impacts your health, and perhaps point you towards resources that can provide proper instruction. Before we do that, could you describe what specifically you’ve been experiencing that leads you to believe stress is a concern?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes perfect sense! I didn’t realize you wouldn’t be… teaching it, exactly. No problem at all. Well, it’s not so much one big thing, you know? It's more like… a constant feeling of being on edge. I find myself worrying a lot, even when things are quiet. And I sleep okay, usually, but sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with my mind racing. I also get headaches fairly often – tension headaches, I think they are called. They’re not debilitating, but they’re… annoying. And lately, I’ve been a little more irritable than usual, I think. My neighbor commented on it, actually, which is when I really started to think about it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're experiencing a constellation of symptoms consistent with stress and possibly some anxiety. I see here in your chart that you had a routine check-up last year with normal findings, and no documented history of significant mental health concerns. However, these symptoms can certainly develop over time. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the timing of these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, good, that's good to know the last check-up was normal! I do try to keep up with those. As for the timing… hmm. It's hard to pinpoint exactly. I'd say it's been gradually getting worse over the last six months, maybe? Things at work have been a bit more hectic. There was a derailment a few months back – thankfully no one was hurt, but it was… unsettling. And there’s been a lot of track work, which means long hours and a lot of pressure to get everything done right. It’s not constant, but those periods definitely make it worse. When things calm down, it’s better, but it never really goes away completely, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful. It sounds like work-related stress is a significant contributing factor, with acute events like the derailment exacerbating your symptoms. To further assess the impact on your daily life, could you tell me a little about your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Well, like I said earlier, I usually sleep okay. I generally get about seven or eight hours a night. I fall asleep fairly easily – I don’t lie awake for hours, thankfully. But, and this is probably the important part, I don’t feel rested when I wake up. It’s like I haven’t had enough deep sleep, you know? And as I said, I do wake up sometimes in the middle of the night, usually with my mind racing about work. It’s not every night, but it happens a couple of times a week, maybe. I can usually fall back asleep, but it takes a bit. And like I said, I don’t feel completely refreshed in the morning. Does that explain it well enough? I'm not very good at describing these things, I apologize!
DOCTOR: You're describing it perfectly well, Ms. Sugino. Don’t apologize at all. It’s very common to have difficulty articulating these types of subjective experiences. The fact that you’re not feeling rested despite adequate sleep duration, and experiencing nighttime awakenings with racing thoughts, is further indication that stress is impacting your sleep quality. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about other areas of your health. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know I’m describing it okay! It’s just… hard to put into words. As for my appetite… hmm. It's been a little all over the place, honestly. Some days I have a really good appetite, and other days I just don’t feel like eating much at all. I haven’t lost any weight, though – if anything, I’ve probably gained a little. I do enjoy my cooking, and sometimes I find myself eating just to… comfort myself, I suppose. It’s not a huge amount, but I’ve noticed my clothes feeling a bit snugger lately. Nothing drastic, but noticeable. I used to be very active – hiking, gardening – but honestly, I haven’t had the energy or motivation for that lately. It’s a vicious cycle, I think.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where stress is affecting both your sleep and your eating habits, and leading to reduced activity levels. That’s very common. Before we discuss potential next steps, I’d like to quickly review your past medical history, surgical history, family history, allergies and medications. I see here in your chart you have no known allergies and are not currently taking any medications. Do you have any significant past medical or surgical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing significant, thankfully. I had my appendix removed when I was a child – that was a long time ago – but otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy. No major illnesses, no chronic conditions. My family… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart problems later in life, but nothing I’m particularly worried about. I try to eat a healthy diet and stay as active as I can, but honestly, it’s been difficult lately. I’m glad you’re checking, though. It’s good to be thorough!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Sugino. It's helpful to have that information. Given your symptoms – the persistent feeling of being on edge, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, reduced activity levels, and the impact of work-related stress – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of adjustment disorder with anxiety and possibly mild depression. However, to rule out any other underlying medical conditions, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Adjustment disorder… that sounds… about right, honestly. It feels like I’m just not coping very well with everything lately. A physical exam sounds perfectly fine. I don’t mind at all. I suppose it’s best to rule everything out, just in case. Where would you like me to start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for your cooperation. Let's start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological assessment. Your blood pressure is 138/86. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given you're describing some stress. Your pulse is 72, temperature is 98.6, and respiratory rate is 16. All within normal limits. Now, if you'll please lie back on the table…
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I try to relax my shoulders. It's a bit hard, honestly, but I'll do my best. Please just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No sensory deficits noted. The physical exam is within normal limits. This doesn’t rule anything out, but it does suggest that your symptoms are unlikely to be caused by an underlying medical condition. I’m leaning towards a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxiety, potentially with mild depressive symptoms. Before we discuss a treatment plan, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s… a relief, I suppose, to know it’s not something physical. It just felt like something was wrong, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. Adjustment disorder… it makes sense, given everything. Um… yes, I do have a question. What does that mean, exactly? What does treatment involve? I’m not really keen on taking medication, if I can avoid it. And I'm not sure I have the time for… I don't know… long therapy sessions. I work quite a lot, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. It's good to be proactive about your health and consider all your options. Adjustment disorder means your symptoms are a response to a specific stressor – in your case, work-related stress. It’s a common condition, and usually resolves with time and appropriate support. Treatment typically involves a combination of strategies. We can start with lifestyle modifications – prioritizing sleep, regular exercise, and a healthy diet, as we’ve already discussed. Mindfulness techniques, while I'm not a trained instructor, I can provide resources for guided meditation apps or local classes. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is often very effective in helping you develop coping mechanisms, and we can explore options for brief, solution-focused therapy. Regarding medication, we can certainly discuss it, but it’s not always necessary, and I understand your hesitation. We can try non-pharmacological interventions first and re-evaluate if needed. Would you be open to exploring those options?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, yes. The lifestyle modifications I think I can handle, although I’ll need to make a real effort. And I’m definitely interested in those resources for mindfulness – maybe an app would be good. I could try that during my commute, perhaps. Brief therapy sounds… less daunting than long sessions. I'm just worried about finding the time. And I'm happy to hold off on medication for now, if we can. Do you have any recommendations for local classes or apps? And what about the brief therapy – what would that involve, roughly? How long are the sessions, and how often?
DOCTOR: Certainly. For mindfulness apps, Headspace and Calm are both very popular and have a lot of guided meditations for stress and anxiety. There’s also Insight Timer, which has a large library of free meditations. As for local classes, I have a brochure here for “Mindful Living Center” in the next town over – they offer a variety of courses. Regarding brief therapy, I work with a wonderful therapist, Sarah Chen, who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. Typically, sessions are 45-60 minutes long, and we can start with a block of 6-8 sessions to assess your progress. We can always extend that if needed. The focus would be on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, developing coping mechanisms for stress, and improving your overall well-being. I can provide her contact information if you’re interested. Finally, I recommend prioritizing regular check-ins with your primary care physician to monitor your overall health and address any other concerns. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… very good, actually. Headspace or Calm sound like a good place to start. And the brochure is great - I’ll definitely look into that. Sarah Chen sounds promising - I’d like her contact information, please. Six to eight sessions sounds manageable. And yes, I do see my doctor regularly. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much better knowing there are options, and that it’s not just… me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It’s not just you at all. Many people experience similar challenges, and it takes courage to seek help. I'm glad I could provide some guidance. Here's a summary of our plan: prioritize lifestyle modifications, explore mindfulness apps or classes, and consider a block of 6-8 CBT sessions with Sarah Chen. I’ll also document this plan in your chart. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I’m here to support you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I wish you all the best on your journey to well-being. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
