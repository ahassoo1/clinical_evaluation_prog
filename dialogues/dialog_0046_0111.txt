DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I suppose I should. Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest notion why I’m here, other than my wife insisted. Something about my skin… looking unwell, she said. And fatigue, naturally. At my age, what isn’t fatigued? I’ve been working with iron and rebar for… a long time. A very long time. Get on with it, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common for changes in skin to prompt a visit, and fatigue can certainly accompany many conditions, especially as we get older. It's good your wife encouraged you to come in. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say your skin looks unwell, can you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… darker. A bit grey, perhaps. Not a pleasant colour, I assure you. It’s hard to explain. I don’t spend my days scrutinizing my complexion. My wife pointed it out. She always points things out. It’s not like it’s urgent. It just… is. And I’m tired. Always tired these days. A man my age is allowed to be tired, isn’t he? Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, a man your age is certainly allowed to be tired. And we’ll try to make this as efficient as possible. The change in skin colour you mentioned is helpful. Is this darkness all over, or in specific areas?
PATIENT: Honestly, I couldn't tell you. Everywhere, I suppose. I don’t go around examining my limbs. My hands, perhaps? They're always covered in grime from the work. It's difficult to say. Look, are you going to do something, or simply ask questions? I haven't got all day, you know. And I haven’t the memory for details, so probing about “specific areas” is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. We will certainly do something. Before we proceed, though, it's important to gather some information so I can provide the best care. It helps me to rule out different possibilities. To start, have you noticed any other changes besides the skin colour and fatigue?
PATIENT: Other changes? At my age? What hasn’t changed? My knees ache, my back aches, my appetite comes and goes… Is this what you doctors do? List every ailment of a geriatric patient? I suppose I’m a bit more… short of breath than I used to be. But that’s to be expected after decades of hauling iron. It's not exactly breaking news. Look, can we skip the inventory, please? It’s quite demeaning.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel demeaning, Mr. Drahota. I assure you, I’m not trying to list every ailment. These details do help me to get a clearer picture of your overall health and what might be causing your symptoms. You mentioned shortness of breath. Has that been worsening recently, or is it something you’ve just noticed over time?
PATIENT: Worsening, I suppose. Everything is worsening at my age! But… yes, recently it's been a bit more noticeable. I used to be able to walk up a flight of stairs without feeling like I’d run a marathon. Now… it’s more of an ordeal. But it's probably just the years catching up. I'm not expecting a miracle cure, you know. Just… tell me if it’s something serious, and then let’s be done with it. I’ve got work to do. A man doesn’t build things sitting around answering questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get back to work, Mr. Drahota. It's good you’re noticing these changes, and you are right to bring them to my attention. Just to clarify, when you say shortness of breath, is it with exertion only, like walking stairs, or do you experience it even when you're resting?
PATIENT: Mostly exertion. When I'm working, certainly. And now, with the stairs, as I said. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting. Unless, of course, I’ve just come in from a long day. Then, everything feels a bit… strained. Honestly, this is becoming tedious. Are we getting anywhere? I feel like I'm reliving my entire medical history for no good reason.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Drahota, thank you. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or lung issues?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I've been perfectly healthy my entire life. Worked hard, ate… reasonably well, I suppose. No time for doctors, or hospitals, or any of that nonsense. The occasional ache and pain, of course. A man who works with iron gets knocked around a bit. But no diagnoses, no. Never had the need. My wife is always fussing, always suggesting I see someone, but I always brushed it off. She worries too much. And frankly, I resent having to recall every minor injury I’ve sustained over eight decades. It's a waste of time. Can we move on? I feel a nap coming on.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no previous diagnoses, and you’ve generally been healthy. Let's quickly go through a few other things then. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, goodness. Let me think… a minor appendectomy when I was a boy, perhaps? It was a very long time ago, I barely remember it. And… a small procedure on my hand, years ago, when I caught it in some machinery at the works. Nothing serious. A few stitches, that’s all. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. Are you quite finished? I'm feeling increasingly unwell just talking about it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a hand procedure. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I don’t believe in all that pharmaceutical nonsense. A bit of liniment for my aching joints, perhaps. And my wife insists I take some vitamin D in the winter, but I often forget. That’s about it. I prefer natural remedies, if you must know. Fresh air, hard work, a bit of rest… that’s all a man needs. Can we please move on? I’m beginning to feel quite faint. I suspect this interview is actively worsening my condition.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – had any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or lung problems?
