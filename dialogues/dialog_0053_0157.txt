DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, it's probably just stress. My husband… well, he worries a lot, and it gets to me. I don’t see what the big deal is, but here I am.
DOCTOR: “Stress,” right. Everyone says stress. Let’s not jump to conclusions, though. The nurse did mention a slightly elevated reading, but a single reading doesn’t tell us much. Have you been feeling any symptoms because of this “stress”, or the blood pressure itself?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really. Maybe a little tired, but who isn't? I work. He works. Life is… life. I don’t go around feeling things just because a machine says my blood is doing something it shouldn’t. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "not feeling things" isn't exactly a helpful diagnostic tool, Ms. Dudney. Fatigue can be a symptom, certainly, but it's incredibly vague. We need to be a bit more specific. Have you noticed any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? Sometimes. But I get them from the sun, mostly. I’m outside a lot for my job, you know, surveying. It’s… well, it’s work. Not everything is a medical emergency. Honestly, I think I just need a vacation. And maybe for my husband to calm down. Is that what you write down? “Husband needs to calm down”?
DOCTOR: We're documenting your concerns, Ms. Dudney, not your husband's emotional state. Still, let’s get a better picture. Do these headaches feel different from your usual sun headaches?
PATIENT: Different how? They're headaches. They hurt. Sometimes they’re worse when it's really hot, sometimes they're just… there. I don't sit around analyzing my pain levels, if that's what you want to know. Look, I appreciate you trying to do your job, but I'm not a delicate flower.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, with all due respect, minimizing your symptoms isn't helping us determine the cause of the elevated blood pressure. It's not about being a “delicate flower.” It’s about gathering information. Have you had any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No. Not that I’ve noticed. I see fine. I mean, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I couldn’t see, would I? Honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated for something I barely even have. It's just…pressure. Everyone gets pressure sometimes. Can we just…get this over with? I have a deadline. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Just basic vitals, listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Blood pressure, pulse, respiration…and I’d like to check your reflexes. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Dudney. Please sit back and relax. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs sound clear. Reflexes are…a little diminished. Not alarming, but worth noting.
