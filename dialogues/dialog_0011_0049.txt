DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Schneer, that's me. Uh… well, things haven’t been so clear lately, if you catch my drift. People seem to be mumblin’ more, or maybe I’m the one mumblin’. It’s hard to say, really. I just know I don’t hear as well as I used to. It’s been goin’ on for… well, a while now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schneer. It's quite common for hearing to change as we age. You mentioned this has been going on for a “while.” Could you tell me approximately how long you've been noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while… that’s a tricky one. Seems like… maybe a few years now? Hard to put a finger on it. I used to work in the shoe factory, lots of noise there, clackin’ and hummin’ all day long. Maybe it started around the time I retired… or maybe before. It all kinda blends together after a bit, ya know? I don't rightly remember when it started started, just that it's gotten worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Working in a noisy environment like a shoe factory could certainly contribute to hearing changes. So, it sounds like this has been a gradual process over several years. To help me understand a bit better, could you describe when you notice the difficulty most?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly when there’s a lot goin’ on, like when folks are talkin’ over each other. Or in restaurants… always a bother in restaurants! Quiet rooms are alright, mostly. And one-on-one conversations, if they speak up a bit. But tryin’ to follow a group… forget about it. And the television… I have to turn it up pretty loud, which my neighbor ain’t too happy about, I reckon. He’s a nice fella, though. Always wavin’.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. That gives me a clearer picture. So, it’s more challenging in noisy environments and with multiple speakers. It sounds like it’s particularly affecting your ability to discern speech in those situations, and you've noticed needing to increase the volume on the television. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes. It’s not constant, more like… a faint whistle, every now and then. Mostly at night, I think. Or when I'm really tired. It doesn’t bother me too much, but it's there. Like a tiny little tea kettle, but quieter. I usually just ignore it. Is that… bad? I don’t even know if it’s related to the hearin’ or not.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Schneer. The ringing you’re describing – that faint whistling sound, particularly at night or when tired – is what we call tinnitus. It can often be associated with hearing loss, although it can also have other causes. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Doc, I’m an old man, I’ve probably got somethin’ or other! Um… high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but I take a little pill for that. And my knees… they ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. Arthritis, I think it’s called. Other than that… nothin’ I can rightly recall. I go to the doc for checkups now and then, but he mostly just talks about my weight. Medicare covers it, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. High blood pressure and arthritis are good to know. And that’s good you're keeping up with regular checkups. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure, I believe. A little white one. I take it every mornin’ with my coffee. And sometimes, when my knees are really achin’, I take somethin’ over-the-counter… ibuprofen, I think it's called? The kind you get at the drugstore. But that’s not every day, just when I need it. I don't take a whole lot of pills, never have.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Just the blood pressure medication regularly, and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family had hearing loss, tinnitus, or any other ear problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tough one. My brothers and sisters… there were a lot of us, and we’re all scattered now. I don’t really remember anyone havin' trouble with their ears specifically. My dad… he was a bit hard of hearin' when he got real old, but I figured that was just from age. Mom… she was always pretty sharp, as far as I recall. We didn't really talk about medical stuff much back then. It wasn’t like it is now with all the tests and doctors and whatnot. I'm not much help, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. It’s common not to have detailed knowledge of family medical history. Now, let's move on to a brief physical examination. I'd like to take a look in your ears with an otoscope, just to check for any visible issues, and then we'll do a quick hearing screening. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, Doc, whatever you need. I trust your judgement. Been goin’ to doctors my whole life, figured I’d get used to bein’ poked and prodded. Go right ahead. Don't you worry about bein’ gentle, I'm a tough old bird. Just let me know if you see anythin' interestin’. I haven't cleaned my ears in… well, a long time. They probably look like a jungle in there!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Let’s take a look. Okay. I see some cerumen – that's earwax – but nothing significant. The ear canal appears clear. And the left ear looks similar – some cerumen, but no obvious blockage or inflammation. Now, I'm going to perform a quick hearing screening. I’ll put headphones on you and you’ll let me know when you hear a series of tones. This will just give us a basic idea of your hearing levels at different frequencies. Can you hear this tone?
PATIENT: Yep, I hear somethin'. Kinda high-pitched, like a tea kettle whistlin', but softer. Is that good? I always worry when they make me listen for sounds. Seems like I can always hear those high-pitched ones, even when I can’t hear folks talkin’. Don't know what that says about me, but it can't be good. Go ahead, keep goin'. I'll try my best. Just tell me if I’m supposed to raise my hand or somethin'? I'm a little confused about what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. You’re doing great. It’s common to hear high-pitched tones even with some degree of hearing loss. Just raise your hand whenever you hear any sound, no matter how faint or high-pitched. And don't worry about being right or wrong, we're just gathering information. Okay, thank you for your patience. The results of the hearing screening indicate a mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, particularly at the higher frequencies. This aligns with what you've described – difficulty hearing in noisy environments and needing to increase the volume on the television. It also explains why you may be able to hear high-pitched sounds but have trouble with speech. Now, based on your history and the hearing screening, I believe you have noise-induced hearing loss, likely exacerbated by age-related changes. This is quite common, and there are several options we can explore. Would you like me to discuss those with you now?
PATIENT: Noise-induced, huh? Figures. All them years in the shoe factory. Clackin' and hummin' 'til my ears rang. Didn't think much of it at the time. Now it catches up to me, I reckon. Yeah, Doc, please tell me what my options are. I’d like to hear what you think. I ain't lookin' for a miracle, just somethin' to make things a little easier. Is there somethin' I can take? Or maybe a fancy machine? I don’t want to be shoutin’ at folks all the time. It’s rude, and it tires me out. Go ahead and tell me what you got.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. There are several options we can consider. The most common and effective solution for this type of hearing loss is the use of hearing aids. Modern hearing aids are quite sophisticated and can be programmed to amplify specific frequencies based on your individual hearing loss profile. They're also very discreet and comfortable. Another option is assistive listening devices. These are devices that can help you hear better in specific situations, such as a television listening device or a personal amplifier for one-on-one conversations. Finally, communication strategies can also be helpful. This includes things like asking people to speak clearly and slowly, facing them when they’re talking, and reducing background noise when possible. Regarding medication, unfortunately, there is no medication that can reverse hearing loss. Would you like me to explain the hearing aid option in more detail?
PATIENT: Hearing aids, huh? Always thought them things were for really old folks. Still, if it helps… alright, tell me about 'em. What kind are there? Are they expensive? Do they make my ears look big? And… will they whistle? I don't wanna be walkin' around whistlin’ like a tea kettle all day. I'd probably scare the neighbors. Tell me everything, Doc. The good, the bad, and the whistlin’. And what about the insurance? Does Medicare cover any of it?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Schneer. It’s a very common misconception that hearing aids are only for very old folks. Many people experience hearing loss at various ages, and hearing aids can significantly improve their quality of life. There are several different types of hearing aids. Behind-the-ear hearing aids sit behind your ear and connect to a custom-molded earmold that fits in your ear canal. In-the-ear hearing aids fit directly inside your ear canal. There are also in-the-canal and completely-in-the-canal hearing aids, which are smaller and more discreet. The best type for you will depend on the severity of your hearing loss, your ear anatomy, and your personal preferences. Regarding cost, hearing aids can be expensive, typically ranging from $1,500 to $4,000 per aid. However, there are financing options available, and many insurance plans do provide some coverage. Now, regarding Medicare coverage… this can be a bit complex. Medicare Part B typically covers diagnostic hearing exams, but it generally does not cover the cost of hearing aids themselves. However, there are exceptions, and some Medicare Advantage plans do offer hearing aid benefits. I have a specialist referral I can provide who can help you navigate the insurance process and find a hearing aid that fits your budget and needs. As for whistling, modern hearing aids are designed to minimize feedback and whistling. However, it can sometimes occur if the hearing aid is not properly fitted or if there is earwax buildup in your ear canal. The audiologist will ensure that your hearing aid is properly fitted and will provide instructions on how to prevent feedback. Would you like me to provide you with that referral to a local audiologist?
PATIENT: Yes, Doc, please. A referral would be mighty helpful. I don’t even know where to begin lookin' for one of them… “audiologist” folks. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain all this to me. It’s a lot to take in, but it’s better than just shoutin' at folks, I reckon. And thank you for not laughin' at me when I mentioned the whistlin'. I get a little embarrassed talkin' about these things. I’m just an old man who can’t hear so good, tryin’ to figure things out. Tell ya what, give me that referral. And I’ll see what the audiologist says. Maybe I can finally hear the TV without blastin’ the neighbors out of their beds.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I’m happy to help in any way I can. I understand it can be overwhelming, and there’s no need to feel embarrassed. Hearing loss is a common issue, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Here’s the referral. This audiologist has a good reputation and works with a variety of hearing aid brands. They’ll be able to perform a comprehensive hearing evaluation and recommend the best solution for your needs. The referral also contains their contact information, so you can schedule an appointment at your convenience. They handle all the insurance paperwork. I’m also providing you with a handout summarizing today’s discussion, including information about hearing loss, hearing aids, and communication strategies. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doc, I think that’s about it. You’ve answered everything I could think of, and then some. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s good to know there’s folks like you around. Alright then, I guess I’ll be seein’ you next time, if I need to. Have a good day now, and thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day as well, and I hope you have success with the audiologist. Take care.
