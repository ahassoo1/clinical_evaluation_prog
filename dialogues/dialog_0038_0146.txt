DOCTOR: Alright, Edric, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, well, thanks, Doctor. It's… muscle weakness, mostly. It’s been getting on my nerves for a few weeks now, and I figured I should get it checked out before it gets worse. I don't really know what's causing it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness. And you said a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yeah, about three, maybe four weeks. It started… subtly, I guess. Just feeling a bit tired after normal stuff, like walking up the stairs. Now it's… more noticeable. Like, lifting things is harder, and my legs feel heavy sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, absolutely. And is this weakness all over, or is it more focused in certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms, a little, but not as bad. My hands seem alright, thankfully. I do a lot of work inspecting cars, so needing strong hands is… important. It's definitely worse on my right side, if that helps. I don’t know if that is helpful, though. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: No, that is helpful, Edric. Knowing it’s more on the right side is good information. And inspecting cars – that's a physically demanding job, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. Lots of bending, reaching, looking under cars… getting in and out of awkward positions. I try to be careful, but you know how it is. It can be rough on the body after a while. It hasn’t gotten so bad that I can’t do my job, but it’s definitely slowing me down. And I worry it will make it impossible if it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. Okay, let's get a little more detail. When you say "heavy," can you describe the sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not painful, exactly. More like… dragging. Like I’m trying to lift something really, really heavy, even when I’m not. Or walking through thick mud, maybe? It's hard to explain. It's just… effortful. And it gets worse the longer I’m on my feet, or if I’ve been doing something physical. Does that make any sense? I really am sorry if I’m being vague. I'm not a doctor.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing perfectly fine, Edric. That’s a really helpful description – “dragging” and like walking through mud. It gives me a much clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I've been a bit more tired than usual, but I figured that was just from work. No numbness, no tingling, no dizziness. Nothing like that. I haven’t been sick recently, no fever or anything. Just the weakness and the general tiredness. Oh, actually… my right leg has felt a little… jumpy sometimes. Not like a spasm, but… twitchy, I guess. It doesn't happen often, though. Maybe once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the twitching. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. Everything’s… normal on that front, if you don't mind me saying. Sorry, a bit of a personal question. I understand you need to ask, though. It just feels a bit odd talking about it.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Edric. It’s an important question to rule things out, and you’re right to point that out. I appreciate your honesty. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, measles… nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but it healed fine. No allergies, no ongoing health problems. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything. I try to stay healthy, eat reasonably well, but… work keeps me busy, so it’s not always easy. I haven't been to a doctor in a few years, to be honest. Just for check-ups, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my dad had high blood pressure, and my mother had some arthritis in her knees when she got older. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. No history of anything neurological, like Parkinson’s or anything like that. My siblings are both healthy, too, as far as I’m aware. We don’t really talk about medical stuff much, to be honest. Mostly just stay in touch about family things. Does that answer your question? I’m trying to think! It’s been a while since anyone asked me about this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Edric. It sounds like a relatively healthy family history. Now, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I try to avoid medication if I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be on the safe side, but that’s about it. Nothing regular. I don’t really believe in taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I prefer to just try and get enough rest and eat well, but like I said, work makes that hard. That’s everything, isn’t it? This feels like a lot of questions. I hope you're getting somewhere.
DOCTOR: You’ve been very helpful, Edric, and I appreciate your honesty. It is a lot of questions, but it helps me get a clear picture. Okay, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It won’t take long. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Get it over with, I suppose. I just want to know what's going on. The sooner the better, really. I have cars to inspect, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be great. I'll start with checking your reflexes. Just relax your legs, and I’ll tap a few spots with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay, good. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I’m not very strong, Doctor. It's mostly grip strength, right? I do a lot of detailed work, so it's precision, not brute force. I'm trying, honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you to push against my hands with your feet. I’ll resist a little, so push as hard as you can. We’ll start with your right leg. Okay, good. Now, your left leg. Alright. I also want to check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a bit awkward with my eyes closed. I'm not very coordinated, Doctor, I'm an inspector, not a gymnast. It's harder than it looks. My right arm feels a bit… heavy, actually. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Edric. That's helpful. So, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, there are a few things I’m noting. You’ve described muscle weakness that’s been progressively getting worse over the last few weeks, predominantly on your right side. The exam shows reduced reflexes and strength in your right leg and hand, and some difficulty with coordination. It's not dramatic, but it's definitely there. Now, there are a number of possibilities here. It could be something relatively minor, like a pinched nerve or muscle strain. However, given the progressive nature and the focal weakness, we need to rule out some more serious possibilities. I'm thinking we should do some blood work to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and inflammatory markers. I also think an MRI of your brain and spine would be a good idea to get a better look at your nerves and muscles. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious. Blood work, okay, I can handle that. But an MRI… what are we looking for, exactly? And how long will all this take? I have work, you know. I don't want to be off work for weeks. I'm not insured, Doctor, just to warn you. This could get expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Edric. It is a lot, and it's perfectly reasonable to be anxious. The MRI is just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, to rule things out. We're looking for any signs of nerve compression, inflammation, or other structural problems. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it helps us make an accurate diagnosis. Regarding the time frame, the blood work can be done today, and the results usually come back within a few days. The MRI will take a bit longer to schedule, depending on availability, but hopefully no more than a week. We can discuss options to minimize your time off work. As for the cost, I understand you’re uninsured. Let me see what options are available. We can explore payment plans, and there may be some financial assistance programs we can look into. I also have a list of imaging centers that offer discounted rates for uninsured patients. We'll figure something out. In the meantime, I'm going to order the blood work. And I'll get the paperwork started for the MRI referral. Would you like me to explain what the blood tests are for?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… good. Payment plans, I appreciate that. And the list of centers, yes, please. Explain the tests, yes. I like to know what's happening, even if I don't understand all the medical jargon. Just… keep it simple, okay? I'm an inspector, not a doctor. And… are there any exercises I should avoid in the meantime? I don’t want to make things worse before I get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. We'll keep it simple. The blood tests are essentially looking for clues. We’re going to check your vitamin levels – things like Vitamin D and B12 – because deficiencies can sometimes cause muscle weakness. We’ll also check your electrolytes – things like potassium and sodium – because imbalances can affect your nerves and muscles. We’ll also run a basic inflammatory marker test – that looks for signs of inflammation in your body. As for exercises, it's best to avoid anything strenuous that significantly increases your weakness or causes pain. So, heavy lifting, intense workouts, anything that feels like it’s pushing you too hard. Light activity is okay – walking, gentle stretching – but listen to your body. If something feels wrong, stop. And avoid any movements that specifically aggravate your right side. I’m going to write down a list of instructions for you. We’ll also discuss a follow-up appointment once we have the blood work results, to go over everything in more detail and discuss the MRI findings. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds… manageable. No heavy lifting, got it. I can do that. Follow-up appointment… when should I expect to hear about the blood work? And… how long does an MRI take? I need to tell my boss something. I’m really just hoping this isn’t anything serious, Doctor. I need to work.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Edric. We’re all hoping it’s nothing serious. The blood work results usually come back within 3-5 business days. My nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. An MRI typically takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on the area being scanned. You’ll lie still on a table inside a large magnet, and it’s fairly noisy, so you’ll be given headphones. You can’t have any metal objects on you during the scan – things like jewelry, watches, or even some types of clothing. The imaging center will give you detailed instructions before the scan. I’m going to write down the number for the imaging center and a list of things to avoid before the scan. I'll also give you a summary of our conversation and the instructions for the blood work. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re taking all the necessary steps to figure out what’s going on, and we’ll work together to find a solution. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything for now. It's a lot to take in, but… thank you, Doctor. For explaining things, and for not dismissing me. And for the list of centers and the instructions. It really helps. I guess… I’ll just wait for the call. And try not to lift anything. Right. Well, thanks again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Edric. That’s what I’m here for. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and try to rest. .
