DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It's lovely to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… how to be more present, you know? I’ve heard good things about mindfulness and meditation, and I was hoping to learn a little more about it, and maybe if it’s something that could help me. It feels a little silly, I work with signals and tracks all day – very practical work – but I feel like I need something to balance things out.
DOCTOR: Not at all silly, Ms. Sugino. In fact, seeking balance and mental well-being is a very proactive and sensible approach to healthcare. It's wonderful that you're recognizing this need for yourself. While mindfulness and meditation aren't typically within the realm of medical treatment as such, I’m happy to discuss your concerns and offer some guidance. To help me understand what you're experiencing, could you elaborate a little on what you mean by “more present”?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s hard to explain exactly. I find my mind wanders a lot. Even when I’m focusing on my work – checking the switches, making sure everything is aligned – I’m often thinking about things that have already happened, or worrying about things that might happen. It’s like… I'm not fully in the moment, if that makes sense? And then I realize I haven’t even noticed the details, you know? The way the light falls on the tracks, or the sounds around me. It’s a bit frustrating, really. Like I’m missing out on things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. What you're describing – a wandering mind, difficulty focusing on the present, and a sense of being disconnected – are common experiences. It sounds like you're quite perceptive and aware of this pattern within yourself, which is a good first step. To get a better understanding, and to rule out any underlying factors that might be contributing to this, may I ask a few questions about your overall health and well-being?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely, please do. Ask away. I don’t mind at all. I'm usually quite healthy, I think. I enjoy my work, even though it can be stressful at times. I try to eat well, though I’m not perfect with that, and I walk a fair bit as part of the job. I don't have any major health concerns, if that's what you mean. Medicare covers my regular checkups, so I see the doctor when I need to.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Ms. Sugino. It’s helpful to know you’re generally in good health and active. Just to be thorough, I’d like to ask a few more specific questions. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns lately – difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested when you wake up?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Actually, yes, a little. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, usually. But I wake up quite a bit during the night. Not every night, but maybe two or three times a week. It’s usually just little things – a noise, or just my mind starting to race again. Then I find it hard to get back to sleep. I don’t feel exhausted when I wake up, but I don’t feel fully refreshed either, if that makes sense. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not as good as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sugino. Interrupted sleep can certainly contribute to feelings of being less present and can affect cognitive function. And you're right, even if you aren’t feeling exhausted, it doesn’t necessarily mean it's not impacting your well-being. Now, let's briefly touch on your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. And I broke my arm once when I was a teenager – very clumsy! But nothing serious, no chronic conditions or anything that requires ongoing treatment. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything other than that broken arm. I try to stay on top of things with regular checkups and vaccinations, as recommended by my doctor. Everything's always been pretty straightforward, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Sugino. A clean medical history is very reassuring. And that's good you are up to date with preventative care. Now, do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I really try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I'm not a fan of pills, if I'm honest. If I get a headache, I'll usually just drink some water and rest. Or maybe a cup of tea. I haven’t taken any regular medication in… well, I can't even remember when. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, that's it.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My doctor has asked me that question many times over the years, and I always say no. I eat a pretty varied diet, and I haven’t noticed anything that causes me problems. I don't have any skin allergies or anything like that either. I feel pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Sugino. It seems you’re generally in very good health, which is excellent. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me see. My mother lived to be 85, and she was quite healthy for most of her life. She did have some arthritis in her later years, but nothing too serious. My father passed away when I was younger, he had heart problems. And my brother is healthy, as far as I know, though we don’t see each other very often. There’s no history of any major mental health conditions on either side of the family, if that’s what you’re wondering. Mostly just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sugino. That’s helpful information. So, no significant history of mental health concerns or anything that would immediately raise a red flag. Now, I understand you are experiencing difficulty staying present and a wandering mind. While this doesn’t necessarily indicate an underlying medical issue, given your reported sleep disturbances, it would be prudent to conduct a brief physical examination to rule out any contributing factors. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds sensible to me. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I don’t mind a quick check-up at all. It's good to be thorough, and I'd feel better knowing we've ruled everything out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'd be so kind as to step onto the examination table, we’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and do a basic neurological assessment. It's a standard procedure and shouldn’t take long. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly. No problem at all. I haven’t had my blood pressure checked in a while, I think it was at my last annual checkup. I usually feel fine, a little tired sometimes, but that's just part of life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Ms. Sugino. Everyone feels a little tired from time to time. Your blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual noises detected. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes – don’t move your head, just your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see it perfectly fine. It’s easy enough. I used to get headaches when I was younger, but they've stopped now. I had my eyes checked a few years ago, everything was normal then. I wear reading glasses now, obviously, but I don't need them for distance. I try to get enough sleep when I can, but it's not always easy.
DOCTOR: Good. Your strength seems normal. Now, just a quick neurological check. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date is August 2nd, 2025. Yes, definitely August 2nd, 2025. I try to keep track of the days. It helps me stay organized. I've always been quite good with dates and remembering details, surprisingly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Sugino. And finally, just a quick assessment of your reflexes. And the other knee… Your reflexes are normal as well. Alright, Ms. Sugino. The physical examination was unremarkable. Your vital signs are within acceptable limits, and your neurological assessment is normal. There are no immediate physical causes for your reported difficulty with focus or sleep disturbances.
PATIENT: That's very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I was a little worried there might be something physically wrong. So, what does that mean then? Is it just… stress, or something like that? Is there anything I can do about it? What about the mindfulness or meditation you mentioned earlier?
DOCTOR: It's good that we've ruled out any physical causes, Ms. Sugino. Based on your report and the examination findings, it’s likely your symptoms are related to stress, anxiety, or simply the cumulative effects of a busy lifestyle. It doesn’t mean they are not important, or that you should just “tough it out”. Mindfulness and meditation are excellent starting points. They’ve been shown to be very effective in reducing stress, improving focus, and promoting better sleep. There are many different techniques, from guided meditations to simply focusing on your breath for a few minutes each day. However, given your reported sleep disturbances and if your symptoms persist or worsen, I would recommend consulting with a therapist or counselor. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your stress and develop coping mechanisms. They could also explore whether cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia would be a beneficial approach for your sleep issues. Would you be interested in me providing you with some resources on mindfulness and meditation techniques?
PATIENT: Yes, please, that would be wonderful! Resources on mindfulness and meditation would be a great place to start. I think I'd like to try those on my own for a bit before considering therapy, if that's alright. I’m just a little hesitant about talking to someone about it, if I’m honest. But I appreciate you suggesting that as an option. Maybe if it doesn't help, I’ll think about it then. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel much better knowing there isn’t anything physically wrong, and I have a direction to go in now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It's perfectly understandable to feel hesitant about therapy, and it's good you're starting with what feels most comfortable. I commend you for taking proactive steps towards improving your well-being. Here, I’ve printed out a list of reputable websites and apps that offer guided meditations and mindfulness exercises. I’ve also included a brochure on sleep hygiene – simple things you can do to improve your sleep quality. I also want to emphasize that if your symptoms worsen or interfere with your daily life, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are here to support you. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfect, thank you so much! This is exactly what I needed. No, I think that’s everything for now. I really appreciate your time and your help, Doctor Bakan. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’m going to give these mindfulness exercises a try and see how it goes. And if I need anything, I know where to come. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember to be kind to yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. I wish you all the best on your journey towards greater well-being. Have a wonderful day.
