DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I’m here. My daughter insisted. Something about not…seeing or hearing properly? It’s all rather inconvenient, and I have a very busy schedule, you know. I’m a surgeon, after all. Not a patient.
DOCTOR: Well, that certainly explains the busy schedule! It's good of your daughter to be so attentive, and it's not uncommon for us to catch things that even busy surgeons might miss. So, let's try to piece this together. When did you first start noticing these changes – the difficulty seeing or hearing?
PATIENT: Honestly, I couldn’t possibly say. Perhaps a week? Two? It’s all a blur, truthfully. I have so much on my mind. Everything just seems…dimmer. And people mumble, I suppose. Though they should speak clearly! It's not my fault if they don't articulate. Is this going to take long? I have appointments all afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Julie. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. “Dimmer” and people “mumbling” are good starting points. To help me understand better, could you tell me more about the “dimmer” feeling?
PATIENT: Ugh. It’s…like looking through a dirty window, perhaps? Or a fog. Everything lacks…definition. Colors aren't as vibrant, I suppose. Though I hardly have time to admire the color of things these days. It's just…less clear. Is that helpful? Really, I don't see why this is necessary. I can still see, can't I? And I'm sure my hearing is fine. People just need to project!
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Julie. It sounds like you're experiencing some changes in your vision – a loss of clarity and color perception. And it’s good you can still see, but we want to understand why these changes are happening, and if they’re likely to progress. Before we get to a physical exam, let’s go through a quick medical history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medical problems? Goodness, no. I take excellent care of myself. I eat well – when I have time, of course – and I exercise…occasionally. I've never really needed to see a doctor much. Just the usual check-ups, I suppose. I had my tonsils out as a child. And a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s hardly significant. My daughter worries over nothing. Is this all there is to it? Just…questions?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Any surgeries besides the tonsils?
PATIENT: Oh, um…let me think. Yes! A rather minor procedure on my knee, decades ago. A meniscus tear, I believe? From tennis. I haven't played in years, though. Honestly, the details are rather hazy. I've had so many cases, so many surgeries to perform…it all blurs together. It was a long time ago, and quite uneventful. Can we get on with this? I’m starting to feel quite…impatient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. Just a few more questions, and then we can move on to the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Absolutely not. I have a very strong constitution. Though…now that you mention it, my skin does get a little irritated sometimes when I use certain hand soaps. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just…sensitivity. A minor inconvenience. I’m quite particular about hygiene, you see. I can't possibly be allergic to anything significant. It would be…unprofessional.
DOCTOR: Alright, and are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I despise taking pills! Absolutely nothing. Perhaps a multivitamin occasionally, if I remember, but that's about it. I prefer to get my nutrients from whole foods, when I have time to properly prepare them. I can't stand the thought of putting unnecessary chemicals into my body. It's just…unhealthy. Really, I'm a very healthy person. This whole thing is…rather baffling. Can we please move on to the examination now? I'm quite busy, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. Let's do that. I understand your time is valuable. We'll proceed with a quick physical exam, focusing on your vision and hearing. I'll also check your general health. Please have a seat, and we'll start with your eyes. I’ll need you to look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Finally. Alright, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie, just focus on this penlight as I move it around. And then I’ll show you some letters on this chart. Can you read the smallest line you can see?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, these charts are terribly small. And the lighting is…suboptimal. I’m used to operating with far superior illumination. I can…make out some of the letters, but they’re rather blurry. Is that what you wanted to know? It’s all very…imprecise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Let's try this one. These letters are a little larger. Just read the letters from left to right. Don't worry if you can't see them all perfectly. And I apologize for the suboptimal lighting; I'll make a note to have it checked. Can you read this first line for me?
PATIENT: Fine. …E…H…V…P…F… That’s…rather straightforward. Though, honestly, Doctor, I expected a more thorough examination. Is that all you're going to do? I’ve seen interns perform more comprehensive tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Your vision is somewhat reduced, which explains the difficulty you were having. Now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision. I just need you to focus straight ahead and tell me when you see my finger moving in your side vision. Just tell me when you see this finger moving. It will be on your left side first.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather tedious. I have far more important things to be doing. …I think…yes. I see it. Just barely. It's…a very faint flicker. Are we almost finished? My schedule is quite packed, you know. I have a surgery scheduled for this afternoon. A rather delicate procedure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Now I’m going to take a quick look in your ears. It just helps me rule out any potential causes for your hearing difficulties. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh, that's…unpleasant. A bit cold, and rather intrusive. I sincerely hope this is nearing completion. No pain, exactly, but it’s certainly not…comfortable. Is something wrong? You're staring intently. I trust everything is alright? I’ve never had any trouble with my ears before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Everything looks generally normal in your ears. There's a bit of wax buildup, which could be contributing to your hearing difficulties. No signs of infection or anything concerning. Now, just to complete the basic assessment, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the necessity of this entire charade. I’m a perfectly healthy woman. My heart and lungs are perfectly fine, I assure you. I maintain a rigorous exercise regimen, when I have the time. Are we absolutely finished now? This is taking far too long. I have a surgery to prepare for, you know. A very delicate procedure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Everything sounds normal in your heart and lungs as well. Based on the brief examination, it appears you’re in generally good health. However, your reduced visual acuity and slightly diminished hearing, combined with the wax buildup in your ears, could be contributing to the difficulties you’re experiencing. It’s likely the wax buildup is a significant factor in your hearing. And the reduced visual acuity warrants further investigation. I recommend a comprehensive hearing test and a referral to an ophthalmologist for a thorough eye exam. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist? And a hearing test? Honestly, Doctor, I find that rather…alarmist. I simply have a busy schedule, and people mumble! I don't require extensive testing. And as for the wax, surely a simple cleaning would suffice? I do not appreciate being subjected to unnecessary procedures. I suppose I can consider a cleaning, but I absolutely refuse to be referred to any specialists. Is that understood? I have a very demanding profession, and I simply do not have time for…frivolous appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Julie. It's important to me that you feel comfortable with the plan. While a simple cleaning may provide some relief, it's best to rule out any underlying causes for your hearing difficulties. It's a precaution. However, I respect your wishes. We can proceed with the wax removal first. I'll write you a referral for that, and if you don’t see improvement, or if your symptoms worsen, please consider revisiting the idea of a full hearing test. As for your vision, I strongly recommend seeing an ophthalmologist, but I will honor your decision to decline that at this time. However, I would like to emphasize that early detection is crucial for many vision problems. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. A wax removal, and nothing else. No tests, no specialists, no unnecessary poking and prodding. Just the cleaning. And make sure it’s done quickly. I have a very busy schedule, you know. A delicate surgery awaits. And please, ensure whoever performs this cleaning is exceptionally gentle. I do not tolerate roughness. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a great deal to prepare for. Do I simply need to sign something? And can we be finished now?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I’ll write you a referral for a local audiologist who specializes in gentle wax removal. They’ll schedule an appointment at your convenience. And yes, there's a consent form for the procedure that you'll need to sign. Here you are. Just read through it, sign at the bottom, and I’ll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you. And just to recap, we discussed a possible referral to an ophthalmologist, but you've declined at this time. However, if your vision changes or worsens, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment with one. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No, I believe that’s quite enough questioning for one day. There. Now, if you’ll excuse me…I have a very delicate surgery to prepare for. I trust your assistant will handle the scheduling efficiently? I do not have time to waste on unnecessary phone calls.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. My assistant is very efficient; she'll take excellent care of the scheduling. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And I wish you all the best with your surgery. .
