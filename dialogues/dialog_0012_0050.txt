DOCTOR: Hi Brodie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, it’s this cough. Been… a while now. A dry cough. Just… keeps happening. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. Just feels old, you know?
DOCTOR: I do know. It's easy for things to blur together after a while. Okay, a dry cough that's been going on for a while. That gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… let me think. It doesn’t… hurt, not really. Just… irritating. Especially at night. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. I try to drink tea, warm tea, but it doesn’t always help. Does that make sense? I… sometimes feel a little… winded after coughing a lot. But mostly just… a dry tickle, and then cough.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds quite bothersome, especially if it's disrupting your sleep. And feeling winded after a coughing fit is definitely something we need to consider. You mentioned it's worse at night – does anything trigger the cough during the day?
PATIENT: Trigger… hmm. Not that I notice. Maybe… dust? I used to work with cars, you know. Body work. Lots of dust and… fumes. But that was a long time ago. I don’t really… spend much time around that stuff anymore. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m sitting, sometimes when I’m walking… it’s pretty random, I think. I don’t really pay attention to what I’m doing when it starts. Old man things, I guess.
DOCTOR: Not necessarily "old man things," Brodie, but I appreciate you sharing that history. Working with cars and being exposed to dust and fumes is definitely helpful to know. It could be playing a role even now. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Not much, really. I get a little tired, but… I’m ninety years old! That’s to be expected, right? Maybe… a little short of breath sometimes, but I always figured that was just… age. I haven't been running marathons lately, if that's what you mean. And… no fever, no chills, no… anything else I can think of. My appetite's okay. I still enjoy my food. Do you need me to think harder? It’s… hard to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. You’re doing great. It’s good to know you’re still enjoying your appetite, and that you haven’t had any fever or chills. Feeling tired is certainly common at any age, but we’ll consider that alongside everything else. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… oh dear. That's a long time ago. Let me think... I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure, once. But I don’t remember taking anything for it for very long. The doctor… he’s not here anymore. And… I don't really go to the doctor much. I try to take care of myself. Mostly just… rest and eat good food. Is that important? I’m probably forgetting something. My wife… she used to remember all that stuff. It's… hard without her.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright. You’re doing the best you can, and it’s very common to forget details over time, especially after a loss. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the past history of high blood pressure is helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes, but that could be anything, right? Dust, pollen… I live in the country, so there's plenty of everything. My wife always said I was a tough old bird. Didn't bother me much, anything. I don't really take any pills, so I haven't had much experience with allergies to medications. Does that answer your question? I’m trying to be helpful, I just… don't know what you need to know.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Brodie, truly. And yes, that answers my question perfectly. No known allergies is good to know. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh. No, Doctor. I don't take anything. Not a single pill. I used to, a long time ago, for my blood pressure, but like I said, it didn't last long. I don't really like taking pills. Makes me feel… strange. I prefer to just… deal with things on my own. My wife… she was the one who kept track of all that stuff. I just… try to stay active and eat well. That's what she would have wanted. I’m sorry, I'm probably not much help with all of this.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Brodie. It's good to know you aren’t currently taking any medications. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'd like to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and take your blood pressure. It will just take a few minutes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Sounds… fine, I guess. I don’t mind. Haven’t had one of those in a while. Just… try to be gentle, okay? Old bones, you know. And… I don’t like cold things on my back. My wife always warmed the stethoscope up before… never mind. Just… be careful. And… what are you looking for, exactly? I like to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. And I'll make sure the stethoscope is warmed up – your wife sounds like a very thoughtful person. I'm looking to see how well your lungs are working and to listen for any unusual sounds, like wheezing or crackling. I’ll also check your heart rate and blood pressure to get a baseline. It’s just a routine check to help us figure out what might be causing your cough. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… in… and out… okay. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. Your heart sounds… a little bit fast, actually. Rate is around 95. And your blood pressure is 140 over 85. Which is a little elevated. I do hear some… wheezing in your lungs, especially on the right side. Not terribly loud, but it's present. It sounds like there is some mild airway narrowing. And I also notice you are breathing a little faster than normal. Are you feeling any chest pain or tightness at all?
PATIENT: Wheezing… that doesn’t sound good, does it? I don’t… feel any chest pain, no. Just… a little tired, like I said. And… maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but that’s just from getting old, I figured. A little tightness… maybe? It’s hard to say. I don’t really pay attention to those things. I just… try to ignore it. Is the wheezing bad? Is that what’s causing the cough? My wife… she always knew what was wrong with me. She could tell just by looking at me. I miss her a lot. I’m probably just rambling now, aren't I? I just… get anxious when I go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Brodie. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, and it’s okay to share how you’re feeling. And it's perfectly understandable that you miss your wife – she sounds like a wonderful person. The wheezing could be contributing to your cough, yes. It suggests there’s some inflammation or narrowing in your airways, which can make it harder to breathe and trigger coughing. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything terribly serious, but it does need to be investigated further. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. That will help us see if there's any sign of infection, fluid build-up, or other problems in your lungs. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… oh dear. I haven’t had one of those in a long time. Is it… safe? I’ve heard things about… radiation. And… it’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. Is there another way to find out what’s wrong? Maybe just… give me some medicine for the cough? I just want to be able to sleep at night. My wife always said I snored too loud when I was coughing. It's silly, I know. But… is it really necessary, Doctor? It feels like a lot for just a cough.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Brodie. You’re right to ask about the radiation. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very small – it’s comparable to what you’re exposed to naturally from the environment over a few days. The benefits of finding out what’s causing your cough outweigh the risks in this case. And I understand your reluctance about being poked and prodded – we’ll do our best to make it as comfortable as possible. The X-ray is quick and doesn't usually cause any discomfort. We could try some cough medicine to help manage your symptoms, but without knowing the underlying cause, we’re just treating the symptom, not the problem. It’s important to rule out any serious conditions, like pneumonia or bronchitis, especially given the wheezing I heard. Would you be comfortable if we proceeded with the X-ray?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I don’t like it, but… I guess. If you think it’s important. I just… I don’t want any surprises. And… I’m tired of coughing. If it will help me sleep… okay. But please be gentle. And… let me know what you find out, right away. I don’t like waiting. And… is it going to cost a lot of money? I’m on a fixed income, you know. My wife always took care of the bills. I’m sorry, I’m probably being a nuisance. It’s just… I don’t like doctors.
DOCTOR: You’re not being a nuisance at all, Brodie. It’s perfectly okay to feel anxious and to ask questions – that’s what I’m here for. And yes, I will let you know the results as soon as I have them. The cost of the X-ray is… around $200, but we have a financial assistance program available if you qualify. We can discuss that with the billing department after the exam. Okay, let’s get you over to the X-ray room. It will just take a few minutes. And I promise we'll be as gentle as possible.
