DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, it's my pee. It’s… orange. It started a couple days ago. Not all the time, but… yeah. Orange. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Orange, you say. Hmm. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel okay. Maybe a little tired, but I work long hours. Nothing different to eat or drink, I don't think. I drink lots of water, always have. It just… showed up. It’s weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, orange urine can be caused by a number of things. Dehydration is one, but you say you drink a lot of water… Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No pain. No burning. Nothing like that. Just… the color. It’s like… a really light orange. Not dark, but… you know. Not normal. Is it… bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Well, "bad" is a strong word. It’s unusual, which is why we’re talking about it. It could be something simple, or it could indicate something else. We'll need to rule things out. Do you have any history of liver problems, or any issues with your gallbladder?
PATIENT: Liver problems? No. Not that I know of. My family… we don’t really talk about that stuff much. I’ve never had any tests for it, or anything. Gallbladder… I don’t even know what that is, to be honest. Sorry. I'm not good with… body parts.
DOCTOR: Alright. No need to apologize. It’s not everyone’s expertise. Let's move on. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. No blood. Everything… normal there. Look, I work with machines all day. I fix things. I don’t spend much time looking at… that stuff. This pee thing is really the only thing. It’s just… worrying. It feels like something is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. We'll figure it out. Now, tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: I don't take any regular medicine. Nothing. Just… sometimes ibuprofen for my back, when it’s bad from work. And no allergies. Never had one. My wife, she’s got some, but not me. She gets itchy with cats. That's it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen occasionally. Okay. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll need a urine sample. Do you think you can provide that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I can. No problem. A urine sample… Okay. Where do I… do that? Is there a… a room? A special cup? I'm okay with that. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, there's a restroom just down the hall. There's a sterile cup in there. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect about two ounces in the cup, then finish. I'll let you have a few minutes of privacy. I’ll be right here when you’re done.
PATIENT: Okay. Mid-stream… got it. Start, then… a little bit, then collect. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll see what that sample shows.
PATIENT: Here you go. Sorry if it took a minute. It’s… not a lot, but it’s what I could manage.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your urine is showing elevated urobilinogen, and there are trace amounts of bilirubin present. Your specific gravity is also a bit high, which suggests some level of dehydration despite your water intake. The good news is, there’s no blood or protein. No sign of infection either. This could indicate a mild issue with your liver, or possibly your gallbladder. It’s not alarming, but we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work. It will check your liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and other important markers. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work? Okay. Liver… gallbladder… I'm starting to get worried now. Is it… serious? What kind of blood work? How much blood? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Mr. Secondi, please try to remain calm. It’s not necessarily serious. These tests are simply to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’re ruling things out. The blood work is a standard panel – it will require a few vials, approximately two or three. I understand you don't like needles, but it's a quick process. It will give us valuable information. I’ll order the lab tests now. You'll need to go to the lab down the street – here's a requisition form. They’ll draw the blood. Once the results are in, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A few vials… Okay. Two or three. That’s… not good. Is there anything I can do now? Before the blood work? Should I stop drinking water? Or… eat something different? Or… anything? I just want to… make it better.
DOCTOR: No, do not stop drinking water. Dehydration will only complicate things. And there’s no specific diet change you need to make at this point. Honestly, I wish more patients understood that overreacting doesn't help. Just continue with your normal routine, and try not to worry excessively. The tests will give us the answers we need. Here. Go to the lab, get the blood work done, and then we'll go from there. It's the most productive thing you can do right now. Do you understand the directions to the lab?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. It’s… down Main Street, next to the bakery, right? I’ve seen it. Okay. Bakery. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go… get it done. And then… call for an appointment?
DOCTOR: Yes. The lab will send the results directly to my office. Once they arrive, my secretary will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you… for explaining everything. And… for not yelling at me for worrying. Okay. I’ll… see you later, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please don't hesitate to call if you experience any sudden changes in your condition. .
