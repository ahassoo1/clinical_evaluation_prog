DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s…difficult to explain. I just feel…low. Very low. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I don't usually bother doctors, you know. I've always been a strong woman, independent. But this has been going on too long.
DOCTOR: “Low,” alright. Can you elaborate on that a little for me?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm. It’s…a lack of enjoyment, I suppose. Things I used to love – gardening, seeing my grandchildren, even a good film – they just don’t…spark joy anymore. And I tire so easily. Even getting out of bed is a struggle some days. I find myself sleeping more, and then feeling guilty about wasting the day. It's a vicious cycle, really. Is that…making sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. Loss of interest, fatigue…sleeping more. And you said it's been going on for a while now?
PATIENT: Yes, quite a while. Perhaps… six months, maybe longer? It crept up on me, you see. At first, I thought it was just the change of seasons, the colder weather. But it hasn’t lifted with the summer. And truthfully, Doctor, I’ve been rather… withdrawn from my friends. Don't want to burden them with my…melancholy. They have their own lives, you know.
DOCTOR: Six months… withdrawing socially… I see. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite has been…unreliable, let’s say. Some days I can’t eat at all, others I find myself snacking constantly, but not on anything nutritious, just…biscuits, things like that. And I believe I have gained a little weight, yes. Though, truthfully, I haven't stepped on the scales properly in months. It's… depressing to look, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any trouble with your sleep aside from sleeping more?
PATIENT: Trouble? Hmm. Not exactly trouble… more like… restless nights. I wake up frequently, even if I haven't fully slept. And when I do wake, I just lie there, thinking. Overthinking, really. Worrying about things, replaying old memories. It’s… draining. I try to read sometimes, but it's difficult to concentrate. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like my mind won't quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or… thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's… a difficult question. I wouldn't say I want to not be here. But…sometimes, I think it would be easier if everything just…stopped. Not actively, mind you. But the thought does cross my mind, particularly on bad days. I find myself… less motivated to take care of myself, you know? What's the point, if it all feels so…empty? I don't want to sound… dramatic. I'm a practical woman, Doctor. But it's the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been managed with medication for years now. And I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. Other than that… nothing significant. A few aches and pains, what you'd expect for my age. And I’m allergic to penicillin, a rather common allergy, I believe. I’ve never been a sickly woman, Doctor, truly. Though, lately… I feel anything but well.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just the Lisinopril for the blood pressure, as I said. Twenty milligrams daily. And sometimes, I take a little ibuprofen for the knee, when it’s acting up. But not regularly, just as needed. Really, I don’t like taking pills, Doctor. I always preferred to tough things out myself. It’s just…this isn’t something I can tough out, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – experienced anything similar to what you're going through, such as depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she was always a worrier, a very anxious woman. Never diagnosed with anything, but she certainly had her share of troubles. And my sister, bless her soul, she suffered with nerves for years. She used to call it “the vapors.” I suppose she never truly recovered. My brother was always the strong one, though. Never bothered with such things. A practical man, like myself. It’s funny, isn’t it? How these things run in families.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not really. A small glass of sherry with Christmas dinner, perhaps. But that's it. Never been much of a drinker. It doesn’t agree with me, you see. Always makes me feel sluggish. And I certainly don’t smoke. Never have, never will. A bad habit, in my opinion. I’ve always taken good care of myself, Doctor. That’s why this is so… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Derasmo. I think I have enough information for now. It sounds like you've been dealing with quite a lot. Based on what you've told me, it could be depression. However, there are many things that can cause these symptoms. I'm going to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying medical issues, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. We'll also do a simple urine test. And I think a referral to a specialist might be beneficial. A psychologist could offer some additional support and coping strategies. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood work and a urine test…yes, that sounds sensible. I wouldn’t want anything overlooked. And… a specialist? A psychologist, you say? I… I suppose so. I've never seen a head doctor before. I'm not sure how I feel about talking my troubles to a stranger. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. Honestly, I just want to feel like myself again. When can I expect the blood work results? And… how long will it take to see a specialist? I don’t want to be waiting for months, you see.
DOCTOR: The blood work should be back in a few days. The lab is just down the hall, and they can schedule you right away. As for the psychologist, it might be a week or two to get an appointment. It depends on their availability, unfortunately. I’m going to write you a prescription for a low dose antidepressant in the meantime. It can take a few weeks to start working, but it might help lift your mood. We'll monitor you closely. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and how you're feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A prescription… and another appointment. It’s… a lot to take in. A low dose antidepressant, you say? I… I don't know, Doctor. I’ve always been wary of medication. But if you believe it will help… I suppose I’ll try. Two weeks… alright. A follow-up appointment in two weeks. Will I… will I feel any different? Any side effects? I have to be able to look after my grandchildren, you see. I just want to be me again.
DOCTOR: The antidepressant has minimal side effects for most people, usually just some mild nausea or drowsiness at first. They should subside quickly. And yes, you should still be able to look after your grandchildren. It won't make you incapacitated, Mrs. Derasmo. I wouldn't prescribe something that would prevent you from doing that. I'll give you a pamphlet with more information about the medication. And if you experience any concerning side effects, don’t hesitate to call the office. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… thank you. I appreciate you listening. I suppose I’ll go get the blood work done now. I’m rather anxious, you see. Hopefully, everything will be alright. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will show you where to go. And Mrs. Derasmo?
