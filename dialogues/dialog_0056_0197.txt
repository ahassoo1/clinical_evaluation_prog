DOCTOR: Hi San, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I need to get one of those cards... the one for driving, you know? For the ride-share thing. It's for my job. I drive people around sometimes. It's a requirement now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you need a medical card for a commercial driver’s license, for your rideshare job?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A commercial driver’s license card. That’s right. It’s… it's a bit of a hassle, honestly. But I need to keep working.
DOCTOR: Alright. To make sure I can complete the necessary exam for you, I'll need to gather some information first. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been managed with medication for a while now. And my knees… they aren’t what they used to be, you know? From all the work, logging mostly. But no… no diabetes or heart problems, not that I know of. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, managed blood pressure is good to know. And knee pain from previous work – we’ll definitely check those out today. Do you know what medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s a little white pill… I think it’s Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. I get it refilled at the pharmacy down the street.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Perfect. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to any medicine, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. Must be... twenty years or more now. And I had a small operation on my hand, a logging injury, but that was a long time ago too. Nothing recent.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hand surgery, both in the past. Do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – like heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, my father had heart trouble. He had a stroke when he was quite old. And my mother... she had diabetes, yes. Type 2, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any of your lifestyle habits?
PATIENT: Lifestyle habits… Hmm. Well, I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I used to walk a lot more, but with the knees… it’s harder now. I do try to stay active, though. I do a little gardening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to assess your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I just… I hope it won't take too long, Doctor. I have another appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay, 138 over 82… that's… okay, I guess? Yes, of course. In… and out… is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s check your vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… E… F… P… T… 20/20… no, wait… 20/25… 20/30… Is that right? It's getting a little blurry down there.
DOCTOR: Okay, your vision is 20/30 in both eyes. That’s a little diminished, we may need to consider a referral for a more comprehensive eye exam. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and range of motion. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Oh, those knees… they're a bit stiff today. Is that okay? Is it hurting to move them too much?
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice some decreased range of motion in your knees, and a bit of discomfort with movement. Reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything sounds normal there. Do you have any pain anywhere else, besides your knees?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the knees, like I said. Sometimes a little ache in my lower back, but nothing major. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on the exam and your history, it seems like you have managed hypertension, some decreased vision, and knee pain likely related to previous work. To be certain and to meet the requirements for the commercial driver’s license, I’d like to order a few tests. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. I also recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more thorough eye exam.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Tests and an eye doctor, alright. Will those tests take a long time? And… will this affect my ability to get the card? I really need to keep driving.
DOCTOR: The tests are pretty standard and should be quick – usually just a blood draw and a urine sample. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. As for the card, it depends on the results. We need to make sure your blood pressure is well-controlled and that your vision meets the requirements. If everything checks out, you should be fine. I'll give you the lab order now. Do you have any questions about the tests or the referral?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, 24-48 hours… That's not too bad. And the eye doctor… is there a specific one you recommend? And… will I need to schedule that appointment myself? I'm not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I recommend Dr. Tanaka at the eye clinic down the street. She's very experienced with these types of exams. Here's a referral slip with her contact information. And yes, you will need to schedule the appointment yourself, but the clinic staff is very helpful. I can have my nurse give you a call tomorrow to check if you were able to schedule the appointment, if you'd like. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, Dr. Tanaka… alright, that’s good. Down the street is convenient. Yes, a call tomorrow would be very helpful, thank you. I always forget these things. So, to recap… blood tests, eye doctor, and you’ll call tomorrow. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: That’s right. Blood tests, eye doctor, and I’ll have my nurse check in with you tomorrow. I'm also going to give you a handout with information about safe driving practices. And I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment with me once we have the lab results, to discuss them and the ophthalmologist’s findings. Do you have any questions about the handout or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Safe driving… good. You and your nurse seem very organized, Doctor. Thank you for your help. I really appreciate it. I hope I can still drive. I suppose I should be going. I have that other appointment to get to.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome, San. We’ll do our best to help you get everything sorted out. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Drive safely, and I'll see you soon.
