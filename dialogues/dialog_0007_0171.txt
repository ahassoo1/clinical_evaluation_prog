DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hello. It's my nails, see? They just...look funny. Not good funny. They changed. I don’t really remember when exactly, just…they do. It botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. They've changed in appearance, and that's concerning you. Can you describe how they've changed?
PATIENT: Changed… how? They’re… thicker, I think. And kinda…yellowish. Not bright yellow, like sunshine, more like…old tea. And one of them, the big toe on my…right foot, it’s kinda lifting up. Like it’s not stickin’ to the skin no more. Does that make sense? I don’t know a lot about nails, okay? I just know they don't look right.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lacreasha, don't worry about knowing a lot about nails – that’s what I’m here for! Thicker, yellowish, and lifting… okay. And how long have you noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Ugh, time… that's the hardest part. Months, I guess? Maybe six? Or was it more? I been so busy, you know? Workin’ and… things. It’s definitely not new, but it’s not like it happened overnight either. I really don’t keep track of these things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. Months… okay, that gives us a timeframe. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with the nails, or any changes to the skin around the nails?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little… achy sometimes, but not like a sharp pain. More like…tired. My feet just feel tired, and the nails feel… rough. And the skin… hmm. I guess it's a little flaky around the bad one, the toe. Not like a rash, just… dry. I put lotion on, but it doesn't really help much.
DOCTOR: Alright, flaky skin, tiredness, no sharp pain… good to know. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Doctor keeps tellin' me my sugar is a little high, but I mostly ignore him. It's not that high, okay? And my feet get cold sometimes, but everyone's feet get cold. Circulation… I don’t even know what that means, really. I just work all day, okay? I'm an audiologist. I listen to people’s ears. Not look at my feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little high blood sugar and occasionally cold feet. We'll definitely want to discuss that sugar level. And being an audiologist – that's interesting! Now, let's talk about your daily routine a bit. What kind of shoes do you usually wear for work, and are your feet often damp or exposed to moisture?
PATIENT: Shoes… mostly flats. Comfortable, you know? Gotta be on my feet all day. And… no, not really damp. I live in a hot place, okay? Everything's dry. I wear socks, of course. Not bare feet. That’s just… not good. But I don't change 'em like, every hour or anything. Is that bad? I just wear 'em 'til they smell, okay? Then I wash 'em.
DOCTOR: Okay, flats, socks changed when they smell… alright. Now, have you had any injuries to your feet or toenails in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm. Not really. Maybe I stubbed my toe a few times, but nothing major. Dropped a file on 'em once, but that didn't break anything. I'm careful, okay? I gotta be careful. Can't be limpin' around all day listenin' to people's ears. I need my feet.
DOCTOR: Right, you need your feet for work – I understand. And no major injuries, that's good. Let’s take a look at the nails themselves. Could you please remove your shoes and socks so I can examine your feet?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Here. Be gentle, okay? They're sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. The nails are indeed thicker and have a yellowish hue. The right big toe nail is partially detached, and there’s some scaling around the nail bed. I don’t see any signs of active infection right now, but the scaling is something to keep an eye on. It looks like there might be some minor debris under the detached nail as well. It’s likely you have a fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. It’s common, especially with prolonged moisture and minor trauma, and the changes you’ve described fit the pattern. The scaling could be a sign of mild inflammation. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Fungal? Like… in the dirt? Oh goodness. I don’t want fungus! That sounds awful. Like, growing things… on my feet. Medications… hmm. I think I’m allergic to penicillin, but I don't really remember. Doctor told me a long time ago. I get a rash, okay? But I haven't taken penicillin in years, so I just… hope I remember if I need it. It was a long time ago. Does that make sense? I don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Lacreasha. It’s good you recall the penicillin allergy, even if it was a long time ago. We'll definitely make a note of that. Fungal infections aren’t usually dangerous, but they can be persistent and uncomfortable. It's not "growing things" in a scary way - it's a microscopic organism, okay?
PATIENT: Microscopic? Like, you need a… a thing to see it? Oh. That’s… a little better. Still don't like the sound of it, though. So, what do I do about it? Do I need… shots? Or medicine? I got a busy schedule, okay? Can't be spendin' all day at the doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and wanting to get back to your schedule. Fortunately, there are treatments available. Typically, treatment involves antifungal medication – either topical or oral . Oral medication is usually more effective, but it does require blood tests to monitor your liver function, and it can have some interactions with other medications. Topical treatments are safer but take longer to work and aren't always effective. To determine the best course of action, I’d like to send a small sample of the nail debris to a lab for confirmation. This will tell us exactly what type of fungus we're dealing with. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Liver? Blood tests? Oh goodness. No, no blood tests, okay? I don’t like needles. And my liver is probably fine. I eat okay. Mostly. So, what about the… cream? The topical thing? Does that work? Even if it takes longer? I’d rather deal with it slow than poke holes in me, okay? And… does it smell bad? I gotta listen to people's ears, remember. Can’t smell like fungus cream.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood tests – I respect that decision. We can certainly start with topical treatment. It's a good first step, and avoids the need for bloodwork. The effectiveness of topical treatments varies, and it can take several months – even a year or more – to see significant improvement. It requires consistent application, usually daily. As for the smell… some topical antifungal creams can have a slight odor, but it usually dissipates quickly. We can try a different formulation if the smell is bothersome. There are some newer formulations that are virtually odorless. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes, I still recommend sending a sample to the lab. It's a quick, painless procedure – basically scraping a small piece of the nail. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Scraping? Like… taking off part of my nail? Oh, goodness. Well… if it’s just a little piece… and you promise it won’t hurt… okay. But not a big piece! And if it smells bad, you gotta give me something else, okay? I gotta be professional. Listenin’ to ears, remember. Just get it over with. But be gentle!
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. It’s just a small scraping – barely noticeable, I promise. I'll use a sterile instrument to collect a tiny sample from under the detached portion of the nail. It shouldn’t cause any pain, maybe a slight pressure. Okay, all done. I’ll send this off to the lab, and we should have the results in about a week or so. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a topical antifungal cream called ciclopirox. You'll apply a thin layer to the affected nail once daily, after trimming it as short as possible. Do you have any questions about applying the cream, or anything else we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: Trim it? How short? I don't want to make it bleed, okay? And… once a day? Even if I'm busy? What if I forget? Is it bad if I miss a day? I got a lot on my plate, okay? People need their ears listened to. This whole fungus thing is… a lot. And what if the cream doesn’t work? Will I have to take the blood tests then? Oh goodness. This is stressin’ me out.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. We can figure this out. Trim it as short as comfortably possible – you don’t need to go digging and cause bleeding. Just enough to thin the nail so the cream can penetrate. If it's too painful, stop. Missing a day occasionally won’t ruin everything, but consistency is key for it to be effective. Perhaps you can set a reminder on your phone?
PATIENT: Phone reminder… hmm. Maybe. I’m not good with technology, okay? But I’ll try. What about socks? Do I gotta wear special socks? Or wash 'em extra? I don't wanna spread the fungus, okay? And... are my shoes gonna smell bad too? Oh goodness. This is a whole thing.
