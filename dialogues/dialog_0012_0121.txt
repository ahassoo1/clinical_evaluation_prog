DOCTOR: Hi Andrew, good to see you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Dry eyes, yeah. Been feelin’ like sand in ‘em for a bit now. Don’t feel good. Just wanna get it looked at, if that’s alright. Don't have a lot of time today.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. "Sand in 'em" is a really good way to describe it, a lot of patients say that. And I appreciate you letting me know you’re short on time – we’ll definitely try to be efficient. Just to get a better picture, how long have you been feeling this dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a month? A month or so. Hard to say exactly, things kinda fade in and out, ya know? Been workin' a lot, cement dust ain’t helpin’ none, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I do reckon cement dust isn't helping at all. A month is good to know, roughly. Do you notice it's worse at any particular time of day, or after doing specific things, besides work?
PATIENT: Well, definitely worse when I’m outside. Wind… wind really gets to ‘em. Makes ‘em burn. And when I try to read, too. That little book-lookin' thing… makes ‘em tired. Not sure why.
DOCTOR: Okay, wind makes them burn and reading makes them tired. That’s helpful. When you say tired, is that more like strained or… aching?
PATIENT: Strained, yeah. Like they gotta work to see. Not pain, just... heavy. Gets old fast. And sometimes blurry, after a while. Is that… bad? Don't know much about eyes.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily bad that they feel strained and get blurry – it’s definitely something we want to figure out though. The straining and blurring sounds like they’re working extra hard. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or crusting in your eyes?
PATIENT: Redness...sometimes. Not real bad. Kinda pinkish, I guess. Mostly in the corners. And no… no gooey stuff. Not that I’ve seen. Been tryin' to keep ‘em clean. Just water, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional pinkness in the corners and no discharge – good to know. Just water for cleaning, that's alright. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any eye conditions before?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin’ wrong with ‘em ‘til this. Just… normal, I guess. Used to see good enough. Now... not so much. Don't know what changed.
DOCTOR: Alright, no previous eye conditions. And we’ll figure out what might have changed. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed ‘em. Still see okay… for gettin’ by. But it's a struggle sometimes, ya know? Especially in the bright sun.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you haven't needed glasses or contacts before. And it sounds like the sunlight bothers you. Now, let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, or using any eye drops?
PATIENT: Nope. Not takin’ nothin’ regular. Maybe some pain reliever for my back, sometimes. But that's it. No eye drops, never used ‘em. Doc never told me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, just pain reliever for your back as needed. Good to know. And no eye drops. Now, I’m going to do a quick exam of your eyes, if that's alright with you. It won't take long. I'll check your vision, how your eyes move, and just take a look at the surface of your eyes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Get it over with, if ya don't mind. Don't got all day. Just tell me if it's somethin' serious.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as quick as we can. Alright, if you could sit facing that chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry it up though. Gotta get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Andrew, I’m going to ask you to read the smallest line you can see on this chart. Just read whatever letters you can make out. Don’t strain, just tell me what you see. We'll start with both eyes open. Alright... with your right eye covered, can you read this line for me?
PATIENT: Ugh. Can barely see any of it. Hmm… that first line… E, F… uh… P? Maybe. That’s the best I can do. It’s blurry. Everything’s blurry. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. With both eyes open, you could read about the first line, and with your right eye covered, you got to the first line as well. That suggests some decreased vision, but it’s not drastically reduced. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to look at the back of your eye. It won’t hurt, but it might be a little bright. Just look straight ahead. Alright… I'm seeing some mild dryness in both eyes, a little bit of redness, and the surface of your eyes is a little hazy. No major concerns back there, thankfully. Everything looks structurally okay.
PATIENT: Hazy… redness… Just tell me what it means. Is it somethin' I gotta worry 'bout? I gotta work. Can’t be seein’ nothin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern and that you need to get back to work. The haze and redness are consistent with dry eye disease – also sometimes called dry eye syndrome. It’s very common, especially as we get older, and can be caused by a lot of things – wind, sun exposure, working in dusty environments... It doesn't usually indicate a serious problem, but it can be very uncomfortable and impact your vision. It’s good we caught it. The good news is it’s often manageable with some simple treatments. It doesn’t sound like anything urgent that will prevent you from working, but leaving it untreated can make it worse. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Manageable... that's good. Treatment… what kinda treatment? Eye drops? Gotta go to the pharmacy? And how much's this gonna cost? I ain't insured, ya know. Just tell me what I gotta do to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, understandable. We can definitely work with the fact that you’re uninsured. For treatment, I’m going to recommend a few things. First, I want you to try some over-the-counter artificial tears – Systane Ultra is a good brand. Use them four times a day, even if your eyes don’t feel dry. They help lubricate the eyes. Second, I’d recommend a warm compress on your eyes for 5-10 minutes, once or twice a day. It helps stimulate tear production. A warm, clean washcloth works just fine. Third, and this is really important, try to avoid the wind and dust as much as possible. If you’re working in the cement, wear safety glasses or goggles. The artificial tears are the main expense, and they're relatively inexpensive – usually around $10-$20 for a bottle. The warm compress is free! Let’s try this for two weeks. If your symptoms don't improve, or they get worse, we can discuss other options. Would you be comfortable trying that?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Drops… compress… safety glasses. I can do that. $20, alright. Cheaper than losin' my job. Two weeks… and then I come back here? Gotta get back to work now. This was a waste of time, but... fine. Thank ya.
DOCTOR: Alright, Andrew. That’s great. Here's a little summary of what we discussed – artificial tears four times a day, warm compress, and protect your eyes from the wind and dust. And yes, if you don’t see improvement in two weeks, please schedule another appointment. We can explore other options at that time. I'm glad you came in today, even if it didn’t seem like a huge waste of time. Taking care of your eyes is important. Drive safely, Andrew. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
