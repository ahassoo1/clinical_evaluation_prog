DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, it's this nausea, see. Been happening most mornings now. Not a pleasant way to start the day, I can tell you that much. And, well, I have a bit of a dodgy heart, so I thought I best get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. Nausea in the mornings, and you're understandably concerned given your heart condition. That's a very good idea to get it checked out. Let's start with the nausea. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Right. It's not, like, awful vomiting, mind you. More of a queasy feeling, right in the pit of my stomach. And it usually hits pretty quick after I wake up. Doesn’t last too long, maybe half an hour, but it’s enough to put me off my breakfast, and I need a good breakfast. I usually have porridge, keeps me going. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, queasy feeling, pit of the stomach, soon after waking, lasting about half an hour, and impacting your appetite. Has this been happening every morning for a specific amount of time now?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s been fairly consistent for about three weeks now, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. I thought it might just be something I ate, at first, but it's kept going, even when I’m careful with what I have for supper. It’s not getting worse, thankfully, just… persistent. I remember my mother used to get something similar, but she never went to the doctor about it. A very stubborn woman, she was.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, consistent, not worsening – that's helpful. And you've been mindful of your diet without any change. I understand your mother didn't seek medical attention, but it’s good you’re here now. Now, let's talk about your heart. Can you tell me a little more about what's going on with that?
PATIENT: Right, well, it's… not the strongest, put it that way. I've got a bit of heart failure, the doctor told me a few years back now. I get a bit short of breath if I do too much, and my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day if it’s warm. I'm on some tablets for it, though. Water tablets, mostly, to get rid of the extra fluid. And a little one for the heart itself, but I can't rightly remember the name of it. I take them regular, though, I do. Never miss a dose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heart failure, shortness of breath with exertion, ankle swelling, and you’re taking water tablets and another medication for the heart. It’s good to hear you're diligent with your medications. Do you know when you were first diagnosed with heart failure, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it must be… five years now, maybe six. I had a bit of a scare, ended up in hospital for a few days, and that's when they told me. They did a lot of tests, scans and things, and that's what they found. Dr. MacIntyre was the one who told me. A good man, Dr. MacIntyre, but he retired last year. That's why I'm with you now, I think. It’s a bit strange seeing a new doctor after all this time.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Benic. It can be unsettling changing doctors, especially with a condition like heart failure. Five or six years ago, diagnosed with heart failure – thank you. Do you remember why you ended up in the hospital that time?
PATIENT: Right, I do. I just suddenly felt awful. Really breathless, even just sitting still, and my chest was all tight. And my legs swelled up something fierce, like balloons, they did. My wife – God rest her soul – she called the ambulance. They said it was fluid build-up, putting too much strain on my heart. That's what started the whole thing, all the tests and the diagnosis and everything. It was a frightening time, I can tell you that much.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Benic. That sounds incredibly frightening. Sudden breathlessness, chest tightness, leg swelling – that led to the heart failure diagnosis. And you’ve been on medication ever since. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years for this and that. The doctor always asks, of course, but I always say no. Never had a problem. I remember my sister was allergic to shellfish, nearly died from it, but that’s not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. And you're not currently taking any medications besides the ones for your heart, correct?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Just the tablets for the heart. A little white one, and a little blue one. I take them with my breakfast every morning. I even set an alarm just to make sure I don't forget. Old age, you know. The memory isn’t what it used to be, though I can remember things from fifty years ago perfectly clear!
DOCTOR: Right, little white and little blue tablets with breakfast. That's helpful. Now, Mr. Benic, before I do a quick physical exam, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, right. What do you mean by that? I used to work in the library, mostly cataloguing books. Retired now, of course. Live on my own, as I said, wife passed away a few years back. Don’t have any children, sadly. Used to enjoy a pint down at the pub, but I don’t go much these days. Mostly just keep myself to myself. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benic. I was just asking about things like if you smoke, drink alcohol, or if you’ve ever used recreational drugs. You've already answered those questions, really. Now, would you mind if I listen to your heart and lungs and check your abdomen?
PATIENT: Right, no, not at all. No smoke, hardly ever drink these days, and definitely no recreational drugs. Never touched the stuff. And go ahead with the listening and the poking, as you say. Do your worst!
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just take a deep breath for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth... Alright, Mr. Benic. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and I hear a faint murmur. I also noticed some crackling sounds in your lungs and a little bit of fluid in your abdomen. Your abdomen doesn't seem tender, which is good. These findings could be related to your heart failure, but we’ll need to do some further investigation to be sure. Do you feel any pain anywhere right now?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a bit of discomfort sometimes, right in the middle of my chest, but it doesn't last long. Happens now and then, and it’s not too bad. I usually just sit down and take a few deep breaths, and it goes away. The fluid in my abdomen... is that what makes my ankles swell up? I always thought it was just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional chest discomfort that resolves with rest. The fluid retention can contribute to ankle swelling, yes. That’s likely a significant factor. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to order a few tests. I want to check your blood count, kidney function, and electrolytes. I also want to order a chest X-ray to see how your lungs are looking and an ECG to assess your heart rhythm more closely. And a BNP blood test can help determine how much strain there is on your heart. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Chest X-ray, ECG, and blood tests... a right lot of poking and prodding, but I'll manage. Will I need to make an appointment for these, or can they be done here?
DOCTOR: Great. We can do all of these tests right here in the clinic today. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now, and then we'll get you set up for the ECG and chest X-ray. It shouldn't take too long. While we're waiting for the results, are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now you mention it… I've been feeling a wee bit more tired than usual, lately. Just a bit sluggish, you know? And sometimes, when I lie down flat, I feel a bit breathless, even when I'm not doing anything. I have to prop myself up on a couple of pillows to get comfortable. And… oh, and my appetite hasn’t been great, even aside from this morning sickness.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue, breathlessness when lying flat, and a decreased appetite. Those symptoms, along with the nausea and the findings from my examination, are concerning for worsening heart failure. It's important we investigate this thoroughly. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood and get you set up for those tests now. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan of action. In the meantime, if you experience any significant chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or feel like you're drowning for air, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand. Chest pain, severe shortness of breath... go to the emergency room. Right. It’s a bit worrying, but I trust you, Doctor. Go and get those tests done, then. And thank you for listening to me. It’s good to have someone taking it seriously.
