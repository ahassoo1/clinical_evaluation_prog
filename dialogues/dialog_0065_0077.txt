DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning to you too, Doctor. They tell me I gotta come. Something about the… the place I work. Been there a long time, you know? Never had trouble 'til now. They want me checked, even though I feel alright.
DOCTOR: "They" being your employer, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. The company. Big place, lots of dust. Been loading and moving things down there… underground… for fifty years. More than fifty, I think. They send me, say it's… a check-up. Waste of time if you ask me. Never been sick a day in my life, except for that bad flu in '82. But that was just a flu.
DOCTOR: Alright. While you feel generally well, your employer is likely performing routine occupational health screenings, which is… prudent, given your long-term employment in a dusty environment. Fifty years is a considerable length of time. Let's proceed with a thorough evaluation just to be certain. To start, could you describe your current workload?
PATIENT: Workload? I load the rocks. Big rocks, small rocks. Put them on the… the thing that takes them away. The conveyor. I operate the machine that does it. Been doing the same thing for… well, a long time. Not much different these days than it was ten years ago, twenty years ago. Just… rocks. It's not thinking work, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Not much different, you say. Any changes in how you load the rocks?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… well, the machine… they gave me a new machine 'bout five years ago. Fancy thing. More buttons. Still moves rocks, though. Same dust, maybe a bit more. They say it's more efficient. I don't know nothin' about efficient. Just gotta get the job done.
DOCTOR: More dust, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, more dust. Always dust, but this machine… it kicks up more. Used to be able to see pretty clear, even down there. Now… well, now it's just brown all the time. I wear the mask they give us, but… you know, it's hot. Hard to breathe. I take it off sometimes, just for a minute.
DOCTOR: And how often would you say you remove the mask, even for a minute?
PATIENT: Eh? How often… Not all the time! Just when it gets too hot, you know? When you're sweating, and it sticks to your face… it's uncomfortable. Maybe… maybe a few times a shift. Not a big deal. Used to be able to handle it, but this new machine… it’s something else.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your lungs, and I'll take a look at your throat and check your oxygen saturation. It's important to rule out any respiratory irritation given your description of increased dust exposure and mask usage. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Hmph. All this for nothing. But alright. Lungs, you say? Never had trouble with my lungs. Always been strong. Hope this doesn’t take long. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the table and I will listen to your lungs. It will only take a few moments. Take a deep breath in… and out… slowly.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Just get it over with. This is all foolishness, you know. I’m perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay… and another deep breath… I am hearing some… wheezing in your lower lobes. And your breathing seems a little labored. Mr. Bigger, have you experienced any shortness of breath, or a persistent cough?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Labored? What are you talking about? I breathe just fine! Maybe a little out of shape, that's all. Old age, you know? See? Just a little cough. Happens to everyone. No shortness of breath. Never had that. It's just… this dust. Always been dust. You doctors… always making something out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, with a history of significant dust exposure and now, the finding of wheezing, it is not simply “nothing.” Your lungs are showing signs of irritation. I'm also noting a slight… discoloration of your fingertips. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your hands or nails?
PATIENT: Discoloration? What are you talking about? These are calloused hands, from working! Always been like this. A little dirty, maybe. They look normal to me. You doctors… you look too close. You always find something wrong, even when there's nothing to find. This is just the dust! Fifty years of dust!
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, prolonged exposure to dust can cause several respiratory issues, including chronic bronchitis and even pneumoconiosis—a lung disease caused by inhaled dust. The discoloration I’m observing—a slight bluish tint to your fingertips—could be a sign of reduced oxygen levels, which is something we need to investigate further. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Smoke? Are you accusing me of something now? I don’t need smoke to ruin my lungs! I’ve worked in that mine for fifty years, breathing in dust! That's what’s ruining my lungs, if anything is! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… God rest her soul… she was the smoker. But I never smoked. Don’t insult me with such questions.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I understand. Given your history and these findings, I recommend a chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing. This will help us determine the extent of any lung damage and guide appropriate treatment. We also need to discuss proper respiratory protection – ensuring your mask fits correctly and that you’re minimizing dust exposure as much as possible. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Testing? More foolishness! I tell you, I feel fine! But… my wife… she always said I should listen to the doctors. Alright, alright. Do what you gotta do. But if it’s just dust, I’m not wasting my time. And that mask… they give us those cheap things. Barely fit. But alright. X-ray… testing… just get it over with. Do they give you something for the discomfort?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Bigger, but these tests are essential to ensure your long-term health. The X-ray is painless – you'll simply stand in front of the machine. And the pulmonary function testing involves breathing into a mouthpiece – it takes about ten minutes. As for discomfort, we can provide a mild anesthetic spray for your throat if needed. I'll write an order for these tests, and the receptionist will schedule them for you. They should be done within the next few days. In the meantime, I’m also going to recommend a referral to a pulmonologist—a lung specialist—for a more thorough evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A lung specialist? Another doctor? What are they going to do, look at my lungs with a magnifying glass? This is getting ridiculous! But… my wife always said… always said I should get second opinions. Alright. Fine. A lung specialist. But if they tell me I'm perfectly healthy, I’m not going back. And… what does this all cost? I got private insurance, but… you know. Bills add up.
DOCTOR: A pulmonologist can perform more specialized tests to assess your lung function and provide a definitive diagnosis. As for costs, your insurance should cover a significant portion of the tests and specialist visit – however, I recommend you check with your insurance provider to confirm your coverage and potential out-of-pocket expenses. I’ll provide you with the necessary documentation to submit to your insurance. In the meantime, I’m going to write a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler—this can help open your airways and ease any breathing difficulties you might be experiencing. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never been allergic to anything. Strong man, me. Always been strong. Just… dust. That's the only thing I got trouble with. Dust and these doctors… always poking and prodding. But alright. No allergies. Write whatever you gotta write. Just get this over with. And tell me, this specialist… can I choose who it is? I don’t want some young whippersnapper telling me what’s wrong with my lungs.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bigger, you absolutely have the right to choose your specialist. I can provide you with a list of pulmonologists in the area, along with their credentials and areas of expertise, and you can select the one you feel most comfortable with. Here’s the list of pulmonologists, and here is the order for the chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing. I'll also provide you with a written summary of our conversation and the medications I’ve prescribed. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… I hope this isn’t a waste of time. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I’ll… I’ll see what the specialist says. And tell that receptionist to be gentle with the bill.
