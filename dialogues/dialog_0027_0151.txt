DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this tingling, you see? In my hands and feet mostly. It’s been going on for…oh, a little while now, I guess. Not terrible, but annoying. I just want to figure out what it is, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A little while now…can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific…let me think. Probably…three, maybe four months? It comes and goes. Some days I don’t even notice it, and other days…well, like this morning, it was pretty noticeable when I was getting ready. It's not painful, exactly. Just…pins and needles, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep. But it doesn't go away completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, comes and goes, more like a tingling sensation...not painful, but like pins and needles. And it’s in your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though, I think it’s a little worse in my feet. I do a lot of walking for my job, you see. Mail carrier. Lots and lots of walking. Could be that? I don’t know. I’m not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s what I’m here for! Lots of walking could certainly play a role. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Do you notice anything that makes it worse, besides walking?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think… Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes maybe when I’m really cold, it feels a little more…intense? But that’s about it. And nothing makes it better, really. Just…time, I guess. It fades on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold weather seems to make it a bit worse, and it improves with time on its own. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… No, not really. I can still do everything I need to. Carry the mail, cook, clean… everything. I haven't dropped anything or anything like that. I do get tired at the end of the day, but that's just from the walking, right? Being an old lady, I get tired easier.
DOCTOR: It's good that you haven’t noticed any weakness. And yes, being tired at the end of the day is perfectly understandable with your job. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Ask away. Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was…oh, probably in my 40s. And I had a bad knee for a while, but it’s mostly okay now. Nothing else… I haven’t really been sick much, thankfully. No diabetes or anything like that, if that’s what you’re wondering.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in your 40s, and knee problems. And no diabetes, that’s good to know. Any surgeries besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. And…oh, I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Not really relevant, I don't think? I just want to figure out what's going on with my hands and feet, if you don't mind. I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll focus on your hands and feet. Hysterectomy is good information to have, thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Just…pain relievers sometimes, for a headache. Never had a reaction or anything. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Don't take many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: That's right, nothing at all. Not a single pill. Unless you count the occasional vitamin C when I feel a cold coming on, but that's it! Really. Nothing regular. I'm trying to keep it natural, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, Teretha, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to get back to work tomorrow, you see. But yes, go ahead. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick as possible. First, let’s start with your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I'm going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Okay, those are…normal. Now, let's check your feet. Normal as well. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright? I don’t want to squeeze too hard.
DOCTOR: Perfect, that’s good. Good strength there. Now, can you lift your toes and your heels, one at a time?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? It feels a little…stiff, but I can do it. Is that okay? It’s a little harder than it used to be, I guess. Being an old lady, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little stiffness, but you're able to do it. And now, I'm going to check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this cotton ball. Just tell me when you feel it. Can you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. There… and there… and yes, I feel it there too. It feels… normal, I think? Is everything okay? It doesn't feel numb, exactly. Just…normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is intact. Everything seems normal so far. It’s subtle, but there is some slight decreased strength in your feet. Given your symptoms and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy, likely due to prolonged walking and possible mild nerve compression. It's not an emergency, but we should investigate further to rule out other causes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Peripheral…what now? Nerves? Compression? Prolonged walking… you mean, from my job? Is it…serious? Will I have to stop working? I don't know anything about nerves. Is it something I can fix?
DOCTOR: It sounds complicated, I know. Peripheral neuropathy just means that the nerves in your hands and feet are a little irritated or damaged. In your case, it's likely from the repetitive motion and pressure of walking for so long. It’s not an emergency, and you shouldn't have to stop working, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. We’ll start with a simple blood test to check for things like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and other causes. Then, we can talk about ways to manage the symptoms, like wearing supportive shoes, stretching exercises, and possibly some over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… blood test… yes, that sounds…reasonable. Supportive shoes… I already wear good shoes, I think. Mail carriers have to. But stretching… I haven’t really done much stretching. What if it is something else? Something serious? And what if I can’t work? I need my job, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. It’s good you wear good shoes; that's a great start. The blood test will help us rule out other causes, like diabetes, which can cause similar symptoms. It’s unlikely to be something serious, but it's important to be thorough. And even if it is neuropathy, it’s usually manageable with conservative treatment – stretching, supportive footwear, and possibly some over-the-counter medication if needed. We’ll also discuss ways to modify your activities if needed. I will order the blood test now. The lab is just down the hall. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. A treatment plan… that sounds good. Blood test, then a follow-up. Just down the hall, you say? Will I need to fast before the test? And…how long will it take to get the results? I have to arrange my schedule for work, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 8 hours before the blood test – no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. And the results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have the lab technician give you a requisition form and detailed instructions. They can also answer any questions you have about the fasting requirements. I’ll also have my nurse give you a handout with some simple stretching exercises you can start doing at home. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…perfect. 8 hours fasting, stretching exercises… I can do that. Handout with exercises… good. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything I should be doing right now? Besides not eating?
DOCTOR: Just focus on staying hydrated and getting some rest tonight. Avoid any activities that aggravate your symptoms, if possible. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. My nurse will come in shortly with the requisition form and handout. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think… no. That's all for now. Thank you, Doctor Fazzina. You’ve been very helpful. And kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I'll see the nurse shortly, then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I’m glad I could help. Just relax and let us do our job. And yes, the nurse will be in shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
PATIENT: .
