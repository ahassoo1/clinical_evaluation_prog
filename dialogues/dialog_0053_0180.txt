DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantorán. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. Just… tired. Really tired. And I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I gotta have it sometimes. It's stupid, I know. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: "Tired," right. And you… consume soil?
PATIENT: Yeah, soil. Dirt. Clay. Whatever you wanna call it. It’s… hard to explain. It just feels… right. Don’t ask me why, I don’t know! And it’s not like I’m out there digging in the garden every day, but when I get this feeling… I gotta have a little. Is that so strange?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantorán, it is… unusual. And frankly, potentially concerning. We need to explore this. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, ages. Honestly, I don’t even remember. Since… well, since my husband passed, probably. It just… never really went away. Gets worse sometimes, that’s all. Like right now. I just don't have the energy for… anything, really. And all this talking about it isn't helping.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue for quite some time, coinciding with the loss of your husband. I’m sorry for your loss, by the way. Now, aside from the tiredness and… the soil consumption, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Look, I’m tired and I eat dirt. What more do you need to know? My stomach feels… off sometimes, I guess. But I eat weird things, so what do you expect? It's not like I’ve got anything fancy going on. And frankly, I don’t understand why you’re asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantorán, with all due respect, “weird things” aren't typically part of a normal diet. And even if they were, a responsible physician needs to rule out underlying causes for both your fatigue and this unusual habit. “Feeling off” is vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. My stomach… hurts sometimes. Like, crampy. And… I’ve been constipated, okay? Happy now? Look, I don't go into detail about my bathroom habits with strangers. And “responsible physician”... I just want something to make me feel better, not a lecture.
DOCTOR: Cramping and constipation. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I can. Mostly just… whatever’s easy. I don’t have much energy to cook fancy meals, if that's what you're getting at. And honestly, food doesn’t really taste good anymore. Everything just feels… bland. Like eating cardboard.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I don't know. I haven’t really been weighing myself. Look, I'm a little bigger than I used to be, okay? I'm not one of those people who worries about numbers on a scale. Is that what this is about? Because I'm telling you, I'm just tired and I eat dirt, and I'd really like to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantorán, your chart indicates a significant weight change over the past year. Now, let's talk about this soil consumption a little more. When did this start?
PATIENT: Ugh. Seriously? You're going back to the dirt again? Look, it started… a while ago. Maybe a few months after… you know. Just a little craving, at first. I thought it was stress. Now it's… more frequent. I don't even think about it, really. Just… gotta have it. It’s not like I'm making a meal out of it!
DOCTOR: “Just gotta have it.” Right. Do you know what kind of soil you’re consuming?
PATIENT: What does it matter? It's dirt! From… the garden, mostly. Sometimes from pots. I don't analyze it, okay? It's not like I'm sending it to a lab! Honestly, you’re asking the silliest questions. This is ridiculous. I'm starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantorán, I understand your frustration. However, consuming soil can expose you to various parasites and toxins, which can explain your fatigue and abdominal issues. I need to rule out some serious possibilities. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Let me think… I had… the flu, a few times. Nothing serious. Old age, probably. I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. My husband handled all that. I honestly can't remember any specific diagnoses. He always said I worried too much. And honestly, I’m not even sure why I'm bothering with this now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I don't do surgeries. Too risky. I’ve always been pretty healthy, aside from… well, you know. Tired and the dirt thing. Look, are you going to give me something for the fatigue or not? I’ve wasted enough time here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantorán, I understand your desire for a quick fix, but I need to perform a physical exam and order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your iron levels, vitamin deficiencies, and look for signs of parasitic infection. Would you be willing to allow me to proceed?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Blood tests, physical… just don’t poke me too much. And hurry up. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat. We’ll start with your vitals, then move on to a brief physical assessment. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look for any other concerning signs. Blood pressure is 130/85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you could lie back for me.
PATIENT: Just… be gentle. And don’t expect me to tell you anything you don’t ask. I’m not a complicated case. Tired, dirt… you already know.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is mildly tender to palpation in the lower quadrants, no guarding or rebound tenderness noted. I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Look, does this mean I'm really sick? All this poking and listening... It's making me nervous. Can't you just give me an iron pill or something and be done with it? I really don’t understand why you need to do so much.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantorán, I'm not going to pretend I can determine the cause of your symptoms with just a quick glance and a pill. These tests are necessary to rule out serious underlying conditions. The hypoactive bowel sounds, the tenderness in your abdomen, the fatigue… all of these things point to a need for further investigation. I’m going to check your skin now for any signs of anemia or other deficiencies.
PATIENT: Anemia? I eat dirt, for goodness sake! I probably have more iron than most people. This is ridiculous. Just… hurry up. And don’t tell me anything scary. I don’t need to know about all the horrible things that could be wrong with me. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Skin is pale. Alright, that’s enough for the physical exam for now. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool analysis to check for parasites, and a Vitamin D level. We will also want to rule out Celiac’s disease with a tissue transglutaminase antibody test. I will also recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist. This level of abdominal discomfort and the unusual habit of soil consumption warrants further specialist evaluation. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and collect a stool sample before you leave. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? Seriously? All this for eating a little dirt? Fine. Whatever you say. Just... get it over with. I hope they don't ask me to show them the dirt. This is humiliating. And how long is all of this going to take? I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will take a few days to come back, and the gastroenterologist appointment will likely be in a couple of weeks, depending on their availability. I'll have the nurse give you instructions for the stool sample collection. In the meantime, I recommend temporarily stopping the soil consumption. I understand it's difficult, but it's important for the diagnostic process. And I suggest focusing on a diet rich in iron and vitamins. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I think you’ve wasted enough of my time already. Just… get me out of here. I’m going home. And frankly, I doubt anything will come of all this. It's just… dirt.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly to collect the stool sample and provide discharge instructions. Have a good day, Ms. Cantorán. .
