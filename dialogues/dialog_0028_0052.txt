DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Benic, is it?
PATIENT: Aye, that's me. Aurthur Benic. Though most just call me Aurthur. It's good to meet ye, Doctor... Memmolo, is it? I saw the name on the door.
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. Dr. Memmolo. Look, I have a rather full schedule today, so if we could just get straight to the point… What brings you in?
PATIENT: Och, right, aye, no problem at all. I’ve been feelin’ a bit queasy o’ a mornin’ lately. Not proper sick, mind ye, just… unsettled. And it’s been happenin’ more often, see? The nurse asked if I’d been feelin’ alright with my heart, and I thought it best to get it checked out. It's not a pain, exactly, just… a bit of discomfort and that feelin’ like I might be sick.
DOCTOR: “Queasy.” Right. And how long has this “queasiness” been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now… It started maybe three weeks ago, now? At first, it was just once or twice a week, and I thought it was just somethin' I ate. But it’s been nearly every mornin’ for the past week, I’d say. Not every single mornin’, but close to it. It usually goes away after I’ve had a bit o’ breakfast, but it's still… bothersome, ye ken?
DOCTOR: And what does your breakfast consist of, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Och, it varies a bit, to be honest. Usually porridge with some fruit, sometimes toast with a bit o' jam. I try to eat somethin’ light, I do. I used to have a full Scottish breakfast, but the doctor – not yerself, another one – suggested I ease off that a bit, with the heart condition and all. So I’ve been stickin’ to the lighter fare, aye? I don't really eat much meat these days, either. Mostly fish. Does that make any difference, d'ye think?
DOCTOR: Possibly. And this discomfort… where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly right here, in my chest, just under the breastbone, ye ken? Not a sharp pain, like a heart attack, thankfully. More like a… pressure, a fullness. It sometimes creeps up into my throat, that unsettled feelin’. And then the queasiness, of course. It's hard to describe, really. It's not like a stomach bug, it’s… different. Does that make sense? I try to take deep breaths when it starts, and it sometimes helps.
DOCTOR: You said you've been told about a “heart condition”?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. A few years back, now, I was diagnosed with… well, the doctor called it heart failure, but he said it was a mild case, and could be managed with medication and… watchin’ what I eat, like we were just talkin' about. I take a couple o' pills every day for it, and I go for check-ups regularly. I haven’t had any major problems with it, not 'til these mornin' sickness spells started, anyway. Do ye want to know the name of the medication? I wrote it down, if that helps. I'm terrible with remembering names, but I'm good with details, ye see?
DOCTOR: Yes, the medication name would be helpful. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this queasiness and discomfort?
PATIENT: Right, let me see… It’s here in my wee notebook. It’s… Lisinopril, I think? And… Furosemide. Aye, those are the two. And as for other symptoms… well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not exhausted, mind ye, but I find myself needin’ a bit o' an afternoon nap more often than I used to. And my ankles have been a bit swollen in the evenings. I just put it down to the warm weather, to be honest. I usually put my feet up, and it seems to help. I've not noticed any shortness of breath, thankfully. Would that be important?
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and fatigue… Yes, that is relevant. Let’s have a listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. Then we can discuss some possible… courses of action. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Aye, no problem at all. Just a bit creaky in the mornings, ye ken? Happy to do whatever ye need, Doctor. Just let me know if there's anything I should be doin', or if there’s a particular way ye want me lyin'. I'm a bit of a worrier, so I always like to get things right.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. I’ll be starting shortly. Try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Right ye are. Arms at me sides, aye? Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin’ else. It's a bit cold on the paper, mind ye, but I suppose it's better than bein' unwell. Tryin' to breathe normally, aye...
DOCTOR: Heart rate is a bit rapid. Some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Slight fullness noted. Alright, Mr. Benic. Sitting up slowly, please. We'll need to get some blood work done, a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count, and a chest X-ray. That will give us a better picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: Right, aye. Blood work and an X-ray, ye say? No problem at all. Just tell me what I need to do, and I'll get it done. Is there anythin’ I should be avoidin’ before the blood work? Like, should I eat somethin’ or not? I always get a bit nervous when they take blood, ye see. And will I need to change into a gown for the X-ray? I just want to be prepared, like. It’s good to know what’s comin’.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to fast before the blood work. And no, you won't need to change for the X-ray. Just remove any metal objects – jewelry, belt, anything like that. The nurse will explain everything. I'll have the orders sent to the lab and radiology department now. <stage>clicks a few more buttons on the computer. I want to rule out a few things. It could be a simple exacerbation of your heart failure, or something else entirely. We need the results to determine the best course of action. <stage>pauses, then looks up briefly. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Och, no allergies to medications, thankfully. Never had any trouble with them, not that I've noticed. Just a bit o' a worrywart, as I said. So, the nurse will tell me where to go for the blood work and the X-ray, ye say? And then what happens? Will I get the results straight away? I'm not one for waitin’ about, ye ken. I like to know what’s goin' on as quickly as possible. And will ye be seein’ me again after they’ve done the tests? I’m just tryin’ to get a wee bit of an idea of what to expect, like.
DOCTOR: The results will not be immediate. It usually takes a few hours, sometimes a day. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss them. I’m a busy physician, Mr. Benic, and I’ll review the results then. In the meantime, continue taking your current medications as prescribed. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe swelling, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand. Continue the medication, and go to the emergency room if things get worse. A few hours, or a day for the results… Right. And the nurse will schedule the follow-up appointment, ye say? Just so I’m clear, I need to go and see the nurse now, is that right? And she’ll sort out all the rest? I just want to be sure I don’t miss anythin’, like. I appreciate ye explainin’ it all, Doctor. It’s good to know what’s happenin’, even if it’s a wee bit of a wait for the results. Right then, I suppose I'll go and find the nurse.
DOCTOR: Yes. Go to the nurse’s station. She’ll take it from here. .
PATIENT: Right ye are. Thank ye kindly, Doctor. <stage>exits the room
