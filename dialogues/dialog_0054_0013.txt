DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s…it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It just…stops, sometimes. It’s been happenin’ for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder when you urinate, and it’s been going on for a bit. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It just…feels like there’s still some left in there, even after I try. I have to… strain a bit, sometimes, to get the rest out. And sometimes it just…won’t come out at all, and I have to try again later. It’s mostly happenin’ in the mornings, I think. But it can happen any time. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Hilber. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. So, it’s a feeling of incomplete emptying, sometimes requiring straining, and it’s more noticeable in the mornings but can occur at any time. Have you noticed any changes in the strength of your stream – is it weaker than usual, or does it start and stop?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe it’s not as strong as it used to be. It doesn’t feel like a full, steady flow, if that makes sense. More… dribbly, sometimes. And yes, it does start and stop, now that you mention it. I hadn't really paid attention to that part before. It’s not a big problem, but it’s gettin’ a little… worrisome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a weaker stream that starts and stops, along with the incomplete emptying and occasional straining. I appreciate you sharing all of that with me. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have to get up a couple times at night to go. More than I used to, anyway. Not every night, but most nights. And… sometimes I feel like I can't quite get comfortable. Like I gotta go even when I just went. Does that make sense? It's a… a pressure, I guess. Not pain, just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Hilber. Increased nighttime urination – we call that nocturia – and a feeling of incomplete emptying with persistent discomfort. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate checked a few years back, but the doctor said it was normal. Nothing to worry about then. Other than that… I don’t really have much. I had the usual colds and flus, but nothing serious. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. My wife… she passed away a couple years ago, and she had some trouble with her heart, but that was her. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, but that’s it. Just a small pill, every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a normal prostate check a few years ago, blood pressure medication is the only current medication, and no known allergies. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… let me see… I have the bottle right here. It’s Lisinopril. Just one pill, 20 milligrams, every morning. I’ve been takin’ it for… I don’t know, maybe five years now? The doctor said it was keepin’ things nice and steady.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure. Thank you. Now, Mr. Hilber, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. It's a standard part of evaluating these symptoms. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Well… I’ve never had one of those before. I guess… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yes. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. It sounds… uncomfortable. But if it’ll help figure out what’s goin’ on, then go ahead.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It's not the most comfortable exam, but it's important for getting a clear picture of what's happening. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. Alright, Mr. Hilber. The exam showed some mild enlargement of your prostate, but no obvious areas of concern. It wasn’t particularly tender to the touch. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it's likely you have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s a common condition as men get older where the prostate enlarges and can cause urinary symptoms like you’ve been describing. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: BPH… that’s a mouthful. So, it’s just… my prostate gettin’ bigger? And that’s causin’ all this trouble? Well, that’s… a little bit of a relief, I guess. Not somethin’ serious, then? Yes, a urine test and a blood test… that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this figured out and get back to feelin’ normal. When can I get those done?
DOCTOR: That’s right, Mr. Hilber. It’s a very common condition as men age – the prostate naturally enlarges. It’s rarely anything serious, but it can be bothersome. The tests will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out anything else that might be contributing to your symptoms. The lab is right down the hall. They can draw the blood and collect a urine sample for you right away. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. These could range from lifestyle changes to medication, and in some cases, we might consider other procedures, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… like what kind of changes? And what kind of medication are we talkin’ about? I don’t want nothin’ that’ll make me feel… foggy, or anything. I still like to get out and do things, you know? I like to fish, and help my grandson with his chores. I just… don’t want to be slowed down. And how long does it usually take to get the test results back? I’m not lookin’ to rush things, but I’d like to know what we’re dealin’ with as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Hilber. Lifestyle changes can include things like limiting fluids before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises – often called Kegel exercises – to strengthen the muscles that support your bladder. As for medication, there are a few different types we could consider. Some medications help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. Others can shrink the prostate over time. We would start with a low dose and monitor for any side effects, and we can always adjust or switch medications if needed. Most people tolerate these medications very well, but it's important to be aware of potential side effects like dizziness or lightheadedness. We'll discuss all of that in detail before starting anything. The lab should have the results back within 2-3 business days. I'll have my nurse give you a call as soon as they come in, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan that’s right for you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Limiting fluids and exercisin’… I can do that. I’ll have to look up those Kegel exercises, though. Never heard of those before. And 2-3 days for the results… that’s not too bad. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a lot better knowin’ what to expect. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. My nurse will be in to give you the lab order and some information about those Kegel exercises. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
