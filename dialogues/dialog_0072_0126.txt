DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 32 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's right. Well, to be frank, I’ve been terribly thirsty lately, no matter how much I drink. And… strangely enough, I’m always hungry, even after a good meal. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and hunger for a few weeks. And you say it’s concerning you. Can you describe the thirst?
PATIENT: It’s… constant, really. Not like after a salty meal, or after exercise. Just… always feeling like I need a drink. I find myself reaching for water, juice, anything, throughout the day and even during the night. It doesn’t really satisfy it, if that makes sense. I drink a lot, and it doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Constant thirst that isn’t relieved by drinking. I understand. And this hunger… is it a normal hunger, or something different?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not like a craving for anything specific. It’s more of an emptiness. I’ll eat a full plate of food, feel satisfied for perhaps half an hour, and then the feeling returns. It’s not a rumbling stomach, just… a need to eat. It's rather disruptive, to be honest. I haven’t lost weight, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Alright. No weight loss, that’s good. This sounds… unusual. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? Hmm… now that you mention it, yes. I suppose I have been going to the bathroom… more frequently. Particularly at night. I’d always been a sound sleeper, but now I’m up a couple of times needing to go. I hadn’t really connected the two, to be honest. Is that… normal with this sort of thing? I apologise, I don’t know much about these medical matters.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency of urination, especially at night. Okay. And are you experiencing any blurred vision, fatigue, or unexplained weight changes – even though you haven’t lost weight, have you noticed any fluctuations?
PATIENT: Blurred vision… no, not that I've noticed. Though, I do spend a fair bit of time staring at screens for work, so it’s difficult to say. Fatigue, yes, actually. I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, more so than usual. I put it down to stress, to be frank. And as I said earlier, no weight loss, but I wouldn’t say my weight has been completely stable, if that makes sense. It sort of… fluctuates a little. Not a drastic amount, mind you. Perhaps a few pounds here and there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, slight weight fluctuations, increased thirst, increased hunger, increased urination, especially nocturia… Have you noticed any skin changes?
PATIENT: Skin changes? No, not that I am aware of. I shave regularly, so I suppose I’d notice anything drastic. But no, no rashes, dryness, or anything like that. I did get a rather nasty sunburn a few weeks ago, but that’s healed now. Is that relevant? I’m sorry to be so… vague, Doctor. I don't mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: No skin changes beyond a resolved sunburn. Mr. Erxleben, while I appreciate you trying to be thorough, these symptoms, taken together, are concerning. I'd like to perform a physical exam and order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. A physical exam and blood work, yes, that’s perfectly acceptable. I'd like to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible, if you don't mind. I have commitments later this afternoon, so the sooner we can get started, the better.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let's start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. After that, we'll draw some blood. It shouldn't take too long. Please sit here on the examination table.
PATIENT: Right. Very well. Let's get on with it then, shall we? The sooner this is done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. We'll start with your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart. Sounds regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, nothing particularly painful. A little… sensitive, perhaps, just above my stomach, but nothing I’d normally consider concerning. It's a dull ache, really, not a sharp pain. It comes and goes, to be frank. I hadn't mentioned it as I thought it was just indigestion. Perhaps a bit there, just now. But it quickly subsides.
DOCTOR: Slight tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region, intermittent. Alright. I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Bowel sounds are present, normal. Now, I'm going to need to draw a few vials of blood for a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and HbA1c. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulty with blood draws?
PATIENT: No allergies to latex, and thankfully, I’m usually quite good with blood draws. My father was a medic, so I've seen it a fair bit throughout my life. Though, I will admit, I don’t particularly enjoy it. But no, no problems as far as I’m aware. Let's get it over with then, shall we? The quicker the better, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. This will be a standard blood draw. You might feel a slight pinch. Okay, all done. Apply pressure to the site for a few minutes. Here's a bandage. Now, we’ll send these samples to the lab, and we should have results within 24-48 hours. While we’re waiting, I want you to continue to monitor your thirst and urination. We'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your attention. Just… what exactly are we looking for, if you don’t mind me asking? Is it something serious? I apologise, I’m probably being rather foolish. I simply want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Mr. Erxleben, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask. Based on your symptoms – increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and intermittent abdominal discomfort – we’re primarily investigating the possibility of diabetes mellitus. The blood work will help us determine your blood glucose levels and HbA1c, which provides a measure of your average blood sugar over the past few months. It’s also important to rule out other potential causes. I don't want to alarm you, but it's best to be proactive. We'll have a clearer picture once we have the lab results. Is that understandable?
PATIENT: Diabetes… I see. My grandmother had that… Yes, that makes sense. Increased thirst and urination, you said. It all fits. Yes, that’s… understandable. I suppose it’s best to know, as you say. Right. Well, I shall await the results then. Thank you, Doctor Hembrey. I appreciate your honesty. If there’s nothing further, I think I'll be on my way. I have an appointment I need to attend.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. I’ve documented our conversation and the physical exam findings. The lab results will be sent to my office, and my staff will contact you as soon as they are available. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as significant weight loss, blurred vision, or unexplained fatigue – please contact the office immediately. And if anything feels particularly concerning, don't hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room. I’ve provided a printed summary of today's visit and instructions for monitoring your symptoms. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Hembrey. I appreciate your time and… well, your thoroughness. I shall await your call. Good day.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Erxleben. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
