DOCTOR: Alright, Jase, nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s… well, it’s my stomach. It's been, like, really upset. A lot of… bathroom trips. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's just not letting up. I think it's diarrhea, yeah? Honestly, I can’t really remember when it started exactly, just that it’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Right. "A bit" is… not terribly helpful, dear, but we can work with that. And you think it’s diarrhea. Okay. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I don’t think so? I haven’t really felt hot, but my husband usually checks those things. He hasn't said anything about a fever, though. It just feels… bad, you know? Like, really uncomfortable and I'm going to the bathroom a lot. I don’t really know if I’ve been actually running a fever or not.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always best to have a concrete temperature, but we'll proceed. Any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: Ugh, sometimes. Not like, every time, but yeah, I get a bit sick to my stomach sometimes, and then… well, you know. It doesn’t happen with every bathroom trip, but it does happen. It’s hard to explain. I feel kind of weak too, I guess. Not super weak, but just… more tired than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea occasionally, weakness… and frequent diarrhea. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh, geez. I… I don’t think so. I haven’t really… looked, if that makes sense. I just… rush to the bathroom, and then… deal with it. I haven’t noticed anything, but I haven’t exactly been checking, you know? Is that… bad? I'm so sorry, this is probably a really gross question.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, dear. These things happen. It’s good you’re telling me. It’s important to rule things out. Okay, let’s move on. Any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, my stomach really hurts sometimes. It’s… kind of all over, I guess? Not one specific spot. It’s just… achy, and crampy. It gets worse when I have to go to the bathroom, obviously, but it’s there even when I don’t. It’s not, like, excruciating pain, but it's definitely uncomfortable. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining this.
DOCTOR: Alright. “achy and crampy, generalized abdominal pain, worse with bowel movements…” Yes, that's helpful. Now, have you eaten anything different lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don’t think so. We usually eat the same things. My husband does most of the cooking, and it’s usually Pakistani food, like curries and rice. I don’t think anything stands out as being… new or different. Maybe I had some street food last week when I was visiting my sister, but that was… a while ago now. I didn’t feel sick then, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this has been going on for “a bit”. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is the worst part. Okay… I think… maybe a month? Or longer? It’s hard to say. It started slowly, just a little upset, and then it got worse. I think it's been consistently bad for about two weeks, maybe? But I've been feeling off for longer than that. Honestly, I'm really bad with dates and remembering things like this. My husband would know better.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let's see… you're 20 years old, Pakistani descent, Medicare… And you’ve been experiencing diarrhea for potentially a month, worsening over the last two weeks, with associated nausea, weakness, and generalized abdominal pain. No fever reported, no blood in stool noticed. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your past medical history, just to rule things out. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… chronic… That means long-term, right? I think… yeah, actually. When I was a kid, they said I had something with my stomach, something about not being able to eat certain foods. It was really hard to say the name, and it was a long time ago. Something about… inflammation? And I think they said something about celiac, but I don’t really remember. My husband handles all the doctor stuff normally. I've been okay for a long time though, until this started.
DOCTOR: Okay, “childhood history of potential gastrointestinal issue, possibly celiac disease or related… husband manages medical care.” Right. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't really taken much medication. Just… normal stuff for colds, maybe? Nothing serious. I haven’t had any bad reactions, anyway. I don’t really like taking pills, so I try to avoid it when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not anything regularly. I took some stuff for a headache last week, but that was just ibuprofen, I think? Nothing else. Just the normal stuff, like if I get a cold. I don't really take anything for… anything, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. Last question about your history before we move on to a brief exam. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: Recent… Hmm. I went to visit my sister in Chicago last month, but that wasn't very far. And before that… Oh! We went to Pakistan last year for a family wedding, but that was… a long time ago. Does that count as recent? I didn't get sick there, though. It was a really nice trip.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, so last travel was to Pakistan a year ago. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle? My stomach is pretty sensitive right now.
DOCTOR: Of course. Alright. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen first. Please lie flat on your back, and let me know if anything feels particularly painful when I press. Okay. There's some… increased bowel sounds, which is expected with diarrhea. And a little bit of tenderness in all quadrants, but nothing acute. I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen now. Please tell me if anything feels sharp or unbearable. Okay, a little discomfort, but no guarding or rigidity. No masses palpable. I’m just going to check your hydration status quickly. Your skin seems slightly dry, which could indicate mild dehydration. And I’ll just take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side – 100/60 – and pulse is a bit elevated at 90. Everything else appears normal.
PATIENT: Okay… that wasn’t too bad. My stomach is a little sore, but… yeah, that’s okay. It’s probably just from everything going on. So, what does all that mean? Is it something serious? I’m a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Well, based on the history and exam, it appears you're experiencing acute gastroenteritis – essentially a stomach bug. The dehydration and slightly elevated pulse are consistent with that. However, given your childhood history and the duration of symptoms, it’s not entirely straightforward. It could be something more chronic flaring up. I'm going to order a stool sample to rule out any infections, and a basic blood panel to check your electrolyte levels and look for signs of inflammation. It's also probably best to get a referral to a gastroenterologist – they’re the experts in this field. They can investigate your childhood history more thoroughly. In the meantime, I’ll recommend a bland diet – BRAT diet: bananas, rice, applesauce, toast – and plenty of fluids. And you can take an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal if you need to, but don't exceed the recommended dosage. We'll get the results of the tests back in a few days. If your symptoms worsen – severe abdominal pain, high fever, bloody stool, or inability to keep fluids down – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… Wow, that’s… a lot. Stool sample… and blood tests… and a specialist… It sounds… serious. I thought it was just a bug. So, the bland diet… BRAT, you said? And don't take too much of the anti-diarrheal. I think I understand. But what if I do get worse? What should I look for, exactly? And… how long should I wait before going to the emergency room? Is it like, right away? I’m just… a little scared. I don’t want anything to be seriously wrong. And is there anything I can do right now to feel better besides the diet and fluids? It's just...a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s unlikely to be anything drastically serious, dear. We're just being thorough. Severe abdominal pain – meaning pain so intense you can’t stand up straight. High fever – over 101. Bloody stool – that's fairly obvious. Inability to keep any fluids down – if you're vomiting everything you try to drink, that’s a concern. If you experience any of those, go to the ER immediately. Don’t wait. As for feeling better right now, the bland diet and fluids are your best bet. And rest. Honestly, it's just a matter of letting your stomach calm down. If it doesn’t improve in a couple of days, we’ll discuss further options. I'll have the nurse give you the orders for the lab tests and the referral information. And I’m writing you a note for work, excusing you for a few days. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay... severe pain, high fever, bloody stool, can’t keep fluids down. Got it. And rest. I think... I think that’s all. I don’t really know what else to ask. It's just… a lot to remember. Thank you... I think. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it is scary. I’ll try to rest and stick to the BRAT diet. .
DOCTOR: Right. Good. That’s all for today. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much.
