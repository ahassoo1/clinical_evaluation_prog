DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's a lot to process, and I appreciate you coming in to discuss it. Just to be clear, were you recently diagnosed with cancer, or is this a follow-up appointment regarding a previous diagnosis?
PATIENT: Yes, recently. A few weeks ago, I think. It was… a lot to take in at first, and honestly, things are still a little blurry. I don’t remember everything the other doctor said.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Chellsea. A new cancer diagnosis is incredibly overwhelming. It's very common to not remember all the details. Don't worry, we'll go over everything again today. Could you tell me what you do remember about the type of cancer, and where it is located, if you know?
PATIENT: Um… they said it’s in my… chest? Near my lungs, I think. Something about cells not being right. It’s… lung cancer, maybe? I’m really not sure. They said a lot of words, and I just… nodded. I apologize. It feels silly.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Chellsea. It doesn’t feel silly at all. It's perfectly normal to feel lost after receiving that kind of news. We can definitely clarify everything. Okay, “near the lungs” and “cells not being right” is a good starting point. Do you recall if they mentioned what kind of lung cancer it might be – for example, small cell or non-small cell?
PATIENT: I… no. I truly don’t remember. They did some scans, and then talked about stages, I think? Numbers… one, two, three? I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. My head feels… foggy.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Chellsea. We'll get to the bottom of it. We have access to your records from the other doctor, so we can review those together. Before we do, let’s just get a bit more information from you. Have you been experiencing any symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Yes… I get tired very easily. And I’ve been coughing, but not a lot. Just… here and there. And sometimes… my chest hurts. It’s not a sharp pain, just… achy. I haven't been able to do much, even walking feels difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, occasional cough, and achy chest pain. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… the tiredness started first, maybe a couple of months ago. The cough and chest pain started more recently, maybe a month or so. I thought it was just… getting older. I didn't think it was anything serious. It just… got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little short of breath, even when I’m just sitting still. And… I lost my appetite. Everything tastes… bland. Not very good. I haven't been eating much lately. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It can be, unfortunately. Shortness of breath and loss of appetite are both symptoms that can sometimes accompany cancer, but they can also be caused by other things. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a few times, and a bad cold last winter. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been pretty healthy, until this. My husband… he passed away last year. That was difficult, and I think I haven’t been taking care of myself as well since then. It’s silly, I know.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Chellsea. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable that it would affect your health. It takes time to heal, both emotionally and physically. Do you have any family history of cancer or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had breast cancer. A long time ago, I think. She… she passed away when I was very young. I don’t remember much about it. And… my father had some problems with his heart, but that’s all I know. Nothing else, really. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of breast cancer and heart problems. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu or a cold?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I've always been very lucky, I guess. Until now. I never smoked, or drank much. I tried to stay healthy. It’s just… confusing. Why me?
DOCTOR: It is confusing, and it’s okay to feel that way. Sometimes, despite doing everything right, these things happen. We don’t always have answers to “why.” Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. Nothing regular. Just when I remember. I apologize. I'm probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being perfectly helpful, Chellsea. Don't apologize. We’re just gathering information. Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I apologize, Doctor, if I'm rambling. I'm just… nervous. And sad. This is all so new.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, and it’s perfectly understandable to be nervous and sad. Take your time. Alright, thank you for sharing all of this with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your lungs, checking your heart rate, and feeling for any abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That's… okay. I suppose. I just… what are you looking for, exactly? Will it hurt? I apologize. I'm probably asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: No, these aren’t silly questions at all, Chellsea. It’s good to know what to expect. I’m listening to your lungs to check for any unusual sounds, like wheezing or crackling, which can indicate fluid or inflammation. I'll also check your heart rate and rhythm, and gently feel for any swollen lymph nodes. It shouldn’t hurt, though you might feel some pressure. Would you mind taking a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay… I’ll try. It feels… strange. I haven’t been breathing very well lately. I think I’ve been holding my breath a lot, without realizing it. It’s silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes of both lungs, and a slight crackling sound in the right lower lobe. This could indicate some fluid buildup or inflammation. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. I don't feel any significant swelling in your lymph nodes. I’m also going to check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Your blood pressure is 135/85, which is slightly elevated. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically low. Okay. Thank you, Chellsea. That gives me some additional information.
PATIENT: Okay. What… what does that mean? Is it bad? I apologize, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening. I'm scared.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be scared, Chellsea. It’s okay to feel that way. The diminished breath sounds and the crackling sound could be related to the cancer, or they could be caused by something else, like an infection or fluid buildup. The slightly low oxygen saturation could also be related to the cancer, or it could be a result of your breathing pattern. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam findings, I think we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I would like to order a chest X-ray and a CT scan to get a more detailed look at your lungs and surrounding structures. We’ll also need to do some blood tests to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A scan and blood tests… will they hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I apologize, I'm asking so many questions. It’s just… I need to know. I need to understand.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Chellsea. It’s good to be informed, and I’m happy to answer whatever you need. The scan and blood tests shouldn’t hurt. The scan will involve lying still for a short period of time while the machine takes pictures. The blood test will just involve a small needle prick in your arm. The results usually take a few days to come back, typically 2-3 business days. Once we have the results, we can schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, I want you to focus on taking care of yourself. Try to get as much rest as possible, drink plenty of fluids, and eat a healthy diet. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as a high fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain, please contact me immediately. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… manageable. A few days… I can do a few days. Rest… that sounds nice. I haven’t been resting much. And… what about treatment? What kind of treatments are there for lung cancer? I apologize. I know I'm jumping ahead. I just… I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to think ahead and prepare, Chellsea. It’s good to be informed. Treatment options for lung cancer depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Some common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. We’ll discuss all of these options in detail once we have the results of your scans and blood tests. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw your blood and schedule your scans. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. I… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For everything. For being patient with me. And for explaining things. It helps. A lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It’s my job to be here for you, and I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if any questions or concerns come up before your next appointment. Sarah will be in shortly. Take care of yourself, and remember, you’re not alone in this.
