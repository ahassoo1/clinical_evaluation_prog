DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Drahota. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s about this… discoloration. My skin, you see. It’s darkening. And I tire… easily. Frankly, I haven’t much time for this, Doctor. A quick assessment would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're noticing some darkening of your skin and feeling more tired than usual. And you’d like to keep things brief, which I’ll certainly try to do. When did you first start noticing the skin discoloration, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t say precisely. Some time ago. Weeks, perhaps? Months? It all blurs together, you understand. I’ve been… busy. It’s not as if it’s a new ailment, just… more pronounced lately. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. It sounds like it's been a gradual change. And you said it's become more noticeable recently. Is it all over, or are there specific areas where you're seeing more of the darkening?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. All over. It’s not as if I’ve been meticulously cataloging the precise shade of my epidermis. Just… darker. It’s rather obvious, wouldn’t you say? Are we going to get to the point, or is this a prolonged inquiry?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like it’s generalized. And you're feeling more tired easily. Have you noticed any other changes along with the darkening and fatigue?
PATIENT: Changes? What sort of changes? I feel… older, naturally. Eighty-five years takes its toll, Doctor. Is that what you mean? I haven't been paying attention to every little… nuance. My wife handles most of those details. Perhaps you should speak with her. She has a far better memory than I do. Frankly, I’m not sure why I even bothered coming in.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Drahota. It’s perfectly understandable. Just trying to get a complete picture. Has there been any change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? I eat. When my wife prepares something. It’s not as if I’ve been subsisting on air, Doctor. Look, I’m a simple man. I work with iron and rebar. It’s strenuous work, despite my age. Is this relevant? I suspect this is all a waste of time. And I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Okay. You said you work with iron and rebar... Do you experience any pain or discomfort while working?
PATIENT: Pain? Of course, there’s pain! I’m eighty-five years old, working a physically demanding job! What did you expect, a carefree existence? Aches and pains are… commonplace. It’s the nature of the beast, Doctor. Now, are we nearing a conclusion? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Weight loss? How would I know? I don’t weigh myself daily, Doctor. My wife handles the scales as well. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… demeaning. It’s obvious I’m not in peak physical condition. Now, if you'll excuse me… I believe I’ve answered your questions sufficiently. Perhaps a referral to someone who specializes in… geriatric ailments? Or can we simply order some tests? Anything to expedite this process.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. It sounds like you’re feeling quite tired and experiencing some discomfort, and it’s difficult to remember details. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Then we can talk about some tests, and if necessary, a referral. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But please, be swift about it. I haven't got all day. And try not to poke and prod too much. It’s rather… undignified. Now, proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Drahota. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. Your heart rate is regular, but a bit fast at 92. Your lungs sound clear. I did notice some generalized darkening of the skin as you mentioned, and your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged. Your abdomen is soft, but there’s a mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Given your fatigue, the skin darkening, and these findings, I think it would be best to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test. This will help us rule out some possible causes. I'd also like to order a TSH test to check your thyroid function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, always tests. Very well. Order your tests. Just get it done. And please, expedite the results. I haven’t the time for prolonged waiting. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I've endured enough for one day. I need to get back to work. Is there anything else? Or can I finally leave?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll get the orders sent to the lab right away, and they’ll contact you to schedule the blood draw. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like significant weight loss, abdominal pain, or persistent fever—please contact the clinic immediately. I’ll also have the nurse print out a list of instructions and contact information for you. And I want to mention, while we wait for the results, it might be helpful if your wife could keep track of any changes you notice in your energy levels or appetite. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… get it over with. And please, inform my wife. She handles those details. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have work to do. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR:
