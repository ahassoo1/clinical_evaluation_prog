DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiо. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I think? The nurse on the phone said something about making sure I was up-to-date on things. I wasn’t really sure what all I needed, to be honest. I just know I should probably get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re being proactive about staying current with your vaccinations. We can definitely sort that out. To start, let’s just confirm a few things. I see here you’re 47 years old. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Forty-seven. August 12th is my birthday, if that helps. I remember dates pretty well.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for that. Now, to determine which vaccinations you might need, it’s helpful to get a little bit of your medical history. Have you had a flu shot in the last year?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think I had one at the pharmacy last fall. Maybe November? It was a busy time, and I don’t always remember things perfectly, even though I usually do. But yes, I’m pretty sure I had a flu shot. I try to get one every year.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Knowing you usually get the flu shot is helpful. And how about a tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Oh, tetanus… That was… a long time ago. I honestly don’t remember the last time I had that one. I think it was when I was younger… maybe when I was working construction, years back? I definitely don’t keep track of those things! Is that something I should remember?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly common to forget those details. It’s good you’re letting me know. A tetanus booster is recommended every ten years, so if it’s been longer than that, we should get you updated. Now, beyond those common vaccines, do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, actually. A little bit of back pain sometimes, from… well, from being a bit short, I think, and bending over a lot at work. But no serious illnesses or anything. I haven’t been to the doctor much over the years. Just for check-ups, really.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. It sounds like you’re generally in good health. And just to cover all bases, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like latex or certain foods?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and I’ve never had a reaction. I’ve used a lot of different kinds of medication over the years – pain relievers mostly – and never had any problems. I don’t think latex is an issue either, but… honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing. Is that bad? Should I be?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all. It’s good you haven’t experienced any allergic reactions. Alright, Mr. Paguiо. Just a couple more quick questions, then we can do a quick physical exam to make sure everything looks good. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke, and I don’t use any tobacco. My mother smoked, and I saw what it did to her, so I’ve always stayed far away from it. Never even tried it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy. Maybe a couple of times a week, if that. It’s more of a habit, really, than anything else. I don’t drink to excess, and I certainly don’t drink every day. It’s just… a little glass with my meal. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That sounds perfectly reasonable. Okay, Mr. Paguiо, that gives me a good overview of your health. Before we decide on which vaccinations you need, let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, so that would be good, I guess. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just have a seat here, and we'll get started. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Overall, you appear to be in good general health. Your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 91 kilograms. Based on this exam and your history, it looks like you're a good candidate for a flu shot and a Tdap booster, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Those are the ones you said I might need, right? Flu and… Tdap? I trust you, Doctor. If that's what you recommend, then let’s do it. I’d rather be safe than sorry, I suppose. Is it going to hurt a lot? I don’t really like needles, but I’ll manage.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to not like needles! It's a quick pinch, and most people don't find it terribly painful. We can minimize discomfort by relaxing your arm. The flu shot will go in one arm, and the Tdap booster in the other. I’ll give you a small bandage afterward. Before I administer the vaccines, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… get it over with quickly, if you could? I’m not trying to be difficult, it’s just… the anticipation is the worst part. I’ll try to relax my arm like you said. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand completely. Okay, all done. That wasn't too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, not terrible. A little sting, but… I’ve felt worse. Thank you, Doctor. Honestly, it was quicker than I expected. Is there anything I need to do afterward? Like… should I avoid exercise, or… anything like that? I don’t want to do something I shouldn’t.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. You might experience some mild soreness at the injection sites, and perhaps a slight headache or muscle ache. That's perfectly normal, and should resolve within a day or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help if needed. Otherwise, just go about your normal activities. There’s no need to avoid exercise or anything like that. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a year to ensure you stay current with your vaccinations. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A year from now is fine. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, Doctor. I feel much better now knowing I'm all up-to-date. Is there anything I need to do before the follow-up appointment? Like… any paperwork? I don’t want to forget anything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome! No, there’s no need to worry about any paperwork before your follow-up appointment. Just come as you are, and we'll take it from there. I will send a reminder text a week before your scheduled date. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
