DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, I don’t have a lot of time for this. I’m just… tired. Really tired. And I been… eating dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It’s just… a craving, okay? Been happening more and more lately. Is that… is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re feeling very tired, and you’ve been experiencing a craving to eat dirt. Thank you for being open with me. It’s important we understand everything that’s going on. When you say “really tired,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… just tired! Like, I could sleep for a week and still feel like I ran a marathon. Everything is just… heavy. Getting out of bed is a struggle, and I can’t focus on anything. Work is… difficult, to say the least. I program those machines, you know? Needs concentration. But I just… can't. It's been going on for months, I guess. Maybe longer. Honestly, time kinda blurs together these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so significant fatigue for several months, impacting your ability to perform daily activities, including your work. You mentioned feeling heavy and having difficulty concentrating. Is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly constant. Some days are worse than others, sure. Like today, it feels like I'm walking through mud. But it's always there, in the background. Even when I'm trying to sleep, I don’t feel rested. It's… frustrating. Look, I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cantoran, that is absolutely not too much to ask. We’ll work together to figure out what's causing this. You mentioned the fatigue impacts your sleep as well – do you have any trouble falling asleep, or do you wake up frequently during the night?
PATIENT: I fall asleep okay, usually. But I wake up. A lot. Several times a night. And I can't get back to sleep easily. I just… lie there. Thinking. Worrying. It's… I don't even know what I'm worrying about half the time, just… stuff. Then I'm exhausted when I finally do get up. It’s a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So you’re falling asleep without much difficulty, but experiencing frequent awakenings and difficulty returning to sleep, often accompanied by racing thoughts. Has anything specific changed in your life recently that might be contributing to this stress or worry?
PATIENT: Stress? Worry? Everything is stressful these days! The world is falling apart, my husband… well, never mind. It doesn't matter. He’s gone. And work is… demanding. I just want to do my job and be left alone. I haven’t done anything different, if that’s what you’re asking. I eat, I sleep , I work, I try to keep the house tidy. It's a simple life. Or it was.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot, even if things haven’t changed dramatically on the surface. I am very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. Let's shift gears for a moment. You mentioned eating dirt. Has this been a long-standing habit, or is it something relatively new?
PATIENT: Relatively new. It started… I don’t know, maybe six months ago? At first, it was just a little. Like, a tiny bit of clay I found in the garden. But now… it’s more. I try not to, but… the craving gets strong. It’s stupid, I know. But it feels… good. For a little while, anyway. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I want to assure you I’m not judging you at all. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable sharing everything with me so we can find the best solution. It’s unusual, yes, but we need to understand why you're experiencing this craving. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Honestly, I don’t even remember. Old doctor, years ago. Said I had… high blood pressure, maybe? Took pills for a while. Then he retired and I just… stopped going. Didn’t see the point. It wasn’t that bad. And honestly, I haven't felt like bothering with doctors since… well, you know. I haven’t been sick, really. Just tired. And craving dirt.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of possible high blood pressure that was previously managed with medication, but you haven’t been regularly followed up with a physician. That's helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had any surgeries. Too scared, I guess. Hospitalized… maybe when I was a kid? For the flu or something. I honestly don't recall. It was a long time ago. Look, I'm not good with remembering things. I'm telling you, I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cantoran, that is not too much to ask at all. We’re getting there. I understand your memory isn't perfect, and that's perfectly alright. Let’s talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… my mother had… arthritis, I think. Bad joints. Lots of pain. My father… he died young. Heart attack, I think. Sudden. I don't know much about it, honestly. We weren't close. And I don’t really keep in touch with my cousins, so… I don’t know their medical history either. It's just… not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis in your mother and a father who passed away from a heart attack at a young age. That's helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I eat. I sleep. Like I said. I don't go out much. I used to garden, but I haven't had the energy lately. I don’t drink or smoke. Never did. Just… a quiet life. A boring life, really. Is this going somewhere? Are you going to tell me I need to start exercising? Because I can’t.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cantoran, I wasn't going to tell you to start exercising, although regular physical activity is generally beneficial. I just want a better understanding of your overall habits. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago. And I don't bother with vitamins. Waste of money, if you ask me. I try to eat healthy, but… honestly, I haven’t been cooking much lately. It’s easier to just grab something quick.
DOCTOR: Okay. No current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, I'm going to ask you about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. No. I don’t think so. Maybe a little pollen sometimes, makes my nose itch. But nothing serious. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Honestly, I'm pretty tough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I think it would be helpful to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline and see if there are any obvious physical findings that could be contributing to how you're feeling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. This is taking up my whole afternoon. Just… don’t poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Your blood pressure is 150/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Throat is clear. Ears are normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetrical. Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, but your blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, I'd like to order some lab work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin D level. We should also check your iron levels, given your craving to eat dirt. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me when it’s over. And don’t expect me to come back if it doesn't show anything. I’m wasting my time here. Iron levels? Because of the… dirt? Is that even a thing? Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. I'll get the lab orders processed right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. The craving for dirt, known as pica, can sometimes be a sign of iron deficiency or other nutritional deficiencies. It's important to rule those out. We'll also get a better understanding of your overall health with the other blood tests. We'll call you with the results as soon as they are available, which typically takes a few days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… let me know when it’s over. I have a life, you know? Even if it’s a boring one. And please… don't judge me about the dirt. It's embarrassing enough as it is. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cantoran. I absolutely will not judge you. Your health and well-being are my top priority, and I’m here to help you in any way I can. The nurse will be in shortly. Thank you for coming in today. .
