DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let's get right to it. It's my stomach. Food comes back up, alright? Like, after I eat. It’s… unpleasant. Happens a few times a week. My wife keeps telling me to come see someone, says I'm losing weight. She worries too much, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. “Unpleasant.” We'll attempt to define that more precisely. A few times a week… and you attribute this to food “coming back up.” Is this immediately after eating, or is there a delay?
PATIENT: A delay, usually. Not right after. Maybe an hour, hour and a half. Sometimes longer if I lie down. And it's not like… throwing up, you know? It just… comes up. Slowly. It’s just… food. Undigested, mostly. And it burns. Like heartburn, but… wetter. Is that making any sense? I don’t do well explaining things.
DOCTOR: It's... marginally clearer, yes. “Wetter heartburn,” as you put it. We need to establish a timeline and the quantity of this… regurgitation. Is it a small amount, or a significant portion of your meal?
PATIENT: Significant. Not a tiny little bit. Like, a good spoonful, two spoonfuls. Sometimes more if I had a bigger dinner. Which, admittedly, is most nights. My wife makes a good roast. But then I pay for it later. And it's not just the amount, it’s… the taste. Awful. Like old pennies, almost. Honestly, it’s quite embarrassing. Do you need me to draw you a picture? I’m being serious.
DOCTOR: A picture is hardly necessary, Mr. Altine. We are physicians, not artists. “Old pennies,” you say. That suggests possible acid reflux, though the undigested food is concerning. Have you experienced any chest pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not exactly. Sometimes a little… discomfort. More like a burning sensation, right here. But not pain. It's manageable. I’ve had worse, believe me. Old war injuries, you wouldn’t believe the things… never mind. The point is, no, I haven't got pain. Just… a bit of heat. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything. It’s just… annoying. And the taste! Really, the taste is the worst part.
DOCTOR: Very well. And your wife has noticed weight loss?
PATIENT: She's always noticing something. Yes, she says I’ve lost a few pounds. I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. I'm a big man, always been a big man. A few pounds one way or the other… it’s nothing. She worries. It’s what wives do. But she said my pants were a little looser. And she's got a good eye for things like that. She used to be a seamstress, you know. Very precise. I suspect she's exaggerating, though.
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, documented weight loss warrants attention. Now, have you altered your diet recently?
PATIENT: Altered my diet? Look, I eat what my wife cooks. What do you think I do, pick through the potatoes? No. I haven't changed anything. Same meals for years. Roast beef, mashed potatoes, gravy… sometimes cabbage. She makes good cabbage. It's not the food, Doctor. I’m telling you. It’s something else. It’s probably just… old age. Things start to go wrong when you get to be my age. It's a fact of life.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Altine, dismissing symptoms as "old age" is rarely a productive diagnostic strategy. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and feel for any abnormalities. If you'll please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Lie down? Really? I had a bad back in '68… this won’t be easy. Fine, fine. But be gentle, alright? I'm not a young man anymore. And don’t expect me to do any sit-ups. I haven't done a sit-up in… well, a very long time. Hurry it up, if you could. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, some mild tenderness in the epigastric region. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. No palpable masses. It’s… unremarkable, frankly. But the diminished bowel sounds are of note. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting outside of these episodes of regurgitation?
PATIENT: No. Not nausea, exactly. Just… a general feeling of fullness, sometimes. Like I ate too much, even if I didn't. And no vomiting. Like I said, it’s not vomiting. It just… comes up. Slowly. It's very different. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you looking, but honestly, I think I just need something to settle my stomach. Something strong. Maybe a prescription? Something that will actually do something. I haven’t got time for tests. I’ve got a garden to tend. A very important garden. Tomatoes, you know. You can’t let those go to waste.
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, with all due respect, simply masking the symptom with medication is not a sound medical practice. Your weight loss, diminished bowel sounds, and recurring regurgitation suggest the possibility of a more serious underlying condition. We need to rule out a possible esophageal obstruction or even a slow-growing tumor. I am recommending an upper endoscopy and a barium swallow. These are standard procedures, relatively non-invasive, and essential to determining the cause of your symptoms. I will also order a complete blood count and metabolic panel. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tumor?! Are you telling me I have… cancer? Look, I came in here for a little heartburn, not a death sentence! Endoscopy? Swallows? You’re trying to scare me, aren’t you? Look, Doctor, I think I'm going to get a second opinion. And frankly, I think you should be more careful about what you tell people. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. I'm leaving. .
