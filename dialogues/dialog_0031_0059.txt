DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brought me in. My husband, he… he said something about my speech. He says it hasn’t been quite right lately. I’ve just been feeling a bit… off, I suppose. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good that your husband noticed and encouraged you to come in. Feeling “off” can be a lot of things, and it’s always best to investigate. When you say your speech hasn't been quite right, can you describe what he – or you – have noticed specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… difficult. He says I’m slurring my words sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. I don’t really notice it myself, to be perfectly frank. It feels… normal, I guess? He mentioned it a few times over the past week or so. I just thought I was tired, working long hours on the site and all.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon for subtle changes to go unnoticed by the person experiencing them. And long hours at work can certainly contribute to feeling fatigued and affect speech. To help me get a better understanding, has this slurring been constant over the past week, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… come and go, I think. Definitely not constant. More… when I’m tired, perhaps? Or if I’ve been talking for a long time. It's hard to pinpoint, really. My memory hasn’t been the best lately, either. It’s just… vague. I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Swaby. We'll try to piece it together. The fact that it seems to correlate with fatigue is useful information. And you mentioned your memory hasn’t been the best lately – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's just… little things, you know? Forgetting where I put my keys, or what I was about to say mid-sentence. Nothing major, thankfully. I just… I used to be so much better at remembering things. It’s been happening more and more frequently in the last few months, I think. It's probably nothing, just getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. While it’s true that memory can naturally change with age, it’s important to investigate any new or worsening changes. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, honestly, I don’t really remember much. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing serious. As an adult… I’ve had a few scrapes and bruises working on construction sites, but nothing that required a hospital visit. I have Medicare, so I’m sure everything is on file somewhere. My husband handles most of the paperwork, to be honest. I’m really not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. We can certainly access your records through Medicare. While I’m doing that, have you had any past surgical procedures?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had surgery. Not a one. I had all my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, if that counts, but that was a long time ago, and it was just a local anesthetic. Nothing major, like being put to sleep or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don't… I don't really know much about her medical history, to be honest. She didn’t really talk about it. And my father… well, he lives back in Jamaica. We haven’t spoken in a while. I wish I could tell you more, but I just don’t know. It’s a bit of a… sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Swaby. Family history can be difficult to obtain, and it’s perfectly alright if you don’t have all the information. We can proceed without it for now. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And I certainly don't partake in any… recreational activities. I’m a working woman, Doctor. I need my wits about me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a multivitamin every morning, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing for any specific condition. I occasionally take ibuprofen for aches and pains from work, but only when I really need to. That's all, I think. My husband gets me the vitamins, and I just take them with my breakfast. I really rely on him to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief neurological examination, if you don't mind. This will involve checking your reflexes, coordination, and some basic cognitive functions. It will help me assess the potential causes of your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if that involves poking and prodding, then so be it. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll begin. First, I'm going to check your cranial nerves. I'd like you to follow my finger with your eyes, but please keep your head still. Can you follow my finger as I move it from side to side, and then up and down?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There. Is that alright? It’s a little difficult to focus, if I’m honest. Perhaps the lights are a bit bright?
DOCTOR: I see. The lights can be a bit much. That's helpful to know. Now, let's check your facial movements. Can you smile for me, please?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay? It feels… a little stiff, actually. I don't know if I’m doing it right.
DOCTOR: I see. And now, can you raise your eyebrows as high as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… difficult to explain. One side just doesn’t seem to want to cooperate. It feels a bit… strange. Is something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Now, can you clench your jaw tight?
PATIENT: Is that how it’s supposed to feel, Doctor? It’s… a little uncomfortable, actually. And I can feel a twitch on this side. I’m not sure if that’s normal.
DOCTOR: Now, if you could stick your tongue out as far as you can, please. I’m looking for any fasciculations or deviation.
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It feels a bit… awkward. And it seems to be pulling to one side. I don't know if I’m doing it right. Is something definitely wrong, Doctor? I’m starting to get a little scared.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Swaby. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what I’ve observed during this brief examination – the asymmetry in your facial movements, the deviation of your tongue, and your reported slurred speech and memory issues – I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. It’s too early to say definitively what’s causing these symptoms, but we need to investigate further. The most likely next step is an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI…? Is that… serious, Doctor? What are you thinking…? Is it… a tumor? My husband, he’s always worried about things like that… I just… I want to know what’s going on. And I don’t want anything… bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Swaby. It's natural to feel anxious when facing uncertainty. Let me assure you, an MRI is a valuable diagnostic tool that will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, but it will allow us to rule out several possibilities and guide our next steps. While a tumor is one possibility we need to consider, it’s not the only one. Other potential causes could include a stroke, multiple sclerosis, or even a nerve compression issue. We won’t know for sure until we get the results of the MRI. To be thorough, I also want to order some blood tests to check for any underlying inflammation or other abnormalities. Would you be agreeable to both the MRI and the blood tests?
PATIENT: If that’s what you think is best, Doctor… then yes. Yes, to both. I just… I want this over with. I want to know what's happening so we can… fix it. My husband… he'll be so worried. Will it… will it hurt? The MRI, I mean. And… what if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be scared, Ms. Swaby. It’s completely understandable. The MRI itself is a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes, but it doesn’t hurt. Regarding the possibility of a serious diagnosis… I understand your fear. I want to assure you that we will be with you every step of the way. If we do find something concerning, we will discuss all your options and develop a treatment plan together. We have a wonderful team of neurologists and specialists available, and we will ensure you receive the best possible care. To start, I’m going to write you a referral for the MRI. The order will be sent electronically to the imaging center, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. I'll also order the blood tests, and we can get those done here in the clinic before you leave today. We'll review the results as soon as they become available. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds… alright. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… explaining everything. And for not… sugarcoating it. I appreciate that. I just… I’m glad we’re doing something. I need to know. My husband… he'll be relieved to hear we have a plan. Let’s get the tests done. Let’s find out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will get the orders printed for the MRI and the blood tests now. The blood draw will take just a few minutes, and the phlebotomist will be ready for you right away. Once that’s done, you can go home and rest. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are available, usually within 24-48 hours. Here are the orders for the MRI. It includes the imaging center's contact information and instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. Please call them to schedule your appointment at your earliest convenience. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your… kindness. And your honesty. I’m… I’m just going to go get the blood tests done. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
