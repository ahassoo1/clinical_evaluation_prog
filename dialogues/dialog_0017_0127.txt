DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… difficult to explain concisely, but I’ve been getting weaker, slowly, over the past few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping. It’s making it hard to keep them open sometimes. It's just... worrying.
DOCTOR: Slowly, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, slowly. It didn’t happen overnight, you understand. I first noticed it, I think, around… February, maybe? Just a little bit harder to get up from a chair. I thought it was just getting older, honestly. But it's gotten more noticeable since then. And the eyes… they’re definitely worse now.
DOCTOR: February… that’s… six months now. And you haven’t sought medical attention until now?
PATIENT: Well, no. I… I work quite a bit. Facilities management keeps me very busy, and I kept hoping it would just… resolve itself. It didn't seem like an emergency, and honestly, I don't have insurance at the moment, so I was… putting it off. Perhaps unwisely, I now see.
DOCTOR: Uninsured, naturally. Right. And this “weakness” – can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… it’s all over, really. My arms feel tired easily, especially lifting things. My legs feel it too, after a long day. And it's not just physical exertion, if that makes sense. Sometimes I just… feel generally weak, like I have no energy. It’s hard to describe. It's not pain, not really. Just… a lack of strength. Like I'm wading through water, a little.
DOCTOR: And this “wading through water” sensation… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It's worse at the end of the day, definitely. After a long shift at work, it’s quite pronounced. In the mornings, I feel… almost normal. Though even then, I don't feel quite as strong as I used to. It's a gradual thing, as I said. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it's worse, just… generally feels more noticeable as the day wears on. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Somewhat. Now, let’s move on. Any changes in your diet?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat… fairly normally, I suppose. I try to eat healthy, but I don’t have any strict dietary restrictions. I’ve not lost my appetite, and I haven’t changed what I eat significantly in the last six months. Though, admittedly, I do eat a lot of quick meals when I'm busy with work. Sandwiches, things like that. Not much home cooking, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: So, convenience foods, largely. Any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty swallowing at all, Doctor. I haven’t noticed anything like that. I can eat and drink as usual. It's just… the weakness is the main concern. And the eyelids, of course. They're very… heavy. It makes it difficult to focus sometimes. Do you want me to demonstrate? I can try to keep them open for a while, perhaps?
DOCTOR: No, that won't be necessary. Let's proceed with a basic neurological examination. Please sit up straight and follow my instructions. I need you to look at my finger. Do not take your eyes off of it.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I can do that. I’m looking at your finger. I won't take my eyes off of it.
DOCTOR: Follow it with your eyes only. No head movements. And tell me if you experience any double vision or blurring.
PATIENT: I’m following it, Doctor. No, no double vision… and no blurring. It's… a little difficult, perhaps, to keep my focus perfectly, but I'm not seeing double. Just a bit… tiring. My eyes feel a little strained. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Naturally. Now, squeeze my hands. Firmly.
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that firm enough? I'm trying to squeeze as hard as I can without… straining myself too much.
DOCTOR: Adequate, but not particularly strong. Now, I want you to push against my hands with your feet. Push as hard as you can. I need to assess your lower extremity strength as well.
PATIENT: I’m pushing, Doctor. I'm trying to push as hard as I can. It's… a little difficult. I feel it mostly in my thighs, and a bit in my calves. Is this sufficient? I’m not sure I’m doing it correctly. It feels… weaker than it should.
DOCTOR: Weakness is present in both lower extremities. Now, let’s move on to reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here I am. Is there anything specific I need to do?
DOCTOR: Relax your legs completely. I’m going to test your reflexes. This may involve a slight tap to your tendons. It shouldn’t be painful, but let me know if it is. I'll start with your patellar tendon.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m trying to relax my leg. It's a little difficult, I admit, I tend to tense up when I'm nervous. But I'm doing my best. Go ahead when you're ready. I'm prepared for a tap.
DOCTOR: Minimal response on the right. And… very weak response on the left. Significantly diminished reflexes bilaterally. This is… concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That felt… odd, to be honest. Very faint. Do you want me to do anything specific while you listen? Take deep breaths, perhaps? Just let me know. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, tell me, have you noticed any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No shortness of breath at all. I haven't had any trouble breathing. I can walk up the stairs without any issues, and I don’t get winded easily. It's just… the weakness, and the eyelids. They're getting worse, and it’s… unsettling. Is something seriously wrong? I'm starting to worry.
DOCTOR: Given your symptoms, the neurological findings, and the lack of any obvious respiratory or cardiac issues… I suspect we need to consider a few possibilities. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a creatine kinase level to assess muscle function. I'm also ordering an electromyography, or EMG, to evaluate nerve and muscle activity. This will be… uncomfortable, but essential. And frankly, given the rapidity of symptom onset, I want you to go to the emergency room immediately for a CT scan of your brain and chest.
PATIENT: A CT scan… and the emergency room? Immediately? What are you thinking, Doctor? Is it something… serious? The EMG sounds… painful. And what does all this mean? Is it… something neurological? A tumor? I don’t understand. I just came in with weakness and drooping eyelids. I… I don’t know if I can afford all of this. Is there… another way? Perhaps more blood work? I'm a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, I understand your concerns, but we must rule out serious conditions first. Your symptoms – the progressive weakness, the diminished reflexes, the drooping eyelids – are suggestive of several possibilities, some of which require immediate attention. A tumor is one possibility, yes, but we must also consider other neurological disorders, as well as muscle diseases. Blood work is necessary, but it will not provide the definitive answers we need. The EMG is uncomfortable, but essential to assess nerve and muscle function. And frankly, given your age and the speed of symptom onset, we cannot afford to delay. As for the cost, I can write a letter explaining the medical necessity of these tests, but ultimately, that is a matter for the hospital and your insurance… or lack thereof. I strongly advise you to go to the emergency room immediately. I will have my nurse prepare the necessary orders and a referral letter. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I understand. It's just… a lot to take in. Emergency room… CT scan… EMG… It all sounds so… frightening. And expensive. Alright, Doctor. I’ll… I'll go to the emergency room. When you say “immediately,”… how immediately are we talking? Can I… can I at least go home and get something to eat first? I haven’t had breakfast.
DOCTOR: No. Do not go home. Do not eat. Every moment counts. I want you at the emergency room within the hour. The longer you wait, the more difficult it may be to determine the cause of your symptoms. My nurse will bring you the orders and the referral letter. Go now. And do not hesitate to tell them you are under my care. Next. Uninsured patients… always the complications.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Within the hour. Thank you… I think.
