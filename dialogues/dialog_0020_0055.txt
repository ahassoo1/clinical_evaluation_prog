DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. Well, I’ve been hearing things… about this… medical marijuana. My niece, she suffers with… nerves, you understand. And she says it’s helped her tremendously. I thought, perhaps, it might be worth exploring for myself. Though, frankly, I’m not one for… fads.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're interested in learning more about medical marijuana as a potential treatment option. And you're curious about whether it might be helpful for you. That’s perfectly reasonable. Before we go further, just to be clear, are you experiencing any specific symptoms that you're hoping to address?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Well, at my age, Doctor, one accumulates a few things. It’s not as though I’m… ailing, precisely. It’s more… a general… discomfort. Trouble sleeping, mostly. And a certain… lack of… pep. I do try to stay active, you understand. Bridge club three times a week, volunteer at the historical society… but one tires, doesn’t one? It’s just… not what it used to be. I suppose that qualifies as a symptom.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely qualifies as symptoms. Trouble sleeping and a general lack of energy – those can certainly impact your quality of life. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue and insomnia. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, and to determine if medical marijuana would be appropriate, could you tell me a little more about your sleep?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not that I can’t fall asleep, Doctor. It’s… staying asleep. I wake up, you see. Several times a night. Often for no reason at all. Sometimes a little noise, sometimes just… a thought. And then I lie there, and I think. And I think. And I think. Until finally, I give up and get up. It’s quite disruptive, really. My husband, bless his heart, doesn’t seem to notice a thing. Men! They sleep like logs, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds frustrating. Waking up frequently during the night, and difficulty getting back to sleep… that's a common issue. It's good you've identified that it's not falling asleep that's the problem, but staying asleep. Do you happen to know about how many times you wake up during the night, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It varies, Doctor. Truly. Some nights it’s just once, perhaps twice. Other nights… well, I wouldn’t want to exaggerate, but I’d say… three or four times, easily. Sometimes more. It’s difficult to say precisely, as I usually just… give up counting. It’s quite… unsettling, really. It’s not as though I’m tossing and turning the whole time, you understand. I’m perfectly still. Just… awake.
DOCTOR: Okay, so on average, waking up three or four times a night. And you said you feel still when you wake up. Do you find yourself having trouble falling back asleep after you wake up, or do you just… lie awake thinking?
PATIENT: It’s the thinking, Doctor. Always the thinking. It’s not that I’m uncomfortable, or in pain, or anything of the sort. My mind just… starts. Reminiscing, mostly. Old friends, past events… things that happened years ago. And then I start to worry. About my niece, about the historical society, about… everything, really. It’s exhausting, frankly. Trying to quiet my own thoughts. It’s not a restful state, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That sounds very disruptive. It sounds like you're experiencing a form of insomnia related to racing thoughts and worry. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about other areas of your health, if that’s alright. First, have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is perfectly fine, Doctor. I’ve never been one for large portions, you understand. But I eat a sensible diet. Fish on Fridays, a nice salad most evenings… I do enjoy a good cup of tea with a biscuit, of course. No, my appetite is not the problem. It’s simply… the mind. Always the mind. It never stops, you see. And that, Doctor, is the trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, consistent appetite. And no recent changes there. Now, have you been feeling more stressed or anxious than usual lately, aside from the nighttime thoughts?
PATIENT: Stressed? Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve seen things, done things. A little stress isn’t going to… unsettle me. I manage the historical society, you see. That’s enough to cause a certain… frustration from time to time. But stress? No. It's not stress. It’s… thoughtfulness. A reflective nature. My husband says I overthink things. Men! What do they know? It’s not anxiety, Doctor. It's simply… being aware.
DOCTOR: I understand. You feel it’s more a reflective nature, rather than stress or anxiety. And you’ve lived a full life, so it’s natural to have a lot on your mind. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve always taken pride in my health. I’ve never been one for… complaints. I do have a touch of arthritis in my hands, you see. Makes opening jars a bit difficult from time to time. But other than that… no. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no heart problems. I’ve always been careful what I eat, and I get plenty of rest. Well… when I can rest, that is. My husband's mother, God rest her soul, she had a touch of the… flutterings. But that was on his side of the family. Nothing to worry about on mine. I've always been quite robust, you see. A healthy constitution.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the hands, and a family history of heart issues on your husband's side. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes. Years ago, when I was a young woman, I had my tonsils removed. A perfectly routine procedure, of course. And… well, when I had my gallbladder out. That was quite some time ago now. Nothing major, you understand. And… I believe that’s it. No other surgeries. A perfectly healthy life, really. Just a few… minor inconveniences from time to time. But nothing to write home about, Doctor. Absolutely nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and gallbladder removal. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I don’t believe in all those… potions. A little tea, perhaps. Chamomile, for calming the nerves. But no medications. Absolutely not. I prefer to rely on my own… inner strength. And a good night’s sleep, when I can get one, of course. Vitamins? Supplements? Heavens, no. All that… artificiality. I prefer a sensible diet and plenty of fresh air. That’s all one needs, really. A natural life. That's what I believe in.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been quite robust, you see. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life. Shellfish, peanuts… never had a problem. I did have a bit of a reaction to a certain perfume once, years ago. A rash, I believe. But that was years and years ago. Nothing serious. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. A healthy constitution, you see. Always been blessed with a strong immune system. It's a gift, really. I suppose I should be grateful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no, Doctor! Absolutely not. I find the habit… repulsive. My husband smoked for a while, years ago, but I made him quit, of course. It’s dreadful for the health, you see. And the smell! Simply dreadful. No, I’ve never smoked, and I wouldn’t dream of it. A healthy lifestyle, Doctor. That’s what I believe in. Fresh air, sensible diet… not indulging in such… vices. It's simply not done.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, Doctor. A nice Chardonnay, perhaps. Or a little sherry. Just a small glass, you understand. For relaxation. And a little celebration now and then. I wouldn’t say I indulge, precisely. But a little… moderation is perfectly acceptable. It’s not as though I’m… imbibing constantly, you see. Just a little something to… enhance the meal. A civilized habit, really. And I always make sure it's paired with the correct food, of course. One must maintain standards.
DOCTOR: Okay. Light alcohol consumption. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your work or daily activities?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I keep quite busy. I’m very active in the historical society, you see. I’m the treasurer, and I organize all the events. It’s quite a responsibility, really. Ensuring the preservation of our local heritage. And I volunteer at the library, cataloging old documents. And, of course, bridge club three times a week. And I assist my husband with his gardening. He’s quite the enthusiast. And I try to maintain a social life, you understand. Luncheons with friends, occasional theatre trips… I believe in keeping an active mind. A busy life, Doctor. A very busy life. It’s important to stay engaged, you see. One must contribute to society. And keep the brain functioning, of course. It’s all about maintaining a… purpose. It’s quite fulfilling, really. Though, sometimes… it’s a bit tiring, you see. But one does what one must.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. It sounds like you’re a very active and engaged individual. Based on what you’ve told me, the primary issue seems to be difficulty staying asleep, along with racing thoughts and worry. You've mentioned you're interested in exploring medical marijuana as a potential option. While it may be helpful for some, it's important to understand that it's not a one-size-fits-all solution and there are potential risks and side effects. Before we proceed, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your sleep difficulties. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Hmm. I suppose it couldn’t hurt. Though, I assure you, Doctor, I’m in perfectly good health. I have regular check-ups with my GP, you see. But very well. If you feel it’s necessary. Just… please be gentle. I’m not accustomed to… prodding. And I do have rather sensitive skin, you see. But yes, proceed. If you insist. Just… keep it brief, if you would be so kind. I have bridge club this afternoon, you understand. And one must be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. This will just be a quick assessment of your heart, lungs, and a neurological check. Breathe deeply for me, please. Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs detected. And now, I’ll listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths in and out. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. This may feel a little strange. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Finally, I'm just going to have you stand and walk a few steps for me. Gait is steady and balance appears normal. Everything appears within normal limits physically. However, the racing thoughts are concerning, and we should rule out other potential causes before considering medical marijuana. I recommend we get a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level to start. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, dear. I do dislike needles. But very well. If you feel it’s necessary. I suppose one must endure a little discomfort for the sake of good health. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and… Vitamin D? What does that have to do with anything? But yes, proceed. If you insist. Just… please be quick about it. And send the results to my GP, if you would be so kind. He knows my history, you see. And I trust his judgment. Honestly, Doctor, all this… prodding and poking… it's quite unsettling. But I appreciate your thoroughness, I suppose. Though, I do hope we can get to the bottom of this soon. I’m simply not sleeping, you see. And it's affecting my bridge game. And that, Doctor, is simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure the blood draw is as quick and comfortable as possible. Vitamin D deficiency can sometimes contribute to sleep disturbances and mood changes, so it’s good to rule it out. And absolutely, I will send the results directly to your GP. I’ll write up the lab orders now. You can go to the lab here in the clinic, and they’ll take the samples. Once the results are back, usually within a few days, we'll review them together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I also recommend practicing good sleep hygiene. That includes establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Sleep hygiene… yes, I’ve heard of that. My niece mentioned something similar. Regular schedule, relaxing routine… avoiding caffeine. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been quite disciplined. I go to bed at the same time every night, you see. And I never drink coffee after lunch. But very well. I’ll try to be even more… diligent. Though, I can’t promise anything. My mind, you see. It simply won’t quiet down. But yes, I’ll give it a try. And I’ll go to the lab. When is it convenient, if you would be so kind? And please, be sure they’re gentle with the needle. Honestly, Doctor, all this… it’s quite exhausting. But thank you. I appreciate your efforts, I suppose. Though, I do hope we can find a solution soon. I’m simply not sleeping, you see. And my bridge game is suffering. And that, Doctor, is simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Of course. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're open until 5 pm today, and you can go any time that's convenient for you. I’ll put a note on the requisition form requesting that they be gentle with the needle. Here you go. Once you've had the blood draw, please let the receptionist know, and they'll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. We can meet in about a week, if that works for you?
PATIENT: A week? Hmm. That seems rather a long time to wait. But very well. If that’s what’s necessary. I suppose one must be patient. Room 203, you said? And the receptionist will schedule an appointment. Yes, yes. I can manage. Though, I do hope the results come back quickly. I’m simply not sleeping, you see. And my bridge game… Honestly, it’s a disaster. But thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your efforts. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll go and endure this… poking. And I do hope they have comfortable chairs in the waiting room. Honestly, Doctor, all this… it’s quite exhausting. But thank you. Very well. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ellan. I hope the blood draw goes smoothly, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. .
