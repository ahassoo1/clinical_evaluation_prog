DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Paguió, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It’s just, I need to get my vaccinations updated, if that’s alright. I think I’m due for a few. I don’t keep track very well, to be honest!
DOCTOR: Vaccinations. Of course. A responsible thing to do, though it's surprising someone your age even bothers with preventative care. Let's have a look at your records… Medicare, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, Medicare. And, well, I may be getting on a bit, but I like to stay healthy if I can! I try to, anyway. Do you need anything else from me before we get started?
DOCTOR: "Try" is the operative word, isn't it?
PATIENT: You got me there, Doctor! Life gets in the way sometimes, you know? I do my best. But yes, you are right. I could probably be better at looking after myself. Is that okay to be honest with you?
DOCTOR: Honesty is… refreshing, I suppose, given the general state of things. Now, let's not dwell on past indiscretions. The important thing is you're here now. According to your chart, you're due for a Tdap booster, a flu shot – it is almost August, though, so we might wait on that – and a pneumococcal vaccine. Any known allergies to vaccines?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had all my childhood shots, and a few boosters when I was younger, but nothing ever bothered me. I don’t really remember specifics, honestly. Just that I didn’t react badly to anything. Is pneumococcal… a serious one? I’m not familiar with that name.
DOCTOR: “Not familiar with the name”... honestly. It protects against pneumonia, meningitis, and ear infections – all potentially very serious, especially as you get older and your immune system, shall we say, declines. It’s particularly important given your… robust stature. Increased risk of complications, you understand. Have you had it before?
PATIENT: Oh, right, pneumonia. Yes, I’ve heard of that. And meningitis sounds awful. No, I don’t think I’ve had that one before. Not that I remember, anyway. You mentioned my… stature? Is that a problem? I just… well, I've always been a bit smaller than most people. Is the vaccine different for someone my size? I wouldn’t want anything… complicated.
DOCTOR: Complicated?
PATIENT: Well, not complicated complicated. Just… I’ve sometimes had trouble with… dosages. With things being adjusted for my size. It's just a worry, that's all. And I didn't mean to be a bother. Is it something we need to think about? Or is it the same for everyone? I just want to make sure I'm getting the right amount, you know?
DOCTOR: Look, I assure you I’m a qualified physician. We adjust dosages as necessary, though frankly, given your height and weight, the standard dosage should suffice. But very well. We’ll do a quick check of your BMI and confirm. Turn around, please. And try not to slouch. It throws off the measurements.
PATIENT: Right, okay. Standing straight. I will try my best! It's just… comfortable for me, usually, to be a little… relaxed. I hope that's alright. Should I take my shoes off?
DOCTOR: Shoes off. Yes. And please, try to maintain some semblance of… posture. Honestly. Ninety-one kilograms… and one meter fifty-five centimeters. Just as I thought.
PATIENT: Right. One meter fifty-five. Yes, that sounds about right. Is that… a problem, Doctor? I'm a bit worried you seem… frustrated with me. I'm happy to leave if I'm being a bother. I just thought I needed my vaccinations.
DOCTOR: Frustrated?
PATIENT: Well, you seemed frustrated. And I just… I want to be a good patient! I really do. Is there anything I can do to make things easier? I understand if I’m asking too many questions. Perhaps I should just… let you do what you need to do? I trust you, of course!
DOCTOR: Hold still. And perhaps in the future, consider making a better effort to maintain your health, rather than subjecting us both to this… ordeal. Next.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. That… wasn't so bad. Thank you, Doctor. I will try. I promise. What's the next one? And will it hurt as much? Is it the same spot? I... I don't mind the pain, honestly. It just… surprises me, you know?
DOCTOR: It's a standard procedure, Mr. Paguió. Stop fussing. There. Done. Now, try to avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day. And if you develop a fever or any severe reaction, contact the clinic. Though I doubt it will come to that.
PATIENT: Right, okay. No strenuous activity. I can do that. Mostly I just sit and read. So that shouldn’t be a problem. Thank you, Doctor. Is there… anything else I need to know? Or is that all for today? I really appreciate you seeing me. And thank you again for being patient with me. I know I can be a bit… much.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Don't mention it. And try to keep your appointments on time in the future. My schedule is… rather full. Here's your discharge paperwork. And please, try to take better care of yourself. Next. .
PATIENT: Right, okay. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day. .
