DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Krahn is fine. Yes, well… something about a check-up? For… acting, I think? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They sent me over here. Said something about needing to be cleared for… performances? It was a young lady, at the theater. Very efficient. I just need to get this over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. A check-up for performances, yes. It sounds like the theater requires a medical clearance. That’s perfectly reasonable. To help me understand your needs and ensure you are fit for acting, could you tell me a little more about the type of performances you do?
PATIENT: Performances… hmm. Mostly… ushering, I think? And taking tickets. Sometimes helping people find their seats. Lobby work, you know? Not much on stage performing, if that’s what you mean. Though I used to… well, a long time ago, I did some… background things. Small roles. It’s all very… distant now. Really, I mostly just make sure everyone gets to the performance comfortably. Is that what you need to know? I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Mr. Krahn. No apologies necessary; memory can certainly be fickle as we get older. So, primarily lobby work, ushering, and assisting patrons. That’s good to know. And some past background work. That gives me a better picture. To ensure you're able to safely fulfill those roles, I’d like to get a bit more information about your current health. First, have you been experiencing any pain recently?
PATIENT: Pain… let me think. Not… constant pain, no. My knees sometimes ache a bit, especially after standing for long periods. It’s just… old age, I suppose. And my back… it gets stiff sometimes. But nothing I haven’t dealt with for years. Nothing sudden, or severe. Is that the kind of pain you mean? A little discomfort is normal, right? Especially with all the walking involved in my work. I don't want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Krahn. And you're right, some discomfort with age and activity is common. But it's good we're discussing it. To get a clearer understanding, could you describe the knee pain?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache. It’s worse after a long shift, especially if I’ve been walking a lot on the hard floors. It feels… creaky, you know? Like the joints are rubbing together. Sometimes it’s stiff in the morning, takes a few minutes to loosen up. And it doesn't really swell or anything. It's just… bothersome. I’ve been trying to take it easy, but… well, the theater waits for no one. Do you need me to… demonstrate? I can walk around a bit, if you’d like.
DOCTOR: That's a good description, Mr. Krahn. “Creaky” is a good way to put it. And no, no need to demonstrate at this moment. Just describing it is helpful. Let’s move on to your back. You mentioned stiffness. Where exactly do you feel the stiffness?
PATIENT: It’s mostly… lower back. Right around the… small of my back, I think that’s what they call it. It’s worse in the morning, like the knees. And after standing for a long time. I usually try to stretch it out, which helps a little. I used to… my wife used to give me back rubs. That was the best. But… well. Anyway, it doesn't shoot down my leg, or anything. Just… stiff. And sometimes a little sore. It’s been like this for… a long time. Honestly, I’m not sure when it started. Is this all… necessary? I feel like I’m taking up your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not taking up my time at all, Mr. Krahn. I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's important to understand the full picture to ensure your well-being, especially with the physical demands of your work. No radiating pain down your leg is good to know. Now, to get a broader picture, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back. Very unpleasant. And my wife… she was the one who always kept track of these things. I remember her mentioning something about… slightly high cholesterol, maybe? But I don’t recall ever being diagnosed with anything… serious. Arthritis, no. Diabetes, definitely not. High blood pressure… possibly? She might have said something about that. Honestly, Doctor, I'm drawing a blank. It was a long time ago, and she… she took care of all of that. I’m afraid I’m not much help. I just try to keep moving and not bother anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s common to have difficulty recalling details, especially over time. And it sounds like your wife was very attentive to your health. "Slightly high cholesterol" is good to know; we can check that with a simple blood test. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… I think I was hospitalized once for pneumonia, many years ago. But that was… before I met my wife, I think. It was a very bad winter. Beyond that… I can’t recall anything. I’ve been fortunate, I suppose. I’ve always tried to stay healthy. Mostly just… simple living. Is that enough? I feel like I'm rambling. I apologize. Should we just skip this part?
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Mr. Krahn. You’re providing me with valuable information, and I appreciate your honesty. Appendix removal and pneumonia are good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, I’m afraid not. My mother passed away many years ago, and my father… even longer. They were… good people. Both of them. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She was always tired. And my father… he had a bit of trouble with his eyesight. That’s about all I remember. They… weren’t big on talking about these things, if you know what I mean. They just… endured. Is this important? I feel like I'm not being very helpful. I really just want to get this check-up over with and get back to work. The theater… they’re counting on me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly understandable. Knowing that your mother had a weak heart and your father had eyesight issues is helpful. It gives us a little more information. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't believe in taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to stay active, that’s my medicine. Maybe a little tea sometimes, if I’m feeling a cold coming on. But no prescriptions, no regular medication. Never have. Honestly, I'm quite proud of that. I feel like relying on pills just… weakens you, somehow. Is that… silly? I just try to take care of myself naturally.
DOCTOR: Not at all silly, Mr. Krahn. It's admirable to prioritize natural health practices. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don't think so. Never had any trouble with food, never had a reaction to anything. Sometimes my eyes get a little itchy in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I think. Nothing serious. No rashes, no swelling, no trouble breathing. Never had an allergic reaction to a medication, because… well, I don't take medications. So, no. I'm pretty sure I don't have any allergies. Is that… good? I always tell people, I'm a pretty simple man. Easy to please, easy to take care of. I just want to get back to work. The patrons… they miss me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krahn. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Krahn, thank you for providing me with this information. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. The sooner we get this over with, the better. I do have to get back to the theater… they’re relying on me. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. And… don't poke around too much. My joints aren't what they used to be. But yes, go ahead. Do whatever you need to do. I’m a patient man. Mostly. Just… try to be gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart sounds good, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, at 140 over 90. We’ll want to monitor that. Your knees have some crepitus, which is consistent with what you described, and your lower back is a bit tender. Alright, Mr. Krahn, that completes the examination. Based on what you've told me and the brief physical exam, it appears you have some mild age-related joint discomfort and slightly elevated blood pressure. I recommend we do some blood work to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… oh. Well. I suppose. If it’s necessary. I’m not a fan of needles, but… I understand you’re the doctor. If it will help me get back to work, then yes, go ahead. But… can we do it quickly? And gently? And… don't poke around too much? I really don’t like needles. I apologize for being… difficult. I just… I’m not good with medical things. But if it means I can keep the patrons happy, and the theater running smoothly… then yes, do the blood work. Just… be quick. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. I completely understand. We'll get it done as quickly and gently as possible. Our phlebotomist is very experienced and will do their best to make you comfortable. The blood work will involve a simple draw to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and complete blood count. We'll also check your blood sugar levels. Once the results are back, we'll review them together and discuss a plan. In the meantime, I recommend staying active, maintaining a healthy diet, and managing any stress you may be experiencing. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, not really. I mean, I appreciate you taking the time to do all of this. And I understand what you said about staying active and eating healthy. My wife used to tell me the same thing. She was a very sensible woman. I guess… how long will the results take? I need to know if I’m going to be able to get back to work on time. The theater… they’re counting on me. And… is there anything I need to do before the blood work? Do I need to fast? Or avoid anything? I don’t want to mess up the results. I just want to get this over with and get back to my life. I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… the theater needs me.
DOCTOR: You’re not anxious at all, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned, and I appreciate your honesty. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I will call you as soon as they are available. And yes, you do need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. We want to make sure the results are as accurate as possible. Here’s the lab order and a sheet with the fasting instructions. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh. 12 hours… that’s… a long time. I suppose I can manage. I'll have to skip breakfast and dinner. And no sugary drinks. Just water. It’s a small price to pay, I suppose. And no, I don’t have any trouble getting to the lab. It’s not far from the theater, actually. I can walk there easily. I try to walk as much as possible, it’s good for me. Is there anything else I need to know? Do I need to bring anything with me? Or… should I wear anything special? I just want to make sure I do everything right. I don’t want to mess up the results. The theater… they’re relying on me. I apologize for repeating myself. I just… I’m a bit stressed. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I should probably go and prepare for my 12-hour fast. It’s going to be a long night. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. No need to apologize at all. Just bring your insurance card, if you have one, and perhaps a book to read while you wait. And please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, and we'll talk soon. .
