DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise, and yet… here we are. I’d like to get to the bottom of it, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Selbitschka. Weight fluctuations can certainly be unsettling. It’s good you're addressing it. Let's try to get some more information. Now, when did you first notice this weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began, I believe, around… March, perhaps? It was very gradual at first, just a feeling that my clothes were a little tighter. But over the last few months, it’s become quite noticeable. I weigh myself every week, you see, and the numbers… well, they’ve been steadily climbing. It’s approximately ten pounds, I would estimate. Perhaps a little more.
DOCTOR: Approximately ten pounds since March… alright. And has anything else changed in your life during that time, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: No, not really. My husband, Darius, and I have kept to our usual routine. I work as an orderly at the hospital—same shifts, same tasks. We haven't had any… major life events, if you understand. No new stresses or anything of that nature. We did visit my sister in Vilnius for a week in May, but that was a relaxing trip, not particularly strenuous. I truly can’t pinpoint anything. That's what's so worrying.
DOCTOR: I see. It's helpful to rule things out. Now, could you describe your typical diet for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, Darius does most of the cooking, thankfully. He’s quite good. We eat a lot of potatoes, of course—it is Lithuanian cuisine. We have meat, usually pork or chicken, several times a week. Lots of beets and cabbage, especially in the winter. We enjoy soups—borscht is a favourite. I have a small sweet treat with my tea in the afternoon, usually a cookie or a piece of fruit. Nothing excessive, I assure you. We try to eat healthily. I suppose portion sizes might be… generous, but that’s just how we’ve always eaten.
DOCTOR: Potatoes, meat, beets… that’s helpful. And what about beverages?
PATIENT: Mostly tea. Black tea, usually. Sometimes I’ll have a small glass of juice with dinner, but not every day. And water, of course. I try to drink enough water. Darius sometimes has a beer with his dinner, but I rarely drink alcohol. I had a small glass of wine at my sister’s birthday in July, but that was a special occasion. Nothing regular, I promise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any other symptoms alongside this weight gain, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really. I haven’t been feeling unwell, exactly. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to work. And my joints ache a bit sometimes, but that’s just age, I suppose. I haven’t noticed any swelling, or changes in my skin, or anything like that. Just the weight. It’s… perplexing. I am normally very regular, if you understand what I mean, and that hasn't changed. I don't have any trouble sleeping, either.
DOCTOR: No swelling, normal bowel habits, no sleep disturbances… alright. Have you experienced any changes in your menstrual cycle, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness, no. I… I haven’t had a menstrual cycle in quite some time. I am well past that stage of life, Doctor. I’m 41, and… well, it’s been several years now. I apologize for not mentioning that sooner. It simply didn't occur to me. I suppose I was focusing on the weight gain itself.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Selbitschka, that’s perfectly alright. It’s important information, and it’s easy to overlook things. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was many years ago. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious. I don’t take any medications regularly. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it came down with diet and exercise, and my doctor said I didn't need pills. Just to watch my salt intake, you see. I don't have any allergies that I know of. Nothing significant, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my father had heart trouble, unfortunately. He passed away when he was 68. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. She's very active, always walking and gardening. No history of diabetes or cancer on either side of the family, as far as I am aware. It's a rather… unremarkable family history, really. Nothing that would explain this weight gain, I shouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. Just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Also, I’d like to feel your thyroid gland. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your expertise. I am a little concerned, naturally, but I'm glad we're taking steps to investigate. I've never had my thyroid checked before, but I understand it can sometimes cause weight gain, so it makes sense. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll be right back with my stethoscope. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, Ms. Selbitschka. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to feel your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but I don’t feel any nodules. It’s possible this is contributing to your weight gain. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Let me quickly check your abdomen and extremities for any swelling. Abdomen is normal. No swelling in your extremities. Everything appears normal, aside from your slightly elevated blood pressure and the mild thyroid enlargement. I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests, including a thyroid panel and a complete metabolic panel. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood tests seem like the logical next step. I am relieved that you are being thorough. If you think it’s necessary, please, proceed. The thyroid panel sounds particularly important, given what you’ve found. I trust your judgement entirely. And yes, please do monitor my blood pressure as well. It’s never been this high before, so it’s concerning. Perhaps I've been too stressed lately, even though I don't feel particularly stressed. I want to understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm ordering those tests now. The lab will draw blood, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle modifications to help manage your blood pressure. Reducing salt intake, regular exercise, and stress management techniques can all be beneficial. Now, given your weight gain and slightly enlarged thyroid, I’m going to recommend a consultation with an endocrinologist. They specialize in hormone imbalances and can provide a more in-depth assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wise, Doctor. An endocrinologist, certainly. I haven't seen one before, but if you recommend it, I trust your expertise. I would like to rule out any hormone imbalances, naturally. And yes, I agree about the lifestyle modifications. I will try to reduce my salt intake—Darius does enjoy his cured meats, so that might be a challenge! And I will attempt to be more mindful of stress—although, as I said, I don't feel particularly stressed. It’s just… life, I suppose. I am grateful for your thoroughness, Doctor. What is the best way to schedule the consultation with the endocrinologist?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will write a referral for you, and my nurse will schedule the appointment for you before you leave. It may take a week or two to get an appointment, so please be patient. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a handout with information on managing high blood pressure and reducing salt intake. I would also recommend keeping a food diary for a week to help identify potential sources of excess salt. Once we have the results of your blood tests, we can discuss the next steps in more detail. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you very much for your time and your thoroughness. I feel much better having discussed this with you, and I am grateful for the referral to the endocrinologist. I will certainly keep a food diary—Darius might protest, but it’s for the best. And I will try to be more mindful of stress. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose I'll wait for the nurse to schedule the appointment. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm glad I could help. For the blood tests, you don’t need to do anything special. Just avoid eating or drinking anything besides water for 8-12 hours beforehand. The nurse will give you a slip with instructions. I’ll also have the nurse print out a copy of your lab results for you once they’re available. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with the endocrinologist. I’m glad we’re getting this addressed, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is all. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I truly appreciate it. I will wait for the nurse, and I will be sure to follow the instructions for the blood tests. I feel much more at ease now, knowing that we are taking steps to investigate this. I wish you a pleasant day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you a pleasant day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. My nurse will be with you shortly. .
