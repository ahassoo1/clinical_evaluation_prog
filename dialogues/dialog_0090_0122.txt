DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing things. Little things, mostly. I forget where I put my keys, or what I was saying mid-sentence. It is…troubling. My blood pressure has been high for some time, and I worry it is connected.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. “Little things,” you say. And how long have these… “little things” been occurring?
PATIENT: Approximately…six months, Doctor. Perhaps a little longer. It started slowly, and I dismissed it as simply being busy, or tired. But it is becoming more frequent now. I can recall everything else perfectly – dates, names, events – but these small, recent things…they slip away. It is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you mentioned high blood pressure. Are you currently taking anything for that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take a pill…Lisinopril, I believe it is called. Every morning. But it does not seem to be helping much, honestly. My husband…he handled all the details of my medication. Since he passed, I just continue what was prescribed. I do not know the dosage, I am afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. Lisinopril. It's…unfortunate your husband isn’t here to provide those details. It's important to know the dosage, of course. We'll need to get that sorted. And you said this memory issue is what’s brought you in today, alongside the blood pressure. Are these memory lapses interfering with your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, they are. I manage several properties, you see. Real estate. And community associations. It requires a great deal of organization. I have started to double-check everything constantly – appointments, payments, even who has given me which key. It is…exhausting. And embarrassing. I fear I am not as efficient as I once was. It is causing me…anxiety.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Anxiety is certainly understandable. And managing properties…that does require a sharp mind. Let's do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Nothing to be alarmed about, just a standard procedure. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I understand. I will try my best. Please, proceed. I hope it is not too…involved. I am not very good with tests. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Just follow the pen. Good. Now look straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands when I touch them. Strength appears normal bilaterally. And finally, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… It is…August 2nd. 2025, yes. Though…it took me a moment. I usually know these things immediately. It is…worrying, Doctor. Very worrying.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. It's good you are aware of these difficulties. And yes, that slight hesitation is noted. Now, let’s review your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I have always been quite healthy, truthfully. A little arthritis in my knees, perhaps, but nothing serious. My husband…he was the one who dealt with all the doctor’s appointments and records. I simply followed his instructions. I feel very lost without him. It is difficult to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no other diagnosed conditions. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes. Many years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. Perhaps… twenty years ago? It was a routine procedure. Everything went well, as far as I recall. And… I believe I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was younger. But that was a very long time ago. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal and wisdom teeth extraction. Noted. Now, family history. Is there anyone in your family with a history of dementia or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she became very forgetful in her later years. She lived in Russia, and we did not have much contact. My aunt, on my father’s side… she also suffered from memory problems. But it was never… diagnosed, as far as I know. It was simply… “old age.” We did not talk about such things. It was…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Right. Now, lastly, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have never had a reaction to any medication. Again… my husband always handled those details. He was very careful. I simply took what he gave me. I feel very helpless without him. I apologize for not being more helpful. I should know these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Alvara, based on what you’ve told me, and the quick neurological exam, it could be early cognitive decline, potentially related to your blood pressure or family history. However, it’s far too early to make any definitive diagnosis. We need some further testing to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a full blood panel, including a thyroid check, and a vitamin B12 level. We also need to get your blood pressure under better control. I'm also going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. Do you understand?
PATIENT: MRI? An MRI… is that… necessary, Doctor? It sounds… serious. And expensive. I am… not insured. My husband… he had insurance. I am not sure how I will pay for all of this. And the tests… and the blood pressure medication… I simply wanted to know why I am forgetting things. I did not expect all of this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, I understand your concerns about the cost. However, we need to rule out any serious underlying causes for your memory loss. An MRI is the best way to do that. As for the cost, we can discuss payment options with the hospital billing department. Regarding your blood pressure, uncontrolled hypertension can certainly contribute to cognitive decline, so getting that under control is crucial. I will write you a prescription for Amlodipine, which is a different medication than what you were previously taking. We will monitor your blood pressure closely. Here are the orders for the blood work and the MRI. The lab is located just down the hall. I've also included a referral to a neurologist. They will be able to interpret the MRI results and provide a more comprehensive evaluation. I suggest you schedule the neurology appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions…? So many tests… and a neurologist… and a new medication… It is… a great deal to take in, Doctor. I… I suppose I will schedule the tests. But I am very worried about the cost. And… what if they find something… serious? I simply wanted to know why I forget things. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, worrying won't change anything. The sooner we have answers, the sooner we can address the problem. As I said, we will work with the billing department to explore payment options. Schedule the tests, keep me updated, and follow up with the neurologist as soon as possible. If you experience any sudden changes in your condition—severe headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
