DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. As the papers say, I am here to be cleared for a stay at the Willow Creek Senior Living Facility. A nice place, from what I understand. I believe they require a doctor's approval before I can move in, and I am happy to comply with whatever you need from me.
DOCTOR: "Compliance" is good, Mr. Tkac. Very good. Willow Creek, yes. Standard procedure. We need to ensure you are…suitable for that type of environment. Now, let's start with the basics. Do you have any significant medical problems – anything that requires regular treatment, or has required hospitalization in the last year?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question, Doctor. Let me see… hospitalization in the last year, no. Nothing of that sort. Regular treatment… well, my knees aren't what they used to be, and the baker’s life wasn't kind to my back. I see Old Man Hemlock, the chiropractor, every other week to keep things moving, you might say. Beyond that… no, nothing that keeps me from my work, thankfully. I still bake every day. Bread mostly, but pies when the berries are good.
DOCTOR: A chiropractor. Right. And you’re still… actively baking?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, still baking. Every day. It keeps me busy, keeps my mind sharp. And people enjoy the bread, you know? I run a small stand out front of my place. Nothing fancy, just good, honest bread. Whole wheat, sourdough…the usual. I’ve been baking since I was a boy, learned from my grandmother. It’s… important to me, you see?
DOCTOR: Very well. While I appreciate a strong work ethic, Mr. Tkac, we need to focus on your medical condition. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, of course, Doctor. You are right to steer me back to that. My apologies for rambling on about the bread. No, I don't take any medications regularly. Old Man Hemlock gave me some liniment for the knees a few months back, but that was a one-time thing. And sometimes a little something for the aches after a long day, if they bother me particularly. But nothing prescribed, if that’s what you mean. Just what I pick up at the general store. Perhaps a little willow bark tea now and then, for the aches. My grandmother taught me that, too.
DOCTOR: Willow bark tea… Right. And this "something" you pick up at the general store – can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… well, it’s a salve, Doctor. A liniment, really. Mrs. Abernathy makes it. She has a little herb garden and sells it at the store. For the joints, you know? It has menthol in it, I believe. And some other herbs… I'm not very good with names. It smells pleasant enough. She says it's good for arthritis, though I've never been officially told I have that. It just helps with the stiffness. It's a small town, Doctor. We rely on each other for these things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, insects, anything at all?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, more or less, and never had a reaction. Bees have stung me a few times, working in the garden, but no worse than a little swelling. And I have never had any trouble with medications, as I don't take any. Come to think of it… my mother always said I had a strong stomach. I suppose that has served me well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Tkac. Please have a seat and try to relax.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you require. I am happy to comply. I always did like a thorough examination. Best to be sure, you see.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but within acceptable limits for your age. Lungs are clear, although there's some diminished breath sound at the bases. Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 90. Not ideal. Now, reflexes… Reflexes are normal, though slightly diminished. Strength is adequate in all extremities. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No swelling, Doctor. Not usually. Sometimes, after a particularly long day on my feet, they might feel a bit tired, but nothing noticeable. And I try to keep my feet up when I can. Old Man Hemlock says it helps. He’s a font of wisdom, that man. I do have some… veins that are rather prominent, if that’s what you mean. A family trait, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see them. Alright, Mr. Tkac. I've reviewed your chart and completed the physical exam. Given your elevated blood pressure, some diminished lung sounds, and your age, I recommend a few tests before clearing you for Willow Creek. I want to rule out any underlying heart or lung issues. An EKG, a chest X-ray, and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also need a complete blood count. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we can schedule the X-ray for tomorrow. This is standard precaution, Mr. Tkac. No need to be alarmed.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Prudence is always a good thing. I am happy to undergo whatever tests you deem necessary. I would like to be as prepared as possible, naturally. And I understand no need for alarm, as you say. Will these tests take long? I have some bread to finish baking this afternoon.
DOCTOR: The blood work will only take a few minutes. The X-ray should be about fifteen. The results will take a couple of days to come back. The nurse will explain everything. Don’t worry about the bread, Mr. Tkac. Your health is more important. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will see to the tests then. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness. .
