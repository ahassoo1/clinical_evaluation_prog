DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see you're here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s rather… distressing, honestly. I seem to be losing my… faculties. My vision, and my hearing. It came on quite suddenly, you see. I haven't the time for this, truthfully. I have patients of my own waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Julie, and I appreciate you taking the time to come in despite your busy schedule. Sudden changes in vision and hearing can certainly be distressing. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when these changes started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I’m terrible with dates. It was… sometime last week, I believe. Perhaps the beginning of the week? It’s all rather blurred, you see. I just noticed things weren't… clear. And people seemed to be mumbling. Honestly, it's most inconvenient. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult to pinpoint exact dates, Ms. Julie. “Last week” gives me a general timeframe to work with. And I'll do my best to be efficient. Could you describe the changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Describe…? Well, everything is… hazy. Not a complete blackout, you understand. More like looking through a dirty window. And there are… spots. Flitting about. It’s terribly distracting when I’m trying to examine a child, I assure you. Though, I suppose you wouldn't understand the pressure.
DOCTOR: I can appreciate that even slight changes in vision can be disruptive to your work, Ms. Julie. “Hazy” and “spots” are helpful. Are these spots constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They… come and go. Mostly, they’re there when I’m concentrating. Or when I’m tired, I suppose. Though, I rarely am tired. I have a great deal on my plate, you see. It’s probably just stress. Though, a good surgeon doesn't have time for stress, does she? Honestly, I expect a simple explanation. Something quickly remedied.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick resolution, Ms. Julie. While stress can certainly contribute to vision changes, we need to rule out other possibilities to ensure we're addressing the correct cause. And it’s good you mentioned they are associated with concentration. Now, regarding your hearing—you mentioned people seemed to be mumbling. Is this in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Though I can’t say for certain. Really, I don’t pay much attention to such trivialities. If someone mumbles, they simply need to speak louder! It's common courtesy, isn’t it? Honestly, I’m surrounded by incompetence half the time. Is this a standard procedure to interrogate one’s patients? It feels rather… belittling.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Julie. I assure you, I'm only trying to gather enough information to understand what’s going on and provide the best possible care. Since the hearing difficulty is in both ears, is it a gradual decrease in hearing, or did it seem to come on suddenly, like the vision changes?
PATIENT: Suddenly, I suppose. Like everything else. Honestly, it’s all rather a blur. One day everything is perfectly… acceptable, and the next it isn’t. I haven't the patience for detailed recollections. I simply noticed I was straining to hear conversations. It’s terribly inconvenient when I’m dictating notes. Can we please move along? I have a very full schedule, you understand. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. Alright, let’s shift gears. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, including a neurological assessment, and check your ears, eyes, and vital signs. This will help me narrow down the possibilities. Would that be acceptable?
