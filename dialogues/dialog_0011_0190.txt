DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling… unsteady. Like I might fall, you see. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s quite concerning. I don't recall when it started exactly, only that it's been bothering me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling unsteady is certainly concerning. It's good you came in to have it checked. When you say “unsteady,” can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not dizziness, exactly. Not like the room is spinning. More like… my feet aren’t quite under me. Like they aren’t connecting properly with the ground, if that makes sense? Sometimes it’s worse when I walk, and other times it’s just a general feeling of… precariousness. It’s hard to describe. And honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so recalling specific instances is… difficult.
DOCTOR: That's a helpful distinction – not dizziness, but a feeling of your feet not being firmly planted. And I appreciate your honesty regarding your memory; we can work around that. So, this feeling of precariousness… does it happen constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Definitely not constant. There are days where I feel quite alright, almost normal. But then… without warning, it will just… start. And it can last for a few hours, or just a few minutes. It’s rather unpredictable. I… I wish I could tell you what makes it worse, or better, but I haven't noticed any particular triggers. It just… happens. Is that… helpful? I feel rather foolish trying to explain something I can’t quite grasp myself.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Lilyanna, and you're not foolish at all. It's common for these things to be difficult to pinpoint. The intermittent nature is important information. Now, let's try to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this feeling – perhaps any weakness, numbness, vision changes, headaches, or difficulty with coordination?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Weakness… not that I’ve noticed, no. Numbness either. My vision… occasionally a little blurry, but I wear glasses, and I assumed that was just the prescription needing adjusting. Headaches… sometimes, yes, but I get those quite frequently, and they aren’t necessarily connected to the unsteadiness. Coordination… now that… I suppose I have been dropping things more often lately. Small things, like my pen, or a cup. But I attributed that to being tired, honestly. It's difficult to say what is connected and what isn’t. Everything feels… a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: I see. Dropping things more frequently is worth noting. Okay, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me see… I… I was married, you see. My husband, Samuel, he took care of most of the medical things. He was very organized. I… I remember being treated for high blood pressure a few years ago, but it was managed with medication. And… I had a rather bad fall about five years ago, broke my wrist. I received treatment for that, of course. Beyond that… my memory is quite hazy. I apologize. It’s… frustrating. Samuel always said I wasn’t very good at remembering doctors’ appointments, let alone medical details.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. Don’t apologize; we'll do our best to piece things together. High blood pressure, and a wrist fracture five years ago – that’s helpful. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or for any other condition?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take… let me see if I can recall the name. It’s a small, white pill… Ah! Lisinopril, yes. Twenty milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but only as needed. Nothing else, I believe. Samuel… he handled the refills, and I just… took the pills he gave me. I feel rather helpless saying this. I wasn’t very involved in my own healthcare, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: You're not helpless at all, Lilyanna. It's good you're taking Lisinopril, and it's very common for one person to manage the details in a relationship. Knowing you're on Lisinopril is important. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Samuel always asked me before giving me any new medication, and I never experienced any itching, swelling, or anything like that. I… I suppose it's possible, but I can't recall any instances. I’ve always been rather fortunate, in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, briefly, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… a bit difficult. My parents passed away when I was quite young. I didn’t know them very well. Samuel’s family… they were quite healthy, as far as I know. His mother lived to be eighty-five, and his father… well, he had some heart trouble later in life, but it wasn’t anything particularly serious, as far as I recall. He managed it with medication, much like myself. I… I don’t believe there was any history of neurological conditions or anything like that. I apologize for being so vague. It’s… a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lilyanna. You've provided what you can recall, and that's perfectly sufficient. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That would be… quite alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m… eager to find out what’s causing this. I just want to feel steady again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’d like to assess your balance and coordination, and perform a neurological exam. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly agreeable. Please, proceed as you see fit. I will… try my best to cooperate. I confess, I’m a little nervous, but I trust you will be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your balance. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here I am. Please, let me know if I need to… readjust. I’m a little unsteady, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Okay, just stand here for a moment. I’m just observing your balance. I notice a slight sway, but nothing immediately alarming. Now, could you close your eyes and stand like this for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Thirty seconds… is it up yet? I… I feel rather vulnerable with my eyes closed.
DOCTOR: Okay, you can open your eyes now. And there we go. I noticed some increased sway with your eyes closed, which is not uncommon. Now, let's check your coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is this… alright? I’m trying my best to follow it.
DOCTOR: That's good, Lilyanna. No jerky movements. Now, let's do a quick heel-to-shin test. Could you sit on the edge of the examination table and place one heel on your shin and slide it down?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. It’s… a little difficult. Is this alright? I’m not very good at this, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. It's alright, this can be challenging. I notice some mild incoordination with the heel-to-shin test on both sides. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap your knees with this little hammer. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal.
PATIENT: Alright. That… was a little startling. But I suppose it wasn't too bad. Is everything… alright? What does all of this mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is alright, Lilyanna. I just needed to get a baseline assessment. Based on the physical exam, I’m noticing some mild incoordination and a slight sway, but your reflexes are normal. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Given your symptoms – the feeling of unsteadiness, intermittent nature, and the mild incoordination – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to a mild inner ear issue, a neurological condition, or even a side effect of medication. To rule out some of the more serious possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I'd also like to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Finally, I think it would be beneficial to get a referral to an audiologist to evaluate your inner ear function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot. But… if it will help determine what’s going on, I suppose it’s necessary. Blood work, an MRI, and a visit to an audiologist. Is the MRI… painful? And will the blood work take long? I… I’m not very good with needles, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilyanna. The MRI is not painful at all. You'll simply lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will take about 30-45 minutes. It can be a little noisy, but we’ll provide you with earplugs. You can even listen to music if you’d like. As for the blood work, it will only take a few minutes. You’ll simply have a small amount of blood drawn from your arm. I know you’re not comfortable with needles, so I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle and efficient. I’m going to order these tests right away, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a highly-rated audiologist in the area. In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid any strenuous activities and be careful with your balance. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe dizziness, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. No strenuous activity, be careful with my balance, and go to the emergency room if things worsen. The MRI shouldn't be painful, and the blood work will be quick. And… when will I get the results? How long will it take to know what’s going on? I… I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your eagerness to find answers, Lilyanna. The lab results should be back within a few days, usually within 3-5 business days. The MRI results may take a bit longer, perhaps a week or so, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will personally contact you as soon as I have all the results, and we can discuss them in detail. We'll then formulate a plan based on the findings. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. Here is the lab order and the referral to the audiologist. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously. Thank you. I think I’ll… head home now. I’ll schedule the blood work and the audiologist appointment as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please do, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Take care, Lilyanna, and remember to be careful. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you for your help. .
