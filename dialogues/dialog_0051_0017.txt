DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well… I am here for… a thing. A check-up. For the… team. A sports thing. I think. It was… arranged.
DOCTOR: Alright, a check-up for the team… arranged, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, arranged. By… the man. He said I needed this paper. For… trying out. For the… baseball. I used to… play. A long time ago. It's… important, I guess. Something about… being healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like this is a pre-participation physical exam, to make sure you're healthy enough to try out for the baseball team. That's good! We want to make sure you're safe and in good shape. It's perfectly normal to feel a little unsure about the details. Let's start with some basic questions. Do you mind if I ask about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… Well, I am… mostly okay. I get… tired sometimes. And my knees… they aren’t what they used to be. But who does, eh? Is that what you mean by general?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Tiredness and knee pain are good things to know. How long have you been feeling tired, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Oh… a while. A long while. Not always, you understand. Just… when I do things. When I… move around. It’s hard to say. Years, maybe? Everything feels like years these days. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Bartok, and I appreciate you telling me. Even a vague idea of how long something has been going on helps. “Years” gives us a starting point. You mentioned it's related to activity. Can you describe what activities make you feel tired?
PATIENT: Well… walking. Especially uphill. And… lifting things. My job, you see? Construction. It's not… easy anymore. Used to be, I could work all day. Now… now I need to sit down more. And baseball. Even just thinking about baseball makes me tired. Funny, that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue with walking, lifting, and even thinking about baseball. That’s helpful. Are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like… being sick? No, not sick. I don't… cough much. Sometimes my knees… ache. Especially when it rains. And… my back. My back is always a little… off. Is that what you mean by symptoms? There aren't many, really. I'm an old man, eh? Things break.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily “breaking,” Mr. Bartok. It’s good you’re telling me about the knee and back pain. Especially the aching with the rain—that can tell us something. Let's talk about your back. Where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Right… here. Lower back. It’s… all over, really. But mostly… here. It’s a dull ache. Not sharp. Just… there. Always there. Some days it’s worse than others. Like… when I bend over. Or lift things. And sometimes… it goes down my leg. A little. Not all the way, thankfully. Just… a little tingle. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A dull ache in the lower back with tingling down the leg. Does that tingling go all the way down to your foot, or is it just in the leg?
PATIENT: Just the leg. Mostly the calf. Sometimes… a little in the foot. But not much. It’s not… a bad tingle. Just… there. Like pins and needles. Not all the time. Only when I… strain myself. Or… when it’s cold. And wet. Like today, almost. It’s nothing much, really. Old age, I tell you. Everything hurts a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… Let me see. The doctor… a long time ago… told me my blood pressure was a little high. They gave me… pills. I took them for a while. But I stopped. Didn't like taking pills. Other than that… no. Nothing much. I’ve broken a few bones over the years, working construction. But they healed. No arthritis, no… dia-bee-tees? Is that what you said? No. Just old age and broken bones.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Yes! When I was young… I broke my arm. They fixed it. Put it in a cast. That was a surgery, I think. And… years later… I had my appendix out. That was… unpleasant. Other than that… no. No surgeries that I can remember. Small things. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… that's a hard one. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. She wasn’t very healthy. My father… he worked hard his whole life. He had… bad knees. Like me. My sister… she had something with her… stomach. Not a good thing. But other than that… not really. We didn't talk about health much. Too busy working. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never smoked a day in my life. Bad for you, you see. Alcohol… sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe. On a Saturday. Nothing much. Recreational… what? No. I don't… do those things. I'm a working man, you see. Don't have time for that nonsense. Is that what you're asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I was asking. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a long time ago, like I said. Vitamins… sometimes. My daughter sends me those chewable ones. But I forget to take them, to be honest. Supplements… no. Nothing much. Just the chewables, when I remember. Is this important? It feels like a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Bartok, and I appreciate you telling me. It helps me get a complete picture. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem. Sometimes my skin gets… itchy. But that's just the heat, you see. No, no allergies. Nothing much. Just… itchy skin sometimes. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Almost, Mr. Bartok. Just a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees and back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. My back… it gets stiff when I sit for too long. But yes, alright. Go ahead. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: There. Be gentle, eh? It’s a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 92. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: There. Be careful. They aren’t what they used to be. Feel free to… poke around, I guess. But gently. It’s going to crack. I promise. It always cracks.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some crepitus and mild tenderness in both knees. Range of motion is a little limited. Now, let’s take a look at your back. Could you bend forward for me, and then backward?
PATIENT: There. That’s… unpleasant. It feels like something is going to snap. It always does that. It’s stiff. Really stiff. Like an old tree. So? What’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you have some mild osteoarthritis in both knees, likely contributing to the crepitus and limited range of motion. Your lower back is showing signs of muscle spasm and some tenderness, possibly due to strain. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. It’s also important to note your fatigue, which could be related to several factors, including age, activity level, and potentially underlying medical conditions. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I recommend the following. First, we need to get some blood work to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and to assess your overall health. I also want to order X-rays of your knees and lower back to get a better look at the joints and spine. In the meantime, I recommend gentle exercise, such as walking or swimming, to help strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage the pain. We can also discuss physical therapy if you're interested. I’m also going to recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and X-rays and to formulate a more comprehensive treatment plan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? That sounds… complicated. And expensive. Exercise… I used to exercise. But now… it hurts too much. Ibuprofen… my daughter sends me those chewable vitamins. Are those the same thing? Two weeks? That's a long time. What about the baseball tryouts? I need to know if I can… participate. Is that even possible? All this… it's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bartok. It does sound like a lot, but we’re going to take it one step at a time. The blood work and X-rays will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of treatment. The chewable vitamins are good for overall health, but they're not the same as ibuprofen, which is a pain reliever. Ibuprofen will help manage the pain, but it doesn't address the underlying cause of the problem. As for the baseball tryouts, I recommend holding off on participating until we have the results of the blood work and X-rays. It's important to make sure you're healthy enough to participate without risking injury. I can write you a referral for the blood work and X-rays. The lab and imaging center should be able to work with your insurance. If you are concerned about costs, we can discuss options for financial assistance. In the meantime, I recommend resting, applying ice to your knees and back, and avoiding activities that aggravate your pain. I will also provide a note for your team explaining that you are undergoing medical evaluation. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: I suppose so. Rest… that I can do. Ice… my daughter keeps telling me to use ice. She’s always right. A note for the team… that’s good. They won’t let me play if I can't show them something. Blood work and X-rays… okay. And the note. And rest. And ice. It’s just… a lot. Will I ever be able to play baseball again? That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable question, Mr. Bartok. It's hard to say definitively right now whether you'll be able to play baseball again without knowing the results of the blood work and X-rays. However, we're going to do everything we can to help you get back to doing what you love. If the blood work reveals any underlying medical conditions, we'll address those first. If the X-rays show significant arthritis, we'll discuss options for managing the pain and improving your range of motion. These may include physical therapy, injections, or other treatments. Even if you can't play baseball at the same level as before, there are other ways to stay active and enjoy the game. We can discuss options for modified activities or other forms of exercise. Let's focus on getting you evaluated and developing a treatment plan first. Once we have a better understanding of your condition, we can talk about your options for returning to baseball. I will write you a referral for the blood work and X-rays, and I will also provide a note for your team explaining that you are undergoing medical evaluation. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For listening. And for… trying. It’s a lot to take in. I’ll go get the blood work done. And I’ll… try to rest. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bartok. Remember, we're in this together. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this. And please, take it easy. Have a good day, Mr. Bartok. And take care. .
