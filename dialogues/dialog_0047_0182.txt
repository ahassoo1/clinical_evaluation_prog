DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly? It's about this… vanity project my daughter keeps pushing on me. Says I look “tired.” Tired! At my age, what does she expect? Anyway, she’s arranged this whole thing – a face lift. Needs some sort of… clearance, I understand. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: A cosmetic procedure, right. And your daughter initiated this?
PATIENT: Oh, she means well, I suppose. Though her ideas of what I need and what I want are usually miles apart. She's a good girl, just… overly concerned with appearances. And persistent. Very persistent. Look, are you going to poke and prod me, or what? I’d rather just tell you what she’s told me I need to answer and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, while I understand your… impatience, I do need to gather some information properly. It's not simply about fulfilling your daughter’s wishes; it’s about ensuring you’re a suitable candidate for surgery, and that you understand the risks involved. A face lift isn't without potential complications. Now, let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – heart problems, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go. Now you're going to ask me about my insides. Fine. No, nothing serious. A bit of arthritis, the usual aches and pains for a man my age. And my blood pressure’s been a little high sometimes, but nothing they haven’t given me a little pill for. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. Worked hard my whole life, laying terrazzo. It’s not a desk job, you know. I’m tougher than I look. Now, can we hurry this along? I have a luncheon planned with the old boys.
DOCTOR: Terrazzo, yes. Physically demanding work. And you mentioned a pill for your blood pressure. Do you know the name of it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, do you expect me to memorize the name of every little tablet they give me? My wife always handled that sort of thing. Now she’s… well, never mind. It’s a little white one, I think. Small. I take it every morning with my coffee. Is that good enough? Really, all this questioning feels unnecessary. I’m a healthy eighty-one-year-old man. Relatively.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, “a little white one” isn't sufficient information. It’s critical to know what medications you're taking, as some can interact negatively with anesthesia or increase the risk of complications during surgery. I understand your wife previously managed your medications, but it's my responsibility to have a complete and accurate record. Do you have any idea where we might find a list?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright, don’t get your knickers in a twist. I think she kept a list in the kitchen, in one of those… recipe boxes. Though my daughter's probably already gone through all that. She's very… organized. I wouldn’t know where to start looking myself, frankly. Ask her. Yes, just ask Bethany. She handles everything now. Honestly, this is all a bit much, isn't it? A face lift shouldn't require a full investigation.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I assure you, this is not about making things difficult. It is about patient safety. While Bethany may have a list, it's best if I confirm the details directly with you, if possible. Now, let's move on. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Too busy working. Couldn't afford to take time off. Had a bad knee for a while, but never bothered with surgery. Just toughed it out. Always have. Now, if you’re quite finished with the history lesson… are we any closer to getting this over with? I have a very important lunch.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t have allergies. I’ve eaten everything there is to eat. A bit of dust bothers me sometimes, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I worked with stone all my life, Doctor! A little dust comes with the territory. Look, I'm a hardy Norwegian. We don't fall apart at the first sign of a sniffle. Can we please get on with this? I’m starting to lose my appetite.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father would have had my hide! A strong drink with dinner now and then, perhaps. A wee bit of whiskey. But nothing excessive. A man needs something to warm him up in this weather, don't you think? Now, are you going to poke and prod me now, or are we just going to talk all day?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Let's proceed with a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the areas where the face lift would be performed. Please lie back.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But be gentle, Doctor. This old body isn’t what it used to be. And don’t take too long. My luncheon reservation…
DOCTOR: Heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not alarming given your age and reported activity. Now, let's take a look at the skin on your face. Skin has some loss of elasticity, as expected. Some wrinkles present. No obvious lesions or abnormalities noted.
PATIENT: Is this going to take much longer? It’s rather cold in here, you know. And frankly, poking and prodding isn’t exactly my idea of a good time. My daughter made it sound so simple. A little nip here, a little tuck there… Is everything alright? Do I have something wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I assure you, everything appears to be within normal limits for someone your age. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean you are an ideal candidate for a face lift. The procedure carries risks, and it’s my responsibility to ensure you understand those risks and that you are physically able to tolerate them. You mentioned your daughter made it sound simple. Cosmetic surgery is never simply a “nip and tuck.” Now, I need to gather a little more information before I can provide a recommendation. Do you have any history of skin cancer?
PATIENT: Skin cancer? Good heavens, no! I worked outdoors my entire life, but I always wore a hat. My wife insisted on it. She was a very sensible woman. Never let me go out in the sun without a good hat and a coat of sunscreen. She worried, you see. Always worrying. But no, no history of skin cancer. Just a few freckles, maybe. And a bit of sun damage, I suppose. But nothing serious. Now, can we be done soon? I really must get going. My friends will be expecting me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Before I can give you a definitive recommendation regarding the face lift, I'd like to order some basic blood work. It will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions that might increase your risk during surgery. I’ll also recommend a consultation with a dermatologist to thoroughly examine your skin for any signs of skin cancer that may not be immediately apparent. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests, of course. More tests. Honestly, Doctor, it's becoming a whole production. Fine, fine, do your tests. But I expect a quick turnaround. I don’t have all day to spend in waiting rooms. And I don't want any unnecessary poking and prodding, understand? Just the essentials. And please, tell your staff to be quick about it. I have a luncheon to attend. A very important luncheon. Can we get this paperwork done already?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I’ll have the paperwork prepared for you. It includes a list of the blood tests and instructions on scheduling an appointment with the dermatologist. I'll also have Bethany's contact information included, in case you need assistance with scheduling. While you're waiting for the results, I recommend you discuss the potential risks and benefits of the surgery with your daughter and the dermatologist. It’s important to be fully informed before making a decision. And, Mr. Orwin… please understand that I have your best interests at heart. Let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I’m sure Bethany will handle everything. She always does. I’ll… I’ll see what she says. Honestly, all this fuss over a little vanity project. Good day to you. And please, don’t bother calling me unless it's absolutely necessary.
