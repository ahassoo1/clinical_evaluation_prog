DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, yes, right. My ear… it feels full. Like it’s stuffed with something, you know? It’s been… a while now, I think. Honestly, the days sort of blend together. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A feeling of fullness in the ear that’s been going on for some time. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: First noticed… hmm. That’s a tricky one. Was it… after the… the incident? No, wait. Before, I think. Maybe spring? Or was it last year? I really can't be certain. It just sort of… gradually got worse, I suppose. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… there. A pressure.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it developed gradually, and you're having trouble pinpointing exactly when it started. That's perfectly alright. So, it’s a pressure sensation, no sharp pain?
PATIENT: That's right. No pain. It’s more like… when you go up in a plane, you know? That feeling in your ears? It's a bit like that, but it doesn't go away. And it’s mostly in my left ear, I think. Or is it the right? Oh dear… It's definitely an ear. Look, I'm sorry, this is probably very frustrating for you. I just… don’t have a very good memory these days.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal to have difficulty remembering details, especially with something that’s developed over time. We can work through this together. It sounds like the fullness is primarily in one ear – do you feel it's more consistently in your left or your right ear?
PATIENT: Left, I think. Yes, definitely the left. Though… sometimes it feels like it's switched sides. It’s very… unpredictable. And it doesn’t seem to be getting better, that’s for sure. Is there… something seriously wrong? I'd really just like to get it fixed, if that’s possible. I have… things to do, you know? Not that I can remember what they are, exactly… but still.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s primarily in your left ear, but occasionally you notice it on the right as well, and it’s not improving. I understand you’d like to find a solution to get this resolved. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I suppose… maybe a bit of ringing sometimes? Very faint, though. I mostly notice it when it’s very quiet. And… oh! I've been a little more tired than usual, but that could be anything, really. I lost my wife a few years back, you know… it’s hard to keep track of what’s normal and what isn’t anymore. I just want to be able to hear properly again. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It’s completely understandable that it’s difficult to distinguish what’s normal after such a loss. It's good you’re seeking help now. So, you’ve noticed some faint ringing in your ear, particularly in quiet environments, and you've been feeling more tired than usual. Have you experienced any dizziness, changes in your hearing, or any discharge from your ear?
PATIENT: No dizziness, thankfully. And no… nothing coming out of my ear. My hearing… well, it's just muffled, mostly. Like there’s something blocking it. People seem to be talking… further away, perhaps? Or maybe I’m just not paying attention. It’s hard to tell. I really don’t like the feeling of… blockage. It’s very unsettling. Can we… hurry this up a bit? I feel a bit… overwhelmed, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're feeling overwhelmed and would like to move things along, and you're experiencing muffled hearing. That’s perfectly alright. We will certainly try to be as efficient as possible. I see here you've had a few routine check-ups with Dr. Chen in the past. No major medical issues listed, and no allergies noted. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes. Just… a little something for my blood pressure. Dr. Chen prescribed it. A small white pill. I take it every morning, I think. Or maybe it’s the evening? Honestly, it all blurs together. I can't recall the name of it, though. I just… take the pill when I remember. It’s not… important, is it? I really just want to fix my ear.
DOCTOR: No, it is important. Knowing what medication you are taking is very helpful. We can look that up in your records. Okay, I see you're taking Lisinopril for hypertension. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that sounds right. Lisinopril. Yes. That's the one. Small white pill. I take it… with breakfast, I think? Oh dear, I feel like such a bother. I'm usually much more… organized. It’s just… everything feels so foggy these days. Can we please just get to the part where you look at my ear? I’d really appreciate it. I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: No, you aren’t a bother at all, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling details, and we are taking our time to understand what’s going on. Alright. Let’s take a look at your ears. I’m going to gently examine both ears with this instrument. It doesn’t hurt, but it might feel a little cool. Okay… I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – present in the ear canal. It appears to be somewhat impacted, meaning it’s built up. The tympanic membrane – that’s your eardrum – appears slightly dull and doesn't have its usual pearly gray appearance. Your right ear appears normal. The ear canal is clear, and the tympanic membrane looks healthy.
PATIENT: Cerumen… so that’s wax. The buildup… is that causing the problem? Is that why I can’t hear properly? And my eardrum… is it broken? Please tell me it's not broken. I'm not very good with… medical things. This is all very stressful. .
DOCTOR: Okay, cerumen is earwax. It’s normal to have some, but it sounds like you have a buildup in your left ear. It's unlikely your eardrum is broken, but the dull appearance could indicate some fluid behind it. Based on what I'm seeing, the most likely cause of your symptoms is cerumen impaction. The buildup is likely blocking your ear canal and preventing sound from traveling properly. The fluid could be contributing to the muffled hearing as well. We can try to remove the earwax first and see if that improves your hearing. Would you be comfortable with that?
