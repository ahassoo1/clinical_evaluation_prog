DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have time for pleasantries. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and my face feels... droopy, on that same side. It's quite alarming, really. And frankly, I expect a quick diagnosis.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I assure you I'll do my best to be efficient. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are concerning. To get a better understanding, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: This morning. I just told you. Around… 6:30, when I woke up. I was getting ready for my walk, and that’s when I noticed it. It wasn’t gradual, it was sudden. Honestly, it's rather inconvenient. Do you need me to repeat myself?
DOCTOR: Okay, 6:30 this morning. Sudden onset. I appreciate you clarifying. Just to be thorough, has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I've never had anything like this happen. And I have excellent health, generally. I walk five miles every morning, I eat very well... It's probably just a virus. Though, why it would cause facial weakness, I haven't the slightest idea. Are we getting somewhere, or are you just going to ask me a lot of questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. A previously healthy individual with sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness…we need to rule out some serious possibilities. Before we jump to conclusions about a virus, I'm going to need to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. It's standard procedure, Ms. Nissenbaum. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to talk about procedure. Fine. Let me think... No fever, no headache. No dizziness. Just the ear and the face. And frankly, a great deal of annoyance. I have appointments to keep, you know. Is this going to involve a long wait?
DOCTOR: No fever, no headache, no dizziness. Good. Any trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: No. My vision is perfectly fine, thank you. I had my eyes checked just six months ago. Everything is crystal clear. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite foolish sitting here describing perfectly normal functions to you. Is this going to lead to an actual examination, or just a long list of questions? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your frustration. However, these symptoms warrant a careful examination. We need to assess the facial nerve function and check your hearing. It will involve a brief neurological exam and an otoscopic exam of your ears. It shouldn't take long. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with, then. The sooner I know what's going on, the better. I suppose a "brief" exam is acceptable, but I expect a quick explanation afterwards. No jargon, please. I'm a radiologist, not an audiologist.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat. I’m going to start with your ears, then we’ll do a few quick tests to check the movement in your face. Can you tell me if you've experienced any pain in or around your ear?
PATIENT: No pain. Absolutely none. Just...weakness. It feels…strange. Honestly, it's quite unsettling. Are you going to shine a light in my ear now? Because I really don't have time for that sort of thing. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll take a quick look in your ears to rule out any obvious cause. It’s a standard part of the exam. Please sit still and keep your head steady. Hmm. The ear canal appears clear. No sign of infection or blockage. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes tightly and try to wrinkle your forehead. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough wrinkling? It's not exactly easy when half my face doesn't seem to be cooperating. Honestly, this is quite ridiculous. It's very obvious there's something wrong; I don't need a theatrical performance to prove it.
DOCTOR: I see. There’s definite weakness on the left side. Now, can you try to smile?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's… uneven, as you can see. Quite a disturbing sight, actually. Are we any closer to a diagnosis, or are we just documenting the obvious? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you try to puff out your cheeks?
PATIENT: Like this? It's rather difficult, honestly. The air just keeps leaking out on one side. Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather self-conscious. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nissenbaum. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, the most likely diagnosis at this point is Bell's Palsy. It's a condition where there's sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of the face, thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. It's not usually caused by anything serious, and most people recover fully within a few weeks to months, with or without treatment. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first.
PATIENT: Bell's Palsy? Just like that? Inflammation of a nerve? Honestly, that sounds rather…simplistic. I deal with complex imaging all day; I find it hard to believe it’s just a simple inflammation. And “most people recover”? What about the ones who don't? And what about treatment? You said "or without", but you haven't actually suggested anything. What do I do now? Just sit here and wait for my face to magically fix itself?
DOCTOR: You're right to be skeptical, and to ask those questions. It's important you understand everything. While Bell's Palsy is the most probable cause given your symptoms and the rapid onset, we do need to rule out other, rarer possibilities like a stroke or a tumor. To do that, I recommend an MRI of the brain. As for treatment, the standard approach is a course of corticosteroids, usually prednisone, to reduce the inflammation. It doesn’t guarantee a full recovery, but it can significantly improve your chances. We can also discuss eye drops to keep your eye lubricated, as you may not be able to blink properly on the affected side. I'm going to write you a referral for the MRI and a prescription for the steroids. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and monitor your progress. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI. Of course. Fine. Though honestly, I was hoping for a simpler solution. Steroids…those have unpleasant side effects, don’t they? And eye drops…this is becoming increasingly inconvenient. Very well. Write your referrals and prescriptions. But if this doesn’t improve quickly, I expect further investigation. I have a very demanding schedule, you see, and I don’t have time for a drawn-out illness. And please, no more vague assurances about “most people”. I want specifics. Can I at least get a referral to a neurologist as well, just to be safe?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns and the need for a quick resolution. I'm adding a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist specializing in facial nerve disorders. She can provide a more comprehensive assessment and discuss further options if needed. Here are the referral for the MRI and the neurologist, and the prescription for the prednisone. The prednisone is a five-day course, starting today. It's important to complete the full course, even if you start feeling better. As for the side effects, they are usually mild and temporary. Common side effects include increased appetite and some mood changes. If you experience any severe side effects, please contact me immediately. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the MRI results and monitor your progress. And, to be clear, we'll re-evaluate if there's no improvement within a couple of weeks. Is there anything else I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Very well. Hopefully, this resolves quickly. I suppose that’s all for now. Though frankly, I'm still skeptical. Just… ensure the MRI is expedited. And make a note in my chart about my preference for a detailed explanation of all results. I expect clarity, Dr. Vanochten, not vague generalities. I have appointments to keep. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’ve made a note of your preferences in your chart, and I’ll ensure the MRI is expedited. I’ll also personally review the results with you and provide a detailed explanation. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you a speedy recovery, and I’ll see you next week.
