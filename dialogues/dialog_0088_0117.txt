DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, just… a cough. Been coughin’ up some stuff. Not good stuff. Little bit of… red in it. I smoke, you know. Been a long time. Don’t really remember much else about it, honestly. Just want to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some red in the mucus. And you mentioned you smoke – for how long have you been smoking, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Geez. A long time. Since I was… young. Maybe forty years? Something like that. I don’t keep track of things like that anymore. It feels like forever.
DOCTOR: Forty years is… a significant amount. Alright. And has this cough been recent, or has it been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Ongoing. It comes and goes. Gets worse when… when it’s cold, I guess. Or dusty. Hard to say. It’s been… a while, like I said. Maybe a few months this time, getting bad? I forget. It just feels…old.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of worsening cough, especially with cold or dust exposure. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes. But I'm always a little tired. Getting old, you know? No fever, no chills, nothin' like that. Just… the cough. And the… stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or other symptoms besides the cough and mucus. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or wheezing with the cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… sometimes. When I walk up hills, maybe. Or… when I’m rushin' around. But I always figured that was just… being out of shape. Wheezing? I don’t know what that sounds like, exactly. Like a whistle? I might have heard something…
DOCTOR: Okay, some shortness of breath with exertion, and possibly some wheezing. Let’s do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and get a better idea of what’s going on. Could you please sit up straight on the exam table?
PATIENT: Sure. Exam table, right. Getting older ain’t easy. Just… hurry it up, if you don’t mind. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally for me. Deep breaths in and out… Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing on both sides, and some crackles as well, particularly in the lower lobes. Your breathing rate is a little elevated, but your oxygen saturation looks okay right now. I also want to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, pulse is normal. Do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? Not that I know of. Never been told. Doctors… I don’t see ‘em much. Just when somethin’ really bothers me. Like this cough. Used to be stronger, I guess. Now… not so much. Everything feels slow, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known heart problems. Given your smoking history, the cough with red mucus, the wheezing, and crackles I’m hearing, I’m concerned about a few possibilities, including bronchitis, pneumonia, or even something more serious like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – COPD. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. We'll also do a sputum test to look at the mucus you’re coughing up. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… sputum… More tests. Look, can’t you just give me somethin’ for the cough? I don't like bein’ poked and prodded. I got stuff to do. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Reyno. However, it’s important to get an accurate diagnosis so we can determine the best course of treatment. Simply giving you something for the cough without knowing the underlying cause could mask a more serious problem. The X-ray and sputum test will give us valuable information. The X-ray is quick and painless, and the sputum test just requires you to cough into a cup. It should only take about an hour or so to get the results, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, I can give you a temporary cough suppressant to help relieve some of your discomfort, but that won’t address the root cause. Would you like me to order the tests and get you that suppressant?
PATIENT: An hour, huh? Fine. Just… get it over with. And the suppressant. Yeah, get me somethin’ for the cough. Just… hurry. I really don't wanna be here all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll get the orders for the chest X-ray and sputum test sent to the radiology department. I’ll also have the nurse bring you a cough suppressant while we wait for the results. The radiology department is just down the hall – they’ll call us when they’re ready for you. I'll also have the nurse check your oxygen levels again before you go. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you feel worse while we're waiting. Is there anyone you'd like me to contact with these results?
PATIENT: No. Nobody. Just… get it done. And I really appreciate you tryin' to hurry things along. Honestly.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Reyno. I understand wanting to get this resolved quickly. The nurse should be in shortly with the cough suppressant. I'll review the results as soon as they become available and will let you know what we find.
PATIENT: .
