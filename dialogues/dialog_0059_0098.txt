DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Uh, well, I ain’t really sick sick. Just… curious, I guess. Heard good things about this place and figured I’d get a check-up. Haven't been to a doctor in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Demondre. Preventative care is excellent, and it’s good you’re taking this step. A general check-up is a great place to start. I see here you’re 25 years old. Just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Yeah, 25. Mostly healthy, I think. I work on boats, so I’m always movin’ around. Lots of liftin’ and… well, boat stuff. No big problems, really. Used to play some basketball, but not so much anymore. Divorced a couple years back… kinda threw things off, you know? But I’m doin’ okay now. I got Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It does matter, thank you for letting me know. And thank you for sharing that with me, Demondre. It sounds like you're quite active with your work, which is excellent. It's good to hear you’re doing okay now, too. To get a better understanding of your current health status, let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Nah, no fever or chills. And I ain’t lost any weight… maybe gained a little, if anything. Boat food ain’t always the healthiest, haha. No, everything's been pretty normal on that front. I sleep okay, eat okay… just regular stuff.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. How about any issues with your digestion – things like stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Nope. Digestion’s… normal. Sometimes a little heartburn, if I eat somethin’ spicy on the boat, but that's it. Not a big deal. Usually goes away with some water. I don't usually have trouble with any of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Good. Any problems with your breathing or chest?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I mean, I get outta breath sometimes when liftin' heavy stuff, but that's just bein' outta shape, I figure. No coughin' or wheezin’ or nothin’. I can walk around fine, climb stairs… regular stuff. Boat work keeps me movin', ya know? Ain’t no time to be short of breath.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Vision's okay, I think. I don’t wear glasses. And my hearin’s… alright. Gotta yell sometimes when the engines are loud on the boat, haha, but that’s not a problem with my hearin’, ya know? Everything seems normal there. Maybe a little trouble seein' real small print sometimes, but I just hold it closer.
DOCTOR: Understood. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been diagnosed with nothin’. I had the usual childhood stuff, ya know, chickenpox and stuff, but that’s it. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. Just bumps and bruises from workin’ on the boat. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I don’t take any regular medicine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Always been pretty careful, I guess. Or maybe just lucky. No cuts or nothin’ that needed stitchin’ up or anything. Just the usual scrapes and bruises, like I said. Boat work can be rough sometimes, but nothin' serious enough for a doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandma, on my mom’s side, had diabetes, I think. And my dad… he had high blood pressure when he got older. That’s about all I can think of. Nobody else really had anythin’ serious. They all lived pretty long lives, actually. Not much history of sickness in my family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Uh... I don't really go out much. Mostly just hang around with the guys from the boat. We don’t really do much, ya know? Just watch sports sometimes, play cards. I don’t smoke, and I don’t do any drugs. I drink sometimes, on the weekends… a couple beers with the guys. Nothin’ crazy. Used to go out more when I was married, but… not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Demondre. That gives me a good overview of your background. Now, to complete the picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… uncomfortable or somethin’. I ain’t afraid of needles, but… I ain't really a fan of ‘em either, haha. Just tell me what you’re doin’, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll explain everything as I go along. We'll start with your vital signs – checking your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and feel your abdomen. Okay, blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within a normal range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, also normal. Respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, which means I don't hear any wheezing or crackling. Ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Nasal passages are clear. Throat looks clear as well, no redness or swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly detected. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears normal at this time.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I mean, I feel normal, so… I guess that makes sense. So, what does all this mean? Is there somethin’ wrong? Or is everything just… okay? I ain’t lookin’ for trouble, ya know? Just wanted to get a check-up.
DOCTOR: That’s exactly what it means, Demondre. Everything appears to be okay. Your vital signs are within normal limits, and your physical exam was unremarkable. Based on your medical history and the exam, I don’t see any immediate concerns. However, as a preventative measure, I recommend we do some routine blood work. This will give us a baseline for your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. It’s just a standard part of a general check-up, especially as you haven’t been to the doctor in a while. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work’s fine. Better safe than sorry, right? I don’t mind a little poke if it means makin’ sure everything’s alright. When can we do it? And… will it cost a lot? I got Medicare, but… sometimes they don’t cover everything, ya know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, better safe than sorry is always a good approach. We can get the blood work done today at the lab just down the hall. They’ll send the results to me, and I’ll review them as soon as they’re available, usually within a few days. As for the cost, the majority of the tests we’re ordering should be covered by Medicare. There may be a small co-pay, depending on your specific plan, but it shouldn’t be substantial. I recommend you check with your Medicare provider directly to confirm your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. The lab staff can also assist you with billing questions. Here’s the lab order. They’ll need this when you check in. Do you have any questions about the blood work process or anything else before you head over?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers everything. Just gotta go to the lab, get poked, and wait for the results. Sounds easy enough. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really well, and you weren’t… judgy, ya know? Some doctors make you feel like you’re stupid for not knowin’ stuff. So, yeah, thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. My goal is to make you feel comfortable and informed. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all once you receive the results. We’ll discuss them in detail then. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
