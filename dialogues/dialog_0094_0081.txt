DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Ka Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well, I suppose. My name is Jailia Chakka, as you know. I am here because I have been… experiencing some rather bothersome weight loss, despite maintaining my usual diet. And, frankly, a rather debilitating fatigue. It's quite inconvenient, really. I also wake up drenched in sweat most nights, which is… unseemly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jailia. It sounds quite distressing to be experiencing weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats all at once. "Inconvenient" is one way to put it – it certainly sounds like something we need to investigate. Let's start with the weight loss. About how much weight have you lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Approximately… seven kilograms, I believe. It has been over the last three months. I weigh myself weekly, quite precisely, and have kept a record. It’s not a drastic loss per se, but it is… noticeable. And it's not as though I’ve been attempting to lose weight; quite the opposite, actually. I maintain a perfectly adequate caloric intake. It’s rather perplexing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Seven kilograms over three months is a significant amount of unintentional weight loss, you’re right to be concerned, and keeping that record is very helpful. So, to clarify, you haven't made any changes to your diet or exercise routine during this time?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. My routine is… structured. I have the same breakfast every morning – aloo paratha with yogurt. Lunch is typically dal bhat, and dinner is usually a vegetable curry with roti. I do not snack. And I take a brisk walk for thirty minutes each day, precisely. Any deviation from this schedule would be… inefficient. It’s quite baffling, really, that I am losing weight despite my diligence.
DOCTOR: That is quite a consistent routine, Jailia. Thank you for being so detailed. It’s helpful to have that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… acceptable. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have several commitments this afternoon. A graphic design project is due, and my husband is expecting me home to prepare dinner. Efficiency is paramount, as you can understand. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, then I’ll take your temperature and blood pressure. After that, I'll palpate your abdomen and check your lymph nodes. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take your blood pressure and temperature. Blood pressure is 118 over 76, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit – both within normal limits. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses. There’s no tenderness when I press. Finally, I’m going to check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes feel normal in size and consistency. Everything seems within normal limits physically, which is good. However, the unexplained weight loss and night sweats are concerning. Given your symptoms, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. These tests will check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and liver and kidney function. We might also want to check for inflammation markers and possibly run a tuberculosis screening, given the night sweats. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds rather extensive. Tuberculosis? That is… alarming. I assure you, I maintain impeccable hygiene. However, if it is necessary to rule out such a… dreadful disease, I suppose I have no objection. The other tests, checking my… functions, also seem reasonable, if you deem them pertinent. Please proceed with whatever is required, but I trust you will expedite the process. I have deadlines, you understand. And my husband… he is not a patient man.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to proceed. You are right to ask questions, and I want to assure you we are doing this to be thorough, not because we suspect anything specific. Tuberculosis is a possibility we need to rule out, but it’s not a definitive diagnosis. Okay, I'll order a complete blood count , comprehensive metabolic panel , thyroid stimulating hormone , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , C-reactive protein , and a tuberculosis screening – a Quantiferon-Gold test. We’ll also collect a urine sample to check for any signs of infection. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or worsening fatigue, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Two to three days? That is… a considerable delay. However, I understand the necessity of such procedures. No, I do not believe I have any further questions at this juncture. Please inform me of the cost of these… investigations beforehand. My husband manages our finances, and he prefers a detailed accounting. And perhaps you could provide a written list of instructions for the urine sample collection? I strive for precision in all my endeavors, and I would like to ensure I follow your directives to the letter.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me pull up the estimated costs for you. The CBC, CMP, TSH, ESR, CRP, and Quantiferon-Gold test will cost approximately $450. The urine sample collection itself is included in the routine lab fees. I can provide you with a detailed itemized bill for your husband. Here is the bill, and here are the detailed instructions for the urine sample collection. It's important to collect a "mid-stream" sample for the most accurate results. The instructions explain how to do that properly. Please let me know if anything is unclear. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are available, usually within 48 hours. If you don’t hear from us within that timeframe, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic to check on the status. Do you have any other questions before we conclude for today?
PATIENT: That is… acceptable. $450 is… within reason, I suppose. I shall inform my husband immediately. These instructions… are quite clear, thank you. I am a meticulous individual, as I have mentioned, and I anticipate no difficulties with the collection process. No, I believe that concludes my inquiries for the present. Thank you for your… thoroughness, Doctor. I trust your diagnosis will be swift and accurate. I do hope it is nothing… serious. It would disrupt my schedule considerably. Very well. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening symptoms. Have a pleasant day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailia. I appreciate your cooperation. I'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And I share your hope for a swift and accurate understanding of what’s going on. Have a good day, and please give my best to your husband.
