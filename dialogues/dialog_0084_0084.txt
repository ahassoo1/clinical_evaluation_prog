DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, but slowly. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry, all the time. It's quite bothersome, actually. I don’t… I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing and dry mouth and eyes… that’s definitely something we need to look into. When you say harder to breathe, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s not like… a wheezing, or a pain. It just feels like I have to… work harder to get enough air. Like I'm always a little… short of breath. Even when I'm resting, sometimes. It’s not bad bad, just… noticeable. And tiring. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. “Noticeable and tiring” is helpful. And you said it’s been gradual?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. Very slow. I… I wish I could pinpoint when it began, but my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps a few months? Or longer? I truly can’t be certain. I apologize for the vagueness. It’s just… things seem to slip away.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kobler. It’s common for things to be a little fuzzy. We’ll figure it out. Now, let's talk a bit more about this dry mouth and dry eyes. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… pretty constant, I think. Though, perhaps a little worse at night. I wake up with my mouth feeling very… sandy. And my eyes, they feel gritty and uncomfortable all day. I've been trying to use eye drops, but they only help for a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay. Constant dry mouth and eyes, worse at night, and eye drops provide only temporary relief. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these—anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I have been feeling rather tired lately, more so than usual. And my skin feels… drier too, I suppose. Not just my mouth. It's hard to explain, but it feels… tight. And I seem to be… thirstier than normal, constantly reaching for water. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's definitely relevant, Ms. Kobler. Increased thirst, fatigue, and dry skin along with the breathing difficulties and dry mouth and eyes… Okay. Let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: I… I was divorced a few years ago, if that’s what you mean? As for medical conditions… I don’t believe so. I’ve not been to a doctor regularly for a while, to be honest. I had a bout of… something with my gallbladder years ago, but that was removed. Otherwise, I’ve generally been quite healthy. I have private insurance, if that’s helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical history other than the gallbladder removal, and you have private insurance. That’s good to know. Any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. Just the gallbladder. And… I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was younger, but that feels… a very long time ago. Nothing recent, certainly. Is something concerning you, Doctor? You seem… focused.
DOCTOR: I just want to be thorough, Ms. Kobler. It's good that you’ve had no other surgeries. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I’ve never had to avoid any foods or medicines. I… I take nothing regularly, either. No prescriptions, no over-the-counter things. Just… occasional tea, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no current medications. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. My family isn’t very close, and we don’t discuss such things. My mother… she passed away some years ago. I believe she had some problems with her heart, perhaps? But I don’t know the details. And my father… I haven’t seen him in a very long time. I truly couldn’t say. I apologize for the lack of information. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. It’s common for families to not share medical information. Let’s move on to your social history, then. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never have. I… I prefer tea, as I mentioned. And quiet evenings. I don’t smoke, drink, or… well, you understand. I live a rather quiet life, truthfully. I’m a writer, and I spend most of my time at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. A writer, spending most of your time at home. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your lungs, check your mouth and eyes, and take your vital signs. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I hope it won't take too long; I have some writing I'd like to get back to. But your assessment is most important.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Breath sounds are a little diminished bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles noted. Mouth is dry, with no obvious lesions. Eyes appear dry, with mild injection. I’m noting some decreased tear production. Skin is dry to the touch. Alright, Ms. Kobler. Based on what you've told me, and the preliminary exam, I'm concerned about possible Sjogren's syndrome. It’s an autoimmune disorder that causes dry eyes and dry mouth, and can cause fatigue and joint pain. It can affect other organs as well. However, it’s important to rule out other causes first. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for specific antibodies, and also a Schirmer's test to measure your tear production. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sjogren's… that sounds… concerning. Autoimmune… I don’t even know what that means, really. Is it serious? And blood tests… I suppose that’s necessary. Yes, whatever you recommend, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it’s not something too debilitating. I enjoy my writing, and I wouldn't want to lose the ability to do that. Please, proceed with whatever tests you deem necessary. If you could explain the process to me, that would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Of course. Autoimmune means your body's immune system is attacking its own tissues, instead of protecting you from invaders like viruses and bacteria. Sjogren’s syndrome is often manageable, but it does require ongoing care. The blood tests are quite simple. We'll just need a small sample of blood, which will be sent to a lab for analysis. It will look for specific antibodies that are often present in people with Sjogren’s. The Schirmer’s test is also quick and painless. We'll place a small strip of filter paper under your lower eyelid, and measure how much moisture it absorbs over a few minutes. It helps us assess your tear production. I'll also want to check your rheumatoid factor and ANA levels. These are other markers that can sometimes be elevated in autoimmune conditions. It may also be beneficial to see a rheumatologist, a specialist in autoimmune diseases, for a more comprehensive evaluation. I can provide a referral if the blood tests suggest Sjogren's is a possibility. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, I think. Autoimmune… attacking itself… and the tests… antibodies and tear production… It all sounds very… complicated. But I understand the basic idea. And a specialist… a rheumatologist… yes, that seems sensible if the tests indicate a problem. Would the tests take long to come back? And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything to… prepare? Or… avoid? I just want to be proactive, if possible. I apologize for asking so many questions; I’m simply trying to understand.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Kobler. It’s good that you're being proactive, and asking questions is the best way to understand. The blood tests usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. The Schirmer’s test results will be available much sooner, likely within the hour. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to manage your symptoms. You can use artificial tears frequently to keep your eyes lubricated. Drinking plenty of water will help with dry mouth. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can worsen dehydration. You can also try sugar-free gum or lozenges to stimulate saliva production. I’m also going to recommend a gentle hydrating eye ointment to use at bedtime. It’ll help keep your eyes moisturized overnight. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable. Artificial tears, water, avoid caffeine… and the ointment. I can certainly manage those things. And scheduling a follow-up… yes, that’s best. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor Voytek. And your patience with my… vagueness. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. Shall I follow you to the lab, then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. It’s my job to help you feel comfortable and informed. Yes, please, follow me. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse, Sarah, is very efficient and gentle. She’ll take excellent care of you. We’ll get those blood samples drawn, and we'll go from there. And don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions along the way.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I suppose… it’s always a little unsettling, having blood drawn. But I trust you and Sarah will take good care of me. I… I hope the results aren’t too concerning. But I suppose worrying won’t help anything. I’m… quite fond of my writing, you see. It’s… it’s my life, really. And I’d be very sad to lose that. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: We’ll take things one step at a time, Ms. Kobler. And we’ll do everything we can to ensure you can continue to enjoy your writing. Sarah is excellent at making people feel comfortable, and it will be quick. I'll be right outside if you need anything at all. Just let me know when you're finished, and we can discuss the next steps. And remember, worrying doesn't solve anything. We’ll have a better understanding once we have the results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I… I will try not to worry. Though it’s… easier said than done. Hello. I have an appointment with Doctor Voytek. She sent me for some blood work.
