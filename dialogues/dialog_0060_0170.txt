DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, it’s about this life insurance thing. They sent me here for a medical exam, I guess. Just need to get it over with, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Right, a life insurance exam. Well, we’ll get through it. It's fairly standard. It's just to assess your overall health, and ensure everything is… as it should be. Before we start, let's go through some questions. It will help me get a better understanding of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, playing baseball. Other than that… not really. Nothing major, I don't think. I’ve had the usual colds and flus, but who hasn't?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Doctor, I just… I'm not really a sick person. I try to eat okay, I walk when I can. This insurance thing is just… paperwork, right? That's all it should be? I got things to do today.
DOCTOR: It should be straightforward, yes. However, the insurance company needs accurate information to assess risk. That’s where the questions – and a quick examination – come in. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, mostly. You know, a multivitamin. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I take ibuprofen. But that’s it. Really. Nothing regular. Honestly, Doctor, is this going to take long? I promised my daughter I'd help her with something this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Right. Vitamins and ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Look, I really don't remember anything else. I’m not good with dates and stuff, you know? I just… try to stay out of the doctor's office as much as possible. Is there a form I can fill out instead? Would that be quicker?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, a form isn't sufficient. We need to verify your health status. It's important. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: My mom passed away a few years back. Heart trouble, I think. My dad… he’s still around, but he lives back on Majuro. I haven’t seen him in a while. And I have a sister, she’s healthy as a horse, lives in Hawaii. I think. We don't talk too often, if that makes sense. Is knowing about them really important? I mean, it's not like I got a family history of anything, you know? Just normal old age stuff.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Putney. It helps us understand potential risks. Now, let's move on to your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Tried it once when I was a teenager, didn't like it. Always been a bit of a health nut, even though I don’t always act like it, I guess. I drink a beer sometimes, with dinner, but that's about it. Not a big drinker. Anything else? Look, I just want to get this over with so I can help my daughter.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. A beer occasionally. Good. Now, for a quick physical exam. I just need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… quick, okay? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 145/90. Your pulse is regular, but a bit fast at 88. And I hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath or coughing lately?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Coughing? Not really. Maybe a little when I walk uphill, but I'm not exactly a marathon runner, you know? I just figured it was… getting old. Look, is that going to be a problem for the insurance? Because I really need this coverage. My daughter… she’s starting college and… things are tight.
DOCTOR: Okay. We need to investigate the wheezing further. Do you have a history of asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: Asthma? No, never been diagnosed with asthma. Allergies… I think I had hay fever once as a kid, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious. Doctor, I’m telling you, I'm usually pretty healthy. I think this is just… a fluke. Could it be a cold? It's been a little humid lately. Look, is this going to disqualify me from getting the insurance? That’s all I really care about, to be honest. My daughter...she's counting on this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your concerns. However, dismissing potential health issues won’t help anyone. The wheezing indicates some airway obstruction, and while it could be a cold, we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you ever been exposed to any environmental irritants, like dust, fumes, or mold?
PATIENT: Mold? Fumes? Not that I know of. I work at a hotel, mostly office work, so… no. I mean, sometimes there's cleaning chemicals, but everyone uses those, right? Look, I’m not a construction worker or anything. This is getting complicated. Can't you just… sign off on it? Say I’m healthy enough? I really don't want to deal with a bunch of tests and appointments. My daughter… she needs this money for school. This whole thing is stressing me out.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your concerns, and I want to help you. However, I have a professional obligation to provide an accurate assessment of your health. I cannot simply "sign off" on something without proper investigation. The wheezing is concerning, and we need to determine the underlying cause. I recommend a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity. Would you be willing to schedule those?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? A… pulmonary function test? Doctor, are you serious? That sounds expensive. And time-consuming. I just… I don’t have the money for a bunch of tests. And I really don't have the time. Look, can't you just… check my chart again? Maybe you missed something? This insurance is really important, and I can't afford to jump through a lot of hoops. My daughter… she’s relying on me. I… I don’t know what to do.
