DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um... my sinuses, I think. It's been... bothering me. Not so good, you know? I forget exactly when it started, but it's been a little while.
DOCTOR: A little while is… not particularly helpful, Ms. Boham. But alright. Can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry, Doctor. It's hard to remember things, you know? It feels... full. Like pressure. Mostly here, <points to her forehead and around her nose> and sometimes in my cheeks. It hurts when I bend over, I think. Not a bad hurt, but... annoying. It’s been making it hard to sleep, maybe? I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this… fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think… <pauses, looking upwards> Sometimes my nose feels… stuffy. And maybe a little bit of… dripping? I don’t know if that makes sense. Not a lot, just… sometimes. Oh! And I feel tired. But I always feel tired, you know? It’s hard to tell what's new.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stuffy nose, occasional dripping… fatigue. And you said this has been going on for “a little while.” Have you tried anything to alleviate these symptoms, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My husband, he… he gave me something. A pill. I think it was red. It didn’t do much, though. And I try to drink lots of water. That helps a little, maybe? I don’t really… know what to do, Doctor. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: A red pill… From your husband. I see. Do you recall the name of this medication, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: No, I don’t remember the name, Doctor. He just… gave it to me. He gets things for people sometimes. It was a little bottle, I think. Small. I really don’t remember what it was called. I’m sorry. I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I eat most things. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that happens sometimes anyway, you know? I don’t think it's an allergy. I’ve never had anything… bad happen from anything I’ve eaten or taken. I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. And are you currently taking any other medications, aside from this… red pill?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just that pill. And I stopped taking it after a few days because it didn’t seem to help. I don’t really like taking pills unless I have to, you know? I prefer to just… deal with things, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Boham, I’m going to need to perform a quick physical examination. I'll need to look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. <nods slightly> Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please recline back in the chair. I will begin with your ears. <Begins examining her ears with the otoscope.> Your tympanic membranes appear normal. Now, let me take a look at your nasal passages. <Shines a light into her nostrils.> There is some mild mucosal swelling and redness present. <Notes observations on the chart.> And finally, let's check your throat... Open wide. <Uses a tongue depressor to examine her throat.> Some slight redness in the pharynx, but no visible exudate.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. <opens her mouth when asked, then closes it again> Everything feels a little cold. Is that normal? It just… tickles a bit. And I’m trying to stay still, I promise.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Boham. Now, I’m going to palpate your sinuses to assess for tenderness. <Gently presses on her forehead and cheekbones.> Any pain here?
PATIENT: <winces slightly as he touches her forehead> Ooh, yes. A little bit there. And… <points to her left cheekbone> a little bit on this side too. Not bad bad, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, you know? Like when you have a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your reported symptoms and my examination, it appears you are likely experiencing sinusitis. It could be a viral or bacterial infection, although given the lack of high fever and purulent discharge, a viral cause is more probable. Do you have a history of frequent sinus infections, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Frequent…? Hmm. I don't think so, Doctor. Maybe sometimes I feel a little stuffy, but I just… drink water and try to rest. I've never been to a doctor for it before. This feels… different, I guess. It’s lasted longer, you know? And it feels more full. <frowns slightly> It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your symptoms and the fact that you are uninsured, I recommend a conservative approach. Supportive care – plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter decongestants – should be sufficient. Avoid strenuous activity. If your symptoms do not improve within 7-10 days, or if you develop a fever, severe headache, or facial swelling, you will need to seek further medical attention. <Begins typing instructions into the computer.> Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter…? Oh. That means I have to buy something, doesn’t it? <looks worried> I… I don't know if I can afford that right now, Doctor. <pauses> And what kind of decongestants? There are so many things in the store. I don't want to buy the wrong thing. What if it makes it worse?
DOCTOR: Yes, over-the-counter. I understand financial constraints. Pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine are suitable options, though pseudoephedrine is often more effective but requires identification at the pharmacy. As for the worry of making things worse, follow the package directions carefully. And if you have any underlying conditions, specifically high blood pressure, consult with a pharmacist before use. <Types rapidly, then prints a simple information sheet about sinusitis.> This sheet has some general advice. I highly recommend consulting with a pharmacist for specific product recommendations given your circumstances. Are we finished here, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Pseudo… I don't even know how to say that! <takes the paper, looking overwhelmed> Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll try to figure it out. And I’ll talk to the pharmacist. It’s just… a lot. <pauses, looking down at her hands> I think… yes. I think we’re finished. Thank you for seeing me, Doctor. <stands up slowly> .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. Get well soon, Ms. Boham. <Turns to the next chart.>
