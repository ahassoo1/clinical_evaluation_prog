DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. It’s about my foot. It’s been bothering me for weeks now, a sore that just won't heal. Honestly, I've seen better work from children with bandages. And it’s probably my sugar, the nurse said something about that. I’ve had this trouble for years, you know. Years.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. It sounds like this foot sore is causing you a lot of trouble, and you're understandably frustrated it isn't healing. We'll definitely take a look at it and figure out what's going on. And you're right to mention your sugar levels; that can certainly play a role in healing. Just to clarify, when you say "weeks," about how many weeks has this sore been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, don't patronize me with the "understandably frustrated" bit. I am a scientist, you know. I understand perfectly well how things work. But weeks… let me think. It must be… six, maybe seven. It started small, a little cut I didn’t think much of, and then it just… worsened. Slowly, mind you. Not a sudden thing. Everything with age is slow. Do you even listen when people talk?
DOCTOR: My apologies, Louine. That was poorly worded on my part, and I absolutely was not intending to patronize you. I understand you're a scientist and very capable of understanding what's happening. It’s good you’ve been keeping track of the timeline. Six or seven weeks is helpful. So, it started as a small cut that gradually worsened. Can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… ugly. Honestly, it’s quite dreadful. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. It's not a clean cut anymore. It’s… raw looking. Red around the edges, and there's some… discharge. And it hurts. Not constantly, but when I put weight on it, or if I knock it against something. It's a nuisance, really. A big, unpleasant nuisance. I’ve tried putting some creams on it, the kind they sell at the store, but they haven’t done a thing. Useless, the lot of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, “raw looking” with redness and some discharge, and it hurts with pressure. And the store-bought creams haven't helped. That's good information. Let's take a closer look. Could you please sit back and elevate your foot for me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t expect miracles. I’ve had doctors poke and prod at this for years, and nothing ever comes of it. Be gentle, young man. This is very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. I see the wound now. It’s located on the plantar surface of your heel, approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter. There is surrounding erythema—that’s redness—and some serosanguinous drainage. The wound bed appears…granulated, and there’s a slightly firm border. No signs of osteomyelitis at this time, thankfully, but we'll want to keep a close watch for that. I'm also noting some decreased sensation in the surrounding area. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your foot?
PATIENT: Decreased sensation? Well, now that you mention it… yes. I suppose I have. It's not a complete loss of feeling, but it’s… muffled. Like wearing thick socks all the time. I hadn’t really thought much of it. Everything goes with age, doesn’t it? Numbness, aches, pains… It's just part of the package. And what did you say about… osteo-something? Is that serious? Don't tell me it's a bone infection. I’ve read enough medical journals to know what that means.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about osteomyelitis. It's a bone infection, and it can be serious, which is why I'm noting that we need to monitor for it. Right now, there are no obvious signs, but decreased sensation in your foot can increase your risk because you might not notice a small infection developing. The muffled sensation is concerning and could be related to neuropathy—nerve damage—often associated with diabetes. Do you have a history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Do I have a history? Young man, I practically wrote the textbook on it. Type 2, diagnosed nearly forty years ago. I’ve managed it with diet and medication for years, mostly. Though my sugar levels haven’t been as stable lately, I’ll admit. The nurse at the clinic mentioned it just last week. It’s a constant battle, you know. A constant, frustrating battle. And it seems to be winning these days. Honestly, I don't know what I'd do without that woman. She's the only one who listens.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. Thank you for sharing that. A long history of Type 2 diabetes explains the neuropathy, and it's important that your sugar levels haven't been as stable recently. That definitely contributes to the difficulty in healing this wound. I’m going to check your blood sugar now, just to get a baseline. Then, I want to do a quick neurological assessment to check the sensation in your feet more thoroughly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you need to do. But don't expect much. I've been poked and prodded enough times to last a lifetime. And frankly, I doubt you’ll find anything I don’t already know. Just hurry it up, will you? I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. Your blood sugar is currently 210. That's elevated, but not critically high. And the neurological exam confirms reduced sensation in both feet, particularly in your left foot where the wound is located. Based on everything we've discussed – your long history of diabetes, the elevated blood sugar, the reduced sensation, and the appearance of the wound – it appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer. These can be tricky to heal, but we can definitely manage it. We need to focus on controlling your blood sugar, protecting the wound from infection, and offloading pressure from your foot.
PATIENT: A diabetic foot ulcer. How…original. As if I didn't know. I’ve read the literature, young man. I know what they are. And I also know that "managing" them is easier said than done. So, what does that even mean? What are you going to do? More creams? More bandages? Because honestly, I’ve wasted enough money on those already. I want a solution, not another temporary fix. And don't tell me about "lifestyle changes" either. I've been hearing that for forty years. What’s the actual plan?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask for a concrete plan, Louine, and I apologize if I haven't been clear enough. More creams and bandages alone won't be sufficient. Here’s what I recommend: First, we need to get your blood sugar under better control. I'll send a referral to our endocrinologist, Dr. Chen, to review your medications and create a plan to stabilize your levels. Second, we need to protect the wound from infection. I’m going to prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment. We’ll also need to keep the wound clean and covered with a special dressing that promotes healing. Third, and most importantly, we need to offload pressure from your foot. That means reducing the amount of weight you put on it. I'd like to refer you to a podiatrist, Dr. Ramirez, who can assess your gait and recommend appropriate footwear, potentially including a custom orthotic or a specialized walking boot. In severe cases, a total contact cast or even surgery may be necessary, but let's start with the more conservative measures. We'll need to see you back here in one week to reassess the wound and monitor your progress. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to start?
PATIENT: An endocrinologist… a podiatrist… More appointments. Honestly, it's exhausting just thinking about it. But… I suppose it’s better than letting it fester. A custom orthotic… that sounds expensive. And a walking boot? I’d rather not. But fine. I'll see Dr. Chen and Dr. Ramirez. But I expect results, young man. I’m not getting any younger. And make sure they know I don’t have time for endless testing. I need a solution, and I need it quickly. And what about the cost of all this? Medicare doesn't cover everything, you know. Will I be stuck with a huge bill? Don’t gloss over that part.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and the need for a timely resolution. I’ll make sure both Dr. Chen and Dr. Ramirez are aware of your concerns about avoiding unnecessary testing and the importance of efficiency. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover the majority of the visits, the orthotic , and any necessary wound care supplies. However, there may be some co-pays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses before each visit. I can also provide a referral for a financial counselor if you have concerns about affording the treatment. I’ll have the nurse print out the referrals for Dr. Chen and Dr. Ramirez, along with instructions for wound care. She’ll also schedule your follow-up appointment for one week from today. In the meantime, please keep the wound clean and dry, and avoid putting excessive weight on your foot. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all for now. Just…make sure those doctors understand I’m not going to waste my time. And tell the nurse to print those instructions in large print. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, it’s just a lot to deal with. I suppose we’ll see if any of this actually works. Don’t get your hopes up, young man. I’ve been disappointed before. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Louine. I’ll do my best to ensure you receive the best possible care, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Louine, and please be careful. .
