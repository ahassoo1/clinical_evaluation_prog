DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, I’ve been havin’ a wee bit of trouble in the mornings, ye see. Mostly nausea, just feelin’ queasy when I wake up. The heart’s been a bit… off, they said, a while back now. That’s what the other doctor told me, anyway. Heart failure, that was the word. It's been managin’ alright, mostly, but this mornin' sickness is new.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benic. So, nausea primarily in the mornings, and you mentioned a history of heart failure diagnosed previously. Just to clarify, when you say "a while back," roughly how long ago was that diagnosis?
PATIENT: Och, it must be… let me think now… nearly five years, I reckon. Five years last October, maybe November. It was right after the bad storm, if that helps. I was livin’ closer to the coast then, and the worry of the wind just… well, it brought it on, they said. Stress, mostly. They gave me some water tablets and told me to watch my salt. I’ve been doin’ alright on those, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. And you’ve been taking those water tablets consistently for the past five years?
PATIENT: Aye, pretty consistently. There’s been a couple o’ times I ran oot, mind ye, and had to wait a few days for a new prescription. But other than that, aye, every mornin’ like clockwork. I’m good at rememberin’ things like that, ye see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And besides the nausea this morning, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Well… now that ye mention it, I have been feelin' a bit more tired than usual. Not exhausted, just… a wee bit flatter, ye ken? And me ankles have been a bit swollen at the end o’ the day, but I just put that down to the heat. It’s been a warm summer, after all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and some ankle swelling in addition to the nausea and the history of heart failure. Let's talk about those ankles for a moment. How much swelling are we talking?
PATIENT: It's not terrible, Doctor, not like they’re balloonin' up. Just… noticeable. If I press me thumb into them at night, ye get a wee bit o' a dent that takes a while to go away. It's mostly in the evenings, after I’ve been on me feet a bit. I do a fair bit o' walkin' to the library, ye see, and back. It's a good walk, mind ye, but maybe it’s too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, noticeable swelling that pits with pressure, worse in the evenings after walking. And you mentioned the fatigue. Is that new, or has that been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Aye, the fatigue is newer, I think. It started maybe a month ago, or so. Before that, I felt… normal enough for an old codger like meself, ha! Just a bit o' tiredness at the end o’ the day, ye ken? But this is… different. It’s just a bit harder to get goin’ in the mornin’, and I feel wiped oot a bit quicker. It’s not keepin’ me from doin’ things, mind ye, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benic. It sounds like a constellation of symptoms that warrants a closer look. Before we do a physical exam, can you tell me about any allergies you have, and any medications you are currently taking, besides the water tablets?
PATIENT: Right, aye. No allergies, not that I know o’. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. As for medications… just the water tablets, like I said. Furosemide, that’s the name o’ them. And… oh, sometimes I take a wee bit o’ paracetamol for me back, if it’s playin’ up. But that’s just now and then, when I’ve been doin’ too much in the garden. Not every day, not by a long shot.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, furosemide daily, and paracetamol occasionally for back pain. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that's grand, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve nothin’ to hide, and I trust yer judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… peculiar, mind ye.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. I'm listening to your heart now. I hear a slightly irregular rhythm, and there's a faint murmur. Nothing overly concerning at this point, but we'll want to investigate further. Now, I’m feeling your ankles. Yes, there's definite pitting edema, as you mentioned, about 2+ bilaterally. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 88 and irregular. We’ll also check your breathing. Take a deep breath for me, please. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear some crackles at the bases. That, combined with the edema and irregular pulse, suggests some fluid retention. I'm going to take a look at your abdomen now, just to rule out any other potential causes for the swelling.
PATIENT: Och, that doesn't sound too good, does it? Fluid retention… aye, that sounds like what the other doctor warned me about. Crackles in me lungs… right. I trust yer listenin’ ears, Doctor. Do what ye need to do. I've got a strong constitution, ye know. I've weathered a few storms in me time.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Benic. You seem to be handling this very well. Your abdomen is soft and doesn’t seem to be causing any discomfort. No obvious swelling or tenderness there. Based on what we’ve discussed and this quick exam, it does seem like your heart failure may be contributing to the fluid retention you’re experiencing. The nausea could be related to that as well, or it could be something separate. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and an EKG to look at your heart rhythm more closely. We should also get a chest X-ray to see how much fluid is in your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Tests are always a good idea, makes me feel better knowin’ ye’re lookin’ into things properly. Complete blood count, kidney function, EKG… chest X-ray… aye, go right ahead. The sooner we know, the sooner we can get things sorted, right? I’ll need to get back to the library later, mind ye, but I can pop back here whenever ye need me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology now. It shouldn't take too long to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a low-sodium diet to help reduce the fluid retention. I’ll also suggest you monitor your weight daily and let us know if you notice any sudden increases. Given your nausea, I’m also going to prescribe a medication to help with that. It’s a common anti-nausea medication, but we’ll start with a low dose. Finally, and this is important, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Right, low-sodium diet, monitor me weight… anti-nausea medication… aye, I can do that. I’m good at followin’ instructions, ye see. And shortness o’ breath, chest pain, dizziness… go to the emergency room… aye, I understand. Important things, those. I’ll write all that down in me wee notebook here. Is there anything else I should be keepin’ an eye oot for, Doctor? Anythin’ at all?
DOCTOR: That’s good of you to write that down, Mr. Benic. Besides the symptoms I mentioned, pay attention to any swelling in your legs or feet that gets significantly worse. And if you notice any changes in your ability to exercise or perform your usual activities, let us know. I’m also going to write a note for your primary care physician to let them know what we’ve discussed today and the tests we’ve ordered. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: No, I think ye've covered everything, Doctor. Ye've been very thorough, and I appreciate ye takin' the time to listen to me. I'll be mindful o' the swellin', the exercise, and the symptoms we discussed. I'll just need to know where to pick up the prescription for the anti-nausea medication, and when I can expect to hear about the test results.
DOCTOR: Certainly. You can pick up the prescription at the pharmacy next door. It should be ready within the hour. As for the test results, we should have them back within 24-48 hours. The lab will usually contact us directly, and our nurse will then give you a call to discuss the results and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions. Here's a copy of the discharge instructions with everything we discussed, just in case. Do you have any further questions before you leave today, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Right, pharmacy next door, results in 24-48 hours... aye, that’s grand. I've got all that written down. No, I think that’s everything. I appreciate yer help, Doctor. Ye've put me at ease. I'll be seein’ ye again soon, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Mr. Benic. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.
