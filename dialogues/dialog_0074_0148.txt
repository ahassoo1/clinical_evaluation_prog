DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's… a pleasure to meet you too. Oh, goodness. Well, it's… this pain. Down there. It's been… troubling me. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure when it started, but it's… present.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain in that area can be quite concerning. “Down there,” as you say, can mean a lot of different things. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Concerning is… a good word for it. Hmm… how to describe it… It's not… sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache, really. A heaviness, sometimes. It comes and goes. Mostly it’s just… uncomfortable. And it feels… lower, on the left side, I think? It's hard to be certain. Everything feels a bit… mixed up, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache and heaviness, mostly on the left side, that comes and goes. That's helpful. When you say it comes and goes, can you tell me roughly how often it appears?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. How often… That’s… difficult. It’s not like a clock, you see. Some days it’s barely noticeable, just a little… awareness there. Other days, it's more… persistent. I suppose… over the last month, it’s been more days with pain than without. Maybe… three or four days a week, it’s really bothering me? It's hard to keep track, truthfully. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to keep track. Three or four days a week with noticeable discomfort is good information. Has anything specific seemed to trigger the pain – certain activities, foods, or times of the month, for example?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, triggers… Let me think. I don’t think so. I haven’t noticed anything particular. I've been trying to be mindful, but… I do a lot of wood carving, you see. Perhaps… lifting heavier pieces? But I do that regularly, and it hasn't always caused a problem. And I… well, I don’t really have… times of the month anymore. I'm past that. Honestly, Doctor, I'm at a loss. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers, and you've ruled out any cyclical changes. That's useful to know. Now, can you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, other symptoms… Let me see… I have been feeling a bit… tired lately, but I attribute that to the work, to be honest. And perhaps a little bit of… well, a bit of swelling, I think. Down there, too. Not much, though. It’s hard to say for sure. It might just be my imagination. I've also been… going to the bathroom a bit more often, maybe? But that could just be… drinking too much water. It’s all a bit… muddled, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, some swelling, and increased frequency of urination. We're building a picture here. Just to clarify the urination – is it painful when you go, or do you just feel the urge to go more often?
PATIENT: Oh, just the urge, Doctor. Definitely just the urge. No pain when I go, thankfully. It’s not… burning or anything like that. Just… more frequent visits to the bathroom. And… It's… a weak stream, sometimes? Not always, but occasionally. It feels… like it doesn’t empty completely. Does that make sense? It's all very… delicate, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A weak stream and the feeling of incomplete emptying are important details. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Goodness. That was… some time ago now. Let me see… I had a problem with my gallbladder, many years ago. They removed it, I think. And… I had some issues with my blood pressure, for a while. But it's been… managed. I’ve been taking medication for it, but the doctor said I could stop a few years back. Oh, and… I had a bad fall when I was younger and broke my wrist. Does that count? I'm not sure what else… Everything feels so… distant. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, managed blood pressure in the past, and a broken wrist. That’s helpful. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me see… I do take something for my blood pressure, occasionally. When it gets a little high. Just a small dose, when I feel it rising. I don't take it regularly, though. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, in my hands. Just when they are really bothering me. It's… ibuprofen, I think? Or maybe naproxen? I can never remember. And occasionally, a pain reliever for headaches. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else regularly. It's mostly just… as needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional blood pressure medication, ibuprofen or naproxen for arthritis, and pain relievers as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don't think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Not that I can recall, at least. I do get a bit of… a rash sometimes, when I'm exposed to certain plants in the garden. But it’s just a mild irritation, nothing serious. And… I think I was a bit itchy once after eating some shellfish. But it could have just been my imagination. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure. I don't have any severe allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known severe allergies, some mild skin reactions to plants and possibly shellfish. Now, to get a better understanding of your situation, I would like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam is… a good idea. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm ready whenever you are. Please, go ahead. I'll do my best to… cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be perfect. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, though slightly diminished. No bruits or murmurs auscultated. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please tell me if you feel any pain. There’s some mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant upon palpation. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Now, I’m going to perform a quick neurological assessment…
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… that was a little tender, yes. Just in that spot. It’s not… sharp pain, just… awareness. I’m glad you’re being gentle. A neurological assessment? What… what does that involve, Doctor? I must confess, I'm a little anxious now. I don't… I don't understand what all of this means.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Noelani. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous when something isn't right. A quick neurological assessment is just a way to check your reflexes and sensation, to make sure everything is functioning properly. It’s very straightforward. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Patellar reflexes are present and symmetrical. Now, I’m going to check sensation in your legs and feet. Please tell me if you can feel me touching you. Sensation is intact in both legs and feet. Based on the initial examination, the tenderness in your left lower quadrant, slightly diminished bowel sounds, and your symptoms of pain, increased urination, and a weak stream, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be something as simple as a muscle strain, but given the other symptoms, we should consider possibilities like a urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, or, less likely, something gynecological. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A muscle strain… that would be… a relief. But diverticulitis and… something gynecological? That sounds… serious. A urine analysis and a complete blood count… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. But… will those tests be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I do worry about… waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Noelani. It’s natural to feel anxious when facing uncertainty. A urine analysis is a simple test – you’ll just need to provide a sample, and it’s painless. The complete blood count involves a small blood draw, which can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s quick. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. While we wait, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. Many things can cause similar symptoms, and we need to gather more information before making any diagnosis. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out your urinary system. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re comfortable taking them, to help manage the discomfort. Avoid strenuous activity, and if you experience a fever, worsening pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. I’m going to write you a prescription for a urine culture, in case the initial analysis comes back positive. That will allow us to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection and prescribe the appropriate antibiotic. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That… that all sounds very sensible. I will definitely drink plenty of water. And I do have some ibuprofen at home, so I will take that if I need to. A urine culture… yes, that sounds wise. You mentioned antibiotics… that would mean it is an infection, wouldn’t it? And… what if it's something more serious? Diverticulitis or… something gynecological? What would that involve? I apologize for asking so many questions, but… I'm very anxious, as you can see.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Noelani. It’s important that you understand what’s going on and feel comfortable with the plan. The urine culture will help us determine if an infection is present. If it comes back positive, antibiotics are usually very effective at clearing up the infection. However, it’s also important to rule out other possibilities. If it turns out to be diverticulitis, treatment typically involves antibiotics, a liquid diet to rest your bowel, and, in some cases, hospitalization. The severity can range from mild to more serious, but most cases respond well to treatment. If it’s something gynecological, we would likely need to schedule a pelvic ultrasound to get a better look at your reproductive organs. Depending on what we find, treatment options could range from medication to further testing or, in some cases, a procedure. It’s important not to jump to conclusions or worry about worst-case scenarios at this point. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to guide you through every step of the process. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… that sounds… a lot. A pelvic ultrasound… No, I… I think that’s enough for now, Doctor. I’m a little overwhelmed, to be honest. I will… try to stay positive, as you suggested. And I will drink plenty of water. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And… thank you for your patience. I suppose I should… schedule a follow-up appointment? When would you like to see me again?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We'll take things one step at a time. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment for approximately one week from today. That will give us enough time to receive the results of the urine analysis and complete blood count and discuss the next steps. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, one week from today sounds… sensible. It will give me time to… prepare myself. Please, let your receptionist know. And… thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I believe that's all for today. I will see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please take your time getting ready, and don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: .
