DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My name is Kiwane Barban. I am here for… a check-up. Before the insurance starts, yes? I have Medicare. It is… necessary for this.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, Kiwane. A wellness check-up is a great way to get things started with Medicare. We'll make sure everything is documented properly. Just so I have a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit more about why you decided to come in for a check-up now?
PATIENT: Well, it is… expected. The paperwork said so. I do not have any… problems. I feel fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. It is all… normal. I just need the doctor to… confirm it, for the insurance. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Kiwane. Sometimes insurance does require a baseline check-up, even if you're feeling well. We'll certainly document that everything seems normal. But even with that in mind, I still want to make sure we cover all the important bases – just to be thorough. To start, have you had a primary care doctor before?
PATIENT: No. Not… regularly. Back home, things are different. You go to the doctor when you are sick. Not… just to check. This is… new to me. Is this normal here? Everyone does this?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Kiwane. It is different here in the US. Preventative care – checking up when you’re not sick – is really encouraged. It helps catch things early, before they become bigger problems. So yes, a lot of people do this, and it's a smart thing to do! Okay, well let’s start with a little bit about your health history then. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing… major. I had the usual childhood things. Measles, chickenpox, like that. But nothing… serious. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But it healed, Doctor. Very well, I think. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Childhood illnesses and a broken arm – that’s helpful. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My family? They are… back home. My mother, she is… old now. My father… he passed away many years ago. They are… healthy, I think. As far as I know. We do not talk… often. Is this information important, Doctor? It feels… personal.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Kiwane. Knowing about your family’s health history can sometimes give us clues about potential risks. But it’s perfectly okay if you’re not comfortable sharing details. Even just knowing that your mother is still living and your father passed away is good. Were there any specific illnesses that ran in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: My father… he had problems with his heart. It was… sudden. Very quick. And my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had… the sickness with the sugar. Diabetes, I think you call it. Nothing else, as far as I know. They did not go to the doctor… much. It was… different times.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart disease in your father and diabetes in your uncle. That's good to know. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about your current lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not… partake in such things. It is… against my beliefs. And it is… unhealthy. I drink tea, sometimes. And water, of course. I work very hard, so I need to stay hydrated. Is that… acceptable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely acceptable, Kiwane. That’s very healthy! Okay, and do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I have never had a… reaction to anything. I eat many different things. Spicy things, sweet things, everything. I do not have… sensitivities. I am a strong person. I do not… break out in rashes easily.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No known allergies – that's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I do not… believe in taking pills unless it is… truly necessary. I prefer to… endure. A little pain is… acceptable. I use a cream for my hands, sometimes, because my work is hard on them, but that is all. It is just… lotion.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications other than hand lotion. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and do a basic visual check. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. I trust your… expertise. I have been to the dentist, before, so I am familiar with… examinations. Do what you need to do. Quickly, if possible. I have… commitments later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kiwane. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat and relax. Okay, taking a listen to your heart. Everything sounds… regular. I’m hearing a normal rate and rhythm. No murmurs or extra sounds. Now let’s listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me… Okay, lungs sound clear and open on both sides. No wheezing or crackles. And now let's check your blood pressure... 128 over 76. That’s a little elevated, but not concerning at this moment. And just a quick look at your throat, ears, and eyes… Everything looks normal. You seem to be in good health overall. Okay. Everything seems… well. Your vitals are mostly within a normal range, and the physical exam didn’t reveal any immediate concerns. I do recommend we do some blood work to get a better baseline and check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, especially given your family history. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work? Yes, I suppose. If it is… necessary. But I do not… enjoy needles. Is it a lot of blood? And will it take… long? I have… things to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s not a lot of blood, Kiwane, just a few vials. And it doesn’t take long – usually just a few minutes. We can get it done right here in the clinic, and it shouldn’t interfere with your plans too much. It will help us get a more complete picture of your health. We’ll check your basic blood counts, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney and liver function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Do what you must. Quickly, please. I… trust your judgment. But if I feel… faint, I will need you to… assist me. I do not… enjoy medical procedures. Is there… water afterward?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kiwane. We'll have water available right after, and a nurse will be right there with you to make sure you're comfortable. If you do feel faint, please let us know immediately. We can have you lie down. Nurse Anya, could you please come in and prepare Kiwane for the blood draw?
