DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s these… hiccups. They just won’t stop. It's been over two days now, and honestly, it’s getting a bit embarrassing. And tiring!
DOCTOR: Hiccups, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Started… let me think… Tuesday evening, I believe. I was having dinner with a friend, and just… hic… started. It hasn’t really stopped since. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down, everything people tell you. Nothing works! hic It’s… very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. And you've tried all the home remedies?
PATIENT: Well, most of them! I haven’t, um… I haven’t tried standing on my head, if that’s one. And I didn’t scare myself, because I don’t really do that. But everything else – the sugar, the water, the breathing exercises… even getting someone to surprise me. Nothing’s touched it. hic It just keeps going. It’s not painful, just… constant.
DOCTOR: Okay. Constant hiccups for two days. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. hic I think… talking makes them worse, actually. And… when I laugh. Which is difficult, because every time I try to laugh, hic I just hiccup harder. Eating doesn't seem to make much difference. Drinking too much water maybe? But I have been trying to drink more water, thinking that would help. hic I'm not sure. It's all a bit of a mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And other than the hiccups, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… tiredness, probably from all the hiccuping. hic And a bit of a sore chest, but I think that’s just from the effort of it all. No fever, no stomach pain, no dizziness. Just… these darn hiccups! hic I haven’t been eating as well either, because… well, it's hard to eat when you're hiccuping constantly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s get a quick run-down of your medical history. Any significant illnesses or surgeries I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. hic I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was… oh, goodness, ages ago. And I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing major. I don’t take any regular medications. Just over-the-counter things when I need them - painkillers for headaches, that sort of thing. hic I try to stay healthy. I work at the community center, keeping busy with activities. It’s usually a very active job.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some heart trouble later in life. hic My sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. We don’t see each other much, though. hic Nothing really relevant to these hiccups, I don’t think. Nobody in my family ever had hiccups that lasted this long! It's rather embarrassing, really. hic
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies. hic Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. hic I’m usually very careful about what I put into my body. It’s just… this hiccuping! hic It’s so annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s have a listen to your chest, just to be sure everything sounds clear. And I'll take a look in your throat. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, of course. hic Deep breath… hic Here we go. hic I hope you don't mind the hiccups interrupting. It's hard to control them, you see. hic Is this alright? hic
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Throat looks a little… irritated, but nothing significant. It doesn’t appear to be anything obviously causing this.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that's… something. hic Irritated, you say? hic Could that be from the hiccups themselves, do you think? hic All the… effort? hic I've been drinking a lot of water, hoping to soothe it, but maybe that's making it worse? hic What do you think is going on, Doctor? hic I'm starting to get worried. hic
DOCTOR: It's likely a vagus nerve irritation. It’s… common. Often resolves on its own. But two days is a bit prolonged. We can try a few things. I’m going to prescribe you something to try and calm the nerve. And I want you to avoid carbonated beverages. See if that helps. If it doesn't, we might need to consider a referral to a gastroenterologist.
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? hic Oh dear. hic That sounds… serious. hic Is it really that bad? hic What kind of medication is it? hic And what does “avoid carbonated beverages” mean exactly? hic No soda? hic No sparkling water? hic Even with lemon? hic I do enjoy a sparkling water with lemon sometimes. hic It's just… these hiccups are so frustrating! hic
DOCTOR: It's not serious, Ms. Redeye. It's just… persistent. The medication is Baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant, to help calm the diaphragm. And yes, no carbonated beverages – soda, sparkling water, anything with bubbles. It can irritate the vagus nerve and worsen the hiccups. We'll start with a low dose, and see if that helps. If it doesn’t resolve within a week, then we'll talk about a referral. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. hic Baclofen. No bubbles. hic A low dose. hic One week. hic Alright. hic That sounds… manageable. hic I’ll try my best. hic I really hope it works. hic Do I need to avoid anything else? hic Like… spicy food? hic Or bending over? hic I've been trying to sit up straight, just in case. hic And is there anything I can do, besides the medication, to help calm the vagus nerve? hic Any breathing exercises, perhaps? hic
DOCTOR: Avoid overly spicy foods. And yes, try to avoid bending over excessively. As for calming the vagus nerve… deep, slow breathing can sometimes help, but honestly, it's a bit of a crapshoot. Just focus on taking the medication as prescribed, and avoiding irritants. Here’s the prescription. Follow-up with me in one week, and we’ll see if it’s improved. And if it doesn’t improve, then we’ll consider other options. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Deep, slow breathing. No spicy foods. hic Medication as prescribed. hic Follow-up in a week. hic No… I think that’s everything. hic Thank you, Doctor. hic I appreciate you taking the time. hic Hopefully, this medication will finally do the trick. hic It's just… it's been a very long two days. hic Alright then. hic I’ll see you next week. hic .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well, Ms. Redeye. .
