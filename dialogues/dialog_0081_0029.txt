DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's kinda strange, really. I just… I get full awful quick when I eat. Doesn't matter what it is, to be honest. A few bites, and I feel like I could burst. It's been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A month, you say. And it's with all foods?
PATIENT: Yep, pretty much everything. Soup, sandwiches, even just a little bit of fish and rice. Doesn't seem to matter if it's something heavy or light. I used to be able to put a plate away, you know? Now… not so much. It's making it hard to enjoy my meals, and my wife worries about me not getting enough to eat.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has there been any change in your appetite besides feeling full quickly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know… I want to eat, that’s for sure. I just can’t get much down. Maybe I feel a little tired afterwards, now that you mention it, but I figured that was just from not eating enough. I don't know if that's related, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Obarr. It does. And have you noticed any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, no sickness at all. Never any vomiting. And I don't feel queasy or anything like that, just… stuffed after a tiny bit of food. It's a weird feeling, honestly. Not painful, just… uncomfortable and full. Like I ate a whole feast when I barely touched my plate.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: No pain, no. And my… well, everything's pretty regular down there, if you don't mind me saying. No changes to my… habits, no. Just the full feeling. It's the main thing, really. I just wish I could enjoy a good meal again. My wife makes a lovely salmon bake, but I can only manage a couple of bites now. It breaks her heart.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when something like this interferes with simple pleasures. Now, let’s go over some other things. Do you have any history of acid reflux or heartburn?
PATIENT: Heartburn… not really. I mean, maybe a little bit now and then, after a spicy meal, but nothing I ever needed to take anything for. It wasn’t a regular thing. It's just this fullness, like my stomach is shrinking or something. I don't know. I'm not a doctor, you see. I just know something’s not right.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any recent weight loss that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, I think so. My wife keeps saying my trousers are a bit loose. I hadn’t really paid attention, to be honest. I figured it was just getting older. But maybe… yeah, I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not a lot, but enough to notice. My wife's a good observer, always has been.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that was a long time ago. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they gave me some pills and it's been alright ever since. Nothing major, really. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to fish a lot, kept me active. I don't get out as much these days, though.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking for that heart condition, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s just… Lisinopril, I think that’s it. A small white pill, once a day. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I'll take a little bit of ibuprofen. But that's it, really. Nothing fancy. I try to keep things simple. And I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks when she's cooking something new, just to be safe, but I've never had any problems. I used to be a bit sensitive to pollen when I was younger, but that's gone away now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, but I understand you need to do what you need to do. I just want to figure out what's going on with this fullness, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender to palpation. No masses appreciated. No obvious abnormalities on examination, but that doesn’t rule everything out. I'd like to order some blood work to start, just to get a baseline and check for any underlying issues. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and a thyroid panel. I also want to order a stool test to rule out any infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and a stool test… alright. I’m not thrilled about the stool test, if I’m honest, but I understand. I just want to get to the bottom of this. When will I get the results? And will I need to make another appointment?
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results once they’re available. In the meantime, I'd like you to keep a food diary, noting what you eat and how you feel afterwards. This might help us identify any potential triggers. Also, try eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. Here's the requisition form for the lab. Please take this to the lab down the hall. If you have any trouble, the nurse at the front desk can assist you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Smaller meals, food diary… alright. I can do that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It's good to know you're looking into it. I'll take this to the lab now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms. Have a good day. .
