DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, please have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Just… lab work, I think? The lady on the phone said something about it. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. Been a bit… fuzzy lately. Just need whatever tests I need for Medicare, I guess. Can we just… get it done?
DOCTOR: Right. “Fuzzy,” yes. Well, Medicare requires certain preventative screenings and annual check-ups. Let’s try to clarify. You said “lab work.” Was this scheduled by your primary care physician?
PATIENT: Primary… care… Oh, geez. I… don’t really have one, not really. I just moved here a few years back, and things… slipped my mind. I think I saw a doctor once, at the hospital, but I couldn't tell you who. Was that what this is about? Something the hospital wanted? I really wish I could remember.
DOCTOR: No primary care physician. Alright. And you're unsure if this was a referral from a hospital visit?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right. Unsure. Everything feels… distant. Look, is this going to be a long thing? I've got… things to do. I just need the blood work, or whatever it is, and then I can go. It’s just… exhausting trying to piece things together.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, yes. Well, we can't simply do blood work without some basic information, Mr. Croonquist. It's not… efficient. Do you have any current medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical… problems? Let me think… My knees ache, sometimes. And I get tired easily, but doesn't everyone? I haven't been sick sick in a long time. Honestly, I mostly just… try to stay out of the way. Is that helpful? I don’t know what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Knees ache, fatigue. Alright. Any medications you take regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. I think I had something for my blood pressure once, ages ago, but I stopped taking it. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and it made me feel… weird. I mostly just drink a lot of tea. Green tea, mostly. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tea doesn’t count, Mr. Croonquist. Any allergies to medications, food, anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never really had a bad reaction to anything. Dust, maybe? I sneeze a bit in dusty rooms, but that’s just… normal, isn't it? Everything’s a bit blurry, honestly. I feel like I'm missing pieces.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I need to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. It will be brief. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Fine, fine. But make it quick, please. My feet aren’t what they used to be. It’s just… a lot to deal with, you know? Old age, mostly. Everything just… falls apart.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on the table. I'll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. Elevated. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly faint. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is weak and rapid. Do you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… Not… lately. No. Sometimes, when I walk up the stairs, I get a little… winded. But that’s just because I’m old, right? And I haven't been doing much exercise. Shortness of breath… not really. I just… get tired easily. Like I said. Is something wrong? Don't tell me I need surgery. I hate hospitals.
DOCTOR: No recent surgery. Fatigue and mild dyspnea on exertion. Mr. Croonquist, given your elevated blood pressure, weak pulse, and history of fatigue, I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. We should also check your thyroid levels. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Look, can't you just give me something for my tiredness? A pill or something? I really don't want to spend all day here getting poked and prodded. But… if it’s necessary… I guess. Yes, do the tests. Just… please make it quick. And don’t tell me anything too scary, okay? .
DOCTOR: The nurse will draw your blood now. After that, we’ll need to do the EKG. It will take about fifteen minutes. I’ll review the results when they come back, and we can discuss the next steps. Please try to relax. .
