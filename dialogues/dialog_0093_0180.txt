DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, I don’t have a lot of time for this. I’m just… tired. Really tired. And I… well, it’s embarrassing, but I been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. Clay mostly. It’s… stupid, I know. Just get me something for the tiredness, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It’s not stupid at all to seek help when you're feeling unwell, and I appreciate you being honest with me. Tiredness, and the craving you describe… these are things we can certainly explore. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Explore? Look, I program computers. CNC stuff. Very precise. Very… brain work. Been doing it a long time. It’s just… lately, even getting to the computer is hard. Like dragging myself through mud. And it doesn't help that… well, everything just feels… gray. Not sad, exactly. Just… blah. It's been getting worse for months, I guess. Longer, maybe? Hard to keep track, honestly. And this dirt thing started around then, too. Is that all you need to know? Can we just skip the feelings part?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get straight to the point, Ms. Cantoran, and I assure you I’m not trying to pry unnecessarily. However, even seemingly unrelated symptoms can provide valuable clues. Knowing how long these feelings have been present is helpful, and you've already given me a good start. You mentioned this has been going on for months, perhaps longer. When you say “gray”, could you elaborate a little?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It's like… everything is muted. Colors aren’t as bright. Food doesn’t taste as good. Music… doesn’t do much. It’s not a big deal, okay? People feel things. I just… don’t. Much. And I get… frustrated easily. Small things. Like if the computer freezes, or the coffee is cold. I snap at people. Not on purpose. It just… happens. My husband… well, he used to deal with it. But… he’s gone now. So I don’t have anyone to… explain things to. Does that make sense? Can we please talk about the dirt now? It’s embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing a number of changes, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling frustrated and perhaps a little overwhelmed. And it’s perfectly alright that it’s embarrassing to talk about the craving for dirt; it's not a common symptom, and it's good you're being open about it. Let's talk about the dirt. You mentioned you crave it, specifically clay. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Look, I don't know why I do it. It just… feels right. Like something's missing, and the clay fills it. It's the red kind, mostly. The stuff in the garden. I try not to, but… sometimes I just can’t help it. Especially when I’m stressed. Or tired. It’s a small amount, usually. A mouthful. Maybe a handful. I know it's weird. I've read stuff online, but it just says stuff about iron deficiency or something. I don’t feel anemic, if that makes sense. I just… need it sometimes. And it makes me feel… calmer. For a little while, anyway. Then the tiredness comes back. It’s a stupid cycle. Can we just… get me something for the tiredness? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound stupid at all, Ms. Cantoran, and I appreciate you explaining it so thoroughly. The craving for clay – this is known as pica – can be associated with iron deficiency, as you’ve read, but it can also have other causes. It’s good you don’t feel anemic, but that doesn't rule it out entirely. Before we discuss options for the tiredness, I'd like to gather a little more information, if you’re willing. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Ugh, cravings? Look, I eat a lot of sugar when I'm stressed. Chocolate, mostly. And coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. But that’s just… normal, right? Everyone likes chocolate and coffee. No, that’s it. Nothing else. No weird ice cravings or… anything. Just the dirt and the sugar. And the coffee. Can we just skip the whole life story part, please? I’m not a big fan of talking about feelings, you know. And I have deadlines. And I'm really tired. Seriously.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. We can certainly focus on addressing the tiredness. Just a few more quick questions to help me get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? It comes and goes. Some days I eat fine. Other days… I just don’t feel hungry. It’s not like I’m trying to lose weight or anything. It just… depends. If I'm really stressed, I don’t eat much. If I'm… calmer, I eat normal. It’s hard to explain. Look, can we just get to the point? I need something to get me through the day, okay? This is taking way too long. And honestly, it's a little insulting that you're asking me all these questions. I'm a professional. I don't need to be… analyzed.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Cantoran. My intention is not to analyze you, but to gather enough information to provide the best possible care. I understand your frustration, and I will be as efficient as possible. To help me determine the best course of action, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And don't ask me to take off my shoes. I have good shoes. I don't want to get dirt on them. Can we just… hurry up? This is ridiculous. I’m a computer programmer, not a patient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. We can keep your shoes on. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears. It shouldn’t take long. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 92 beats per minute, but otherwise regular. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 138 over 88. Your ears look clear. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Arms extended. Just get it over with. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I could be debugging code right now. And I’m pretty sure my blood pressure is high because I’m stressed being here. This is ridiculous. Hurry up. Just tell me what I need to take to feel less tired. That’s all I want. Is this going to take much longer? I have a deadline, you know. A serious deadline.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to quickly check your thyroid gland. It’s just a quick palpation of your neck. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, I suspect we need to do some blood work to investigate this further. Your symptoms – the tiredness, the craving for clay, the loss of appetite, and the slightly enlarged thyroid – could point to a few different possibilities, including iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, or a thyroid issue. We need to get a clearer picture before deciding on a treatment plan. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work? Of course. Just what I needed. More waiting. More poking. Honestly, this is a disaster. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. But if it takes too long, I’m blaming you when I miss my deadline. And don't expect a glowing review. Seriously, I'm a very busy person. And I don't have time for this. Just… get it over with. And tell me when I can expect results. And can I at least have a glass of water? This whole thing is making me thirsty.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I’ll arrange for the blood work to be done as quickly as possible. It will involve a standard panel to check your iron levels, vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. Nurse, could you please get Ms. Cantoran a glass of water and draw the necessary blood samples?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. And don't poke me too hard. I bruise easily. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I could be writing code right now. I'm a professional. I don't need to be treated like… this.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be very gentle, Ms. Cantoran. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – typically within 48-72 hours – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic.
