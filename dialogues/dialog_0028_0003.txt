DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Baide, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do, you know. Eighty years old isn't exactly a picnic, and my time's valuable even if it doesn't feel like it to some people.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I understand. Though, a thorough examination is valuable, regardless of age. So, if you could just tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Tremor, she said. The nurse, or someone. My hands shake. It’s… annoying. Makes it hard to hold a fork, you know? Simple things. It's not like it's anything serious, probably. I just want something to… stop it. Honestly, I don't remember when it started, exactly. A while ago, I guess.
DOCTOR: A tremor, alright. And it affects your ability to eat?
PATIENT: Well, yeah, that's what I just said! Makes a mess, mostly. Soup's a disaster. And trying to… sign things. Important papers, you know? It looks… unprofessional. Not that it matters much anymore, but still. It's just… bothersome. Look, is this going to take long? I haven’t had my afternoon biscotti yet.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this tremor been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse? I dunno. Everything feels worse when you get old, doesn't it? Maybe. It’s hard to say. I don't sit around analyzing my shaking, if that’s what you’re asking. It just… is. It’s always been a little there, I think. A slight wobble. Now… it’s a bit more noticeable. But honestly, I’m not a doctor. How am I supposed to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the tremor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I feel old. Is that a symptom? Look, I’m not a hypochondriac. I get tired, my knees ache… normal stuff for someone my age. It's not like I'm falling apart, if that's what you're getting at. Just the shaking. Mostly the shaking. I don't have any… bells and whistles, if that’s what you mean. Can we just get to the part where you fix it?
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles, or any difficulty with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? Sometimes I feel a little… unsteady. But that’s probably just getting up from the chair. And stiffness… yeah, maybe. Everything’s stiff, you know? I creak when I move. Like an old door. It’s called getting old, look it up. Honestly, I don’t know why you’re asking me all these silly questions. You’re the doctor! You tell me what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. If you could just sit here, please. I’ll need to check your reflexes and assess the tremor more closely. Just a routine examination, Mr. Baide. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Routine, she says. Fine, fine. Just don't poke me too much. I bruise easily, you know. And be gentle with the hands. Don't want to make the shaking worse. Honestly, doctors these days… always poking and prodding. It's undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see… I observe a resting tremor in both hands, slightly more pronounced on the right. When you reach for this object, the tremor becomes more apparent, but also seems to have a slightly jerky quality. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Strength appears intact. No rigidity noted. Now, I'd like to check your gait and balance. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Stand up, she says. Fine, fine. Just be careful, you know? I'm not exactly a spring chicken. And don’t rush me. It’s a little wobbly, alright? Always has been. See? A little wobbly. Nothing drastic. Honestly, I think I'm doing pretty good for eighty years old. Now, can I sit down? My knees are starting to complain.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, sit down. That's fine. I observe a slightly wide-based gait and a mild postural instability. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with anything neurologically?
PATIENT: Neurologically? What does that even mean? Look, I've had the usual aches and pains, the arthritis, the… forgetfulness. But nothing neurological. No, never. I don’t go running to doctors for every little thing. My wife, God rest her soul, she was the one who went to all the specialists. I just… toughed it out. Honestly, I don't even remember what she said she had. Something with her… nerves, maybe? It was years ago. Don’t ask me to recall specifics, alright? My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Maybe a little sensitivity to dust, but that's it. Medications… Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And something for my… cholesterol, I think. Another little pill. Oh, and aspirin, when my knees are acting up. That's it. I think. Honestly, my daughter handles most of that now. She keeps track of all the pills. I just take what she gives me. Don't ask me the names, alright? I wouldn't know where to begin. It's a mess, honestly. Too many pills, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and the examination findings, it seems you're exhibiting signs consistent with essential tremor, potentially with some age-related mild postural instability. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some blood work to assess your thyroid function and vitamin levels. And I recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and possible imaging. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work, a neurologist… honestly. Look, is this going to involve a lot of poking and prodding? I just want something to stop the shaking, alright? A pill, maybe? I don’t want to go running all over town for tests and specialists. My daughter will have a fit. She handles all the appointments already. Can't you just give me something for it? Something simple? I’m an old man, you know. I don’t have time for all this fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Baide. While I can’t definitively diagnose or prescribe a long-term solution without further testing, I can prescribe a low-dose beta-blocker to potentially help manage the tremor symptoms in the meantime. However, it’s important to understand this is not a cure, and it may not be effective for everyone. Also, it’s crucial to follow up with the neurologist as recommended. They can determine the underlying cause of the tremor and develop a more comprehensive treatment plan. We will also run some basic bloodwork, just to rule out any other underlying conditions that might be contributing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. A pill. That's all I wanted. But no poking, alright? And tell your nurse to write down the name of that neurologist. My daughter will want it. And don’t expect me to run all over town. I’m an old man, you know. I got things to do. Just give me the pill, and let me go home. Now, can we get this over with? I'm missing my biscotti.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the prescription for propranolol, 20 milligrams twice daily. Start with one pill in the morning and one in the evening, and let me know if you experience any side effects. Here’s the referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist at City General Hospital. She’s highly recommended. I’ve also scheduled a blood draw for you here at the clinic for tomorrow morning. Your nurse will give you the paperwork. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Vance, huh? City General… Alright. Fine. No, I don’t have any questions. Just… get me out of here. And tell your nurse to be gentle with the needle. I bruise easily, you know. Now, if you'll excuse me… I think I’m done here. Biscotti… I need biscotti…
