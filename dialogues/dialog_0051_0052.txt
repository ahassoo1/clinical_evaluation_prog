DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good afternoon to ye as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, I’ve been havin’ a bit o’ trouble in the mornin’s, ye see. Nausea, mostly. And it’s… well, it’s a wee bit worryin’ because o’ my heart, ye understand. The doctor back home – not ye, of course – diagnosed me with heart failure a few years back now. It’s usually alright, but this mornin’ sickness is new.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Nausea, especially with a history of heart failure, is certainly something we want to look into. It's good you're bringing this to our attention. Just to clarify, when you say "mornings," is this immediately upon waking, or does it happen later in the morning?
PATIENT: Aye, good o' ye to listen, Doctor. It’s right after I wake, usually. Sometimes even before I’m fully awake, if that makes sense. A sort o’ queasiness that builds. It doesn’t last all day, thankfully. Usually gone within an hour or two o' gettin' up, but it's enough to put me off my breakfast, ye see. And I need to eat, keep my strength up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s happening soon after waking, sometimes even before you’re fully awake, and it resolves within a couple of hours. And it’s affecting your appetite. Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Mr. Benic. Now, could you tell me a bit more about the heart failure diagnosis?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem at all, Doctor. Happy to explain. Well, it was about four years ago now. Started with a bit o’ shortness o’ breath, especially when I was walkin’ uphill. I live in the Highlands, ye see, so there’s a lot o’ hills. Then my ankles started swellin’ up at the end o’ the day. Went to see the doctor, and after some tests, that’s what he told me. Reduced ejection fraction, he said. I don’t pretend to understand all the fancy words, but he put me on some medication, and it kept things under control… until this mornin’ sickness started. I’ve been takin’ the pills regular as clockwork, mind ye.
DOCTOR: Right, shortness of breath and ankle swelling, diagnosed four years ago, reduced ejection fraction… and you’ve been taking your medication consistently. That’s good to hear. Do you happen to know the names of the medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Aye, I do actually. I always keep a list in my wallet, just in case. Let me see… Here we are. I’m takin’ Lisinopril, 20 milligrams once a day, and also Furosemide, 40 milligrams every mornin’. And a wee bit o’ Digoxin, 0.125 milligrams, also every day. I take them with my breakfast, usually. I haven’t changed the dose or stopped takin’ them, not for a moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg, Furosemide 40mg, and Digoxin 0.125mg – all taken daily. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Besides the nausea, have you noticed any changes in your breathing recently?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Good to have it all written down, eh? As for my breathin’… well, it’s been a wee bit worse, I suppose. Not drastic, mind ye, but I'm gettin’ a bit more winded than usual when I’m doin’ things. Walkin' up the stairs, for example. Or even just carryin' a heavy bag o' groceries. It's not constant, but it’s noticeable. And sometimes, I feel like I'm not gettin’ a proper deep breath, a sort o' tightness in my chest. It passes fairly quickly, but it's there. I haven't coughed more than usual, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some worsening of breathlessness and a tightness in the chest, but no significant increase in coughing. Thank you. Now, have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a good question. I weigh myself every week, keeps me on track. I’ve actually gained a wee bit, I think. Maybe two or three pounds in the last couple o' weeks. I’ve been tryin’ to eat a bit more because o' the nausea, ye see, tryin’ to get some strength back. But it's been difficult, holdin' down the food and all. It's not a huge amount, but it's a change. I usually stay around 140-142 pounds.
DOCTOR: Okay, a weight gain of a couple of pounds, associated with the difficulty eating. That’s useful information. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit about any other medical conditions you have, besides the heart failure?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem, Doctor. Let me think… Well, I had my appendix removed when I was a lad, but that was a long time ago and caused no bother since. And I've got a touch o' arthritis in my knees, mostly just aches and pains, nothin’ too bad. I take a wee bit o’ paracetamol for it now and then. Oh, and I get the occasional bout o’ indigestion, but I put that down to my fondness for a good curry. That’s about it, I think. Nothin’ else that would be of any consequence, I reckon. I've never had any serious illnesses, touch wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal many years ago, arthritis in the knees managed with paracetamol, and occasional indigestion. And no other significant medical history. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, over-the-counter or herbal supplements, besides the ones we’ve already discussed?
PATIENT: Aye, good o’ ye to ask, Doctor. Just the paracetamol for my knees when they’re botherin’ me, and a wee bit o' vitamin D in the winter months. The sun doesn't shine much in the Highlands, ye see. I get a bit o’ seasonal affective disorder, so the doctor suggested it a few years back. It seems to help a wee bit. Apart from that, nothin’. I don't hold much truck with herbal remedies, to be honest. I prefer to stick to what the doctor prescribes.
DOCTOR: Okay, paracetamol as needed for your knees and vitamin D during the winter months. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Aye, good o’ ye to ask, Doctor. I'm thankfully not allergic to anythin’ that I know of. Never had a reaction to any medication, not even as a lad. I enjoy a good variety o' foods, and I've never had any trouble with shellfish or nuts or anythin’ like that. I do have a bit o' a sensitivity to the cold, but I don't think that's an allergy, just a Highland constitution!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem at all, Doctor. I used to enjoy a wee dram o' whisky now and then, but I gave that up a few years ago, when I was diagnosed with the heart failure. The doctor said it wasn't a good idea. I don't smoke, never have, and I certainly don't partake in any o' those recreational drugs. I'm a simple man, enjoyin' a quiet life in the Highlands. I do enjoy a good cup o' tea, though!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no recreational drugs, and you’ve stopped drinking alcohol. Just enjoying a quiet life and a cup of tea. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Benic. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your ankles. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds grand, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m happy to do anythin’ ye think will help. I’ve been a bit worried about this mornin’ sickness, so anythin’ ye can do to put my mind at ease would be appreciated. My heart and lungs… well, I'm used to havin’ them listened to, so it's no bother at all. And my ankles are a bit swollen, as I said, but that's nothin' new. Go ahead, and let me know if ye see anythin' concerning, eh?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic, I’m listening to your heart now. I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm, and there's a faint murmur, which we know about from previous examinations. I’m also listening for any crackles or wheezes in your lungs. I am hearing some mild crackles in the bases of both lungs, which suggests a bit of fluid buildup. Your blood pressure is 148/86, which is a little elevated. And your pulse is irregular, around 72 beats per minute. Your ankles do show some pitting edema – meaning the swelling leaves an indentation when I press on them. There’s no redness or tenderness, thankfully. So, to summarise, I'm hearing an irregular heart rhythm with a murmur, mild crackles in your lungs, elevated blood pressure, and pitting edema in your ankles. This, combined with your symptoms of nausea, shortness of breath, and weight gain, is concerning for worsening heart failure. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Aye, that doesn’t sound too encouraging, does it? Worsenin’ heart failure… I feared as much. I’ve been feelin’ a bit more tired than usual, and the mornin’ sickness is gettin’ worse. I suppose I should have come sooner. So, what do we do now, Doctor? Will ye be wantin’ to do some tests? I’m happy to do anythin’ ye think is necessary. I just want to get this sorted out and feel like myself again. I don't want to end up bedridden, ye see.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Mr. Benic, and you absolutely did the right thing coming in. It's always best to address these things promptly. Yes, we definitely need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'd like to order a few things. First, I want a complete blood count to check for any infection or anemia. Second, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Third, and most importantly, an echocardiogram – that's an ultrasound of the heart – to see how well your heart is pumping and to assess the valves. And finally, a BNP level – that's a blood test that measures a hormone released by the heart when it's under stress. These tests will help us determine the severity of your heart failure and guide our treatment plan. I’m also going to order a chest X-ray to look for any fluid in your lungs. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. A lot o’ tests, but I suppose it’s necessary. I don’t think I’ve had an echocardiogram before, is it painful? And what exactly does the BNP level tell ye? I understand the blood count and the X-ray, but these other two are a bit of a mystery to me. I’m happy to do them, mind ye, just want to know what I’m lettin’ myself in for. And how long will it take to get the results? I’m anxious to get this sorted, as I said.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Benic, and I’m happy to explain. No, the echocardiogram is not painful at all. It’s a non-invasive test, meaning we don’t need to insert anything into your body. A technician will simply apply a gel to your chest and move a probe around to get images of your heart. It might be a little cold, but it shouldn’t cause any discomfort. The BNP level, as you asked, is a blood test that measures a hormone released by the heart when it's under stress. If your heart is struggling to pump effectively, it releases more BNP. So, a high BNP level suggests that your heart failure is worsening. It's a helpful marker for assessing the severity of the condition. As for the results, the CBC and CMP usually come back within a couple of hours. The echocardiogram results will take a bit longer, usually a day or two, as a cardiologist needs to review the images. We'll get the BNP results around the same time as the echocardiogram. Once we have all the results, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I want you to limit your salt intake and monitor your weight daily. If you notice any sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Aye, that explains it perfectly, Doctor. No pain with the echo, and the BNP level tells ye how hard my heart’s workin’. And limit salt and watch my weight… I can manage that. It’s just a bit worryin’, havin’ all these tests, ye see. But I trust yer judgement, and I'm glad I came in. So, how do we go about gettin’ these tests done? Do I need to make an appointment with a technician, or will someone contact me? And how long will it take to actually do the tests? I'm not in any rush, but I like to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, and it's good that you're asking these questions. Let me explain the process. I'll write up the orders for the tests right now. The receptionist will contact you to schedule an appointment for the blood work and the echocardiogram. The blood work will only take about 15-20 minutes. The echocardiogram usually takes a bit longer, around 30-45 minutes. The clinic has an on-site lab for the blood work, so that can be done quickly. For the echocardiogram, you'll likely be scheduled with a technician at a radiology center nearby. They'll contact you directly to confirm the appointment details. Once the results are available, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds manageable. Fifteen minutes for the blood work and forty-five for the echo… I can arrange that. And my nurse will contact me for a follow-up… good to know. I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. I appreciate ye explainin’ it all so clearly. It’s put my mind at ease a wee bit, knowin’ what to expect. I'll limit the salt, watch my weight, and contact ye if anythin’ changes. Thank ye again for yer time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. The receptionist’s number is on the paperwork I'm about to give you. I’m going to give you a printout of the test orders and some information about managing heart failure. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye kindly, Doctor. I will do that. I appreciate yer kindness and the information. Right then, I think I'll be on my way. Thank ye again for seein' me today.
