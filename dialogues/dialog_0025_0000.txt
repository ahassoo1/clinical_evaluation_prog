DOCTOR: Alright, Sharifa, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my legs. They just…gave out. Not all at once, you understand. It started a couple of weeks ago, right after I had a terrible cold. Just felt weak, you know? But now…now it’s like trying to walk through mud. It’s very inconvenient, honestly. I have tours scheduled. People pay me to walk with them.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Walk through mud,” alright. And this started after a cold, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A really nasty one. Stuffed nose, sore throat, the whole thing. I usually just push through, you know? But then, a few days after I started feeling better, I noticed my legs weren’t… responding like they should. It’s just gotten worse since then. I don’t understand what could have happened from a simple cold. People don’t just lose the use of their legs from a cold, do they?
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes a cold can be followed by…complications. Let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll figure this out. Now, when you say "responding like they should," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, it's just… heavy. Like I said, walking through mud. It’s harder to lift them, harder to control them. And it's both legs, which is what’s so worrying. I don't stumble every time, but I definitely have to concentrate more. It’s not like a sudden paralysis or anything, it’s… gradual. And frankly, it’s undignified. I'm a professional, you know. I need to be steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: Right, gradual… and both legs. Okay. And has this weakness been getting worse steadily, or are there days that are better or worse than others?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely better and worse. It seems to be worse when I've been on my feet all day, obviously. The tours, you see. After a long walk with a group, I feel like I can barely drag myself back to the car. And it's worse in the mornings, sometimes. I have to really think about each step. But then, there are moments – maybe after a good night’s sleep – when it feels…almost normal. Almost. It’s very frustrating, I assure you. Not reliable at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Worse with activity, worse in the mornings… better after rest. Okay. Now, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm. Numbness… not exactly. Tingling… sometimes, yes. But it’s…fleeting. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as pronounced. And it doesn’t happen constantly. It’s mostly in my toes, I think. It’s hard to say, really. I don’t usually pay that much attention to those things unless it’s really bothersome. I have more important things to worry about, honestly. Like keeping my business afloat.
DOCTOR: "More important things," I understand. But fleeting tingling is still something we need to note. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. And, let me see…oh, I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control with medication for a long time. Otherwise, I'm a very healthy woman. I eat well, I try to get enough sleep, I stay active…well, I used to stay active. Before this leg business. And, of course, the divorce was…stressful. But that was years ago. Does emotional distress count as a medical condition? It certainly felt like one.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication. Divorce… noted. Okay. And what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It’s…Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. And I’ve been on it for, oh, at least five years. It does its job. My doctor in Honduras always said I had a tendency towards hypertension, even when I was younger. It's just…something I’ve always had to manage. And I’m very good at following instructions, if I do say so myself.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful. Now, any allergies to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I eat everything. I'm Honduran, you know. We don’t have a lot of… sensitivities. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication. Honestly, I’m a very sturdy person. It's just these legs… I don't understand what's happening. It's simply inconvenient. And I have a tour scheduled for Friday. A very important tour.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's have a look. If you don't mind, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just want to check your reflexes, strength, and see if I can get a better idea of what’s going on. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, it feels a little silly, lying down when the problem is clearly with my legs. But if you insist. Just…try not to take too long. I really should be getting back to my emails. There are clients waiting for responses.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be quick. First, let's check your reflexes. Relax your legs. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to have you try to push against my hand with your legs. First, push with your right leg. Try to resist me. Okay, good strength, but a little fatigue with repeated effort. Now, try to lift your legs off the table. Hmm. A little weakness in hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion. No tenderness or swelling. Alright. Okay, that gives me a little more information.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Is it something serious? Because honestly, I really can’t afford to be sidelined. And Friday’s tour… it’s with a very important group. They're historians, you see. Very particular people. Is it my nerves? Perhaps I'm just stressed. I do worry a lot.
DOCTOR: It's not immediately clear, Sharifa. It doesn't feel like a nerve issue, and your reflexes are mostly intact. The weakness in your hips and ankles, combined with the fatigue you mentioned, is concerning. The fact that it started after a cold is also a clue. It could be something called Guillain-Barré syndrome, although it's too early to say definitively. It's a rare condition where your immune system attacks your nerves, causing weakness and fatigue. It can come on after an infection. It's not an immediate emergency, but we need to rule it out. I’m going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count and an electrolyte panel. I also want to order an EMG – electromyography – which will measure the electrical activity in your muscles and nerves. It's a bit uncomfortable, but it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. And I think you should postpone that tour on Friday, just to be safe. It's better to err on the side of caution.
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré…sounds dreadful. You mean, like, paralysis? And blood tests? EMG? Honestly, this is all very disruptive. And postponing the tour… those people paid me. It's a significant inconvenience, you understand. Is there anything else it could be? Something less…serious? Perhaps it’s just a vitamin deficiency? I do try to eat well, but one can’t always be sure. And I’m a very busy woman. I don’t have time for…extensive testing. Will these tests at least tell me why this is happening? And how long will it take? Because frankly, I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sharifa. Vitamin deficiencies can cause weakness, but they usually present differently, and wouldn’t explain the timing with the cold. Guillain-Barré is rare, and not every case leads to paralysis. Many people recover fully with treatment. The blood tests will help rule out other causes of weakness, like electrolyte imbalances or inflammation. The EMG is the most important test to assess the function of your nerves. It will help us determine if there's nerve damage, and if so, how severe it is. I'm not going to guess at the cause of your symptoms, and I won't downplay the potential seriousness of this. The results of these tests will give us the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. The lab work should be back in a few days. Scheduling the EMG will take a little longer – the facility isn’t in town, so we’ll have to work around their availability. As for postponing the tour, I strongly advise it. Your health is more important than a schedule. I can write a note for your clients explaining the situation, and perhaps offer a refund or reschedule. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: A refund…that’s something, I suppose. Though it doesn't compensate for the damage to my reputation. And "damage to my reputation" is not something easily fixed, you understand. Very well. Write the note. And schedule the EMG. Though I still maintain this is a tremendous inconvenience. What exactly does this EMG involve? Is it…painful? Because I have a very low tolerance for discomfort. And I need to know how long I’ll be out of commission. I have commitments. I expect a thorough explanation, Doctor. And prompt results. Because frankly, I don’t have time to waste.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've drafted a note for your clients, explaining that you’re experiencing a temporary medical issue and need to reschedule the tour. It includes a statement about a potential refund. As for the EMG, it involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It can be slightly uncomfortable, like a pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. The technician will explain the procedure in detail before they begin. The test usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for how long you’ll be out of commission, that’s impossible to say without the test results. It depends on the severity of the nerve damage, if any. It could be a few days, a few weeks, or longer. I understand your concerns, and I wish I could give you a more definite answer. But I can’t make a diagnosis or prognosis without more information. I've scheduled the EMG for next Tuesday at the facility in Willow Creek. You'll receive a confirmation email with the details. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. If you experience any new symptoms, such as worsening weakness, numbness, or difficulty breathing, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: “Temporary medical issue…” sounds so vague. And Willow Creek…that's a considerable drive. Very well. Tuesday it is. Though I expect a detailed report sent to me as soon as the results are available. And I still maintain this is a tremendous inconvenience. I trust you’ll do everything in your power to expedite the process, Doctor. I have a business to run, you understand. I suppose that’s all for now. Unless you have something else to add? No? Very well. Good day.
