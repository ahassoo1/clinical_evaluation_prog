DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Fratoni. I’m Dr. Soodeen. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doc. Thanks for seeing me. It's... well, it's kinda embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been havin’ trouble gettin’ up out of chairs. Like, really havin’ trouble. It ain’t a pain thing, not exactly. More like... stuck. It’s been goin’ on for a couple weeks now, maybe a bit longer. I just figured it was a bad day at first, you know? Rough work and all. But it hasn't gotten better.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright, Mr. Fratoni, no need to be embarrassed. Many things can cause difficulty rising from a chair. We’ll figure this out. When you say “stuck,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s like… my legs just don’t wanna go. Like there’s somethin’ holdin’ ‘em back. I gotta really push with my arms to get goin’, and even then it's slow. It’s worst with lower chairs, like kitchen chairs. Din’ table chairs are a bit easier, 'cause they're taller. And my work chair… that one’s kinda high, so I don’t have much trouble there. It just feels… weak, I guess? Not a burnin’ or achin’ weak, just… won’t cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it's more of a difficulty initiating the movement rather than pain preventing you from standing?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. No pain, really. Not unless I really force it, then my arms get tired, but that's just from pushin’ too hard. It's like there's a delay between my brain tellin’ my legs to go and ‘em actually goin’. Does that make sense? I feel kinda silly explainin’ it, like I’m a broken robot or somethin’. But that’s the closest I can get.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound silly at all, Mr. Fratoni. You’re explaining it perfectly. It’s important to be thorough, and you're doing a good job describing what you’re experiencing. We need to gather a bit more information. Have you noticed this difficulty with other movements, like walking, climbing stairs, or getting out of bed?
PATIENT: Hmm… gettin’ outta bed is a little tougher than it used to be, now that you mention it. Not stuck like the chair, but I gotta kinda roll and push myself up more than before. Walkin’ and climbin’ stairs, though, feel alright. No trouble there. I do a lot of walkin' at work, checkin' the oil rigs and stuff, so I figured it was just bein’ tired from that. But… now I’m thinkin’ maybe it's all connected. It kinda started around the same time, this chair thing and the bed thing. I ain't been climbin' much outside of work, though, so I hadn't really noticed if that was harder.
DOCTOR: Okay. And before this started, a couple of weeks ago, was there any specific event that triggered this?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… yeah, kinda. There was a bit of a scare at the rig. A pipe burst, and I had to move pretty quick to get outta the way. Twisted my ankle a little, I think, but it didn’t feel bad bad. I iced it for a couple days and it felt alright. Kept workin’, didn’t wanna lose a shift, you know? Maybe that’s what started it? I didn't really connect the two things 'til just now. Should I have taken time off? I kinda just pushed through it.
DOCTOR: That’s important information, Mr. Fratoni. It’s good you remembered that. It's definitely possible that the ankle twist, even if it didn’t feel severe at the time, contributed to this. Now, let's briefly discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or any neurological issues?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothin’ like that. I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Never had much reason to go to the doctor, honestly. Just the usual colds and flu, and a couple broken bones as a kid, but nothin’ serious. And my wife... she handled all the doctor stuff. She passed a couple years ago now… so I ain’t really kept up with all that stuff. I just… kinda avoided it, I guess. Sorry, I didn’t mean to get all gloomy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Fratoni. Please don’t apologize. It's perfectly natural to feel that way. And it’s helpful to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Always been lucky enough to avoid those. Just a few stitches here and there over the years, mostly from work accidents. Scraped knees and elbows and such. Nothin’ major. I think that’s it, Doc. I ain't really one for doctor visits, as you can probably tell. It kinda feels like I’m makin’ a big deal outta nothin’, honestly. But this chair thing is gettin’ kinda embarrassing, and I don’t wanna fall or somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you came in to get it checked out. I appreciate you being thorough. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Never been much of a pill-taker. I drink coffee, of course. Lots of it. Gotta stay awake on the rigs, you know? But that’s it. Just coffee. And water. Try to drink enough water, anyway. It gets hot out there. No vitamins, no nothin'. Pretty clean livin', all things considered. Except for the coffee, maybe. And the hard work. Does that answer your question, Doc?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Fratoni. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll check your strength, reflexes, and balance. It'll help me narrow down what could be causing this difficulty. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Whatever you need. I'm kinda curious to find out what's goin' on, anyway. Just tell me what I gotta do. I'm not real comfortable with doctors and all, but I trust your judgment, Doc. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable or somethin’. Don't wanna surprise me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it slow. First, could you please stand and I’ll observe your gait – how you walk. Just walk normally across the room and back. I'm lookin’ for any limping or unusual movements.
PATIENT: Alright. No problem. There. Felt alright, I think. A little awkward, maybe. But I been doin’ a lot of walkin’ lately, like I said. So I guess that's normal. How’d I do?
DOCTOR: That looked good overall, Mr. Fratoni. No significant limping or instability. Now, can you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure thing, Doc. Comfy enough, I guess. Though I gotta admit, chairs ain't my favorite right now. Is there somethin’ specific you're lookin' for when I'm sittin'?
DOCTOR: Just a few things. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, then I'll check your reflexes in your legs. It will help rule out any underlying causes. This won’t be uncomfortable at all. If you could just relax your legs, please.
PATIENT: Alright. Heart and lungs, huh? Everything soundin' alright in there? I don’t usually pay much attention to those things, honestly. Just gotta keep workin’ and stayin’ busy. Everything feels okay, I guess. But I ain’t an expert, like you are, Doc. You just let me know if you see somethin’ wrong.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Mr. Fratoni. Your reflexes are also normal. Now, I’d like you to try and stand up from this chair, just as you normally would. I'm going to observe how you do it. Take your time.
PATIENT: Ugh… that was not graceful. See? That’s what I been talkin’ about. Gotta push with my arms, and it still feels like I’m gonna fall. It’s kinda embarrassing, Doc. Just like I said. How’d I do this time? Worse than before, maybe?
DOCTOR: That was helpful, Mr. Fratoni. I see exactly what you mean. You are exhibiting weakness with initiation of standing. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief examination, it appears you’re experiencing something called proximal weakness. This means difficulty with movements originating from the hips and thighs. Several things can cause this, including muscle weakness, nerve issues, or even certain vitamin deficiencies, though you've stated you don't take any supplements. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of your hips to assess for any structural issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an MRI… sounds serious. What kinda structural issues are we talkin' about? I gotta get back to work, Doc. Can’t be out for too long. And how much is all this gonna cost? I ain’t insured, so I gotta be careful. But… if it’s gonna figure out what’s goin’ on, I guess I gotta do it. Just tell me what I need to do. Blood tests and an MRI, right? Can I still work while I'm waitin’ for the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and work. The MRI will help rule out issues like hip impingement or labral tears, which can sometimes cause this type of weakness. It's unlikely you will have to be completely off work, but depending on the MRI results, we may need to adjust your activities temporarily. Regarding cost, I will have the billing department contact you directly with an estimate. We may be able to arrange a payment plan. I can also provide a letter for your employer explaining your medical situation. For the blood tests, we can draw them here today. It will take a few days to get the results back. I will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and the MRI findings. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… payment plan and a letter for work. That’d be good. I appreciate that, Doc. It’s kinda stressful thinkin’ about all this, but… it’s better than just fallin’ over all the time. Blood tests today, then wait for results and an MRI. Follow-up appointment after that. Yeah, that sounds alright. Where do we start with the blood tests? And how long will that take? I gotta get back to the rig eventually.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw your blood. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes, and then we'll send it to the lab. Sarah will explain the procedure and answer any questions you have. I’ll also have her schedule your MRI appointment. Do you have any allergies to latex or other medical materials I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Just… heights, kinda. But I deal with ‘em on the rig. Latex is fine, though. Everything's good there. Just get it over with, I guess. The quicker we figure out what’s goin’ on, the better. Hopefully it don’t take too long. I got things to do, even if I can’t quite do ‘em right now.
DOCTOR: Sarah, can you please assist Mr. Fratoni with his blood draw?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Hopefully it won't be too painful. I'm not real fond of needles, to be honest. But... I gotta do what I gotta do. Just let me know if you need anything.
