DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Popova, good morning. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, you’re 87 years young, and… quite thin, I see. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, 87, feels it some days! And you’re right about the thin, never been one for a big appetite, really. What brings me in… oh, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, feels like a tight band. Been comin’ and goin’ for a couple weeks now. Not awful, but enough to bother a fella.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A headache, you say. “Tight band” is a good way to describe it. A couple of weeks, alright. Now, is it constant, this headache, or does it come and go, like waves?
PATIENT: More like waves, definitely. It’s not always there, you understand? Some hours I barely notice it, and then other times, especially if I've been… well, thinkin’ too hard, maybe, or a bit stressed… it just builds up. Not a sharp pain, just… pressure. It doesn’t make me sick or anything, just uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, “pressure” with stress… good to know. Now, have you tried anything for it yet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My wife, bless her heart, she’s always got a remedy for somethin’. I took some of her paracetamol, the regular stuff, a couple times. Didn’t really do much, to be honest. Just took the edge off for a little bit, then it came back. And I tried restin', that helps a bit too, but I can't spend all day lyin' down, can I? Gotta keep movin', you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, lying down isn't a life, is it?
PATIENT: Exactly! I like to keep busy. I work, you know? Manicurist, down at the salon. Keeps my hands nimble and my mind sharp. Although, sometimes I wonder if all the focusin' is causing the headache… but what else am I gonna do?
DOCTOR: A manicurist… at 87. Remarkable. Still, prolonged focus can contribute, yes. Now, tell me about other symptoms. Any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Been doin' it a long time, kept me out of trouble! As for my vision… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes things seem a bit blurry, especially when I’m lookin’ at somethin’ close up. I always just figured it was my age, you understand? Needin' stronger readin' glasses, maybe. Nothin' sudden, just… gradual. But it’s been worse lately, now that I think on it. Especially at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, worse with close-up work, and gradual onset… alright. Any nausea or vomiting associated with this headache, or the vision changes?
PATIENT: No, no sickness at all. Not a bit. And no dizziness, either. Just the headache and the blurry vision. Sometimes, when the headache’s really botherin' me, I feel a bit tired, that’s all. But nothin’ serious, just… worn out. I sleep alright, though, most nights. And my appetite's always been small, as we said.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, vomiting, dizziness… small appetite, normal sleep. Let's move on to your medical history, Mr. Popova. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Not much, really. Years ago, I had high blood pressure, the doctor put me on some pills for a while. Stopped takin’ 'em after a bit, he said I was doin’ okay. And I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's pretty common for someone my age, right? Nothing major, just a bit of stiffness in the mornin’. Aside from that… I’ve been pretty lucky, really. No serious illnesses, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: "Pretty lucky," yes. Alright, high blood pressure, managed previously, and arthritis. Any surgeries, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had the need, thankfully. I broke my arm as a boy, fell out of a mango tree, but they just put it in a cast. Healed up fine. Aside from that… nothing. I've always been careful, you know? Avoided risk. My wife always said I was too cautious!
DOCTOR: Cautious… alright. Now, family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother, she had diabetes, when she got older. And my father, he had heart trouble. He didn’t take care of himself, always smokin' and drinkin’. My sister, she had glaucoma, I think it was. Lost her sight a bit, before she passed. But that's about it, really. Not a lot of serious illnesses on either side, as far as I know. Mostly just… livin' long enough to get old!
DOCTOR: Diabetes, heart trouble, glaucoma… Alright. And do you smoke or drink alcohol, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife couldn't stand 'em, and I wouldn't want to upset her. And I rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion. But nothin’ regular, I assure you. Always been a teetotaler, mostly. Don't see the appeal, really. Makes me feel sluggish.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Last question for now, allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of, anyway. I've been stung by a bee a couple times, but didn't have a bad reaction. And I can eat anything, really. Not picky at all. My wife always jokes that I’ll eat anything she puts in front of me. No rashes, no sniffles, no trouble breathin’… just a good, old-fashioned constitution, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Let's have a look at you. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to. Lead the way. Just hope my old bones don't protest too much! I'll try not to wiggle, promise.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your pupils and your peripheral vision. Follow my finger with your eyes, please. Don't blink. Hmm. Pupils are equal and reactive to light, but… I notice a slight sluggishness in the tracking. And your peripheral vision seems a bit… constricted. Alright, Mr. Popova. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to cooperate. Squeeze away. Not as strong as they used to be, but they still work, mostly. Though my wife says I have a habit of gripin' too much. Hopefully they’ll pass your test. And what did you say about my vision bein' constricted? Is that bad? I've noticed things aren't as sharp as they used to be, but I figured that was just old age creepin’ up on me.
DOCTOR: Strength is… adequate, for your age. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not unexpected. Now, Mr. Popova, based on your symptoms – the headache, the blurry vision, the constricted peripheral vision, and the slight sluggishness in your tracking – and your medical history, I'm concerned about the possibility of… glaucoma. It’s possible. The high blood pressure also isn’t helping things, puts you at risk. But we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I'm going to order a visual field test, an optical coherence tomography scan, and a check of your intraocular pressure. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll also need to get a comprehensive eye exam from an ophthalmologist. I’ll write you a referral.
PATIENT: Glaucoma… oh dear. My sister had that, didn’t she? Lost her sight gradually. So, that’s what this is… it’s serious, then? Is there somethin’ they can do? I don’t want to end up like my sister, not seein’ nothin’ at all. And this… optical something-or-other and the pressure check… what will those involve? Will it be painful? I’m not good with pain, you understand. And I’m afraid of needles…
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Popova, let's not jump to conclusions. Glaucoma is manageable, especially if we catch it early. Yes, it can lead to vision loss if left untreated, but that's why we're doing these tests. The visual field test is non-invasive. You'll simply look straight ahead while lights are flashed in your peripheral vision, and you'll indicate when you see them. It's like watching a fireworks display. No pain involved at all. The optical coherence tomography scan uses light waves to create an image of your retina. It's also non-invasive, and a little bit uncomfortable, like a quick flash of light in your eyes. And the pressure check… well, that involves a small probe gently touching your eye. It may feel a little bit of pressure, but it's not painful. There is no needle involved. I understand your concerns, but these tests are necessary to determine the best course of action. And if it is glaucoma, there are treatments available – eye drops, laser therapy, or surgery – that can help slow or prevent further vision loss. I'm going to write down the name and number of a highly recommended ophthalmologist. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And I’ll also put you on a low-dose eye drop in the meantime, just in case. Now, let’s address your blood pressure. I'm going to prescribe a low-dose medication to help lower it. It's important to keep your blood pressure under control, as it can worsen glaucoma and increase your risk of stroke or heart attack. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Low-dose, you say? That's good. I don't like takin’ too many pills, always feel sluggish afterwards. A fireworks display… well, that doesn’t sound so bad. And no needles, thank goodness. I always did hate needles. Will these eye drops affect my driving? I still like to take my wife to the market sometimes, and I wouldn't want to risk anything. And what about the cost? I'm on a fixed income, you understand. My wife and I, we don’t have much to spare. This is all a bit much, Doctor. A bit much for an old man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your concerns. The eye drops shouldn’t affect your driving, if they don’t cause any blurred vision or glare. But please, if you experience any changes in your vision after starting the drops, do not drive. As for the cost… I’m aware that medical expenses can be burdensome. I’ll write a note for the ophthalmologist, explaining your financial situation. They may have some assistance programs available, or be able to offer a reduced rate. And I can also provide you with a list of local charities that may be able to help cover the cost of your medications. Now, let’s focus on what we can do. We’re going to get these tests done, find out what’s going on, and develop a plan to protect your vision. It’s important to be proactive, and not let anxiety get the best of you. I’m confident that we can manage this, together. Do you have any other questions, before you leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explainin' everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience, and your kindness. It's just… it's a lot to take in, you understand? Worryin' about losin' my sight… it scares me. But I'll try to stay positive, as you said. And I'll schedule that appointment with the eye doctor right away. Thank you again, Doctor Fourney. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, at least. I'll see you soon, I suppose. And… thank you for not laughin' at me. .
