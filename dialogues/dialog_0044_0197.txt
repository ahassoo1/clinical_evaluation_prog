DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. It’s a bit of a hassle, but necessary. I want to get it over with quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Ah, a medical fitness-to-drive certificate for ride-sharing. Yes, I understand. It can be a bit of paperwork, but we’ll get through it. To start, can you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Well… I’m 70, as you can see. I’ve been… generally okay, I suppose. A few aches and pains, what do you expect? I try to stay active, though. I used to work with logging equipment, you know? Still do a little, when I can. Nothing strenuous anymore. I have Medicare, if that matters. Is there a list of things you need to know? I don't want to forget anything important.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active! And yes, Medicare is good to know. Don’t worry about forgetting things; that’s what I’m here for. A few aches and pains are normal at 70, absolutely. Let's go through some things systematically. First, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Arthritis, yes, in my hands mostly. It flares up sometimes, but I manage it. No diabetes, no heart problems that I know of. The doctors have checked me regularly over the years. I had a bit of trouble with my eyesight a few years ago, but I wear glasses now, and it’s fine. Oh! And I had my gallbladder removed maybe ten years ago. Other than that… I think that's everything major. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the hands, managed, glasses for eyesight, and gallbladder removed ten years ago. That’s very helpful, thank you. And how about medications?
PATIENT: Just a couple. I take something for the arthritis, it’s… naproxen, I think? And a low-dose aspirin, the doctor said it’s good for my blood. That’s it. Really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can. Do you need to know the dosages? I have the bottles at home, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Naproxen and low-dose aspirin. Knowing the dosages would be helpful, but we can get that information later if needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything… never had a reaction. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Does that count as medical history? I don’t think so. But I've never had a problem with allergies. Not even to cats, and I love cats.
DOCTOR: That's good to know! A cast-iron stomach is definitely a plus. Okay, and what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother lived to be 95, very healthy until the very end. My father… he had some heart trouble, but he didn't take care of himself, always smoking. I think my brother has high blood pressure, but I don't see him much. Honestly, I'm not very close to my family, so I don't know a lot of the details. Is it important to know specifics, or is a general idea enough? It’s been a long time since anyone’s really asked me about this.
DOCTOR: A general idea is fine, Ms. Sciarotta. It's perfectly alright if you don't have specifics. So, mother healthy to 95, father with heart trouble, brother with high blood pressure. That gives me a good starting point. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never. Absolutely not. My father smoked, and it was awful. I always hated it. I’ve always been very careful about my health, even if I do have a few aches and pains now. I don’t drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Just to be sociable. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No smoking, minimal alcohol. Very good. And do you do any regular exercise, besides staying active with the logging equipment?
PATIENT: Well, logging isn't exactly strenuous anymore. I walk a lot, though. I walk to the market, walk around the neighborhood… I try to get out every day. And I do some light gardening, weeding, planting flowers. It keeps me busy. Not exactly a marathon training program, but it’s something. It keeps the arthritis from getting too stiff. Is that enough? I’m not trying to be an athlete, just keep moving.
DOCTOR: That is enough, Ms. Sciarotta. Staying active with walking and gardening is fantastic. It sounds like you're very mindful of your health, which is wonderful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I understand it’s part of the process. I just want to get this card and get on with things. The sooner the better, if you know what I mean. I have things to do, you know. But yes, go ahead. Do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. Let's get started then. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good airflow bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Good strength in your extremities as well. I’m going to look in your ears and eyes quickly. Eyes appear normal, no cataracts or macular degeneration. Ears are clear as well. Everything appears within normal limits for your age.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. No problems, then? I was worried it would be something complicated. I just want to be able to keep driving. It’s important for me to be independent. Are we getting closer to the card now? Do I need to fill out any forms? I have my glasses if you need me to read something small.
DOCTOR: No, everything appears within normal limits, Ms. Sciarotta. That’s very good news. We are getting closer to the card. There is a standard medical form I need you to fill out, it’s a fairly straightforward questionnaire about your health and driving history. It’s mostly confirming things we’ve already discussed, but it needs to be completed for official purposes. Here you are. Take your time, and if you have any trouble reading it, just let me know. Your glasses will be perfect. I'll be right here if you need me to clarify anything.
PATIENT: Thank you. I can manage. It’s just a bit of small print, that’s all. I'll try to be as clear as possible. I want to get this right. Do you want me to read it back to you when I'm finished, or is that not necessary? I just want to be sure it's all correct. It's a bit tedious, honestly. But I'll get through it.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of you, Ms. Sciarotta. Reading it back to me is not necessary, but I appreciate the offer. Take your time, and if you find any questions confusing or unclear, please don't hesitate to ask. We want to make sure everything is accurate. I’m right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Here you are. I think I’ve answered everything as accurately as possible. It asked a lot of questions about whether I’ve had any accidents or moving violations, which I haven’t, thankfully. I’m a very careful driver. I’ve always been so. Is this all you need? Are we getting closer to the card now? I’m ready to be done if possible. It's been a long morning, and frankly, I’m a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Excellent. This looks complete and accurate, Ms. Sciarotta. Thank you. Okay, based on everything we’ve discussed and the information on this form, I am comfortable completing the medical certification for your driver’s license. I'm submitting it electronically now. You should receive a confirmation email within 24-48 hours, and the license bureau will likely send you the updated license within a week or two. So, yes, we are getting closer to the card! You should be all set soon. I’m glad we were able to get this done for you. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! That’s such a relief. No, I don’t think so. That covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've been very kind and patient. I appreciate you taking the time to help me. I’m going to go home and have a cup of tea now. I think I’ve been here long enough. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your tea, and drive safely. If you have any questions in the future, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day!
