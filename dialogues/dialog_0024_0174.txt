DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been… myself lately. It’s a long story, and honestly, I’d rather not take up too much of your time. But my daughter insisted I come. She says I’m… down. I suppose that's a polite way of putting it.
DOCTOR: “Down,” is a rather vague descriptor, Ms. Derasmo. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… alright. I just don’t feel much joy anymore. Things that used to… please me, don't. I used to love my garden, but even that feels like work now. And I sleep… far too much. Or not at all. It’s a bit of both, if that makes sense. I just feel… empty, really. Is that specific enough?
DOCTOR: Empty. Right. And how long has this “emptiness” been present, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s difficult to say exactly. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. Time… it seems to blur these days. It wasn't sudden, you understand. It just… crept up on me. It feels like a lifetime, honestly. But my daughter only just noticed. Women, eh? They notice everything eventually.
DOCTOR: Six months, you say. And has anything… significant happened in the past six months that might contribute to this… decline?
PATIENT: Significant… Well, my divorce was finalized about eight months ago now. It wasn't… amicable. He… wasn't a good man. But it’s done. I thought I was handling it. Truly. But… perhaps I wasn't as strong as I believed. It’s a difficult thing, starting over at my age, you know. I don't want to bore you with the details.
DOCTOR: A divorce, finalized eight months ago. And you're attributing this… malaise to that?
PATIENT: Attributing? No, not solely. It’s… complicated. It’s not as if the divorce was the only thing. I retired last year, too. From the ski patrol, mostly. Lifeguarding was… seasonal. It’s just… a lot has changed. I’ve lost my routine, my purpose, my… companion. It all feels rather overwhelming, if you must know. I suppose I just expected to… adjust. But I haven't. And frankly, I’m tired of feeling this way.
DOCTOR: So, divorce, retirement… loss of routine. Do you have any history of… depression, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Depression? No, not as such. I've had my sad days, of course. Everyone does. But nothing like this. Never needed… medication or anything of that sort. I always considered myself a strong, practical woman. This… this feels different. It’s not just feeling sad, Doctor. It’s… a hollowness. Like something is missing. I’m not sure you understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a daily multivitamin, and something for my blood pressure, which is very mild. No allergies, thankfully. I’m quite healthy, actually, for my age. It’s just… my mind feels unwell, not my body. I used to be so active. Skiing, swimming… now, I struggle to get out of the house some days. It's rather embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, Ms. Derasmo, just to rule out any underlying physical causes for your symptoms. Can I ask you to step on the scale and we'll check your vitals?
PATIENT: Very well. A physical exam. I suppose that’s sensible. Though, as I said, I feel perfectly healthy physically. Still, if you think it’s necessary… lead the way. Let's get this over with, shall we? My time is rather valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Please step onto the scale, Ms. Derasmo. And then, if you would, have a seat on the examination table. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly rapid. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 88. Within acceptable parameters, though slightly elevated. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. Reflexes are normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Physical exam unremarkable. Vitals within normal limits, though slightly elevated blood pressure. No acute findings.
PATIENT: So? Is there something physically wrong with me? I knew it wasn’t anything serious. Honestly, I’ve been feeling this way for months, and I doubt a simple examination will reveal anything of significance. I trust your professional opinion, Doctor, but I do hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. My daughter is already planning a series of appointments, and frankly, I’d rather be in my garden.
DOCTOR: As I suspected, Ms. Derasmo, the physical examination reveals no underlying medical cause for your symptoms. Your vital signs are slightly elevated, which could be attributed to stress. However, the core of your issue appears to be… psychological in nature. Based on your history and presentation, I believe you are experiencing an adjustment disorder, likely related to the recent life changes – the divorce and retirement. It’s not uncommon, though that doesn’t make it any less unpleasant. I'm going to prescribe a low dose antidepressant. It will assist with regulating your neurotransmitters. You'll likely experience some mild side effects initially, but they should subside. I'd also recommend cognitive behavioral therapy, or 'talk therapy', to help you process your emotions and develop coping mechanisms. I'll provide you with a referral to a qualified therapist. It’s important to address these issues proactively. Now, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Antidepressants? Really, Doctor? I thought you were a sensible man. I don’t need drugs to feel better. I need… purpose, I suppose. And perhaps a good cup of tea. Therapy… well, I suppose I can consider it. But frankly, I’m not convinced it will be of much help. I’m a practical woman, Doctor, not one for… emotional navel-gazing. I’ll take the referral, but I make no promises. And as for the medication… I'd rather hold off for now. Let’s see if I can manage this myself, shall we? Is that acceptable? I simply don't want to be reliant on pills.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Derasmo. I've documented your decision regarding the medication. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider if your symptoms persist or worsen. I’ll provide you with the referral information for the therapist, and a list of resources for managing stress and coping with life changes. If you experience any concerning symptoms – such as suicidal thoughts or overwhelming anxiety – please seek immediate medical attention. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that will be all. Frankly, this has been rather… draining. I appreciate your time, though I remain skeptical of your diagnosis. I’m a strong woman, as I’ve said. I’ll manage. I believe I’ll take my leave now. And thank you… again. Though I suspect a good night’s sleep and a bit of gardening will do me more good than any pills or therapy. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Derasmo. Do take care of yourself. .
