DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It's good to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just Teretha is fine, please. Well, it’s this… tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet, you know? Been happening on and off for a couple weeks now. It’s not painful, exactly, just… annoying. I'm hoping it's nothing serious, to be honest. I really don’t have time for a lot of fuss right now.
DOCTOR: “Teretha,” then. Very well. Annoying tingling, you say, in your hands and feet. On and off for two weeks. I understand you'd prefer it not to be anything significant. Can you describe the tingling more precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm, precisely… that’s a good question. It’s like… pins and needles, sometimes. Other times it feels kinda numb, like when your foot falls asleep. Not always both hands and feet at the same time, either. Sometimes just one hand, or just my toes. It seems to come and go, especially when I’m… well, when I’m doing things. Like carrying mail, you know? Though it happens when I’m resting too, which is strange. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Pins and needles," and numbness. Intermittent, affecting different limbs at different times. And exacerbated by activity, but also present at rest. That is somewhat unusual. It’s important to ascertain the cause. Before we proceed, have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not really. I mean, I carry a lot of mail, Doctor. My arms get tired, of course, and my back aches sometimes, but that's just from the weight. But I haven't dropped anything, or tripped, or anything like that. Everything feels like it works, just… tingly. I hope that makes sense. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: “Makes sense,” Teretha. It's helpful to clarify. No associated weakness is good. Now, let's delve a little deeper. Do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No diabetes, no. Blood pressure… the doctor used to say it was a little high, years ago, but I haven't been to a doctor regularly since… well, since my husband passed. He took care of all that. I don't take any medication, if that matters. And I don't have insurance, so… I mostly just try to ignore things and keep moving. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: "Ignoring things" is rarely ideal, Teretha. And the previous history of elevated blood pressure is relevant. I see here your height and weight are noted. Do you have any family history of nerve problems, like neuropathy, or conditions like diabetes or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother had… arthritis, I think. Badly, in her hands. And my father had something with his heart. Not sure what exactly. My sister, she's got… well, she’s always been sickly, but I don’t know what’s wrong with her. It’s not something we talk about much. As for neuropathy… what is that exactly? I’m sorry, I don’t know a lot of these medical terms.
DOCTOR: “Neuropathy” simply refers to nerve damage. There are many causes, including diabetes, certain medications, and autoimmune conditions. Given your family history and the intermittent nature of your symptoms, we'll need to conduct a brief physical examination to assess your reflexes and sensation. Then, depending on those findings, we may need to consider some blood tests. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… ugh. Fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. And quickly, if possible. I have a route to finish today, you see. The sooner we figure this out, the better. So, yes, let’s do the… physical examination. Just try to be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Very well. It will be as expeditious as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll begin with a neurological assessment. First, I’m going to test your reflexes. Please keep your arm relaxed. And now, the other side.
PATIENT: Oh! That's a little… startling. It feels alright, though. Like a little jump. I haven't had that done in… well, a long time. Is that normal? And yes, go ahead, do the other side. Just… a warning next time, maybe?
DOCTOR: The reflex is elicitable, though slightly diminished on both sides. It’s a standard part of the examination. Now, let’s assess your sensation. I’m going to touch this to various points on your hands and feet. Please tell me when you can feel the vibration, and where you feel it. Do you feel anything here?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. I think so. A little… buzzing. Right in my toe, there. It’s not very strong, though. Kind of faint. And it feels… different on this foot than the other one. Is that bad? The other foot feels… numb, almost. Like when it’s been asleep for a little too long, you know? I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Makes sense.” Reduced sensation in your left foot is concerning, Teretha. Reduced vibration sense, along with your reported tingling and diminished reflexes, suggests possible peripheral neuropathy. Now, I'm going to assess your muscle strength. Please resist me as I try to push down on your hands. Push back against me, please.
PATIENT: I’m trying! It's a little hard, my arms are… tired already. From the mail route, you know. I'm not as strong as I used to be. But I’m pushing, I’m pushing! Is that enough? It feels… okay. Like a normal push. But… maybe not as strong as it should be? I hope that makes sense. It’s hard to gauge, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Makes sense.” Reduced strength, along with the other findings, warrants further investigation. Given your history and the examination results, I suspect peripheral neuropathy, but we need to determine the cause. I recommend a blood test to check for diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and signs of inflammation. Do you consent to a blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests… fine. Just… fine. Yes, I consent. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner we know something, the better. I have a lot of mail to deliver, you see. And honestly, I don’t want this getting any worse. Just… tell me where to go. Please. And how long it will take? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, in room three. It should take approximately fifteen minutes for the draw and processing. I will review the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. And please, try to address your overall health. Ignoring these issues will only lead to further complications. Here's a requisition form for the blood work, and the phlebotomist will give you instructions on fasting requirements, if any. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll go get this done. And I’ll try to… take it easy. Though that’s not always easy, you know? Thank you again.
