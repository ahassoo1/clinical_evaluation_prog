DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I’m here because, well, I’m starting to date someone. And I thought it prudent to get a… check-up, shall we say, before things progress. One simply doesn’t want unpleasant surprises, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite prudent, Ms. Pandolfi. A very sensible approach. So, a general check-up to ensure everything is in good working order before… becoming more intimate. I appreciate your foresight. To get started, perhaps we could go through a bit of your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Though I must say, I find all this… questioning a bit much. It's not as though I’m falling apart. But, very well. I have Medicare, if that’s what you’re after. And I’m married, have been for… quite some time now. As for past illnesses... honestly, I can’t recall anything significant. I've always been rather… robust. Is there a particular area you're concerned about?
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful to know, thank you. And you’re right to question – I don’t want to pry unnecessarily. It’s simply standard procedure to get a comprehensive picture. And robust is excellent! It's not about expecting anything to be wrong, Ms. Pandolfi, but about being thorough and preventative. Since you mention not recalling anything significant, let’s start with any surgeries or hospitalizations you might remember, even if they seem minor. And then perhaps we can move onto medications you currently take?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries. Goodness. Well… let me think. There was a tonsillectomy, naturally, when I was a child. Ages ago. And… I had my gallbladder removed, I believe. That was… sometime in the nineties, I suppose. I really don't keep track of these things. Honestly, Doctor, my husband handles all the medical paperwork. As for medications... just a low-dose aspirin, occasionally, if I feel a headache coming on. And a multivitamin, of course. One has to maintain a certain standard, you know. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Pandolfi. Tonsillectomy and gallbladder removal – noted. And the aspirin and multivitamin. Thank you. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a perfectly healthy woman. I've never had an allergy in my life. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to cheap perfume, but that’s hardly a medical condition. I can’t abide strong floral scents, they give me a headache. But actual allergies? No. I assure you. My husband always says I have a cast-iron stomach. He’s a very practical man, my husband.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news, Ms. Pandolfi. A cast-iron stomach is a wonderful thing! And no known allergies are good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history. Really, Doctor? Now you’re going back generations? Honestly. Well… my mother had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my aunt Mildred… she had something. Some sort of… female trouble, I suppose. But she didn’t talk about it much. And my father… he was a very stoic man. Didn't complain about a thing. He smoked a pipe, of course, but lived to be eighty-five. I doubt there’s much of a pattern there. Is this truly necessary? It feels…invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Pandolfi, and I apologize if it feels invasive. It’s not about finding something wrong, but about understanding potential risks. High blood pressure and a history of… female trouble, as you put it, are helpful to know. And your father's longevity is encouraging. Let’s move onto something a little different, if you don’t mind. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle. Honestly, Doctor. What is a lifestyle? I maintain a respectable home. I entertain occasionally. I volunteer at the church. I ensure my husband is well-fed and comfortable. I wouldn’t say I’m particularly… athletic. I prefer quiet evenings to strenuous activity. Is that sufficient? I don't spend my time skydiving or running marathons, if that’s what you’re inquiring about.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly sufficient, Ms. Pandolfi. A respectable home, entertaining, volunteering – those are all very admirable activities. And quiet evenings are perfectly valid. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I just want to ask one final question, if you don’t mind. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Absolutely not. I came here for a precautionary check-up, Doctor, not because I’m ailing. I feel perfectly fine. Perhaps a little… preoccupied, if you must know. One simply wants to be certain everything is in order before… embarking on a new chapter. But symptoms? No. I assure you. Is this finally nearing an end? I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, I understand. No current symptoms, and a precautionary check-up before a new chapter. Very well. In that case, let’s proceed with a brief physical exam, just to ensure everything is as you believe it is. It will be quite quick. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, a check of your blood pressure, and a brief abdominal examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. A brief exam. I insist on brief, Doctor. I haven't got all day. And please, be gentle. I’m not accustomed to being… prodded. Do proceed. But quickly, if you please. My luncheon awaits. And I do hope this won’t mess up my hair.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. Brief and gentle, I promise. I'll be as quick and considerate as possible. Okay, just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. Slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range considering your…preoccupation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Everything feels normal here. Everything appears to be within normal limits, Ms. Pandolfi. Your overall health seems good. I would recommend monitoring your blood pressure, though. Perhaps reducing salt intake and managing stress could be beneficial.
PATIENT: Well. That wasn't nearly as unpleasant as I anticipated. Monitoring my blood pressure… reducing salt… managing stress. Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds rather tiresome. But thank you, I suppose. And is that… all? Can I finally depart? I really mustn’t be late for my luncheon. It’s with the ladies from the church, and Beatrice makes a truly dreadful gossip if one arrives after the cucumber sandwiches are served.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, that is all. Your physical exam was normal, and I’ve noted my recommendations. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of our visit for you, and a few handouts on managing blood pressure. I wish you a lovely luncheon, and please, don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
