DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Fontanazza, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, the lady on the phone… she said something about… learning? I work with metal, you know. Sheets. Big sheets. Not much to learn about that. It’s… work.
DOCTOR: Learning, yes. That was… a miscommunication, I assure you. The receptionist sometimes… Well. Let’s focus. You said you work with metal sheets?
PATIENT: Yeah. Big ones. And small ones. I cut them. Bend them. Make… things. For buildings, mostly. My husband, he does the… the fixing. I just… make the shapes. It’s hot work. Very hot. What do you want to know? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Hot work… Right. And are you experiencing any… problems related to this work?
PATIENT: Problems? Like… what kind of problems? I get tired, of course. It's heavy. And my hands… they get cuts sometimes. Small ones. Bandaids fix it. Is that a problem? I don't understand why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, cuts… It’s good you’re addressing them. We’re here to make sure nothing more serious is developing. Have you noticed any… swelling in your hands or wrists, beyond the cuts?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… Sometimes. But I thought that was just… from holding things so much. Everything feels a little puffy at the end of the day. My ankles too, sometimes. But who doesn't have puffy ankles? It's August! It's hot!
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Not really. I mean, I get headaches sometimes. Everyone gets headaches. And my back… aches. From bending metal, you see. But it’s just… work. My mother had… something with her stomach, I think. But I don’t have that. I don’t think. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never. I don't like pills. My husband takes… something for his blood pressure, I think. Little white ones. But I don't take anything. I drink tea. That helps. And sometimes… a little ginger. Why are you asking all these questions? It's about the metal, right? Not my tea.
DOCTOR: I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your health, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s standard procedure. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, not shellfish. I don’t really like shellfish. But I’m not allergic. My husband is allergic to… cats, I think. He sneezes. But I can handle cats just fine. Are we done yet? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and examine your hands and wrists. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Examine my hands? I make things with my hands. You want to examine hands that cut metal? They’re probably dirty. And calloused. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But make it quick.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I'll start with your blood pressure. 160 over 95… concerning. Hands are warm to the touch, some redness present, moderate calluses as expected, and mild edema in the metacarpophalangeal joints. Responds to light touch. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your hands?
PATIENT: Numbness? Not really. Sometimes they feel… tired. Like I said. They cut metal all day. That’s probably it. Tingling… no. Unless… Sometimes, after a really long day, when I’m trying to sleep, they feel… funny. Like little pins. But it goes away. It’s nothing. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little dizzy now. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Pins and needles… dizziness… Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Considering your elevated blood pressure, the swelling in your hands, and the intermittent tingling, I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying issues. We’ll also check your kidney function and look for signs of inflammation. I also recommend a consultation with a rheumatologist. They specialize in conditions affecting the joints and can better assess the cause of your symptoms. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? A… a what-ologist? Look, I just cut metal. I don’t need fancy tests and doctors. My husband can fix anything with a wrench. I'm wasting my whole day here. No. I don't think so. I'm perfectly fine. Just… tired. And a little dizzy. Maybe I need more tea. I don’t want any tests. I'm leaving now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your reluctance, but your health is my primary concern. While you may feel fine now, these symptoms could indicate a serious underlying issue. Ignoring them could lead to further complications. I strongly advise you to reconsider. However, I respect your autonomy. I will document your refusal of testing and consultation. Given your elevated blood pressure, I strongly recommend you follow up with your primary care physician within the next week for further evaluation. I will provide you with a written summary of our discussion and a referral note, should you choose to seek further medical attention. Here is a list of resources for managing high blood pressure, and contact information for local primary care physicians. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. I'll… I'll think about it. But I'm still telling you, it's just the metal. And maybe the heat. Waste of a whole afternoon. Tell your receptionist to be more clear next time. .
