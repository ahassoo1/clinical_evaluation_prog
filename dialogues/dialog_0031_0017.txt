DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to begin, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… a team. A sports team. I gotta… get checked, I think. For tryouts. Yes. Tryouts. It’s… important. I forget what they call it, this check-up thing. It’s for… bein’ sure I’m still able. You know? Still got it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you’re referring to a pre-participation physical exam, often called a sports physical. That’s perfectly alright – many people forget the terminology. It's a good idea to get checked out before starting any new or intense physical activity. To help me get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me what sport you're trying out for, and what level of competition?
PATIENT: Competition…? Uh… hmm. That's a good question. It's… local. Very local. Down at the park, mostly. With the… the other fellas. It’s… softball. Yes, softball! That’s it. Not fancy, you understand. Just… to keep movin’. I ain’t lookin’ to be a… a star or nothin’. Just… softball. I think. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, local softball league. That's helpful. And you mentioned it’s been a while since you've played regularly. Can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall… health? Hmm. Well, I… I get tired easier these days, I suppose. Ain't what I used to be. And my knees… they make noise. A lot of noise. clicks tongue Especially when I gotta… go down the stairs. Or get up from a chair. It’s just… old age, I figure. I don’t… I don’t go to the doctor much. Never have, really. Just… when somethin’ really hurts. You understand.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Bartok. It’s common to not visit the doctor regularly unless something is significantly bothering you. Fatigue and knee discomfort are good things to bring up. Let's talk a little more about this fatigue. When did you start noticing it?
PATIENT: Noticin’ it… oh, gosh. It’s been… slow, like. Over the years. Maybe… five, six years ago? Hard to say, really. Just… gettin’ winded quicker. Used to be able to… mow the whole lawn in one go, you know? Now I gotta… take breaks. Sit down a bit. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. A man should be able to mow a lawn. shakes head slightly But… that’s how it is now. I guess.
DOCTOR: It's not embarrassing at all to acknowledge changes in your body, Mr. Bartok. It’s actually very responsible to bring these things to my attention. It helps me get a better picture of your overall health. Now, regarding your knees… is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: It ain't a sharp pain, no. More of a… grindin’ feelin’. Like… rocks rubbin’ together. demonstrates rubbing his knuckles together And a little bit of a… pop, sometimes. When I bend ‘em. It don’t hurt all the time, but… it’s always there. A little reminder, you know? Especially when it’s cold. Or rainy. Makes ‘em stiff. Real stiff. And then the pop. shrugs It’s just… old knees, I guess. I ain’t expectin’ miracles.
DOCTOR: Okay, grinding sensation with popping, worsened by cold and rain. That's helpful information. And you’ve mentioned fatigue and knee discomfort. Have you experienced any pain in other joints, or any swelling in your hands, feet, or ankles?
PATIENT: Swellin’… hmm. I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit in my… ankles, sometimes. At the end of the day. But I figured that was just from… bein’ on my feet. I do a little work, you know? Construction, mostly. Not fancy stuff. Just… helpin’ out. But no real swellin’. And no pain in my hands… not that I remember. I can still… grip things pretty good. demonstrates clenching his fist See? Still got some strength left. chuckles softly Though, it ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ankle swelling at the end of the day, but no pain in the hands. Good to know. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, such as a cold, the flu, or anything else?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses…? pauses, tapping his chin Let me think. I had a bit of a… cough, last winter. Just a little cough. Nothin’ serious. Took some… somethin’ from the store. Made it go away. And… oh, I think my neighbor gave me his cold, a few months back. Just a sniffle. Nothin’ to write home about. I ain’t been sick sick in… a long time. Knock on wood. taps the arm of the chair I try to stay away from folks when they’re coughin’ and sneezin’. Smartest thing you can do, really.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Mr. Bartok. Avoiding sick people is always a good idea. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… frowns, looking up as if searching his memory Oh, gosh. Doctor… I don’t really… remember. I ain’t been to a doctor much, like I said. I think… maybe my blood pressure was a little high, once? The nurse at the pharmacy said somethin’ about it, when I got my flu shot. But she didn’t say nothin’ about… a condition or anythin’. Just said to… watch my salt. And… no, I don’t think I got… diabetes or heart disease. Not that I know of. I feel… okay. Mostly. Just… old. You understand? It’s just… the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm. Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a little boy. Fallin’ out of a tree. They put a cast on it. That’s about it, I think. No hospital stays… not unless you count when I was born. chuckles softly But that don’t count, does it? I ain’t been… seriously sick enough to go to the hospital. I’m a pretty tough fella, you know? I’ve always been able to… tough things out. That’s how my father raised me. shakes head slightly But no… no surgeries, not since that broken arm when I was a kid.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the childhood broken arm. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any health conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… pauses, thinking deeply My father… he had a bad heart, I think. He passed away when I was young. Not a young young, but… not old, either. Something with his heart. And my mother… she had… I don’t really remember. She passed away a long time ago. I think… maybe high blood pressure? But I don’t really know for sure. Nobody really talked about those things when I was growin’ up. It was… different back then. We didn’t worry so much about… conditions and whatnot. shrugs So… I guess maybe heart disease on my father’s side, and maybe high blood pressure on my mother’s. But I can’t say for sure. It’s all a little… blurry, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. It's common for family medical history to be uncertain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. pauses, tapping his chin thoughtfully Not that I know of, Doctor. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a problem with… shellfish or peanuts or nothin’. I take a little somethin’ for my knees, sometimes. Over-the-counter stuff. But that don’t bother me. And… no, I don’t think I got any allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Never had to carry one of those… EpiPen things. chuckles softly So… no allergies. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just that little somethin’ for my knees. Like I said, over-the-counter. Helps with the… grindin’. I think it's got… ibuprofen in it. Or somethin’ like that. And sometimes, when I’m feelin’ a little achy, I take a little… Tylenol. But that's about it. No vitamins, no fancy supplements. Just… the knee stuff and the Tylenol when I need it. I don’t really believe in all those… pills and whatnot. Unless I really need ‘em. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Okay, Mr. Bartok, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. It shouldn’t take too long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds… alright. Go ahead. As long as it don't involve too much… pokin’ and proddin’. I ain’t afraid of a little checkin’, but… I get a little nervous with needles, you know? chuckles softly But go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready. Let’s get this done. I got things to do, you know? Softball tryouts ain’t gonna wait forever. flexes his bicep playfully Gotta stay in shape!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bartok. I understand completely. We'll keep the "pokin’ and proddin’" to a minimum, and I'll let you know before we do anything that might be uncomfortable. No needles today, I promise. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Relaxin’. Easy for you to say. settles back in the chair with a slight sigh But go ahead, Doctor. I’m tryin’. Just… try not to squeeze too tight, alright? My arm ain't as young as it used to be. extends his arm with a slight grimace Let’s get this over with. Softball awaits!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok, your blood pressure is 148 over 88. That's a little elevated. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Elevated, huh? frowns slightly That ain't good, is it? Should I be… worryin’? I told you, I don't really go to the doctor much. Maybe it's just… nerves. All this talk about blood pressure and whatnot. takes a few deep breaths, as instructed Just… tell me if you hear somethin’ bad, alright? I don't need a lot of… fancy medical terms. Just… good or bad. closes his eyes briefly Deep breaths… deep breaths… Softball… Softball…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not necessarily cause for alarm, but it's something we should investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me, and tell me where you’re feeling the discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort, huh? slowly bends his knees, wincing slightly Right… here. On both sides. points to the sides of his knees It’s a grindin’ feelin’. Like… rocks rubbin’ together. demonstrates rubbing his knuckles together And a little bit of a pop. bends his knees again, a more pronounced pop is audible Hear that? That’s what I’m talkin’ about. It ain’t painful, exactly. Just… annoying. And it makes me worry about… pullin’ somethin’ during the tryouts. straightens his legs slowly See? Not too bad, but… somethin’ ain’t right. It’s just… old knees, Doctor. I told you. It’s just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. I feel some crepitus, which is the grinding sensation you’re describing, in both knees. There's no significant swelling or warmth, and your range of motion is good, although it's slightly limited by the crepitus. It sounds like you have some osteoarthritis, which is a common condition in older adults. It’s a wear-and-tear condition of the joints. Now, to get a better idea of the extent of the arthritis, I’d like to order some X-rays of your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays…? frowns deeply Oh, gosh. You mean… like, seein’ the bones? I don’t know, Doctor. I ain’t really fond of all this… lookin’ inside my body. Is it… necessary? Can’t you just… tell me what’s wrong without all the… machines and whatnot? I mean, I know my knees ain’t perfect. They’re old! shakes his head slightly I just wanna make sure I can still play softball. Is that too much to ask? looks at me pleadingly Can’t we just… try some ice? Or maybe a little somethin’ for the pain? I really don’t wanna go gettin’ X-rays. It sounds… complicated. And expensive. clutches his wallet nervously
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Bartok. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about X-rays. They do involve a small amount of radiation, although it’s a very low dose. And you’re right, they can be expensive. However, the X-rays will give us a much clearer picture of the condition of your knee joints and help us determine the best course of treatment. We can see the extent of the cartilage loss and any bone spurs that may be contributing to your discomfort. If you’re not comfortable with the X-rays at this time, we can try a more conservative approach. We can start with some physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees, some over-the-counter pain relievers, and some ice and heat therapy. However, without the X-rays, it’s difficult to rule out other potential problems. And if your symptoms don’t improve with conservative treatment, we may need to consider other options, such as injections or even surgery. Ultimately, the decision is up to you, Mr. Bartok. I’m happy to answer any questions you have and help you weigh the risks and benefits of each option. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Sighs deeply, running a hand through his thinning hair. Alright, Doctor. If you really think it’s necessary… then okay. I guess I’ll get the X-rays. But… can we just do one knee? The left one’s been botherin’ me a little more. And… can you write down the instructions really clear? I ain’t good with… fancy medical speak. And… will insurance cover it? Medicare, I mean. I don’t wanna get a big bill. Looks at me with a worried expression. But… okay. X-rays. Just… one knee. And please, be gentle. And explain everything to me afterwards. I don’t want any surprises. Softball… Softball… I just want to play Softball.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bartok. We’ll start with an X-ray of just the left knee. I’m writing a referral order for you to take to the imaging center down the street. I’ll also include detailed instructions, written in plain language, explaining what to expect during the procedure. I’ll also check with Medicare to confirm your coverage. Most likely, the X-ray will be covered, but it’s always best to double-check. I'll have my nurse call you tomorrow with the results of that check. And don’t worry, the procedure is very straightforward and not painful. It involves simply standing or lying still while the machine takes a few pictures. The technician will explain everything to you before you begin. After the X-rays, the results will be sent to me, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Nods slowly, a slightly less worried expression on his face. Yeah… that sounds better. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything real clear. And checkin’ with Medicare is a big help. I appreciate that. Reaches for the referral order. Okay… so I just take this to the center down the street? And they’ll… take the picture? And then you’ll… look at it? It sounds… complicated. But… okay. I’ll try it. Clutches the referral order tightly. Softball… gotta be ready for Softball. Stands up slowly, wincing slightly as his knees protest. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. Starts to walk toward the door, a little unsure of his steps. I guess I’ll see you… after the picture?
DOCTOR: Yes, you just take the referral to the imaging center. They’ll take the picture, and then the results will be sent directly to my office. I’ll call you as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I wish you all the best, Mr. Bartok, and I hope you’re back on the softball field soon!
