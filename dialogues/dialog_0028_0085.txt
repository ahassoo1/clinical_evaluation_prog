DOCTOR: Right. Gabbrielle Bartock, 31. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this patch of skin, really. It’s… different. Not painful, thankfully, but noticeably… off-color. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month. I noticed it when I was putting on sunscreen, actually. Quite distracting.
DOCTOR: "Off-color," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not a nice color, if I’m honest. It's… sort of grayish, but not a solid gray. More like… faded. And it’s on my left forearm, just below the elbow. Not something one expects at my age, is it? I take very good care of my skin, you know. Always have. SPF 50, minimum.
DOCTOR: SPF 50 and still… interesting. Let's have a look. Please, roll up your sleeve. Don’t get me started on people not protecting their skin; it’s a disaster.
PATIENT: Yes, well, one should be diligent. It’s just… frustrating. And it's not as though I spend all day out in the sun, either. Mostly indoor work, you know. Archiving. Delicate things. One can't be too careful with old documents or one’s complexion.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. It’s… a discoloration. Not particularly alarming, but… not normal, either. A little dry, perhaps. No noticeable lumps or bumps. Is there any itching?
PATIENT: No itching at all. Absolutely none. And it's not raised. Perfectly smooth, actually, aside from the… the color, of course. It just is. That’s what’s so unsettling about it. One expects something to accompany an oddity like this, don’t you think? A little texture, a little soreness... something. But it's just… there. It's very peculiar.
DOCTOR: Right. Peculiar. Have you noticed any other changes to your skin anywhere else?
PATIENT: No. Just this. And, honestly, I would have noticed. I examine myself regularly. It's part of… maintaining standards, you understand. I haven't had any moles change, no new rashes, no excessive dryness anywhere else. It’s distinctly localized to this one spot. It’s not like it’s spreading, thankfully. At least, not yet. But one does worry, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: Worrying is unproductive. Have you been exposed to any new chemicals or detergents recently?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. Not that I’m aware of. I use the same products I’ve always used. Mild soap, unscented lotion. I'm rather particular about what I put on my skin. My husband handles the laundry, and he hasn’t changed anything either. He’s quite set in his ways, you see. One could hardly expect him to experiment with new washing powders, would one? It’s all very… stable, usually. That’s what’s so odd about this whole situation.
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies noted… unremarkable past medical history. It’s likely a minor dermatological issue. Perhaps a slight pigmentation change. We can try a topical steroid cream. It's probably nothing. I'll write you a prescription.
PATIENT: A topical steroid cream? Is that… all? It just seems… rather dismissive, doesn’t it? I mean, surely some further investigation is warranted? Perhaps a skin biopsy, just to be certain? I'm not trying to be difficult, but it feels rather… cavalier to simply prescribe a cream for something unexplained. One doesn’t simply ignore anomalies, does one?
DOCTOR: A biopsy?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Wouldn’t that be the sensible course of action? To determine the cause of the discoloration, not just treat a symptom? I understand you’re busy, but I would feel much more comfortable knowing precisely what we’re dealing with here. It’s not about being alarmist, it’s about being… thorough. Surely a responsible medical professional would agree? I work with fragile historical artifacts all day; I appreciate the importance of proper assessment. It’s a matter of principle, really.
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve been doing this for six years. I can usually tell what's going on without resorting to invasive procedures. But… …fine. If it will put your mind at ease, I’ll refer you to a dermatologist. But I assure you, it’s likely nothing. I'll need to get some paperwork started. Don’t expect a quick appointment; they’re usually booked solid.
PATIENT: Very good. I appreciate that, thank you. I do prefer to be certain, you see. It’s far better to be safe than sorry. And I understand they're likely busy; I'm quite accustomed to waiting for things to be properly assessed. Delicate work takes time, after all. Though, if you happen to have the name of a particularly… conscientious dermatologist, I would be most grateful. Someone who appreciates a thorough approach, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Dr. Volkov. He’s… adequate. I’ll write his number on the form. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: That's very kind of you. Dr. Volkov, noted. No, I believe that's all for today. Though, just to clarify, will I need to schedule the appointment myself, or will your office be handling that? I wouldn't want to cause any unnecessary disruption. And thank you again for… accommodating my concerns. It is, after all, better to be cautious. One can never be too careful, can one?
DOCTOR: She handles scheduling. And yes, it's always better to be… meticulous. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Good day.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you for your time. Good day.
