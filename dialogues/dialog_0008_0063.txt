DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual. I… I have the cancer, you know? And this pain… it feels different this time.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here in your chart you’ve been diagnosed with cancer. And you’re saying this back pain is new or different from what you’ve experienced before?
PATIENT: Different, yeah. It’s… hard to explain. Before, it was more like a dull ache. All the time. Now it comes in sharp waves. Like someone is stabbing me, then it goes away for a little bit. And it’s… lower down now, too. More on my right side. Does that make sense? I try to remember how it used to feel, but… it's all kinda blurry.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Sharp, stabbing pain that comes and goes, and localized more to your right lower back…okay. And when did you first notice this change in the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week ago? No, maybe a little longer. Maybe ten days. I was gardening, pulling weeds, and I bent over… and oof. Just a really bad pain. It didn't go away like it usually does after I rest. It just kept getting worse each day. I tried some of the pain pills the doctor gave me before, but they don't seem to be helping much this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started with bending over while gardening about ten days ago, and the pain hasn't improved with rest or your usual pain medication. Do you recall anything specific about the pain immediately after you bent over?
PATIENT: Right after… well, it felt like something shifted. Like a muscle pulled, but… deeper. Hard to explain. It wasn’t just a muscle ache, it was… a bad feeling. And it made it hard to stand up straight. I had to kinda bend to the side to get back on my feet. I didn’t think much of it at first, just figured I pulled something. But then it didn’t get better, and the pain just kept getting sharper.
DOCTOR: Okay, a shifting sensation with the initial injury, followed by a sharp pain that hasn't improved. We need to investigate this further. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. Not yet, anyway. My legs feel… normal. A little weak sometimes, if I’m walking a long way, but that's probably just me getting old, you know? But no tingling, no… pins and needles feeling or anything like that. Just the pain. Mostly in my back, but sometimes it shoots down my leg a little. Not all the way to my foot, just… in my thigh.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, just pain radiating into your thigh. And you mentioned you have a history of cancer. Can you tell me what type of cancer, and what treatment you've had?
PATIENT: It’s… it’s in my lung. Small cell. They found it about two years ago, I think. I had… chemotherapy. A lot of it. It shrunk the tumor, but it never went completely away. Then I did some radiation. It’s been… okay for a while, but they said it could come back. We do scans every few months to check. That’s what I’m worried about now… if this back pain is… you know. If it spread.
DOCTOR: Okay, small cell lung cancer with prior chemotherapy and radiation. You're understandably concerned about possible metastasis. Given your history and the change in your pain, we definitely need to investigate this further. I'm going to start with a physical exam, and then I'd like to order some imaging. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just… I don't want it to be bad news. I’ve been trying to… enjoy things, you know? But this pain is making it hard. The scan… will it show if it spread?
DOCTOR: Yes, an MRI of your spine will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. It will help us determine if there’s any involvement of the spine or surrounding tissues. Alright, let’s start with the physical exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My back is pretty sensitive, so… be careful?
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to palpate your spine to feel for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Please let me know immediately if anything is particularly painful. Tell me when I press on a spot that hurts. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Oof! Right there… yeah, that one hurts. And… a little bit to the left of that one, too. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a deep ache when you press on it. Be careful, please. It’s… tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness noted on the lower back, slightly to the left. Now I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you gently bend forward, trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof! Not very far… I can’t go much further without it really hurting. It feels like something is blocking me. And it makes the pain shoot down my leg a little when I try to bend. That wasn’t very good, was it? It hurts to bend forward now, even more than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with pain on forward flexion. I'm noting that as well. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact in both legs. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes! That one, on the right. It shoots pain down my leg, right in the back of my thigh. Not a sharp pain, but a really uncomfortable stretching feeling. The left one is okay, doesn't hurt much at all. I don’t like that test… it makes it hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, positive straight leg raise on the right side, indicating possible nerve root irritation. Alright, Ms. Meigs, thank you. That gives me a much better understanding of what's going on. Based on the exam, and your history, it's concerning for possible nerve compression or irritation, possibly related to a disc issue or, given your cancer history, potential metastasis. I’m going to order an MRI of your spine to get a clearer picture. I'll also want to review your recent scan results. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Metastasis… that’s what I was afraid of. So you think it could be the cancer spreading? The MRI will tell you that for sure? And what happens if it is the cancer? What can they do? I just… I don’t want to go through all that again, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Meigs. The MRI will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on and help us determine the cause of your pain. It’s possible it’s not related to the cancer, but given your history, we need to rule that out. If it is metastasis, treatment options depend on several factors, including the extent of the spread and your overall health. We can discuss options like radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and potentially even surgery. There are also pain management strategies we can employ to help improve your quality of life. Right now, let’s focus on getting the MRI done. I’ll get the order sent to the radiology department and they'll schedule you for an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a stronger pain medication to help manage the discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A stronger pain medication would be good. This is… it’s hard to do things when it hurts like this. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining things… even the scary parts. I appreciate it. When should I expect to hear about the MRI results? A few days?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. We’ll get the MRI scheduled for as soon as possible, typically within 24-48 hours. The results usually take a couple of days to be interpreted by the radiologist. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you oxycodone 5mg. Take one tablet every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. Do not exceed 10 tablets per day. I’ll also have my nurse give you a list of potential side effects. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I just… I hope it’s not bad news. I’ll wait for the nurse to call about the MRI.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to get you answers quickly. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or if your pain worsens. My nurse will be in touch shortly. Take care now.
