DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Withycombe, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Enrique Withycombe. But please, call me Enrique. It’s… easier.
DOCTOR: Easier for you, perhaps. So, Enrique, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Ronnisha, yes? I’ve been… flushing. My face gets very red. And my neck. It happens sometimes when I… when I talk to people. Not always, but often enough it’s… bothersome. It started maybe three months ago, I think. Around June.
DOCTOR: Three months… approximately. And it’s localized to the face and neck?
PATIENT: Yes. Only my face and neck. Not my… chest, or arms, or anywhere else. Just… up here. <gestures to face and neck> It feels warm too, when it happens. Not a fever warm, just… flushed. Like I’ve been out in the sun, maybe. But I haven't been!
DOCTOR: Warm, you say. And does anything specifically trigger this flushing, or is it… random?
PATIENT: Hmm. Random is… a good word, I think. But… no, not really random. It’s… when I get a little… excited, maybe? Or nervous. Talking to people, like now, is a big one. Also, sometimes when I remember… things. Old things. Not sad things, just… important things. It's hard to explain. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Important things…right. And how long does this flushing last when it occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, not long. Usually just a few minutes. Maybe five minutes, the most. Then it goes away. It’s just… embarrassing, you know? I don't like people staring. It makes it… worse, actually. Then I really flush! It's a… a circle. A bad circle. <fidgets with his hands>
DOCTOR: A 'circle', yes. And have you noticed anything else associated with this?
PATIENT: Associated…? Let me think. <pauses, taps chin> Sometimes my heart… beats a little faster. Not a racing heart, just… a little quicker than normal. And… my hands get a little… sweaty. Just the palms. Not like… dripping, but you can tell. It’s all… together. Flushing, faster heart, sweaty hands. It's always that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Enrique?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I haven’t taken any… pills in a long time. Not since… well, it doesn’t matter. I don’t like pills. They make me… feel strange. I just… try to manage on my own. <looks down at his hands> Mostly.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything. I eat… most foods. Sometimes spicy food makes me sweat a little, but that’s just the spice! Not an allergy. I don’t have… hay fever or anything like that. Just the usual little things. Nothing serious. <shrugs slightly>
DOCTOR: Step on the scale, please. And then we'll take your blood pressure. Don't talk while I'm doing it. It interferes with the reading.
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, the scale. <gets up slowly and walks towards the scale, glancing around the room> I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time. <steps onto the scale> It’s… not my favorite thing, honestly. <waits quietly>
DOCTOR: 121 pounds. Right. Now, stay still. And breathe normally. I need a clear reading.
PATIENT: Okay, 121. That… sounds right. <sits very still, closing his eyes and taking slow, deep breaths> I am trying to be very still. And breathing. Like you said. It's… difficult to remember to breathe sometimes. <waits in silence>
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. It’s not alarming, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, hospitalizations, or surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Not recently. Nothing… serious. I had the flu, maybe five years ago? But that was just a bad cold. No hospital. No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I try to… stay healthy. <fidgets with his hands again> That's why I'm here, I think. To… stay healthy.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Hmm. My father… he had problems with his heart. Not like… a sudden thing, but… he got very tired easily. And my mother… she worried a lot. A lot. That's not… a disease, I suppose. But she was always anxious. They both… passed away a long time ago. <looks down, briefly> It's a… long story.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. And do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not even a sip of alcohol. It… doesn't agree with me. And no smoking. No drugs. Never. I don't like those things. They… confuse my mind. I prefer to be clear. Always. <looks directly at Dr. Memmolo with a slight frown> It’s very important to me. To be clear.
DOCTOR: Right. So, to summarize: Flushing episodes triggered by talking or remembering things, lasting a few minutes, accompanied by a faster heartbeat and sweaty palms. No medications, allergies, or substance use. Elevated blood pressure. Family history of heart problems and anxiety. Now...<pauses, glancing at the screen> It's likely anxiety-related, but we need to rule out other possibilities. <looks up, with a slight glare> I'm going to order some blood work. Basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and thyroid function tests. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds good. Blood work. I can do blood work. When… when will I get the results? And will it… hurt? I don’t like needles very much. <looks apprehensive> And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? To… help the flushing? Before the results? Just… something?
DOCTOR: The lab is next door. It will be a routine blood draw. A slight pinch, that's all. Results should be back in about a week. In the meantime...<pauses, types rapidly> avoid caffeine and try to manage your stress. I suppose you could try some deep breathing exercises. But honestly, Enrique, it sounds like you need to learn to cope with your anxiety. I'm not a therapist, and I doubt a few breathing exercises will fix everything. <looks up, with a condescending expression> We'll discuss the results when they come back. <starts to type a referral order> I’m also going to refer you to a psychologist. Consider it. <pauses> Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A psychologist…? <frowns slightly> No. No, I don't think so. Not right now. <looks down at his hands again> A week… that’s a long time. Caffeine… I don’t drink much caffeine. Just a little tea sometimes. And… managing stress. That’s… hard. <pauses> The flushing… will it get worse while I wait? Is there… anything at all I can take, even over the counter, to stop it when it happens? Just… something to calm me down? <looks up hopefully>
DOCTOR: Here are the lab orders. And no, there’s nothing I recommend over-the-counter. Do not self-medicate. It will likely just exacerbate the problem. <hands the paper to Enrique>. If it gets significantly worse, go to the emergency room. Otherwise, schedule a follow-up appointment for next week. <pauses, looking at the chart> That will be all. <stands up, signaling the end of the consultation>. .
PATIENT: Oh. Emergency room… <takes the paper slowly> Okay. <looks down at it, then back up at Dr. Memmolo with a slightly confused expression> Thank you, Doctor. I… I think I understand. <hesitates, then slowly gets up> Bye. <walks slowly towards the door, looking lost> .
