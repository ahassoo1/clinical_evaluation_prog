DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Dr. Glowka, is it? Honestly, I haven’t got all day. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like tar. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. Is that what this is about? I just want to know if it’s serious and if I need to stop the pills. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concern and that you're short on time, and we'll do our best to be efficient. Black, tarry stools are definitely something we need to investigate. It could be related to the pain pills, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities. Just to clarify, when did you first notice the change in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… maybe a week ago? Or was it ten days? Honestly, they all blend together. It wasn’t right away after I took the pill, not always. It just… started happening. And it’s not every time, mind you. Sometimes it’s normal, sometimes it’s… not. Why does it matter when? It’s black, isn’t that enough?
DOCTOR: It matters because the timing can help us pinpoint the cause, Ms. Hatchard. But you’re right to point out that black stools are concerning, regardless. We need to determine the source of the bleeding, if that is indeed what it is. To help me understand a little better, besides the change in stool color, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness gracious, what kind of symptoms? I’m an old woman with arthritis, of course I have symptoms! My knees ache, my back hurts, I get tired easily. Is that what you want to know? I thought we were talking about the… the problem. Honestly, I just want to know if I'm dying or not. Is that so much to ask? And don’t tell me to be patient, I really haven’t got the time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize if my questions seem slow. It’s not my intention to upset you. I absolutely want to get to the bottom of this and address your concerns directly. And I will certainly not tell you to be patient if you don't have the time for that. When you say "the problem," you mean the black stools, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The black stools! Are they dangerous? Is it something serious? And do I need to stop taking my pain pills? They're the only thing that lets me garden, you know. Honestly, if I can't garden, what's the point? This whole thing is very upsetting. Just tell me straight, doctor. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. I want to be very clear with you. Black, tarry stools usually indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract – the esophagus, stomach, or the beginning of the small intestine. That is something we need to investigate. It could be caused by a number of things, and the pain pills can be a contributing factor, but we can't rule out other possibilities without doing some tests. It's important to determine the source of the bleeding. To do that, I’d like to start with a physical exam, and then I'll order some blood work. We may also need to consider a stool test to check for blood, and potentially an endoscopy – a procedure where we look at your digestive tract with a camera. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I’ve taken everything under the sun. I’m Czech, you know. We’re a tough people. No allergies. Just get on with it, doctor. What kind of blood work? And what is this… endoscopy thing? Is it painful? Honestly, I’m not fond of poking and prodding. And will it make me sick? I’ve got a luncheon next week.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concerns. The blood work will be a standard complete blood count to check for anemia – low red blood cell count, which can be a sign of bleeding – and we'll also check your liver and kidney function. The endoscopy involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end that's gently inserted down your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum . It allows us to visualize the lining of your digestive tract and identify any potential sources of bleeding, like ulcers or inflammation. You will be given medication to make you comfortable during the procedure. Most people don’t feel any pain, but you might feel some pressure. You will likely be a little drowsy afterward, and you may have a mild sore throat. It's a relatively safe procedure, but like any medical test, it does carry some risks. We’ll discuss those in detail if we decide to proceed. Before we talk about procedures, though, let’s do a quick exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But I warn you, my knees aren’t what they used to be. And don’t expect me to be cooperative if it’s uncomfortable. Honestly, this is all rather undignified for a woman of my age. [I carefully maneuver myself onto the examination table with a grunt.] Just hurry up, doctor. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hatchard. I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll take things slowly. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem a little… diminished. And your abdomen is slightly tender in the upper left quadrant. Do you usually feel any pain or discomfort in that area?
PATIENT: Diminished? Tender? Honestly, I’m always a little tender somewhere! I’m seventy-three years old, doctor, not a spring chicken! That upper left quadrant… that’s where my… well, never you mind. It’s always a little uncomfortable there, especially after I eat. I just thought it was indigestion. Honestly, I’ve had indigestion for years. Is that what this is about? Indigestion? [I shift uncomfortably on the table.] Just tell me straight, doctor. Is it serious? And do I need to stop my pills?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hatchard. It's good that you're able to describe what you're feeling. Diminished bowel sounds and tenderness can be related to indigestion, but given the black stools, we need to investigate further to rule out other possibilities. Regarding your pain pills, I’m not going to tell you to stop taking them immediately. However, we need to determine if they are contributing to the bleeding. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm going to check your reflexes now, just as a standard part of the exam.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Heavens, what are you looking for? Honestly, this is all rather a lot. I just want to know if I’m dying or not, and if I can still garden! [I tense as Dr. Glowka checks my reflexes.] Just get on with it, doctor. This is very upsetting. And please, be gentle. My hips aren’t what they used to be. Honestly, you young people just don’t understand what it’s like to get old.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious, but it's good to have a baseline. Okay, Ms. Hatchard, I've completed the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam – the diminished bowel sounds, tenderness in your upper left quadrant, and the black stools – I’m concerned about possible bleeding in your upper digestive tract. The pain pills could be a factor, but we can't rule out other causes, like an ulcer or gastritis. I want to order some blood work, as we discussed, to check for anemia and assess your liver and kidney function. I also want to order a stool test to confirm the presence of blood. Would you be willing to discuss the possibility of an endoscopy?
PATIENT: An endoscopy… honestly, I don’t like the sound of that at all. A camera down my throat? Heavens, no! Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just give me something for my stomach? Some pills? Honestly, I’ve always been able to handle things with pills. This all seems rather drastic, doctor. And what if it hurts? What if I get sick? I have a luncheon next week, you know! [I fold my arms tightly across my chest.] Just tell me straight, doctor. Is it life-threatening? If it isn't, I'm not doing anything drastic. And I'm not having a camera shoved down my throat.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Hatchard. An endoscopy isn’t the most pleasant procedure, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious about it. To answer your question directly, based on the information we have now, it's not immediately life-threatening, but the bleeding could become more serious if left untreated. That’s why it's important to investigate. The blood work and stool test will give us a better idea of the severity of the bleeding and help us determine the next steps. If the blood work shows significant anemia or the stool test confirms a large amount of blood, then an endoscopy would be strongly recommended to identify the source of the bleeding and stop it. If the blood work and stool test are relatively normal, we might be able to manage it with medication to protect your stomach lining and reduce acid production. However, without knowing the source of the bleeding, we can’t be sure if that will be enough. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood work and stool test?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work and stool test. Just get it over with. But if it turns out to be nothing serious, I don’t want any more poking and prodding. And don't expect me to be happy about it. Honestly, this is all rather a waste of my time. Where do I go for these tests? And how long will it take? I have things to do, you know. [I sit up slowly, adjusting my dress.] Just tell me straight, doctor. When can I go home?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hatchard. We’ll proceed as efficiently as possible. I’ll write you a lab order for the blood work and stool test. You can go to the lab right across the street – the front desk can give you directions. The blood work should only take about 15-20 minutes, and the stool test kit will be quick to collect. You’ll need to bring the stool sample back to the lab within 24 hours. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to discuss them and determine the next steps. You can go home whenever you’re ready. There are no restrictions after the blood work or stool test. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just get me out of here. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. [I stand up slowly, clutching my purse tightly.] And don't expect me to be thrilled if I have to come back for more tests. [I turn and slowly walk towards the door.] I have a garden to tend, you know. [I exit the room.]
