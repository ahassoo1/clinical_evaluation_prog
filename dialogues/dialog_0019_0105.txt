DOCTOR: Good morning, Bradlee. Welcome in. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think? For my weight. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details, but it’s something about getting a smaller stomach or something?
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss surgery. Right. It sounds like your wife did some good groundwork getting you scheduled. It can be a very effective option for some folks. And it's perfectly alright that you don't remember all the specifics—lots of information to take in. Let’s try to piece things together. So, you're interested in exploring surgical options for weight loss. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Exploring… yeah. I just… I’ve been bigger for a long time, and it’s getting harder to do things. My wife says it’s for my health, and I trust her. It's just… a lot. I don’t really know what all’s involved. Is it… is it a big operation?
DOCTOR: It is a significant step, Bradlee, and you're right to ask about what's involved. It is a major operation – typically laparoscopic, so smaller incisions, but still surgery. We're talking about changing your digestive system, so it's not something we take lightly. Before we even think about surgery, though, we need to make sure it's the right path for you. Let's start with a little bit about your overall health. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine. Ask away. I don’t… I don’t really have a regular doctor, so I probably won’t have much to say. I mostly just… deal with things. My wife always gets me over the flu when I get it, and… that's about it, I guess. Do you want to know about when I was a kid? I came here from Iraq a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. No regular doctor, and you came here from Iraq some time ago. We can definitely talk about your history there if you're comfortable; sometimes that’s relevant. But let’s start more with things happening now. First, when you say “deal with things”, are there any ongoing health problems you’re aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart trouble, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I think my wife said something about my blood pressure being a little high last time she took me to the pharmacy. But she gave me some pills, and I take them sometimes. I forget, honestly. I don’t feel sick, really. Just… tired a lot. And… I get winded easy. Does that count? I don’t have any heart trouble that I know of. And I don't think I have… what was it? Di-a-bee-tis? No, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially elevated blood pressure, managed with medication sometimes, fatigue, and getting winded easily. That's good information, Bradlee. It sounds like there might be some things going on that we need to look at a little closer. Let’s talk about those pills your wife gives you. Do you know what they're called, or what dosage you take?
PATIENT: You know… that’s a good question. I think they’re little white pills. And… she gives me one or two, maybe? When I complain about feeling bad. Honestly, I just take what she gives me. She knows best. I don't remember the name of them, or anything about how many I’m supposed to take. She keeps them in a little bottle in the kitchen. I really don't pay much attention to that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's alright that you don’t remember specifics, Bradlee. It’s good you’re telling me this. We need to know what medications you’re taking, even if they're prescribed by a family member. It's important for your safety. I'm going to have my nurse take a look at your wife’s pharmacy information – with your permission, of course. That will give us a clearer picture of what you’re on. And while she does that, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. My wife probably has all the information anyway. She’s really good at keeping track of things. And… yeah, a physical exam is fine. I don’t really mind. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have to help her with the garden later.
DOCTOR: Perfect. It won’t take long, Bradlee. Just the usual – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, feel your abdomen. Standard stuff. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, that's 148 over 92. A little elevated, which is consistent with what your wife mentioned. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit fast. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. And your abdomen is soft, a little bit of tenderness when I press here on the right side, but nothing concerning. Do you experience any pain in your abdomen regularly?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. Not all the time. It’s… hard to explain. It’s like a dull ache, mostly after I eat. Especially if I eat something heavy. My wife says it’s probably just gas. She makes me drink peppermint tea sometimes. It helps a little. I don’t think it's bad pain, just… uncomfortable. And it comes and goes. Is that what you mean? I don't really know what regular pain feels like.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache after eating, especially with heavier foods, relieved somewhat by peppermint tea. That's helpful information. It could be related to digestion, like your wife suggested. But we need to rule out anything else. Now, just a few more quick questions. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Oh… um… well… not really. I mean, sometimes it’s a little… hard to go. And sometimes it’s… not. It depends on what I eat, I think. Like, if I eat a lot of fruit, it's easier. But mostly… it's just… normal. I don’t really talk about that stuff with anyone. Is that okay? I don't want to bother you with details. It's not important.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Bradlee. These are important questions, and you're not bothering me at all. It's good you're telling me. We need to understand your whole system to make the best decisions. So, some occasional constipation, relieved by fruit. Okay. And finally, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe… once or twice, a little bit of red when I wipe. But I thought it was just… hemorrhoids. My wife says I should drink more water. It’s probably just that. I don’t usually pay attention to that stuff. It doesn’t bother me, so I just… ignore it. Is that bad? I really don't want to think about it. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional bright red blood when wiping, possibly related to hemorrhoids. It's good you mentioned that, Bradlee. While hemorrhoids are common, we do need to investigate the cause of any bleeding. It's good that you're honest with me about what's bothering you and what you're not paying attention to. This is all very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, I think it's important to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Tests are good. It’s good to know what’s going on. My wife always says it's better to be safe than sorry. So, yeah, tests are good. Can I still help her with the garden later? I promised I would. And… will the tests take a long time?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bradlee. Tests are a good idea. And yes, you can absolutely still help your wife with the garden. The tests shouldn't take too long – we'll get them ordered right away, and the lab should be able to process them pretty quickly. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist. They're specialists in digestive health, and they can take a closer look at things. It's always good to have a specialist involved when we're dealing with things like bleeding and abdominal pain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… gastro… what was it? A specialist? Yeah, that sounds good. If you think it’s best. My wife always says specialists know more. So, yeah, that's fine. As long as it doesn’t take too much time. I have to help her with the tomatoes. She’s really particular about her tomatoes. And… will I have to go somewhere else? Is it far? I don’t drive very well.
DOCTOR: A gastroenterologist. They specialize in the digestive system. And yes, you'll need to go to a different office for that appointment. It's about a 20-minute drive from here, but we can help you arrange transportation if you'd like. We have a list of services that can assist with getting patients to and from appointments. I'll get the referral sent over to your wife’s pharmacy, and she can help you schedule the appointment. I’ll also have my nurse print out some instructions about preparing for the stool analysis. Does that sound alright, Bradlee?
PATIENT: Okay, good. My wife can handle the driving. She’s really good at that too. And she can schedule the appointment. That’s perfect. Instructions are good. I forget everything, so she needs to remind me. And… is that it for today? Can I go help her with the garden now? I promised. I really don't want to keep her waiting. It's almost lunchtime.
DOCTOR: Yes, Bradlee, that’s it for today. We’ve covered a lot. We’ll get those tests ordered and the referral sent over. And yes, please go help your wife with the garden. It sounds like she's a wonderful support to you. Here’s a summary of our plan, just to recap. We're ordering a CBC, BMP, and stool analysis, and we're referring you to a gastroenterologist. My nurse will print out the instructions for the stool analysis, and we'll have the nurse give it to you on your way out. If you experience any worsening pain, any heavy bleeding, or any fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained it all really well. And my wife will remind me of everything I need to do. She always does. Thank you, Doctor. I think I can go now. I really need to help her with those tomatoes. She gets upset if they don't get picked on time. I don’t want to be in trouble. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bradlee. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'm glad your wife is so supportive. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I’m sure your wife appreciates your help with the tomatoes. Have a wonderful day!
