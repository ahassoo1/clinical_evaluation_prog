DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it plainly, I’m hoping to talk about losing some weight. It’s become… difficult, you see. And my wife, God rest her soul, always kept me on track. Now… it's just harder.
DOCTOR: Difficult, yes. Many people find that. And… your wife passed recently?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. About six months ago now. It’s… changed things, naturally. She always cooked healthy, kept me moving. I feel… lost without her routine, if that makes any sense. And the weight has just crept on. I’d like to get back to a healthier place, for myself, and to honor her memory, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s not dwell on… sentimentality. Weight gain after a loss is… common. But we need to establish a baseline. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me think. Not really, no. I get tired a little easier, maybe. And my knees… they ache a bit more than they used to. But nothing drastic. Just the usual aches of getting older, I suppose. I’m not a complicated case, Doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: “Usual aches.” Right. And do these aches… interfere with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Well, not completely. I still do my wood carving, that keeps me busy. But walking… longer walks, like we used to do with my wife… that’s become difficult. And getting up and down from the floor to pick up tools… that’s a bit harder, too. I don’t want to be limited, you see. I like to do things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet currently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s probably the biggest problem. My wife… she did all the cooking. I’m not much of a cook myself. Mostly… I eat what’s easy. Canned soup, frozen dinners, things like that. Not very healthy, I know. It’s just… simpler. And honestly, it doesn’t taste as good without her cooking. I’ve put on weight, you see, and I feel… sluggish. Is there a medication that might help with that?
DOCTOR: Medication is rarely the answer, Mr. Osumi. We need to look at the whole picture. Have you had any recent blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Not recently, no. Not since my annual check-up with Dr. Palacios, and that was… oh, goodness, maybe a year ago now? He said everything was… okay then. But that was before… well, before everything. I just thought maybe something new had come out, a pill or something, that could give me a little boost. I’m not looking for a miracle, you understand. Just a little help to get back on track.
DOCTOR: Let me see what Dr. Palacios recorded… Hmm. Yes, basic lipid panel, glucose… all within normal limits, last year. Still, things change. We’ll need to repeat those, just to be thorough. And a thyroid panel, wouldn’t hurt. I want to rule out any underlying medical causes first.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. If you think it’s best. I just… I’m eager to get started, you see. I don't want to waste any time. It's just frustrating, feeling like I’m losing control. Will this take long? The blood work, I mean.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Osumi. The lab is just down the hall. It should take no more than fifteen minutes. And then we’ll schedule a follow-up to discuss the results. Frankly, I suspect this is just a matter of lifestyle adjustments. But we need the data to confirm that.
PATIENT: Alright. Fifteen minutes, you say. Very well. I suppose I can manage that. If you’ll just tell me where to go, Doctor. And… thank you for not dismissing me out of hand. I appreciate that. It's hard explaining things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on your left. The phlebotomist is expecting you. And… you're welcome. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go down there now. I hope I didn’t take up too much of your time. .
DOCTOR: Let’s get this over with.
