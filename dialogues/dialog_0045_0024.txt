DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. I need a letter. It’s… a bit unusual, I suppose. I need confirmation that I’m able to fly.
DOCTOR: <stage>I raise an eyebrow, tapping a pen against the chart. A letter?
PATIENT: Yes. My husband… he passed away six months ago. We had a trip planned, a really long one, to visit family in Mongolia. It was all booked and paid for. The airline is asking for a letter from a doctor saying I’m fit to travel, mentally and physically. It's just… a formality, I think, but they won’t let me go without it.
DOCTOR: Right. A letter of fitness to fly after a… bereavement. Six months ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, February 2nd. It feels like longer, honestly. But… yes, February 2nd. And I understand it's probably unusual, but it’s really just to get permission from the airline. They're very strict about things, especially with… everything happening these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s just go through the motions, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Whatever you need me to do. I just want to get this sorted so I can… well, so I can go. Do you need me to fill out any forms, or…?
DOCTOR: Let’s start with the basics. Tell me a little about your general health. Any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. I don't have any ongoing medical issues. Just… the usual colds and flu sometimes. I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally. I try to eat well, though it's been harder since… everything. I do have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, none. Never had to be hospitalized, thankfully. And I haven’t had any surgeries. Just routine check-ups with my primary care doctor back home, mostly. I’m not usually in hospitals or anything. It's just… this trip.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some heart trouble later in life. But they both lived to be quite old, actually. Mid-eighties. So… it wasn’t anything immediate. And I don’t have any family history of serious mental health conditions, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how have you been coping since your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult. It still feels very raw, honestly. I’ve been… sad, of course. A lot of days are just… hard to get through. But I’m trying. I have friends who are helping, and I’m… keeping busy when I can. I haven't been sleeping perfectly, but I’m not… I’m not actively depressed, if that makes sense. I just… miss him. Terribly. I am a little anxious about traveling, mostly because it was something we planned together, and I… want to honor that.
DOCTOR: Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, none. I don't take any regular medication. Not even vitamins, usually. I try to get everything I need from my diet. Actually… I did take something for the sleep for a couple of weeks, just a mild over-the-counter thing. But I stopped, it didn’t really help. It was… Melatonin, I think it was called. But I haven’t taken it in months.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs… standard stuff. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is good. Pulse is normal. Lungs are clear. Abdomen feels fine. Everything seems… within normal limits. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not even insect bites or anything like that. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing. I'm pretty lucky, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. Everything checks out. You’re physically fit to travel. You’re a bit… understandably stressed, but nothing medically concerning. I can write a letter stating you are in good health and cleared for air travel. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor Billman! That’s wonderful. That’s all I needed, really. The letter is perfect. No, nothing else, thank you. I really appreciate your time and… your understanding.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse print that out for you. Try to get some rest before your trip. And… enjoy your visit with your family.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. I really appreciate it. Have a good day. .
