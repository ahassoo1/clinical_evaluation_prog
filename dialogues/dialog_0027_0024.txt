DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. My travel agent said I need a letter from a doctor confirming I’m able to fly. I’m going overseas, and they’re being very strict these days.
DOCTOR: A letter for travel, yes… right. Of course. Hmm. And… what exactly are they needing confirmation of?
PATIENT: They just said a general confirmation that I’m fit to travel, no specific conditions or anything. Honestly, I think it's just a formality. It’s for an airline in Mongolia, and they’re very cautious after… well, after everything. Is there a form I need to fill out, or do you just write the letter? I’m happy either way, I just want to get it sorted quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Right, a general fitness to travel… yes. It’s becoming more common, especially with international travel. No, there isn’t a specific form we use here, but to be thorough – and to make sure the letter is sufficient – I’d like to ask a few quick questions, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check-in. It shouldn’t take long. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was married to a wonderful man, but he passed away about two years ago, and… I've been pretty healthy since then, thankfully. No major illnesses, no ongoing treatments, nothing like that. I have Medicare, so I do get regular check-ups, but everything's always been fine. I’m a little… slender, I suppose, but that’s just how I am. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. I'm very sorry for your loss. It's good to hear you've been generally healthy. “Slender” is fine, just making sure there wasn’t anything underlying. And Medicare is good – we can pull up your records quickly. Okay. Just to be complete, are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really take anything. I try to eat well, and… well, that's about it. I honestly haven't needed anything. I sometimes get a little travel sickness, but I usually just deal with it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing. Is there anything else you need to know? I really do appreciate you fitting me in today.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not to food, not to anything. I’ve always been lucky that way. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach! I can eat pretty much anything, which is useful when you travel. Is that everything? I’m happy to answer anything else, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay… no allergies, no medications… Hmm. Just to be absolutely sure, have you had any recent hospitalizations or surgeries in the last, say, five years?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not in the last five years, not ever, really. Just the usual doctor’s visits for check-ups. Nothing major. I’ve always been very careful about my health. I had a minor injury a few years ago—tripped over a rug, silly thing—but it didn’t require a hospital visit or anything. Just a bit of bruising. I’m really trying to think, but I can honestly say there's nothing else. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… good. Right. Okay. Just a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Let's listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m happy to cooperate. I just… I really need to get this letter sorted before my flight, so I’m glad you’re being so thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure first. Blood pressure is 120/80, good. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds… normal. Good. Do you have any dizziness, shortness of breath or chest pains?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. No dizziness, no shortness of breath, no chest pain. I feel perfectly fine, actually. A little anxious about traveling, maybe, but that's just normal, isn't it? I'm a bit worried about flying after… everything, but physically, I'm perfectly healthy. I really do appreciate you checking everything so carefully.
DOCTOR: Right… Anxiety is understandable. And… you mentioned "after everything." Was there a recent medical event that you’re concerned about relating to travel?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… my husband, he… he had a heart attack on a flight a few years ago. He didn't make it. That’s why I’m a little… apprehensive about flying, and why the airline is being so strict. It's not my health I'm worried about, exactly, it's… the thought of being on a plane. I suppose I should have mentioned it earlier. It's just… it’s not easy to talk about.
DOCTOR: Oh, Kiante. I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. That must be terribly difficult. It’s perfectly understandable that you’re anxious, and that the airline is being cautious. No, you didn’t need to mention it, but it helps me understand things better. Okay. Given the circumstances, and just to be absolutely certain, I’m going to write a letter confirming your general fitness to travel. However, I would strongly recommend discussing your anxiety with a specialist – perhaps a therapist specializing in grief and trauma. We can provide a referral if you’d like. And I suggest, if possible, having someone travel with you for support. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wonderful, actually. A letter confirming my fitness is all I really need, and I appreciate the advice. A referral would be great, thank you. I haven’t really thought about talking to someone, but it probably wouldn’t hurt. And… yes, I was planning on traveling with a friend, so that’s good. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. It’s my job to ensure your safety and well-being. Here. This confirms your general fitness to travel. I’ve also included a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a therapist specializing in grief and trauma. Her information is on the letter. And… please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything else. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. This is perfect, thank you so much. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your kindness and understanding, Doctor Fazzina. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. And you have a good day too. Safe travels, and please take care of yourself. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. .
