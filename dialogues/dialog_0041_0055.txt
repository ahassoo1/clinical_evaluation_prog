DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather simple, really. I understand you can… authorize medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been going on and on about it for months. Says it’s the only thing that helps her with… well, her problems. I thought I’d look into it for myself, naturally. One must stay informed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive. Authorizing medical marijuana does require a proper evaluation, just like any other treatment. To start, can you tell me a little more about your reasons for considering it?
PATIENT: My reasons? Doctor, honestly. My daughter is the one with… the issue. I am perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I simply wish to understand the process, and perhaps… assist her in procuring it, if it’s truly necessary. I wouldn’t want her getting involved with… unsavory elements, you understand. One hears such stories. I’m a bailiff, Doctor. I’ve seen things. I just want to make sure everything is… above board.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Your daughter. Sorry, sometimes I get a little lost in the details. So, what is your daughter being treated for?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather… delicate. She has… anxiety. A dreadful, modern affliction. She won’t leave the house, barely speaks to anyone. It started after… well, never you mind. The point is, she’s convinced this marijuana will help. She says it’s “natural” and “therapeutic.” Honestly, I think it’s nonsense. But a mother does what she must, doesn't she? Though I maintain a healthy skepticism. It all seems terribly…lax.
DOCTOR: I understand. Anxiety can be very debilitating, and it's good she's exploring options. Has your daughter seen a doctor for her anxiety before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years of it. One doctor after another. Pills, therapy… you name it. Nothing seems to stick. That’s why she’s latched onto this… marijuana. She says it’s different. More… holistic. I’ve always told her proper medicine is the way, but… she’s my only child, Doctor. You understand. A mother wants to see her happy. Though I do worry about the legality of it all. Is it even properly regulated?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's good she’s been seeking treatment, and it’s natural to want to explore all avenues. As for the legality, yes, it is regulated, though the specifics vary. We'll make sure everything is done properly, if we decide it's a suitable option. Can you tell me a little more about the anxiety itself?
PATIENT: Well, it manifests in… avoidance, primarily. She rarely leaves the house. She used to be so vibrant, so social. Now, she just… hides. She gets terribly agitated in crowds, and even simple phone calls seem to overwhelm her. She says she feels… trapped, constantly on edge. It's quite distressing to watch, really. She’s become a shadow of her former self. It’s affected her work, too. She used to be quite ambitious, but now… she barely manages to get through the day. Frankly, it's embarrassing. A perfectly capable young woman, reduced to this.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult for both of you. It sounds like this is significantly impacting her quality of life. Has she been diagnosed with anything specific, like a panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, one diagnosis after another, really. Generalized anxiety, they said. Social anxiety, at one point. Something about a “panic threshold” being too low, I believe. Honestly, I stopped paying close attention after a while. They all sounded the same, frankly. Pills, pills, pills. And the therapy… endless talking, and no discernible results. She tried a few different specialists, but none of them seemed to truly understand. That’s why she’s fixated on this marijuana. She says it's a “natural alternative” and that it will “calm her nerves.” I just want her to be well, Doctor. Is it even safe? That's my biggest concern. I read something about… side effects. And the long-term consequences…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. Safety is always our top priority. There are potential side effects with any medication, including medical marijuana, and we need to weigh those against the potential benefits. That's why a thorough evaluation is so important. Do you happen to know if your daughter has any allergies or is currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe she mentioned something about an allergy to penicillin, years ago. A mild rash, as I recall. And… yes, here it is. She takes… sertraline. A small dose, the doctor said. For the anxiety, naturally. And… oh, she also takes something for… occasional insomnia. A low-dose benzodiazepine, I think it’s called. She doesn't like taking it, says it makes her feel… foggy. Honestly, I worry about her mixing all these pills. It seems awfully… complicated. Perhaps this marijuana is best avoided altogether. It just sounds like adding fuel to the fire.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful information. The sertraline and benzodiazepine are important to know, as they can interact with other substances. You're right to be cautious. Before we proceed, I'd like to review your daughter’s complete medical records, if possible. That would give me a better understanding of her overall health and treatment history. Would you be able to provide me with access to those?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. But it all seems rather…invasive, doesn't it? I mean, I understand you need to be thorough, but I'm not entirely comfortable sharing her private medical information with… well, with anyone. It's just… a delicate matter. And frankly, I'm not sure how easy it will be to obtain them. She keeps everything meticulously organized, and she's rather protective of her privacy. But… I suppose for the sake of her well-being, I can try. Do you have a specific form I need to fill out? Or a fax number? I'm not particularly adept with technology, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your hesitation. We take privacy very seriously, of course. All information is kept confidential and secure. We have a standard release form that you can fill out, and a fax number is perfectly fine. Or, if you prefer, we can explore options for electronic access, but I understand that may not be your preference. We can take things at your pace. Here's the form. It just needs basic information and your authorization for us to request her records.
PATIENT: Hm. Very official looking. It does seem…rather lengthy. All these disclaimers and legal jargon… Honestly, it's enough to give one a headache. Very well. I suppose I can fill it out. But I make no promises about getting her records quickly. She's…particular, you understand. And I'm not sure she'll be thrilled about me sharing this information with anyone, even a doctor. But… I'll do my best. It's for her well-being, after all. .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. I appreciate you taking the time to do that, and I understand it may take a little while. Don't rush. In the meantime, perhaps we can discuss some general information about anxiety and potential treatment options, while we wait for the records?
