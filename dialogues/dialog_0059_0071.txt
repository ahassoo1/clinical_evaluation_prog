DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, it's a bit complicated. I have a… a young man, a friend of the family, coming to the States. He needs some… shots, I believe, to get his paperwork right. I’m trying to help him get everything sorted, and I was told I needed to come see a doctor to understand what’s required. I don’t know where to even begin, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. You’re assisting a friend with the medical requirements for immigration paperwork. That's very kind of you. It can certainly be a bit confusing navigating those requirements. To best advise you, could you tell me a little more about his situation?
PATIENT: Certainly. He's coming from… well, he doesn't like to talk about it much, but it’s a small village in Mexico. He’s applying for… I think it’s a visa, not a green card. A work visa, I believe. He's a carpenter, a very skilled one. He doesn't have any paperwork with him currently, just… he told me what the government office said he needed. I just want to make sure he's healthy enough, and gets all the right… things done before he travels. Is that clear? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly clear, Mr. Skarbek. You're doing a wonderful thing to help him, and it's completely understandable that the process feels a bit overwhelming. A work visa, alright. Generally, for a work visa, we’ll need to ensure he's up-to-date on his routine vaccinations, and we’ll likely want to perform a basic physical exam and potentially some blood work to screen for common infections. Do you know if he has any existing medical conditions or allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well, he says he's healthy as a horse, but… he's a proud man. I suspect he might not mention everything. He did say something about getting a bad fever when he was a boy, a long time ago, but he seems fine now. As for allergies… I don't believe he's ever mentioned any. He does work with a lot of wood, so perhaps he’s sensitive to dust? I really don’t know. He hasn’t been to a doctor in… well, I’m guessing a very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. We’ll proceed carefully then. A history of a childhood fever is worth noting, and it’s common to have sensitivities with occupational exposures like dust. To start, would you mind if I ask a few more general questions about his medical background?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Ask away. I’ll do my best to answer. I just… I worry about him. He's a good boy, and this is a big step for him. I want to make sure everything goes smoothly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Skarbek. It's natural to worry, and I assure you, we’ll do our best to ensure he’s healthy and prepared. Let's start with his past medical history, if you know anything. Has he ever been hospitalized for anything, aside from perhaps that childhood fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't think so. He mentioned breaking his arm when he was very young, working on his family’s farm, but that was a long time ago. He didn't need to go to the hospital, he said a local healer set it. I honestly don't know if he’s ever been in a proper hospital. It’s a small village, Doctor, they don’t have much in the way of medical care. I don’t think he’d tell me if he had, though. He's a bit… private.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s good to know. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, has he had any prior surgical procedures?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. He’s a carpenter, you see, very handy with his hands. He does things with wood, he doesn’t… well, he doesn't have things done to him. It’s a bit silly, I know, but that's just how he is. I haven't ever heard him mention any surgery. And honestly, I doubt his village even has a surgeon.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Skarbek. You’re providing very helpful information, even the details about his lifestyle. It helps me build a more complete picture. Now, let’s move on to his family history. Do you know if anyone in his family has any significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. He doesn't talk about his family much. He has… many siblings, he said, but they all live in Mexico. He doesn’t see them often. He mentioned his mother… she passed away when he was young. He said it was from… a sickness, but he didn’t say what kind. I don’t know anything about his father or any of his siblings’ health. I wish I could be more helpful, but I just don’t know. He keeps his past very close.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Skarbek. It's completely understandable that he may not share much about his personal life, and you’re doing your best. We’ll proceed with what information we have. Now, let’s talk about his social history. Does he smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I've never seen him smoke. He works with wood all day, the smell would be enough to keep him away from cigarettes, I suspect. He’ll occasionally have a beer with his dinner, but nothing excessive. Just one, maybe two. And… no, I’ve never seen him drink anything else. He's a very simple man, Doctor. Very hardworking. I'm quite certain he doesn't use any… recreational drugs. He wouldn't approve.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Skarbek. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, are you aware of any allergies he has – to medications, food, insect stings, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. He’s never mentioned any allergies. He eats everything I've ever offered him, and we’ve shared many meals. He works outdoors a lot, of course, and I've never seen him react to any insects. I've never seen him take any medications, either. He prefers natural remedies, if he needs anything at all. He's a very… stoic man. He doesn't complain much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Thank you for providing such a thorough history, Mr. Skarbek. It's very helpful, even with the limited information available. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, just to get a baseline assessment of his overall health. We’ll check his vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to his heart and lungs. I’ll also take a quick look at his throat, ears, and abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure he's healthy enough for this journey. He's a strong lad, but you can’t be too careful, can you? Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Excellent. First, let's take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor? This cuff feels… snug. I haven’t had my blood pressure checked in… well, I can’t remember the last time. It's good of you to be so thorough. I worry about him. He’s a good boy, a hard worker. He deserves a good life.
DOCTOR: It is a little snug, yes. It needs to be to get an accurate reading. And you’re right to want to ensure he's in good health. We'll do our best to make sure he is. Alright, your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s check your pulse.
PATIENT: Slightly elevated? Is that… bad, Doctor? I try to eat healthy, mostly. And I do walk a bit. I worry about stress, though. He's a bit worried about leaving his home, I think. It's a big step for him. Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I’ll just try to relax. This is all new to me.
DOCTOR: It's not drastically elevated, Mr. Skarbek, and it could be a bit higher just from the slight anxiety of being here. We consider anything consistently over 140/90 to be high blood pressure, and yours is 138/82. It's something to monitor, and we can discuss lifestyle modifications if needed. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute. That’s a normal resting heart rate. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s within the normal range as well. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, that's good to know. I'm glad his temperature is normal. He does run warm sometimes, working outside in the sun, but I thought that was just normal. There. Is that alright, Doctor? I hope I’m not making too much noise.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfect, Mr. Skarbek. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing, crackling, or other unusual sounds. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that feels alright, Doctor. Just a little… pressure. He has a strong stomach, that boy. Works hard, eats good food. He doesn’t complain much. Just a little pressure. It’s fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything feels normal there as well. No tenderness or masses. Everything seems to be in good working order. Based on this brief examination, he appears to be in reasonably good health. However, it is important to have some baseline bloodwork done to get a more comprehensive picture. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? What sort of bloodwork, Doctor? Is it… painful? He doesn’t like needles. He’s a bit of a… stoic, as I said, but he doesn't like needles. I don’t want to cause him any distress. What exactly will it tell you?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. No, the bloodwork isn't overly painful. It's a quick pinch, and then it's over. We'll use the smallest needle possible, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We’ll check a complete blood count, which gives us information about his red and white blood cells and platelets. We’ll also check his basic metabolic panel, which tells us about his kidney and liver function, and his electrolytes. We'll also screen for common infections, like Hepatitis B and C, and HIV. It will give us a baseline of his overall health, and help us determine if he has any underlying conditions that need to be addressed before he travels. It's simply a precaution. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Hepatitis… HIV… Goodness. That sounds… serious, Doctor. He’s a good boy, a hardworking boy. He wouldn’t… he wouldn’t have those things. I… I’m not sure he'd want those tests done. It sounds like you think he might be… sick. Are you saying he looks sick? I thought he looked healthy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Skarbek, please don’t be alarmed. These are routine screenings, standard precautions we take for anyone traveling internationally, especially when applying for a visa. They’re not because I suspect he’s sick. Many people carry these viruses without even knowing it, and early detection is key. It allows us to provide appropriate treatment if needed, and prevent the spread of infection. It’s simply due diligence. It's much better to be safe and know for sure, rather than risk any complications down the road. We are not looking for anything to be wrong, but simply making sure he is healthy enough for travel. Would you like me to explain why these specific tests are recommended for international travelers?
PATIENT: International travelers… yes. I suppose that makes sense. It’s just… he’s very private, Doctor. He doesn’t like people poking around. He wouldn't tell me if he'd been… exposed to anything. And he certainly wouldn’t want a stranger knowing his… business. If it's standard, though… and you say it's just a precaution… alright. But please, be gentle with him. And please don’t tell anyone anything. He'd be very embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. I completely understand his privacy concerns, and I assure you, all of his medical information will be kept strictly confidential. I will personally explain the purpose of each test to him and answer any questions he may have. I will also be as gentle as possible, and we will proceed at his pace. Everything will be done with the utmost respect and discretion. Alright, let’s get the bloodwork ordered then. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in shortly. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now, Doctor. Just… please, be kind to him. He’s a good boy, and he’s very brave. I’m just worried about him. He’s never been away from his home, and this is a big step. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. And thank you for understanding his… hesitancy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I understand completely, and I’ll do my best to make him feel comfortable. We’ll take excellent care of him. I'll just step out and let the phlebotomist know to come in shortly. Please let me know if you have any further questions before she arrives.
PATIENT: .
