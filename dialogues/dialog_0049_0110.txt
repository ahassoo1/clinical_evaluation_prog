DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Nestingen. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I feel…stuck. Like an old engine that doesn’t quite turn over like it used to. I’m hoping you can help me get a bit of a “reset,” a jumpstart, if you will, to feeling better. I’m not really sick, you understand, just…not as lively as I once was.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," you say. I understand. Many patients describe it that way. Perhaps you could elaborate a little?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. It’s hard to explain, really. I used to be very active, always in the garden, taking care of things. I taught kindergarten and elementary school for…well, a very long time! But now, everything feels like it takes more effort. Getting up in the morning is harder. I don’t have the energy for the garden anymore, and even visiting friends feels…daunting sometimes. It’s not a specific pain, not like a cold or something. It’s just…a general weariness. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make some sense. A general weariness… it's a common complaint as we get older, certainly. But we need to figure out why. Have you noticed anything specific that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I suppose it’s worse in the mornings, definitely. It takes a good cup of coffee to get me going. And…when the weather is damp, like it has been lately, I feel it more. Better…well, when I do manage to get out and do something, even just a little bit, I feel a bit brighter afterwards. But getting started is the hardest part. It's a vicious cycle, really. I don’t want to be lazy, mind you, but I just…lack the pep.
DOCTOR: "Pep," alright. And it's worse in the mornings and damp weather, better with activity... Have you experienced any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. My sleep isn’t what it used to be. I go to bed at a reasonable hour, but I wake up several times during the night. Sometimes I have trouble getting back to sleep. It's not every night, but it happens enough that I’m not always feeling very rested when I wake up. And I tend to get up a little earlier than I used to, even if I haven’t had a full night's sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent awakenings, early rising… And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My appetite isn’t quite what it used to be, no. I don’t really crave things like I once did. I eat because I know I should, but I don’t particularly enjoy my meals the way I used to. My daughter worries about me, always asking if I’m eating enough. I try to have a good breakfast, but sometimes even that feels like a chore.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Decreased appetite, changes in sleep… it’s all rather…typical, at your age, frankly. But we should rule out other things. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, I haven’t weighed myself recently, but I believe I have lost a little bit of weight. My clothes feel a bit looser, and my daughter commented on it when she visited last month. She’s a practical nurse, you see, so she notices things. It hasn’t been drastic, but I'd say maybe five or ten pounds, something like that. It wasn't intentional, I assure you! I haven't been trying to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weight loss, decreased appetite, changes in sleep, fatigue... Let's move on to other systems. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, that's a bit personal, isn't it? Let me see…it’s not regular as it once was, that's for sure. Sometimes I feel a little…backed up, if you understand. And other times…well, let’s just say I don't have much warning. It's rather inconvenient, to be honest. It hasn't been a major issue, but it's another thing that makes me feel…not quite myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Changes in bowel habits. Let’s continue with the review of systems. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And I haven't had any trouble breathing, thank goodness. No palpitations either. My heart feels…normal, I suppose. I walk around the house, I climb the stairs—it’s not effortless, but I haven't had any trouble with shortness of breath. It would be very concerning if I did! My husband, God rest his soul, had some heart trouble, so I pay attention to things like that.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, my ankles do tend to swell a bit by the end of the day. It's not terrible, just…noticeable. I usually put my feet up in the evening and it helps a bit. My daughter said it's probably just from being on them too much when I'm in the garden, but it's something I've noticed getting worse lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Swelling in the ankles. Now, have you had any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, both, I’m afraid. My vision isn’t as sharp as it used to be, so I’ve had to get new glasses a couple of times in the last few years. And my hearing…well, I sometimes have trouble hearing my grandchildren when they whisper! I’ve been meaning to get a hearing aid, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. It’s just…another thing on the list, you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see…the doctor told me I had high blood pressure a few years back, and I take a pill for that every day. Other than that…I had a bad bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but I recovered from that. Nothing major, really. I’ve been pretty healthy overall, thankfully. My husband wasn't so lucky, he had diabetes and heart trouble, so I’m very grateful for my good health, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a long, long time ago. And I had a gallbladder removed when I was in my fifties. That was a bit rough, but I recovered well. No other surgeries that I can recall. I was only in the hospital overnight for the gallbladder. I’ve always preferred to stay out of the hospital if I can help it!
DOCTOR: Alright. Any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother had arthritis, and my father had heart trouble, like my husband. And my sister had diabetes, later in life. My family…we've had our share of health problems, unfortunately. That’s why I try to take such good care of myself, you see? It's worrying, thinking about the things that could happen.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let’s talk about medications. Besides the pill for your blood pressure, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the one pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just a standard one. My daughter keeps telling me I should take calcium for my bones, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. I try to eat a good diet, you see, so I don't feel I need a lot of supplements.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. McNabb, it sounds like you’re experiencing a constellation of symptoms that are quite common with age. Fatigue, sleep disturbances, decreased appetite, some swelling… We've covered quite a bit. I would like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying issues like anemia, thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Anything that can help me figure out what's going on is fine with me. I just want to feel like myself again, you understand? Anemia, thyroid… I don't know much about those things, but if you think it's necessary, then yes, let’s do it. And an EKG…well, better safe than sorry, I always say. My husband always said I worried too much, but I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. I'll have the nurse draw the blood samples now and schedule you for an EKG. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we want to be thorough. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to try and maintain a healthy diet and get some gentle exercise when you’re able to. If your symptoms worsen significantly before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and I feel a bit better just knowing we’re looking into it. Thank you. I’ll see the nurse then, I presume?
DOCTOR: Yes. The nurse will be with you shortly. She’ll explain the blood work and EKG procedure. Have a good day, Ms. McNabb.
PATIENT: .
