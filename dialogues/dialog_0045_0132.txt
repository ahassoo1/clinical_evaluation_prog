DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Heat intolerance, you say? Honestly, it's about time someone looked into this. I’ve been dealing with it for… well, a long time now. It’s just gotten worse this summer, though. It’s not right, you know? A man should be able to handle the heat. I’ve built houses in this sun, painted 'em, fixed 'em... now this?
DOCTOR: Right. "Should be able to." Well, bodies change, Mr. Coby. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. "Worse this summer," you say. Can you describe what "worse" looks like?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you lecture me about bodies changing. I take care of myself, alright? It's not like I’m sitting around doing nothing. Anyway… worse is… I get dizzy, mostly. Really dizzy. And I sweat like… well, like I’m in a monsoon. Even when I'm just standing still. It used to be just after a hard day's work, but now? It happens just walking to the mailbox. And my heart… it feels like it’s going to jump right out of my chest sometimes. It’s unsettling, I tell ya. Very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, excessive sweating even at rest, and palpitations… heart racing. How long has this been happening – the dizziness and sweating at rest?
PATIENT: At rest… hmm. Let me think. It started… oh, maybe three, four months ago? It was subtle at first, just a little more tired than usual after being outside. But the last month, it’s been constant. Even indoors, I feel it. I wake up sweating, sometimes. It’s ridiculous. My wife… well, she always said I worked too hard. She would’ve said something about this, that’s for sure. But she's gone now. So, you have to listen to me. It’s definitely gotten worse recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get to the bottom of it, Mr. Coby. Now, besides the dizziness and sweating, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else… well, my hands have been shaking a bit. Not constantly, but… enough to spill my tea a couple of times. And I’ve been… forgetful. Not like really forgetful, but… where did I put my glasses? Oh, here they are. See? Little things. But it's not like I'm losing my mind, I still remember everything that happened on the job, don't you worry about that. I’ve got a good memory for details, always have. It’s just… things around the house.
DOCTOR: Hand tremors and increased forgetfulness. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. It's been a little off, I suppose. Not that I'm not hungry, but I don't enjoy my food as much. Used to look forward to a good meal, now… it's just food. As for weight… I haven’t stepped on the scale in a while, to be honest. But my clothes feel a little looser. A little. Probably just the heat, though. Makes you lose your appetite and sweat everything out, right?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you worry about all that fancy stuff. I'm a strong man, always have been. But… well, the doctor back in Nepal, he said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. Maybe ten, fifteen years. He put me on some pills for a while, but I didn't like how they made me feel. Stopped taking 'em. Didn’t see any harm in it, really. And I’ve got arthritis in my hands, but that's just old age, everyone gets that. Doesn’t stop me from working, though. Other than that… nothing. I’m a healthy man, always have been. It’s this heat, I tell ya. It’s got to be the heat.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, history of hypertension, previously treated with medication, now off medication. And arthritis in your hands. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, never. A strong man doesn't need surgeries! Hospitalizations… well, I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But that was… oh, seventy years ago! It healed up fine. Other than that… nothing. I’ve always been lucky. Good bones, good health. This whole thing… with the heat… it’s just a bit unsettling. It's not right, you know? A man should be able to handle the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my father… he lived a long life. Worked hard all his life, like me. He died in his sleep, old age. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I think. But I don’t remember the details. Nepal wasn't like here, you didn't go to doctors for every little thing. She passed when I was young. And my wife… she was healthy as a horse until… well, that’s another story. We didn’t have much family after that. I guess what I'm saying is… no real family history of anything serious. Just long lives and hard work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Like I said, I don't like taking pills. They make me feel sluggish. Vitamins… sometimes I take a multivitamin, if I remember. But mostly, I just eat a good diet. Lots of vegetables, rice… a little bit of meat. Supplements? No. Never been one for all that fancy stuff. A strong man doesn't need supplements. Just hard work and a good diet. That's what keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and take a look at your hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Go ahead. I’ve been examined by doctors before. I know what to expect. Just don’t poke around too much. I’m a strong man, remember? But go ahead, do what you need to do. Just hurry up, I have things to do. It's just this heat, I tell ya... it's getting to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 160 over 90. A bit elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Heart rate is a little fast – 95 beats per minute – and there's a slight irregularity. I'll listen to your lungs now. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your hands. There’s some swelling and redness in the joints, consistent with arthritis. And I do notice a slight tremor when you extend your hands. I'll also check your reflexes and neurological function. Reflexes are normal. No obvious neurological deficits. Overall, your exam findings are… concerning. Your blood pressure is elevated, your heart rate is fast and irregular, and you have some signs of arthritis. Given your symptoms and exam findings, I’m concerned about a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Possibilities? What possibilities? Is it serious? I told you, it's just the heat! I've built houses in hotter weather than this! Don't tell me I'm seriously sick. What are these "possibilities", doctor? And don’t use fancy medical terms, I want to understand what you're saying! I don't need any trouble, just want to be able to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your concerns, and I’m not dismissing your experience. However, your symptoms – the heat intolerance, dizziness, sweating, palpitations, tremor, forgetfulness – coupled with these exam findings, suggest we need to investigate further. One possibility is that your previously elevated blood pressure isn’t being adequately managed and is leading to heart strain. Another is that we need to evaluate for a thyroid problem, which can cause similar symptoms. And finally, we can’t rule out the possibility of an electrolyte imbalance, which can also cause these issues. I’m not saying you have anything serious, but we need to do some tests to figure out what’s going on. I recommend a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolytes, and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to look at your heart’s electrical activity.
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, doctor, I don’t have time for all this! I have work to do. And I don't like going to hospitals, never have. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just give me something for the blood pressure and be done with it? I’ve been fine for years without all these fancy tests. I just need something to help me handle the heat. My wife would’ve told me to get it checked out, but she’s… gone now. I don’t have anyone to tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand this is frustrating, and I respect your concerns. And I truly am sorry for your loss. But simply treating your blood pressure without knowing why it’s elevated could be dangerous. There could be underlying issues causing it, and if we don’t address those, the problem could get worse. The tests are necessary to ensure we're giving you the right treatment and protecting your health. I'm not trying to overwhelm you, and we can take things one step at a time. We can start with just the blood work and the EKG, and then we can discuss the results and go from there. The blood work can be done here in the clinic, and the EKG only takes a few minutes. I want to help you feel better, and the best way to do that is to get a clear understanding of what’s going on. Would you be willing to agree to those tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your tests. But hurry up, I have things to do. And don't tell me anything I don't need to know. Just give me the results and a quick fix. Just... get it over with. She would've wanted me to get checked out. Just... do it. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. I understand. We'll get the blood work done right away. And the EKG technician is available now. I'll explain everything as clearly as I can, and we won't proceed with any treatment until you fully understand the results. In the meantime, I want to be clear – if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Now, let’s get you started with the blood work. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples.
