DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yeah, hi. It’s…sleep, mostly. And, well, feeling a bit…not right, you know? I guess. It’s hard to explain. I just don't bounce back like I used to, and honestly, I haven’t been sleeping properly for…a while now. Honestly, everything feels a bit hazy. Don't really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: "A while now," is…helpful. Alright. Let’s try to narrow that down. When you say "not right," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics…right. Look, it’s just…tiredness, mostly. Not the kind you fix with a coffee, you know? It's…deeper. And I get…winded. Easily. Used to be able to, uh…well, I used to do things. Before…everything. I fix instruments all day, which shouldn't be that taxing, but by the end of it, I'm wiped. And the sleep…it just doesn’t feel like sleep. Does that make any sense? I don't know what good sleep even feels like anymore.
DOCTOR: It’s…vague, but I understand. "Wiped" and not restorative sleep. Okay. And this windedness…is it with exertion only?
PATIENT: Exertion… yeah, mostly. Though, sometimes… even just walking up the stairs. It’s not bad bad, like, I’m not collapsing or anything. Just…noticeable. Like, I feel it. And I used to… well, never mind. It's probably just getting old. Though I'm not that old, am I? Twenty-nine, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Twenty-nine is certainly not "old." Let’s not dismiss it like that. Okay, so exertion and even sometimes with minimal activity. And you mentioned feeling "hazy." Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to put into words. Like, things don’t… stick. I forget where I put things, I forget what I was doing five minutes ago. Not like…serious memory loss, I don't think. Just… little things. And it’s like my head is full of cotton wool, sometimes. Difficult to concentrate, you know? Especially when I’m trying to tune a particularly…temperamental violin. Honestly, it’s probably just stress. Losing my wife…that threw everything off. Though that was… a long time ago now. It's just...lingering.
DOCTOR: Losing your wife…I see. And how long ago was that, exactly?
PATIENT: Uh… honestly? I’m not entirely sure. A few years, I think. It's…a blur. Everything is a bit of a blur. It was…before I moved here, definitely. I remember…vaguely…the funeral arrangements. And the paperwork. God, so much paperwork. It was…a difficult time. It's just… hard to focus on dates, you know? Everything kind of…blends together. I try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need something concrete. “A few years” isn’t terribly helpful for a medical history, Mr. Redfern. Approximately how many years?
PATIENT: Look, I'm telling you, it was a while ago. Probably…five years? Maybe six? It was before I opened the shop here. Before… everything settled down. Honestly, I don’t keep track of that sort of thing. I’m a musician, not an accountant. It's not like it changes anything, is it? I'm tired, I don't sleep well, and I forget things. That's what matters, isn’t it? Not the precise date of…well, you know.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Redfern. It helps me understand the timeline of your symptoms and rule out potential causes. Six years ago… were you experiencing any of these symptoms before your wife passed away?
PATIENT: Honestly? I…don’t know. Everything was…a mess back then. I was barely functioning. I was probably just…numb. I don't remember feeling much of anything, let alone whether or not I was tired. I was going through the motions, you know? Work, funeral arrangements, paperwork… It’s all a blur. I really wish I could be more helpful, but my memory just isn't what it used to be. Perhaps…perhaps it was always like this? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let’s move on, then. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally something I can answer! No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I don't take much medication, honestly. Just the occasional painkiller for a bad back. Fixing instruments is… not exactly gentle work, you know? Mostly, I just try to push through it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what painkillers do you use, and how often?
PATIENT: Um… ibuprofen, usually. Or… paracetamol, sometimes. Whatever’s cheapest at the chemist, really. And… not very often. Maybe once a month? When I’ve really overdone it. Though I've been trying to cut back. I read somewhere it's bad for your liver. I don't really pay much attention to dosages, to be honest. Just take what it says on the packet. Or maybe a little extra if it’s really bad. Don't tell anyone, alright?
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, taking more than the recommended dosage of any medication is potentially dangerous, and you should always follow the instructions on the label. We will discuss that further. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, look, I said I’ve been trying to cut back! It's not like I'm popping pills all day. Honestly. And no, not that I know of. Never been seriously ill. Had the usual childhood things, you know? Chickenpox, measles… but nothing major. No chronic conditions. Doctor never told me anything. I’m a relatively healthy guy. Just…tired. And a bit forgetful. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? No. Nothing like that. I mean, I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was…ages ago. And it was just a day thing. In and out. Nothing serious. Never been hospitalized for anything else. I’m… remarkably durable, actually. Mostly, I just fix instruments. It's a peaceful life. When I'm not feeling tired, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… right. Uh… My father… he had… something with his heart, I think. Not sure what exactly. He wasn't a healthy man. Smoked a lot. And my mother… she had…arthritis, I think. Bad joints. Lots of aches and pains. But honestly? I didn't pay much attention to their medical stuff. I was more interested in music. It wasn’t something we talked about much. They're both… gone now, anyway.
DOCTOR: And finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Something easy. No. Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. But nothing regular. And recreational drugs? Don’t even think about it. I need a clear head for my work. Tuning an instrument requires…precision. And frankly, I don't have the time for any of that nonsense. So, no. Nothing like that. Clean as a whistle.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Redfern, based on what you've told me—and frankly, the lack of specifics—it’s difficult to pinpoint a cause for your fatigue and sleep disturbances. Your memory issues are concerning, but without a clearer timeline, it's hard to determine if they are new or longstanding. We need to run some tests. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. I also want to rule out any underlying infection, so I’m ordering a urinalysis. And frankly, I'm concerned about the accuracy of your self-reported history. I'm referring you to a neurologist for a formal cognitive assessment. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Redfern. The lab orders have been sent, and you will receive a call to schedule your appointment with the neurologist. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop any new symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. .
