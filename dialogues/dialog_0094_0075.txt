DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, the thing is… I’m still awfully tired, even with the machine. They said it was sleep apnea, and the machine helps, you know? But I still feel like I could nap any time of the day. It's just... persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're still experiencing fatigue despite using the CPAP machine for your sleep apnea. That's definitely something we need to explore. “Persistent” is a good way to describe it. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about how long you’ve been using the machine, and how many hours a night, on average?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… almost two years now, maybe a little more. The doctor – Dr. Ramirez, lovely woman – she fitted me up, and I was very diligent at first. I really was! I tried to use it every night. Now… most nights, I’d say. Maybe five or six out of seven. And I try to keep it on for at least six hours. Some nights it’s more, some nights… well, sometimes I wake up and it's fallen off, or I just can’t get back to sleep with it on. It’s a little… stuffy, you know? Not uncomfortable, just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be difficult to adjust to and consistently use CPAP therapy. Five or six nights a week is good, but we'll need to consider that occasional non-compliance. And you mentioned feeling "stuffy." That’s helpful information. Now, aside from the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, my wife – well, ex-wife now, it's been a few years – used to complain about my snoring, before I got the machine, of course. That's completely gone, thank goodness! Aside from that… I suppose I wake up with a bit of a dry mouth sometimes. And I wouldn’t say I’m groggy, exactly, but it takes me a little while to really feel awake in the mornings. Not every morning, but… often enough to notice. Oh! And I get headaches. Not terrible ones, just sort of… dull aches, usually in the front of my head. They come and go. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Paske. You've given me a lot of useful information. The dry mouth and morning grogginess are common side effects of CPAP, and the headaches could be related, or something else entirely. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… Dr. Ramirez did mention my blood pressure was a little high when she first started me on the machine, so she put me on a small dose of medication for that. I take it every day, it’s a little white pill. Other than that… nothing major, thankfully. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was no big deal. And I’ve got a touch of arthritis in my knees, but who doesn’t at my age? It flares up sometimes, but I manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers. I think that’s about it. Nothing life-threatening, I assure you. I’m a pretty healthy man, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Paske. It sounds like you’re generally quite healthy. The blood pressure medication is important, and we’ll make sure it's being managed effectively. And arthritis is very common. Do you currently take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication and the pain relievers for your knees?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the blood pressure pill, which is Lisinopril, I think, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees if they’re acting up. Otherwise, no. I try to eat a healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables – and I don’t really believe in all those fancy vitamins and supplements. I think good food is the best medicine, you know? My mother always said that. And she lived to be 95! So, no, nothing else regularly. Occasionally, a glass of sherry with dinner, but that’s hardly a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a glass of sherry certainly isn’t a medicine, though sometimes it feels like one! You're right to focus on a healthy diet. That’s excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or children – who have sleep apnea, heart problems, or other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he was a heavy snorer, always was. Never got it checked out, though. Those were different times, you know? He just… accepted it. My mother… she had high blood pressure, and she had a stroke towards the end, unfortunately. And my sister… she has diabetes. Type 2, I think. She’s managing it with diet and exercise, doing pretty well. I don’t think anyone else in the family had any major health issues, to be honest. Nothing that I’m aware of, anyway. It's a fairly small family, really. I had one sister, and I'm an only child.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That’s helpful information. A family history of snoring, high blood pressure, and diabetes are all relevant. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother was very against it, and frankly, I never had the urge. Always seemed like a foolish habit to me. And my ex-wife… well, she was a smoker, for a long time. But I always made her smoke outside. Couldn’t stand the smell. No, never smoked. And I don’t drink very much, as I mentioned. Just a glass of sherry with dinner occasionally. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I like to stay active, too. I walk every day, weather permitting, and I enjoy gardening. Keeps me busy, you know?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Paske. Staying active and having a healthy lifestyle are very important. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had an allergic reaction to a medication. I’ve had a few bee stings over the years, gardening again, but nothing serious. Just a little swelling and discomfort. Nothing that required a trip to the emergency room, thankfully. No, no allergies to report. I feel very lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Paske. It sounds like you're in good shape overall. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat and nose to see if there's anything obvious contributing to your sleep apnea. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I understand you need to check things out. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske. Deep breaths in and out, please. Your heart rate is regular, and your breathing sounds clear, but I do hear a very slight wheeze on exhale. It's subtle, but I’ll make a note of it. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. It's good that you’re already on medication for it. Now I’m going to take a look in your throat and nose. Your throat looks clear, no obvious signs of obstruction. Your nasal passages are a little dry, but no significant congestion. I do notice some mild swelling of the nasal turbinates. Alright, Mr. Paske. Everything seems relatively normal so far. The slight wheeze and nasal swelling are worth noting.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That doesn't sound too bad, does it? I do get a bit of a stuffy nose sometimes, especially in the mornings. Perhaps that's what you're seeing. And you’re right, my nose is often dry. I use a little bit of saline spray sometimes, but it doesn't always help. So, what do you think is going on? Is it the machine, or something else? I'm just anxious to get to the bottom of this tiredness, you know? It's really starting to wear me down.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Paske. It’s frustrating to still feel tired despite using CPAP therapy. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The CPAP machine should be resolving your sleep apnea, and it sounds like you’re doing a pretty good job using it most nights. However, the fact that you’re still tired, combined with the nasal swelling and slight wheeze, suggests a few things. Firstly, the nasal swelling could be contributing to some resistance, making it harder to breathe comfortably with the machine on. This can lead to less effective therapy and fragmented sleep. Secondly, the slight wheeze could indicate some mild airway inflammation, perhaps from allergies or a sensitivity to something in your environment. Thirdly, it’s possible that your CPAP pressure isn’t optimally adjusted. It’s possible that it's too low, and not fully opening your airway. Finally, we can't rule out other causes of fatigue, such as iron deficiency, thyroid issues, or even early signs of heart failure. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I recommend a complete blood count to check for anemia, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to assess your thyroid function, and a sleep study to re-evaluate your CPAP pressure and rule out any other sleep disorders. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to feel like myself again. I haven’t had the energy to do my gardening properly this year, and that’s saying something! A blood test and another sleep study… fine by me. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for them? And how long will it take to get the results? I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better knowing we're trying to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I understand how frustrating it is to not feel like yourself, and we will get to the bottom of this. For the blood test, you don't need to do anything special. You can eat and drink normally before the test, and you don’t need to fast. The lab will give you specific instructions when you schedule the appointment. For the sleep study, you’ll need to go back to the sleep lab for another overnight evaluation. They’ll monitor your breathing, heart rate, and brain activity while you sleep, and they’ll adjust your CPAP pressure if necessary. They’ll also look for any other sleep disorders that might be contributing to your fatigue. I’ll send you a referral to the same sleep lab you used previously. The results for the blood tests usually take about 24-48 hours. The sleep study results will take a little longer, about a week or so, as they need to be reviewed by a sleep specialist. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, you can continue using your CPAP machine as you have been. Also, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids to help keep your nasal passages moist. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. That all sounds perfectly reasonable. A blood test, another sleep study, and then we’ll see what happens. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, and for listening to my concerns. It’s a relief knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. I’ll schedule the blood test and the sleep study as soon as I can. Thank you again for your help, Doctor Gegan. I feel much more optimistic now. And please, call me Moshe. Mr. Paske feels a bit… formal.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Moshe. I'm glad I could help, and I'm happy to hear you’re feeling more optimistic. It's my pleasure. I'll make a note to refer to you as Moshe from now on. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We're here to help in any way we can. I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results. Have a good day, Moshe. And enjoy your gardening when you feel up to it!
PATIENT: .
