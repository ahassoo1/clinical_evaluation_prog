DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It feels like it’s getting harder, slowly. And my mouth and eyes feel very, very dry. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it’s… more noticeable lately, I think. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started. It just… is.
DOCTOR: “Slowly getting harder,” huh?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s not sudden, not like… a bad asthma attack or anything. It just takes more effort, you understand? Like… climbing a gentle hill instead of a flat road. And the dryness… it’s quite uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain, I suppose. I apologize for being… vague. My memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "gentle hill," noted. Let's try to get a bit more specific. When you say it’s harder… is it harder when you're exerting yourself?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It is worse when I walk quickly, or… go up stairs, certainly. But it also happens when I’m resting, sometimes. Not as bad, but… there. It’s just… always there, a little bit. It doesn’t go completely away, even when I’m trying to be still.
DOCTOR: So, it’s constant, but exacerbated with exertion. And you mentioned dryness… just the mouth and eyes, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Mostly my mouth and eyes, yes. Though… now that you mention it, my skin does feel a bit… tight, sometimes. Especially on my arms and legs. But I thought that was just… the weather. It's been quite warm, hasn't it? I drink plenty of water, but it doesn't seem to help much. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: "Plenty of water" is… subjective. How much is “plenty”?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a good question. I don't really… measure, I suppose. Two or three glasses throughout the day? Perhaps a bit more on hot days. I drink when I feel thirsty, naturally. But… it doesn’t seem to be enough, does it? I apologize again for being so imprecise. It’s hard for me to keep track of these things, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Past medical problems… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. Other than that… not that I recall. I was generally quite healthy, I believe. Though… I was divorced a few years ago. Does that count? It was… rather stressful. I suppose it affected my health somewhat, but not… physically, if that makes sense. I'm afraid I don't have a good memory for doctors' visits or illnesses.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Kobler, a divorce does not count as a medical problem. Any surgeries besides your tonsils and your arm?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just those two. I am quite certain. It… it’s just… sometimes my memory plays tricks on me. I apologize if I'm making this difficult. I truly do try to remember everything, but… things seem to slip away. It’s rather frustrating, honestly. I’ve never been one to… to require much medical attention, thankfully. This is all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mother passed away several years ago. She lived in Alaska, where I grew up. She was… healthy, mostly. She enjoyed fishing and gardening. My father… he wasn't around much. I don't really know much about his side of the family. He wasn't a very communicative man. I don’t recall any serious illnesses in either of them, truthfully. Though… my mother did have… arthritis, I think. In her hands, mostly. But it wasn't… debilitating. Is that helpful? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what do you do for work?
PATIENT: I am a writer, Doctor. I write stories and… articles. It’s mostly freelance work, from home. It keeps me occupied, and I enjoy it very much. Although… it can be rather isolating at times. I've been doing it for several years now. It doesn't require much physical exertion, which is… probably fortunate, given my current condition. I write mostly fiction, you see. Mysteries, mostly. It's… rather ironic, perhaps, given my own difficulties with remembering things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I've never knowingly had a reaction to anything. I eat most foods without issue. No… no rashes, or difficulty breathing, or anything like that. I suppose… I’m a bit sensitive to strong perfumes, sometimes. They give me a headache, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I really don’t recall anything serious. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I wish I could provide more definitive answers.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick examination. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat. Could you please sit up straight and take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I… I'll try my best. Is something seriously wrong? I apologize for asking, but… your expression is making me a little anxious. I do hope it's nothing too concerning. Please, do what you need to do. I’ll take a deep breath, as you requested.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take another deep breath… and exhale. Not bad, but a slight wheeze on exertion. Now your heart… Rate is normal, rhythm is regular, but a slight murmur. Now open your mouth for me… Ah. Throat is a little dry, but no redness. Okay. I’m also going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger.
PATIENT: A wheeze and a murmur… That doesn’t sound good, does it? My… my breathing has been getting worse, as I mentioned. And my throat is very dry. I drink plenty of water, truly. Is this… serious, Doctor? I apologize for being so anxious, but I’m starting to get quite worried. Is it my heart? Should I be concerned? And what is oxygen saturation? I don't really understand medical terms.
DOCTOR: Your oxygen is at 92%, which is acceptable, but on the lower end. The murmur and the wheezing… frankly, Ms. Kobler, you're likely just a bit run down. A lot of people experience these things, especially with the weather. You are a writer, and don’t get a lot of exercise, right?
PATIENT: Run down… But I have been feeling increasingly unwell, as I explained. Not just… tired. My breathing feels… constricted. And my mouth and eyes are constantly dry. It's more than just being tired, Doctor. Is it possible… could it be something more serious? Perhaps something with my lungs? Or my heart, as you mentioned? I… I worry about my health. And if it is my heart… what would that mean? Is there anything I should be doing? Any tests you can run? I apologize for pressing you, but I’m really quite concerned now. I just want to know what's happening, and what I can do to feel better.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Kobler, I've listened to your lungs, checked your heart, and reviewed your history. You're a healthy 25-year-old woman with a bit of dryness and a minor wheeze. It's likely just allergies or a mild respiratory infection. I’m going to prescribe a humidifier for your home to help with the dryness, and a course of over-the-counter antihistamines. If you aren’t any better in a week, then we can consider a chest X-ray. But honestly, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
PATIENT: A mountain out of a molehill… But I am feeling unwell, Doctor. And my symptoms have been worsening, slowly but surely. I understand you're busy, and you've examined me, but… I feel like my concerns aren’t being taken seriously. I’m not trying to be difficult, but I’m genuinely worried about my breathing, and the dryness is quite debilitating. Could we… perhaps consider some further testing, just to rule out anything serious? A simple blood test, maybe? Or… even a referral to a specialist? I just want to be sure, Doctor. I'd feel so much better knowing that everything is alright. I apologize for being so insistent, but this is really important to me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, with all due respect, you are a healthy young woman who’s likely stressed and a bit anxious. More testing is unnecessary, and frankly, would just cause more worry. A humidifier and antihistamines are the appropriate course of action. If you insist on seeing a specialist, I will write you a referral to a pulmonologist, but I do not believe it is necessary. I’m doing this to appease you, not because I think it's medically indicated. Don’t self-diagnose with things you read on the internet, okay?
PATIENT: …Oh. I… I understand, Doctor. I’m sorry for bothering you, and for causing extra work. It’s just… it's difficult to explain. I feel… unwell, and I wanted to be sure. But if you don't think it's necessary, I won’t press the issue. I’ll… I’ll try the humidifier and antihistamines. And I promise, I won’t self-diagnose. I just… I’m relieved you’re writing a referral, even if you don’t think it’s necessary. Thank you, Doctor. When… when should I schedule the appointment with the pulmonologist? And… is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? I apologize again for being so… troublesome.
