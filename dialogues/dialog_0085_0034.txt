DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Lahn. I… I just moved here, and I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? I have Medicare, and… well, someone said I should come in. I don't really remember much about why, exactly. Just that I needed a check-up or something?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Getting established with a primary care physician when you move is a very smart idea. And it’s common to forget the specifics of why you were advised to come in. We can definitely do a comprehensive check-up today. First, let me just confirm a few details. I see here you’re 21 years old, and your insurance is Medicare. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Twenty-one… feels like a long time ago sometimes, honestly. And yeah, Medicare is what I have. It’s… all a bit confusing, to be honest. I don’t really know how it all works.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable – it can be confusing. We have staff here who are very good at helping with insurance questions, so don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes up. Okay. To get started, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Have you been feeling generally well, or have you had any specific health concerns recently?
PATIENT: Um… generally well, I think? Nothing major. I get tired, sometimes. But… everyone gets tired, right? I don't really… go to the doctor much, so I don't really have concerns, I guess. Just trying to figure things out, since I'm new.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue is something we can definitely explore. It’s good you mentioned that. And it’s perfectly fine if you don’t have a long list of concerns. We’re just trying to get a baseline understanding of your health. When you say you get tired, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Like… just really sleepy? Even when I sleep enough, I feel… drained. It's hard to explain. It's not like a sick tired, just… a heavy tired. I don't know if that makes sense. And sometimes it's hard to… focus. Like, my brain feels slow.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Emileigh. “Heavy tired” is a good way to describe it, and the difficulty focusing is important too. Is this fatigue something that's been happening for a long time, or is it relatively new?
PATIENT: That's a good question… I think it’s been getting worse lately? Like, it wasn't always this bad. Maybe… the last few months? Before that, it was just… normal tiredness. I don’t really keep track of things like that. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Emileigh. It's good you're able to tell me it’s been getting worse, that’s a really important piece of information. And it’s perfectly okay if you don’t have exact timelines. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you had any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Um… weight, maybe? I think I’ve lost a little bit, but I haven't really been weighing myself. Appetite… not really. I eat when I'm hungry, I guess. And sleep… I sleep okay, usually. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, but not too often. Does that make sense? I'm trying to remember if anything is different...
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Emileigh. It’s helpful to know there hasn’t been a significant change in your appetite or sleep. Now, let's briefly go through some of the major body systems. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Pal…what now? Sorry, I don’t really… understand those words. Chest pain, no. Shortness of breath… sometimes, if I run, but that’s normal, right? Like, when you exercise? I don’t really do much exercising, though.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you’re right about shortness of breath with exercise – that’s perfectly normal. “Palpitations” just means feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering. Have you ever felt your heart doing that, even when you're resting?
PATIENT: Racing… hmm. I… maybe? Sometimes, when I'm stressed. But I don't know if that's what you mean. It just feels… fast. And I get a little dizzy sometimes. Not a lot, but… enough to notice. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Emileigh. Feeling dizzy and having a racing heart, especially with stress, is something we should explore. Now, let's move on to your digestive system. Have you been experiencing any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Um… no. Nothing like that. My stomach’s been okay, I think. Maybe a little… off sometimes, but nothing major. Just… normal stomach stuff. Like, after you eat something bad? But not often. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Emileigh. It's helpful to know your digestive system has been relatively stable. Just to complete a quick overview, have you noticed any changes in your urination or bowel movements?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… personal. No. Nothing… different. Everything’s normal. Can we… talk about something else? This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. I apologize if I was being too intrusive. We can certainly change the subject. It’s important you feel comfortable. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I… didn't go to the doctor much when I was younger. Just… checkups, maybe? I don't really remember. My mom handled all that stuff. I don't think I have any… serious problems, though. I think I had… chickenpox when I was a kid? Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, chickenpox isn’t a current problem – most people have it as children and it provides immunity. And it's perfectly alright that you don't have a detailed medical history. We're just gathering information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No. Never. I haven't had any surgeries. And I haven't been in the hospital. I broke my arm once, when I was little, but that's it. It wasn't a big deal. Just a cast. That's about it, I think. I'm really not a medical person, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It sounds like you've been quite healthy overall. Now, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Um… my grandma had… something with her heart, I think? And my uncle… he was sick, a long time ago. But I don't really know what it was. My mom never really talked about it. And… I think someone on my dad’s side had… diabetes? But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago, and I don’t know anyone on that side of the family very well. I'm sorry, I'm not much help with this, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Emileigh. It's common for families not to have detailed medical histories. Anything you can recall is useful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Definitely not. I don't smoke. I don't drink. And… no. Nothing like that. I don't really… do any of those things. I work, and… I try to eat healthy.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Emileigh. And it's perfectly alright to share that information – it helps me get a complete picture of your health. Now, one last set of questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no. I don’t think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, if I get stung by a bee, but that's it. No food allergies, no medication allergies… I’m pretty sure. Is that it? Are we done with the questions now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Emileigh, that’s it for the questions. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Um… okay. That’s fine. I guess. As long as it doesn’t hurt. I… I’m not really good with… medical stuff, so please be gentle?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. I will be very gentle. We'll take it slow, and you can let me know at any time if you feel uncomfortable. First, let's take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… excellent. Your blood pressure is 120/80, which is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Everything seems normal so far, Emileigh. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re generally healthy. The fatigue you're experiencing is something we should investigate further, though. I recommend we order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and vitamin D level. This will help us rule out any underlying causes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. If it will help figure out why I’m so tired. Blood work… is that going to hurt? I don’t really like needles. But if it means I can feel better, I guess I can do it. Where will I go to get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: It will be a quick prick with a needle, Emileigh, and it's usually over very quickly. We'll use a small needle, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. It's a common procedure, and many people experience minimal discomfort. We can have the blood work done at the lab just down the hall here at the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition form, and you can take it to the lab technician. They'll draw a few vials of blood, and the results will be sent back to me within a few days. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to address your fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds alright. A few days… I guess I can wait. And a follow-up appointment… is that just to talk about the results? And… will it cost a lot of money? I don’t really understand how insurance works.
DOCTOR: Yes, the follow-up appointment will be to discuss the results. We’ll go over everything together, explain what the results mean, and talk about potential next steps. As for the cost, your insurance should cover the majority of the blood work. However, there may be a copay or deductible. Our billing department is very good at working with insurance companies, and they can help you understand your out-of-pocket expenses. They can also answer any questions you have about your coverage. I’ll have the receptionist give you their number before you leave. For now, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. If your fatigue worsens or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s everything. You explained everything really well. Thank you, Dr. Lahn. I feel a little bit better just knowing what’s going on. And that you’re going to help me figure it out. I guess I’ll go get the blood work done now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. And you're right - we'll figure it out together. Here’s the requisition form for the blood work, and the billing department's number if you have any insurance questions. The receptionist will be right with you to schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And remember, taking care of your health is a team effort. Have a good day, Emileigh, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
