DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this light sensitivity, really. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now. Everything seems just… too bright, you know? Even on cloudy days.
DOCTOR: Light sensitivity, alright. And you say this has been going on for a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yeah, about three or four weeks now, I think. It’s hard to say exactly, time just kinda…blurs sometimes, you know? But definitely over a month. It’s not a pain, exactly, more like…everything feels washed out and glaring. Makes my eyes ache if I’m outside for too long.
DOCTOR: “Washed out and glaring,” I see. And is this constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's more like it starts pretty mild, then gets worse as the day goes on, or if I'm out in the sun. Cloudy days are better, but even then, bright screens or things reflecting light can be a bit much. So, it definitely comes and goes, but it's pretty consistent that it will get worse if I’m exposed to light for long enough. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's…adequate. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really pain, like I said. Sometimes my eyes feel a little gritty, but I figured that was just from being tired. Oh! And maybe a few headaches, but I get those anyway sometimes. Nothing really connected to the light, I don't think. Just the usual stuff. Is there anything specific I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: Gritty sensation and occasional headaches. Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Changes in vision… not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything seems pretty clear, as far as I can tell. I haven't needed to get a new glasses prescription or anything. I did notice things seem a little brighter overall, even when it's not bothering me, but I figured that was just…well, everything being so bright! You know how it is. But no blurry spots or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, just the usual stuff for my blood pressure, a small dose. And no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Medicare covers everything, so I get checked pretty regularly. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication… alright. And do you have a family history of any eye problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother, she had… cataracts, I think? When she got older. And my father, he wore glasses all his life, but I don't know if it was anything serious. They both lived in Ghana their whole lives, so it’s hard to say. We didn’t really have access to much medical care growing up. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, none of that. Never touched a cigarette in my life, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a month. And definitely no drugs. I worked as a dental assistant for years, too much responsibility to be doing anything like that! Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Dental assistant... adequate. Alright, Mr. Komarov, I’m going to perform a quick examination of your eyes. It won’t take long, but I will need you to look in a few different directions. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable or anything. I understand.
DOCTOR: Good. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity. Can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Let's see… um… is that an “F”? No… wait… it’s definitely an “F”. And then a… “T”? Yes. “FT” I think. Is that right? It’s a little blurry, honestly.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision. I need you to focus on this point here, and I'll wave a finger in your field of vision. Just tell me when you see it. Do you see it now?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I see it! On the left side, I think. Just a little bit out of the corner of my eye. Is that what you wanted? It's a bit hard to concentrate on one point and see something on the side at the same time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to examine the inside of your eyes. This will require me to get fairly close. I’ll dim the lights momentarily. Hmm… Adequate. I am observing some mild pallor of the optic disc, and slightly reduced foveal reflex in both eyes.
PATIENT: Oh... that doesn't sound good. Is that…serious, Doctor? What does that mean? I’m sorry, I don’t really understand all the medical terms. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s…not immediately alarming, Mr. Komarov. However, the pallor of the optic disc and reduced foveal reflex could indicate optic nerve dysfunction. This requires further investigation. I’m going to order a visual field test and an optical coherence tomography scan, or OCT, of your optic nerve. This will give us a more detailed picture of what’s going on. We will also check your blood pressure, just to be certain.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. A visual field test and a scan. And check my blood pressure. That's good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Will Medicare cover these tests? I just want to know what’s going on and get it sorted out, you know? I’m a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover these tests, yes. We will submit the necessary paperwork. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged exposure to bright light. Wear sunglasses when outdoors, and take frequent breaks if you are working on a computer. I’m also going to schedule a consultation with an ophthalmologist. It’s best to have a specialist evaluate these findings. Here is the referral. Schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… so, a specialist. And avoid the bright light. I will definitely do that. No, I don’t think so, not right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to look into this. I appreciate it. It’s just…a little scary not knowing, you know? Is there anything I should be specifically looking out for before my appointment with the specialist? Any symptoms that would mean I need to see someone sooner?
DOCTOR: Adequate. If you experience any sudden vision loss, double vision, or severe eye pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, follow the instructions on the referral slip. We will review the results of the tests and the specialist’s evaluation at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Sudden vision loss, double vision, or pain. I will remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Versace. I appreciate your help. I will schedule the appointment with the specialist as soon as I can. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Adequate. You're welcome. Have a good day, Mr. Komarov. .
