DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 88 years young. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Eighty-eight, that's right. Well, it’s this eating thing. I just… don't get very hungry, and when I do eat, I get full awful quick. It's been happening for a few months now, I'd say. Not sure exactly when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. A decreased appetite and early satiety – feeling full quickly – for a few months. That’s certainly something we should investigate. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me, if you don't mind?
PATIENT: Hmm. A typical day… well, my wife, Elsie, she does most of the cooking, bless her heart. Usually, breakfast is a piece of toast, maybe with a little jam. Sometimes I don’t even finish the toast. Lunch is usually a sandwich, something simple, ham and cheese. And dinner… well, whatever Elsie makes. Soup often. I usually just pick at it, to be honest. I don’t have a big appetite, never really did, but this is… different. I get full after just a few bites now. It's just not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Obarr. That gives me a better picture. And you mentioned it's different than your usual lack of appetite; could you elaborate on how it’s different?
PATIENT: Well, before, I just… wasn’t hungry. I could skip a meal, not bother with it. Now, I want to eat, sometimes, but it feels like my stomach is full after just a couple of mouthfuls. And it’s not a good full, you know? It's like… uncomfortable full. A bit bloated, maybe. And it stays with me for hours, even if it wasn't much food. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Obarr. Uncomfortable fullness after a small amount of food, and a feeling of bloating that lingers… That is helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Elsie’s been saying I’ve lost a bit, yes. I haven’t been weighin’ myself, but she's a good judge of these things. No nausea or vomiting, thankfully. And no real pain, just… that uncomfortable fullness. Bowel habits… well, they’re a bit irregular, now that you mention it. A bit more constipated than usual, I guess. Not major, but noticeable. I haven’t been drinkin’ as much water lately either, now that I think about it. Maybe that’s it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Obarr. Weight loss, constipation, and decreased water intake alongside the decreased appetite and early satiety. Those are all relevant details. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but they put a stent in and I've been alright ever since. High blood pressure, too, but that’s managed with pills. And arthritis, of course, it’s what gets most folks my age. Nothing else major, I don’t think. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago! Elsie keeps track of all my medications, I’m terrible at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. A history of heart trouble with a stent placement, hypertension managed with medication, and arthritis. That is all very helpful. And you mentioned arthritis – does that affect your ability to prepare meals, or does it cause you any pain when you eat?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly in my hands, so choppin’ vegetables and things can be a bit of a struggle sometimes. Elsie does most of the heavy lifting, again. When I eat… not really pain, but sometimes it’s just stiff and awkward, makes it hard to get comfortable. It's more of a general ache, you know? Doesn't really stop me from eatin' entirely, just a bit of a nuisance. It’s worse in the mornings, usually.
DOCTOR: I understand. The arthritis causing some difficulty with meal preparation and a bit of discomfort while eating. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as cancer, heart disease, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mother, she passed away from a heart attack, I think. And my father had some trouble with his stomach, but I don’t know exactly what it was. Just… stomach problems. Elsie’s family… her mother lived to be ninety-five, very healthy woman, but I don’t know much beyond that. We didn't talk about these things much back then, to be honest. It wasn’t really the custom.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. A family history of heart trouble on your mother’s side and stomach problems on your father’s side. I understand it wasn't common to discuss medical history as openly in the past. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. Elsie's father smoked, and I saw what it did to him. No, never touched ‘em. And I used to have a little nip of whiskey now and then, especially on cold nights, but I haven’t had a drink in… oh, must be ten years now. Elsie convinced me to give it up, said it wasn’t doing me any good. She was probably right. I enjoy a good cup of tea, though. That's about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Obarr. No smoking and you haven’t consumed alcohol for ten years. Just a cup of tea. Excellent. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Elsie always asks when she gets me new pills, and the pharmacist always asks too, but I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. Though, I don't care for beets much, but that's a personal preference, not an allergy! Heh. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I feel like I've been rambling on and on. Elsie always says I talk too much.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Obarr, you haven’t been rambling at all. You've provided a lot of helpful information. Thank you for your patience and thoroughness. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. My heart's been a bit troublesome in the past, so you’re welcome to listen to it as long as you need. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Elsie always says I’m a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Your heart rhythm is regular, though I do hear a murmur, which we know about from your previous cardiac issues. Your lungs sound clear. And your abdomen is mildly tender in the upper part of your stomach, but there’s no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. I don't feel any masses. Blood pressure is 142/88, and your pulse is 78 and regular. Based on your history and the physical exam, several possibilities come to mind. The decreased appetite, early satiety, weight loss, constipation, and tenderness in your upper abdomen could be related to a number of things, including medication side effects, reduced gastric motility with age, or possibly even early signs of a gastrointestinal issue. To help narrow things down, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. I’d also like to order a stool test to rule out any infection. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That all sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a stool test… yes, go ahead. I’d rather know what’s going on than just wonder about it. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? Elsie’s been wonderful, but she worries about me, and I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily. So, yes, let's get those tests done. When do I need to go for them? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Obarr. I understand your concerns, and we'll work to get to the bottom of this. For the blood work, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks other than water. We can draw the blood here in the clinic tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. For the stool test, I’ll give you a collection kit, and you can collect a sample at home over the next few days. The instructions are straightforward. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Eight o'clock tomorrow morning for the blood work, and I’ll collect the stool sample at home. I can manage that. And you’ll let me know when you’ve got the results? Elsie can help me with the instructions for the stool sample, she's good at reading those things. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. Is there anything I need to do or change between now and tomorrow morning, besides fasting? Should I adjust any of my medications?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Obarr. Please continue taking all your current medications as prescribed. Do not make any changes to your medication regimen without consulting me first. The fasting is the only preparation needed for tomorrow. It's also important to stay hydrated, so drink plenty of water today and tonight. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, or bloody stools, please contact the clinic immediately. While we await the test results, it might be helpful to eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. Avoid foods that are high in fat or sugar, and try to incorporate more fiber into your diet. And be sure to get plenty of rest. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Smaller meals, more fiber, plenty of rest… I can manage that. Elsie will be pleased to hear I'm supposed to take it easy. She's always tellin' me to slow down. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better now that we have a plan. I appreciate your kindness. I'll see you tomorrow morning then. Eight o'clock, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, eight o'clock tomorrow morning. And you’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad I could address your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or if anything changes. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a restful evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
