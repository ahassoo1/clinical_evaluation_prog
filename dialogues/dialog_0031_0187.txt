DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Chest… hurts. And fast beat. Like… drum. Old man heart not so good, you know? Blood pressure… wife say high. She worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic. I understand you’re experiencing some chest pain and a rapid heartbeat. It’s good your wife is looking out for you. “Like a drum,” you say – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Fast. Very fast. Not normal. Like… running. I no run. Old man. Maybe eat too much kimchi? Wife make very spicy.
DOCTOR: I see. A fast heartbeat that feels different than usual. And you're wondering if it could be related to your diet, specifically the kimchi?
PATIENT: Kimchi good! But maybe… too much spice. Everything too much these days. You think so? You doctor, you should know. I want to go home now.
DOCTOR: It's good you enjoy kimchi, Mr. Sobkowic. While spicy food can sometimes cause palpitations in some people, it's important to rule out other potential causes for your chest pain and rapid heartbeat. Just to be thorough. Before we consider dietary factors, I’d like to ask a few questions, and then I'll need to do a quick examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination? How long? I have… appointment. Very important. Wife make schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand you have a busy schedule, Mr. Sobkowic. The examination won’t be lengthy, perhaps 10-15 minutes. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your pulse. This will help me gather some information to better understand what's going on. Would you be willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Ten minutes… okay. But hurry. I no like doctor poking around. And tell me quick if it kimchi. Waste of time if it just kimchi.
DOCTOR: I assure you I'll be as efficient as possible, Mr. Sobkowic. We'll try to determine the cause quickly. Now, if you could please sit back and relax on the examination table. First, let's check your vital signs. I'm going to start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Hmph. Always with the poking. Okay, okay. Do quick. Wife will be mad if I late for mahjong.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 162/94. That is a bit elevated, Mr. Sobkowic. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. I’m hearing a slightly rapid heart rate, consistent with what you've described. I also notice some… mild crackles in your lungs, primarily on the lower left side. Do you experience any shortness of breath, Mr. Sobkowic?
PATIENT: Crackles? Like… rice popping? I no understand. Shortness… sometimes. When climb stairs. Old man lungs, you know? Everything slow. Wife say I need exercise. She always say something.
DOCTOR: Okay, "like rice popping" is a good way to describe it. The crackles could indicate some fluid in your lungs. And experiencing shortness of breath with exertion, like climbing stairs, is something we should investigate further. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions, such as arrhythmia, heart failure, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No! Never. Strong heart. Used to work very hard. Factory. Many boxes. No time for heart trouble. Wife always worry too much. She read internet. Internet lie.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about misinformation, Mr. Sobkowic. It’s good you were active in the factory. Now, have you ever had any chest pain before this episode, or is this a new symptom?
PATIENT: No. Never before. Sudden. Like… someone sit on chest. And fast beat. Scared me. Wife scared too. She call ambulance. They say go see doctor. You doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new onset of chest pain accompanied by a rapid heartbeat. And you were advised by the ambulance personnel to see a doctor, which is good. Now, can you rate your chest pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being mild and 10 being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Six. Maybe seven. When bend over, worse. Like… squeezing. Not cut, just… squeeze.
DOCTOR: Alright, a 6 or 7 out of 10, worsened by bending over. That gives me some more information. Now, Mr. Sobkowic, I need to ask about other symptoms. Have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, sweating, dizziness, or pain radiating to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: No! No throwing up. No dizzy. Sweaty? Maybe. Old man always sweat. Pain… just chest. No go anywhere else. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or radiating pain. Just the chest discomfort. I understand you’d like to go home, and we will work towards that, but I want to make sure we rule out anything serious first. To help me do that, I’d like to order a quick EKG to assess your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to check for any issues in your lungs. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray? More poking? And wait… more waiting? Wife make good food. Food get cold. I no like cold food.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the wait and cold food, Mr. Sobkowic. The EKG and X-ray are quick procedures. The EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest to monitor your heart’s electrical activity. The X-ray is a quick scan using a small amount of radiation to get a picture of your lungs and heart. They won't take long, and we can get the results relatively quickly. It’s important to gather more information so we can determine the best course of action and ensure your health. Would you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Do quick. And tell me if kimchi cause trouble. No want to give up kimchi.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. I will keep your kimchi preference in mind. I’ll step out now to arrange the tests. A technician will be in shortly to perform the EKG and X-ray. I'll review the results as soon as they’re available. Please remain in the examination room, and I’ll be back as soon as I can.
