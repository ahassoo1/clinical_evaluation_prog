DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yes, hello Doctor. It's… my ears. They feel blocked, you know? Full. Like when you go too high up in a plane, but it hasn't gone away. It’s been… a while, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, blocked ears, that's a good place to start. And you said it feels like airplane pressure, but it hasn't resolved. Roughly how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky one. Weeks, certainly. Maybe a month? Longer? I really can’t pinpoint it. My wife… she usually kept track of things like that. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Sorry. I don’t mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, it's perfectly alright. It's common to lose track, especially with things that develop gradually. Let’s say roughly a month or more then. Is it just the feeling of fullness, or are you experiencing any pain, discharge, or changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And no… nothing coming out of them. My hearing… I don't think it's worse. I mean, I don't go to concerts anymore, haven't for years. It's just… quieter, generally. But that could be anything, really. Old age, probably. I haven't noticed a change, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. So, no pain or discharge, just a feeling of fullness and a general sense of quieter sounds, but no noticeable worsening of hearing. Have you noticed it in one ear more than the other, or is it the same in both?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s… both, yes. Equally, I suppose. It’s hard to tell, really. I don't actively listen to my ears, you know? I just notice things are… muffled. It's probably the same in both, though. I wouldn't say one is noticeably worse than the other. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Okay, so bilateral fullness with no pain or discharge, and no change in hearing that you’ve noticed. Have you tried anything to relieve it – over-the-counter drops, chewing gum, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… drops, yes. I think. My wife bought some once, for… something. I used them for a bit. Didn't seem to do much, to be honest. And chewing gum… occasionally, yes. But I didn’t really think it made a difference. I don't really have much luck with these things, I'm afraid. I mostly just… put up with it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a full picture, have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or allergies?
PATIENT: Let me think… allergies, no. Not really. I used to be around a lot of pollen when I was working the fields, but I got used to it. Colds… yes, I think I had a little one a few weeks back. Nothing major, just a sniffle and a cough. It went away pretty quickly though. Sinus infection… I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies, a mild cold a few weeks ago, and no recent sinus infections that you recall. Let's do a quick examination of your ears, just to take a look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I'd like to get this sorted if possible. It's a bit distracting, you know? Especially when I'm trying to… concentrate. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm taking a look now… Hmm. Both tympanic membranes are slightly retracted, and there's a dull appearance to them. No signs of acute infection, no fluid buildup, thankfully. But the retraction and the dullness suggest some pressure difference. Your ear canals are clear. I'm going to do a quick pneumatic otoscopy to assess the mobility of your eardrums. This just involves a little puff of air. It won't hurt, but it might feel a little strange. Okay?
PATIENT: A puff of air? Oh. Right. Yes, that sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t hurt. My wife… she always said I was a bit sensitive. Go ahead, then. Just… don't startle me too much, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, just a little puff… and again… Okay. Both eardrums have reduced mobility. That’s consistent with fluid or pressure in the middle ear space. It doesn't sound like an acute infection, but this is likely what’s causing the fullness you’re experiencing. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination findings, it sounds like you likely have some Eustachian tube dysfunction, possibly related to the recent cold. The Eustachian tube helps to equalize pressure in your middle ear, and when it's not working properly, fluid can build up.
PATIENT: Eustachian… what now? Is that… serious? My wife… she always knew what everything meant. Is it something I need… medicine for? I'm not good with… complicated things. Just tell me if it’s bad, alright?
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s not serious, thankfully. Eustachian tube dysfunction is very common, especially after a cold. It basically means the tube that connects your middle ear to the back of your throat isn’t opening and closing properly to regulate pressure. It’s like when you take off in a plane and your ears pop – that’s the Eustachian tube working. It often resolves on its own. We can try some things to help encourage it to open. We’ll start with some conservative measures. I recommend trying over-the-counter decongestants and nasal saline sprays to help reduce congestion in your nasal passages. Chewing gum or sucking on hard candies can also help. And I want you to try the Valsalva maneuver – gently pinching your nose and trying to blow air out of your ears – that can sometimes help open the tubes. I’ll give you a handout with instructions. If it doesn't improve within a few weeks, we can discuss other options, like a referral to an ENT specialist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Saline spray… chewing gum… and blowing my nose? That doesn’t sound… too bad. A handout? Yes, that would be helpful. I'm terrible at remembering things. A few weeks… and then see a… what was it? An ENT? Yes. Okay. That sounds… manageable, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I just… I'd like to get back to hearing properly. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, it's perfectly reasonable to want to hear properly again. We'll give these conservative measures a try first, and see if they help. Here's that handout with instructions on the Valsalva maneuver and some information about Eustachian tube dysfunction. I'm also going to write you a note for work, just explaining that you've been seen for ear discomfort, and that you may need to take short breaks if the fullness is distracting. And if you don’t see any improvement in a few weeks, or if you develop any pain, fever, or discharge, please call the office right away to schedule a referral to an ENT specialist. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A note for work… that’s kind of you. No, I think that’s everything. I'm not very good at asking questions, to be honest. I just… tend to forget what I wanted to ask. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I think I’ll… just go home and try those things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if things don’t improve, or if they worsen, please don’t hesitate to call. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon.
