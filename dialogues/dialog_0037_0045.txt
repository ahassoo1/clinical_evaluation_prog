DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I been getting… flushed. A lot. Like, my face gets really red, and warm. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? Hard to say exactly. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of intermittent flushing. That gives us a starting point. Can you describe what you mean by “comes and goes”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not every day. Sometimes it happens a few times a day, and other days I don't notice it at all. It doesn’t seem to be after I eat anything special, or if I do too much. I just… feel it. Warm feeling, and then my face gets red. Like when you are embarrassed, but I am not embarrassed. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, the flushing isn’t consistently linked to any specific activity or food. And it feels internal, a warmth you notice before the redness appears. Now, when this happens, does it involve any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes my heart feels a little fast, maybe. Not racing, just… noticeable. And sometimes I get a little sweaty. Just my face, mostly. Not all over. I don’t feel sick, though. No headache, no dizziness. Just the warm, red face and a little quick heartbeat sometimes. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to know. A quick heartbeat and facial sweating along with the flushing is definitely information we should consider. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… well, I don’t really have much of one. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I had the flu a few times when I was a kid, like everyone does. And I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. But nothing serious. No big illnesses or anything like that. My wife… she had some problems with her heart, but that was… a long time ago. She’s… gone now. I haven’t seen a doctor in… oh, maybe five years? Just for a check-up. Everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, haven't been to the doctor regularly recently, and no significant past medical problems. And your wife had heart issues in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just the broken arm when I was a boy, and they put a cast on it. That’s all. Nothing else. I was always careful, you know? Didn't take many risks. Maybe that’s why I haven’t needed to see doctors much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had high blood pressure. Towards the end of her life, it was bad. And my father, he had… I think it was diabetes. He lost a foot because of it. On my wife’s side… her brother had something with his heart, I think. Not sure exactly what, it was a long time ago. Nobody else that I can think of had anything too serious. Mostly just… old age problems, you know? It’s hard to remember, really. It was a big family.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and diabetes in your immediate family, and some heart issues on your wife's side. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone now, in a small house. I mostly keep to myself. I do a little gardening, mostly vegetables. I don’t really exercise, not in a planned way. I walk to the store sometimes, but that’s about it. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, but not much anymore. Maybe one or two a week. I eat… pretty normal, I guess. Lots of rice and vegetables. I try to eat healthy. I don’t really have any hobbies, besides the garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly sedentary lifestyle, healthy diet, minimal alcohol, no smoking. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications or have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing at all. And no allergies, as far as I know. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think. Used to worry my wife, always saying I should be more careful, but I always felt fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications and no known allergies. That’s good to hear. Alright, Mr. Withycombe, that gives me a good start. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 160/92. That's a little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a little strong. No murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin is warm and dry. I do notice some mild redness on your cheeks and forehead, consistent with what you described. No rashes or other abnormalities. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, a few things come to mind. Elevated blood pressure, the facial flushing, and the occasional quick heartbeat… It could be a number of things, but one possibility we need to investigate is something called Rosacea, which can cause facial flushing and redness. Another possibility, given your family history and elevated blood pressure, is that this could be related to hypertension. However, it's important to rule out other causes. To help determine the cause, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We should also check your cholesterol levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests seem like a good idea. I don’t mind at all. If that’s what you think is best, then let’s do it. I just want to know what’s going on. How long will it take to get the results? And… will it cost a lot? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Mr. Withycombe. It's good you asked about the cost upfront. The tests will likely cost around $200-$300 total, depending on the specific lab. I can check with the lab to see if they offer any discounts for uninsured patients. We can also discuss payment options if needed. The results should be available in about 3-5 business days. Once I have them, I'll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding things that seem to trigger the flushing, like spicy foods, alcohol, and excessive sun exposure. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Three to five days… and I'll try to avoid the things you said. No spicy food, no alcohol, stay out of the sun. Sounds… doable. What about… what if it is Rosacea? Is that serious? I've never even heard of it. And what if it is something with my blood pressure? Is that… bad? I don't want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid questions, Mr. Withycombe. Let's address them one at a time. Rosacea is a chronic skin condition that causes redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, pus-filled bumps. It’s not life-threatening, and it's manageable with treatment. We can often control the symptoms with topical creams, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, oral medications. It doesn't typically require hospitalization. Now, regarding your blood pressure. If it is hypertension, meaning chronically high blood pressure, it can be serious if left untreated. High blood pressure puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels, increasing your risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems. However, it's also very manageable with medication and lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress reduction. We would work together to get your blood pressure under control. It's important to remember we’re just gathering information right now. We don't know for sure what’s causing your symptoms yet. Getting these blood tests will help us make an informed decision about the best course of action. I want to assure you, we will address this step by step, and I'll be here to guide you through the process. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that… makes sense. Step by step. You're right. Okay. The blood tests. How do I… arrange that? Do I need to come back here? And… will you explain the results to me, when they come back? I'm not very good with… medical things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll write you a lab requisition—that's the order for the tests. You can take this to any certified lab – I can give you a list of some nearby labs if you'd like. They'll draw a small sample of your blood. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. And yes, absolutely. I will explain the results to you in detail when they come back. I understand that medical jargon can be confusing, and I’ll make sure to use plain language so you can understand everything. We’ll discuss all your options and create a plan together. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available, and we’ll go over everything then. Here you are. Do you have any questions about where to go or how the process works?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. I'll take this to the lab. And then… you'll call me? When the results are ready? Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It… makes me feel better, knowing what's going on. Even if we don't know exactly what it is yet. I think that’s all for now. Unless… is there anything I should be doing, besides avoiding spicy food and sun? Before the tests? Just to… be prepared?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. As for what you can do before the tests, just try to stay hydrated – drink plenty of water. And if possible, avoid strenuous exercise the day before. Fasting isn’t necessary for these particular tests, so you can eat and drink normally. Other than that, just focus on getting some rest and taking care of yourself. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Feel free to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Withycombe. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. I will drink water. And rest. Thank you again.
