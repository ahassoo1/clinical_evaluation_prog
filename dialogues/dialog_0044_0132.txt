DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome. I’m Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, it's this heat, see? Can't take it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, building stuff, painting… now? I get dizzy, feel sick. It's ridiculous. Never had this problem before. It's just… getting old isn't for the weak, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It certainly isn't, Mr. Coby, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. It is unusually hot this summer, and heat can definitely affect people, especially as we get older. Dizziness and feeling sick… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it starts with just feeling…flushed, you know? Like my face is burning up. Then my head starts to swim a bit. Not a proper headache, more like everything's…wobbly. And then, if I don't sit down, I'm gonna be sick. Proper sick. Happened twice last week while I was trying to fix Mrs. Henderson’s fence. Had to tell her I needed a break. She wasn’t happy, let me tell you. She thinks I’m making it up. Women. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, flushing, dizziness – you described it as a wobbly sensation – and nausea if you continue activity. And it seems to be brought on by exertion, especially in the heat. That’s very helpful. About how long does this episode last when it happens?
PATIENT: Usually… if I sit down quick enough, maybe ten, fifteen minutes? It takes a while to go away completely, though. I still feel weak for a good hour after, can't really do much. And it's getting worse, see? Used to be able to push through it, now it hits me faster, harder. This time, it's been happening even when I’m not doing much. Just walking to the shops yesterday, I felt it coming on. It’s unsettling. Never had anything like it before. Makes a man feel useless.
DOCTOR: That’s concerning that it’s starting to happen with less exertion, Mr. Coby. We definitely need to figure out what’s going on. Now, besides this dizziness and nausea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… let me think. I’ve been sweating a lot more than usual, even when it’s not that hot. Not like a proper sweat, more like… clammy. And my mouth feels dry all the time, no matter how much water I drink. Oh, and I haven’t been sleeping properly either. Keep waking up feeling thirsty and sort of… shaky. Not like tremors, just… unsettled. And my legs… they feel a bit cramped sometimes, especially at night. Though, that could be the age, I suppose. Everything aches these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased sweating, dry mouth, disrupted sleep with thirst, a general feeling of shakiness, and nighttime leg cramps. Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Coby. It paints a clearer picture. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Never been one for doctors, see? Waste of time, most of the time. Had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that was it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I take a multivitamin every day, that’s about it. And, well, I used to smoke, but I gave that up about ten years ago. Best thing I ever did, that. Though, the missus kept nagging me for years before I finally did it. Women, always right, aren’t they?
DOCTOR: It's great to hear you quit smoking, Mr. Coby—that is one of the best things you could have done for your health! And good to know about the gallbladder removal. So, no other major medical problems, just the multivitamin. Now, have any close family members – parents, siblings – had any significant health issues, like heart problems, diabetes, or anything similar?
PATIENT: My father… he had a bit of a weak heart, I think. Never really talked about it much. He just slowed down in his later years. Always tired, you know? And my mother… she had arthritis, bad in her hands. Couldn’t do much with them towards the end. My brother’s fine, as far as I know. Lives over in Australia, doesn’t hear from him much. Always chasing the sun, that one. Doesn’t seem to bother him none. Maybe he's got tougher skin than me. Honestly, I think it’s just this heat. It's unnatural, I tell ya. Never been this hot for this long.
DOCTOR: I understand your thoughts on the heat, Mr. Coby, and it certainly isn’t helping. But we need to rule out other possibilities as well. Now, let's talk a little about your social habits. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Yeah, I have a couple of beers with my dinner most nights. Nothing fancy, just a regular lager. And maybe a wee dram of whisky on a Friday, if I've had a hard week. Nothing that would bother me, though. I don’t go out drinking, never have. Just a quiet one at home. And, well, I don't do drugs, if that’s what you’re getting at. Never had any interest in that sort of thing. Always seemed a bit foolish to me. Waste of money, waste of time. I prefer a good book. Though, I haven’t had much time for reading lately. Too busy trying to keep up with everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. A couple of beers with dinner and the occasional whisky. Now, one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, ever. Bit of a prickly feeling after eating shellfish once, but that was years ago. And I can handle most plants, even the stinging nettles. Tough skin, you see? Though, this heat is testing it, I tell ya. Right, what sort of poking and prodding are you gonna do? Let’s get it over with. I’ve got a fence to mend, you know. Mrs. Henderson’s already on my back about it. Women. Always… never mind. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, I appreciate your patience. It will be a quick exam, just checking your blood pressure, heart rate, listening to your lungs, and feeling your abdomen. We'll also check your hydration status. Your blood pressure is a little low, 108/72, and your pulse is a bit elevated at 88, but not overly concerning. Your temperature is normal. Listening to your lungs, they sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness on the left side. I’m also checking your skin turgor. It appears slightly diminished, indicating some mild dehydration. And I’m going to quickly assess your neurological function - checking your reflexes and balance. Everything appears normal there. Okay, Mr. Coby. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it seems you are likely experiencing heat exhaustion with some dehydration. The tenderness in your abdomen could be related to that, or something else, and we’ll need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Always something, isn’t it? Alright, fine. Do what you have to do. Just get it over with quickly. I haven’t got all day, you know. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Though, honestly, I still think it’s just this blasted heat. But if you think blood tests are necessary, then go ahead. Just tell me when and where. And try not to stick me too many times. I hate needles. And what about this fence? I’m gonna have to tell Mrs. Henderson I’m delayed again. She’ll have my hide. Honestly, women. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. It won't take long, and we'll be as quick as possible. We'll just need a small sample. The lab is right down the hall, and they're very efficient. I’ll write out the requisition form, and then you can head down there. I’m also going to recommend increasing your fluid intake—water, electrolyte drinks, anything to help rehydrate you. And try to avoid strenuous activity, especially during the hottest part of the day. We’ll get these results back within 24-48 hours. Once we have them, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen—if you experience confusion, severe dizziness, or start vomiting—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll also give you a note to explain to Mrs. Henderson, if you’d like. And, for the record, women can be quite understanding when they know someone is taking care of their health! Do you have any questions for me at this time?
