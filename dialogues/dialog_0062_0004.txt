DOCTOR: Hi Teah, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. DeCosta, nice to meet you too! Well, it’s just a check-up really. My husband said it was time for some of those… shots, I guess? Just keeping up with things, you know. Routine stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s great! It’s good to be proactive about health, and your husband sounds like a smart man. Let me pull up your record here… Alright, Teah Fornes, age 53. It looks like it has been a little while since your last general check-up. Just to get a good picture of things, even though it's routine, could you tell me if you've been experiencing any new or unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? I work out on construction sites, so aches and pains are pretty normal too. Nothing I can’t handle with a good night’s sleep, usually. Does that make sense? I don’t want to bother you with stuff that’s just…old lady stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Teah, and you’re not bothering me at all! It’s important for me to know what “normal” is for you so we can figure out if anything is changing. Construction work is physically demanding, so aches and pains are definitely understandable. The fatigue is worth noting, though. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. It's not like, can't-get-out-of-bed tired. More just…dragging by the end of the day. Like I don’t have the pep I used to. And sometimes, I just feel…foggy, you know? Hard to concentrate, like my brain is slow. It’s been going on for…a few months, maybe? I just figured it was the heat, honestly. It's been a scorcher this summer.
DOCTOR: Okay, “dragging” and “foggy” are helpful descriptions, thank you. A few months of that fatigue and mental fogginess is good to look into, even with the heat. Let’s do a quick review of your overall health. Have you had any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my wrist a few years back, building a deck for a client – clumsy me! And I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. But nothing serious, no heart problems or anything like that. My dad had high blood pressure, but I’ve been pretty lucky so far, I think. I try to eat healthy, mostly, and stay active.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the broken wrist, and thanks for mentioning your dad’s blood pressure. That's important family history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never. I've always been pretty good at avoiding those! I try to tough things out when I can. I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was…a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy does count, thank you! And I appreciate your…resilience! Let's talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just some ibuprofen now and then for aches, when they get really bad. And a multivitamin, mostly just to be on the safe side. My daughter keeps telling me I should be taking more, but I forget! Nothing regular, though. Definitely not a pill person.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin – that’s good to know. Now, one more quick set of questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a problem. My mom was always careful about that, made sure I tried everything as a kid. No bee stings or anything like that either, thankfully. I work outside a lot, so that’s a relief!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, good to know! Alright, Teah, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgment, Dr. DeCosta. I just want to make sure I'm not falling apart, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please sit back and take some deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Deep breaths, right? I can do that. One, two, three… like this?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly like that! Okay, good, good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, I'm not hearing any wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Now, I'm just going to take a look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear. Throat looks clear as well, no redness or swelling. Alright, everything looks good so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, just a quick palpation of your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems within normal limits physically, Teah. However, given the fatigue and brain fog you've been experiencing for a few months, I’d like to run some blood tests just to be on the safe side. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it’ll give us a better idea of what’s going on, I’m all for it. I trust your judgment, Dr. DeCosta. Blood tests are fine. What exactly will they be looking for? Just so I have an idea.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. We'll do a complete blood count - that will check for anemia or any signs of infection. We’ll also check your thyroid levels – sometimes fatigue can be a sign of thyroid issues. And we'll do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and your blood sugar levels. Basically, we're just trying to rule out anything obvious that could be causing your symptoms. It's a pretty standard panel. Do you have any concerns about getting blood drawn?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve had blood taken before, it’s not my favorite thing, but I can handle it. I get a little lightheaded sometimes, so maybe I should sit for a bit afterwards? Other than that, I’m good.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the lightheadedness, we’ll definitely have you sit for a few minutes afterward. I'll write a note to the lab to let them know. Here's the lab order. You can take this to the lab just down the hall, and they’ll take care of it. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A few days is fine. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Dr. DeCosta. I feel a lot better just knowing we're looking into it. Do I need to fast before the blood draw? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. And you are right to ask about fasting - yes, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I’ll make a note of that on the order as well, just in case. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. DeCosta. You've been very helpful. I'll go get those blood tests done, and I'll look forward to hearing from you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. I'm glad I could help. Just give the lab a call if you have any questions when you go. You have a good day, and I'll see you in a few days.
