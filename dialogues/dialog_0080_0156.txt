DOCTOR: Hi Jase, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rosanova, but please, call me Crystale. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Crystale. Um, well, it’s… my stomach. It's been, like, really bothering me. I keep getting diarrhea. A lot. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, honestly. It feels like it’s been going on for a while though.
DOCTOR: Okay, diarrhea. And you said it’s been going on for a while... can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the hard part. Maybe… a few months? Or more? It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s just a little upset, other times it’s… bad. I really can’t pinpoint it. My husband keeps telling me I should write things down, but I just… don’t. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jase. It’s common to not remember exact timelines. A few months is helpful, though. Is it happening at specific times of the day, or after eating certain foods?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really a specific time, no. But… maybe after I eat dairy? I think. It’s hard to say for sure. My husband makes a lot of curries, and they have cream in them sometimes. And I do love a good yogurt… It’s probably something to do with that, right? I just figured it was… a sensitive stomach.
DOCTOR: It could be dairy, definitely. A lot of people have some level of lactose intolerance. But since it's been going on for months, we should rule out other things just to be safe. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I've been a little tired, I guess. Just generally feeling run-down. And… sometimes my stomach cramps a lot. Like, really bad cramps. It feels… bloated too, a lot of the time. Oh! And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Jase. Tiredness, cramps, bloating, and unintentional weight loss… those are all things we want to investigate further. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Blood? No, not that I’ve seen. And no fever, nausea, or… throwing up. Just the diarrhea, the cramps, feeling tired, and the bloating. It's mostly just… really annoying, to be honest. It makes it hard to go anywhere. Especially with my husband’s work, we like to travel a bit, and it’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh, gosh. I’m not really sure. I haven’t really been to the doctor much. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, colds and things. And I think I had chickenpox. But nothing major. My mom… she had some problems with her stomach, I think. Something about not being able to eat certain foods. I don't know what it was, exactly. And I think… I think she said something about celiac disease? Is that what it’s called? I barely remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A history of stomach issues in your family is good to know. And just to clarify, have you ever been diagnosed with anything yourself?
PATIENT: No, never diagnosed with anything. Honestly, I just figured I was… delicate. My husband always says I'm a bit sensitive. He makes me tea when I'm feeling bad, and I usually get better. But it's been going on for so long now, that's why I finally decided to come in. I just thought it would go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase. No shame in that at all. It's good you came in now. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um, let me think… I take a multivitamin, sometimes. But not every day. And… I take something for my allergies, during the spring. That’s it, I think. Just a normal allergy pill. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, mostly. But I do love a good sweet treat, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin occasionally and allergy medication. And no known allergies other than seasonal ones?
PATIENT: Right, just seasonal allergies. Nothing food-related that I know of. Except… sometimes I get a little heartburn after spicy food, but I just take some antacids for that. It’s not a big deal. I don’t think that counts as an allergy, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn treated with antacids. Good to know. Now, just a couple more questions. Can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Um… well, I’m married, like I said. My husband, Omar, he works as an engineer. We don’t have any kids. We both grew up here, in the countryside. I work in sales, mostly over the phone. We don’t really drink or smoke. We like to travel when we can, and I enjoy gardening. Is that what you mean by social history?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Jase. That gives me a good picture. One last thing - how about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, family history… Well, my mom… she passed away a few years ago. I think she had some stomach issues, like I mentioned before. Something about not being able to eat certain foods. I don’t remember the exact name of it. My dad is still alive, he's healthy as far as I know, but he doesn't talk much about his health. And I have a brother, he lives in the city, he’s fine too, as far as I know. It’s not a very detailed family history, I’m afraid. My mom always kept things to herself.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase. That’s alright. We can work with that. It sounds like there may be some predisposition to digestive issues in your family. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I hope it won’t be too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, and then feel it gently. It might be a little uncomfortable if you’re tender, just let me know. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, I'm hearing some normal bowel sounds. There's some tenderness in your lower abdomen, especially on the left side. No masses that I can feel. Your abdomen is slightly distended. Do you often feel bloated?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. All the time, really. It feels… full and uncomfortable, even when I haven’t eaten much. Like I’m going to pop. My husband says I look pregnant sometimes, but I definitely am not! It's just… always bloated. It's one of the main reasons I came in, honestly. It's really uncomfortable, and it makes it hard to move around.
DOCTOR: Okay, that bloating is significant. Given your symptoms – the chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, fatigue, and some weight loss, along with the tenderness I felt during the exam, I'd like to order some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I want to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool culture to check for infections, and a celiac disease panel. We can also check for inflammatory markers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to find out what’s wrong, and hopefully get some relief. Celiac disease… that's what my mom had, right? Is that what you think it might be?
DOCTOR: It’s a possibility, Jase, given your family history and your symptoms, but we need to do the testing to confirm. It’s important to remember that these tests aren’t definitive, but they’ll give us a good starting point. I'm also going to order a test to rule out Giardia, a common intestinal parasite. It can cause similar symptoms. The lab will need a stool sample, which you can collect at home. They’ll give you instructions. And the blood tests can be done here at the clinic. It will take a few days to get the results back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. A stool sample… right. I can do that. And blood tests here… good. A few days… I can wait. What if it is celiac disease? What does that mean? Is it… serious? I don’t really know much about it.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Jase. If it is celiac disease, it means your immune system reacts to gluten – a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This reaction damages the small intestine, making it difficult to absorb nutrients. It is a serious condition, but it’s very manageable with a strict gluten-free diet. That means avoiding all foods containing wheat, barley, and rye. It requires some lifestyle changes, but many people with celiac disease live perfectly normal, healthy lives. We’d refer you to a dietitian to help you navigate that. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We need the test results first. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat normally, so the tests are accurate. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Gluten-free… that sounds… difficult. But if it helps, I’ll do it. My husband is a good cook, he can probably figure it out. I just want to feel better. Thank you for explaining everything. It makes me feel a little less worried. When should I come back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but it gets easier with time. And you’re right, a good cook makes all the difference! Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today, August 9th, to discuss the results. That should give the lab enough time to process everything. If you don’t hear from us before then, please call the clinic to reschedule. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything. Thank you so much for listening, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on. I’ll see you on August 9th. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’ll figure this out together. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes before your appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you on August 9th.
