DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Look, let’s not waste time. I’m 51, perfectly healthy, and I want to have a baby. I don’t want any… complications. I’ve heard things, you know? I want to do this right the first time, and frankly, I’d like it to happen quickly. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your desire for a straightforward and timely process. That's very reasonable. To assess the possibility of a healthy pregnancy, and to ensure we address any potential concerns proactively, I'd like to gather some more information. First, have you been trying to conceive for a while now, or are you just beginning to consider it?
PATIENT: Just beginning. I haven’t… actively tried yet. I wanted to see if it was even feasible before I started… well, you know. It seems silly to bother if it’s going to be a disaster, doesn’t it? And I read online... things aren’t as simple as they used to be.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be proactive and gather information beforehand. It’s very wise of you, and you’re correct; conceiving can be more complex than it once was. We want to ensure everything is optimal. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Really? I told you my age. I’m healthy. I work. I fix bicycles. What more do you need to know? I don't spend my time in doctors' offices. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I broke my arm once falling off a… never mind. Look, is there a test you can just do? To tell me if this is a bad idea?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. I assure you, I am not trying to be difficult. A comprehensive understanding of your health background, even if you feel perfectly healthy, is crucial for a safe and successful pregnancy. While a simple "yes" or "no" answer would be ideal, it's not always possible. However, we can certainly begin with some key questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I eat reasonably well, I get plenty of exercise—lifting heavy bicycle parts counts, surely—and I don’t smoke. Honestly, doctor, I’m probably healthier than half the women your age. I don’t need a list of ailments. Can we please just move on to the… the checking part? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your transparency, Ms. Shteynberg, and I certainly understand your desire to expedite the process. It's good to hear you maintain a healthy lifestyle. To proceed, let’s discuss your family medical history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps heart disease, cancer, or diabetes – in your parents, siblings, or grandparents?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father… well, he worked too hard. That’s all. He wasn’t a delicate flower. No cancers, no heart disease. Just… normal people who lived normal lives. Honestly, doctor, this feels like a complete waste of time. Can’t you just give me something to take? Or tell me if it's going to be impossible?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. I assure you, these questions are important for a thorough assessment. While it's good to hear of no major medical history in your family, even seemingly minor conditions can sometimes be relevant. To continue, have you ever had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Just the arm, when I was a child! I told you! Falling off a… Look, it was decades ago! Is this really important? I'm trying to have a baby, not recall my entire childhood medical history. I swear, I've never encountered such a tedious process. Just tell me if I can do this. Please. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, the childhood arm fracture is noted. You are right to point out we’ve established that. I apologize if my questions seem tedious, but they help to build a complete picture of your health. Now, let’s discuss your current medications and any allergies you may have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
