DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, truthfully. But I suppose that’s why one comes to the doctor, isn’t it? It's… a problem down there. With… a man. A gentleman caller, if you will. He’s… leaking. It’s most unpleasant. And frankly, a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, leaking. A discharge, really. It’s not… polite. And it’s not something one expects, is it? Especially not… at our age. He insists it doesn’t hurt him, but it's quite obvious, and I worry about… well, everything. It’s terribly unhygienic, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, Ms. Wartick, while I appreciate your… discretion, it's important we be precise. This “gentleman caller,” is he your husband?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Heavens, no. Not at all. Just a… companion. A friend. We’ve been… seeing each other. For a little while. It's really quite a delicate situation, you understand. And I don’t want to cause any… complications. Is that relevant, Doctor? I mean, does it matter who he is? It’s the… the problem itself that’s concerning.
DOCTOR: It matters, Ms. Wartick, because sexually transmitted infections are a distinct possibility. And, frankly, I need to assess the risk factors properly. Is this a recent development, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I hadn’t… I hadn’t thought of that. Goodness. No, it’s… fairly recent. Perhaps a week? A little over. He hasn’t mentioned anything, of course. Men! They never do. But I suppose… one can’t be too careful. It’s just… awfully awkward to even think about, let alone discuss. Is it… common?
DOCTOR: Common, Ms. Wartick, depends on one’s… lifestyle. Given the recent onset and your description, it could be a number of things. We’ll need to rule out the more serious possibilities first. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Well, he hasn’t complained of any pain, as I said. And I certainly haven’t. He seems perfectly healthy otherwise, really. A bit… flushed, perhaps, sometimes. But he enjoys a good glass of wine. Oh! Now that you mention it, he did scratch a bit… down there… yesterday. But he said it was just his trousers being a bit rough. Do you think that matters? It all feels rather… messy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The scratching could be indicative of irritation, but it’s hardly definitive. To get a clearer picture, Ms. Wartick, I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. This will involve an examination of the affected area. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Me? Well, I… I hadn’t anticipated… I assumed you’d… examine him. Is it absolutely necessary? It all feels terribly… intrusive. And I’m not entirely sure he’d approve. Surely you can ask him questions? Give him some… medication? This is all rather undignified, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I am assessing your health and potential exposure. I need to rule out any possible infection in you that might be causing your concern. I can’t examine someone without their consent. And frankly, given the circumstances, it's highly advisable to have a complete picture. I understand your discomfort, but this is standard procedure. If you refuse the exam, I can offer a referral to a urologist for your companion, but I cannot adequately address your concerns without assessing you.
PATIENT: Well! I never! It seems I’m being held responsible for another man’s… hygiene. It’s utterly preposterous. Very well. If it must be done. But I expect the utmost discretion, Doctor. And I shall require a very thorough explanation of everything you do. And I mean everything. It’s terribly embarrassing, you understand. And I do have a luncheon appointment afterwards. So if we could be quick…
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. Discretion is assured. I will explain each step as we proceed. If you experience any discomfort during the exam, please let me know immediately. If you’ll please disrobe from the waist down, we can begin. I'll need to perform a visual inspection and may need to collect a sample for testing.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Very well. But do hurry, Doctor. And try not to… stare. It's rather alarming, you know. And I do hope my luncheon companion won't notice I'm a little… flushed when I return. This is most undignified. Truly. .
