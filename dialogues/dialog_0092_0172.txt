DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Really, must we go through all of this? I just moved here, you see. Some…social worker insisted I come for a visit. New area, new rules, I suppose. It's all rather tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Engelhaupt. It is often standard procedure to establish care with a new move, even if you’re feeling perfectly well. It’s a good way to ensure continuity of care and get acquainted. But of course, we can certainly tailor the visit to your needs. To begin, even though you may be feeling well, are there any specific health concerns that prompted the social worker to suggest this visit, or anything at all that’s been bothering you recently?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Well, the traffic is dreadful, if you must know. Honestly, the way people drive these days… But I doubt that's what you’re after. No, nothing specifically bothering me. I've lived a long life, Doctor. I've had my share of…things. My husband keeps telling me I worry too much, though. He's always been the practical one. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Engelhaupt. And I certainly don’t want to take up too much of your time, especially with a luncheon planned. We can keep this concise. Perhaps we could start with a brief overview of your general health history?
PATIENT: History? Goodness. Where does one begin with a history? It's been… decades. I suppose I've always been rather…sturdy. Never much for complaining. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I expect. Measles, mumps... things of that nature. Nothing serious. And I've always been careful about my diet. My mother instilled that in me. Is that sufficient? Really, I haven't the faintest recollection of specific dates or… details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. A general overview is a good start. It sounds as though you had a relatively healthy childhood. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations as an adult?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations… hmm. Let me see. Oh, yes, I had my gallbladder removed. Years ago. A dreadful experience, I assure you. And… and I broke my wrist once, falling on the ice. A silly thing, really. Trying to be helpful. And… I suppose there were the usual bouts of the flu. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on these things. Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. It's good to have a picture of what's happened in the past, even if it was unpleasant. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and broken wrist is helpful. Do you recall approximately when you had those surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates. You want dates? Honestly, Doctor. That's… asking a lot. The gallbladder… must have been… the 1980s, perhaps? Or maybe the early 90s? It was before the children were grown, certainly. And the wrist… Oh, dear. That was… later. When my hair started to turn gray, I believe. Does it really matter? It was all so long ago. I simply can't recall specifics. I have a very busy mind, you see. Luncheon preparations, social engagements… these things take precedence.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Engelhaupt. Approximate dates are perfectly fine. It’s simply helpful to have a general timeline. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Well, the doctor prescribed something for my arthritis, years ago. But I stopped taking it. It didn't agree with me. And I take a multivitamin, of course. Everyone should take a multivitamin. And… oh! Sometimes I take something for my indigestion. But not regularly. It depends on what I've eaten, you see. Is that all? Really, I'm quite a healthy person. I don't believe in burdening myself with unnecessary pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a multivitamin and something for indigestion as needed, and you previously used medication for arthritis but discontinued it. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I’ve always been quite… robust, you see. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but nothing severe. A little itchiness, that’s all. My husband is the one with all the allergies. Pollen, dust mites, cats… the list goes on! Honestly, it’s quite exhausting. But I am perfectly fine. No, no allergies to speak of. Can we be done now? I truly must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. It sounds as though you've been quite healthy overall, with a slight sensitivity to shellfish. To complete the visit, I would like to do a brief physical examination, just to get a baseline. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Oh, dear. Really, Doctor. Must you? I haven't had one of those in… decades. I feel perfectly fine, you know. I assure you. But… I suppose if you insist. It will have to be quick, though. I have a luncheon! And I do dislike being prodded and poked. Is there a comfortable chair? And please, be gentle. I’m not as young as I used to be. Honestly, this is all rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. I completely understand. We will keep it as brief and gentle as possible. Please, have a seat in that chair. It reclines for your comfort. First, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take your blood pressure and check your pulse. Would that be alright?
