DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been hangin’ on for a while now. Real dry, it is. Doesn’t bring nothin’ up, you know? Just… scratchy. Feels like somethin’ stuck in my throat sometimes. I… I can’t rightly say when it started, exactly. Seems like a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. A dry cough… for “a long time.” And it doesn’t produce any sputum?
PATIENT: Sputum? Oh… no, no. Not really. Like I said, just dry. Sometimes, especially when I lie down… it feels… tickly. Makes me cough more. Used to be worse at night. I… my wife, she always used to make me some tea. But… well.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything – any changes in your environment, recent illnesses, anything like that – coincided with the start of this cough, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. That’s a tough one. I’ve mostly stayed home these last few years. Not much goin’ out. I used to… I used to work on cars, a long time back. But the shop… it closed. Dust, maybe? There was a lot of dust in the shop. But that was… a long time ago, like I said. I don’t know if that’s it. It feels… different now. Not like the dust cough.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a past history of dust exposure with automotive work… and this cough feels distinct from that. Any fever, chills, or night sweats associated with it?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I’ve noticed. I don’t really take my temperature. Night sweats… sometimes I get warm when I sleep, but I always just figured that was… old age, you know? It’s been hot lately, too. Hard to tell what’s normal and what ain’t. My wife, she always said I ran warm.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… sometimes. When I walk up the stairs, I get a little winded. But I’m… well, I’m ninety years old, Doctor. I get winded easy! Chest pain… no, not really. Just… a little ache sometimes, in my chest. But I think that’s just my old bones. It ain’t sharp, or anything. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Let's have a listen to your lungs. Deep breaths in and out, please. Hmm. There's some mild wheezing, but it’s not particularly pronounced. Your respiratory rate is… a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Do you have any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Asthma… no, not that I remember. COPD… what’s that? My wife… she was the one who knew about those things. She always took me to the doctor. I… I just did the work, you know? She handled the health stuff. I feel… kinda lost without her, if you wanna know the truth.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll proceed as if it’s a new onset issue. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… now that you mention it… yeah, a little. Sometimes. Not bad, though. Just… kinda puffy at the end of the day. I figured it was just from sittin’ too long. Old age again, probably. I try to put my feet up, but… sometimes I forget.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and some basic bloodwork. The X-ray will help us rule out any underlying lung issues, and the bloodwork will give us a better understanding of your overall health. It's standard procedure. We’ll need to get those ordered and then schedule you for imaging. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, if we needed a CT scan later on?
PATIENT: CT scan? Contrast dye? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. I… I don’t think so. I haven’t had any scans or anything like that before. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… my wife always knew about those things. Maybe I should have written those things down. It’s just… so much to remember these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. No known allergies, then. We’ll start with the X-ray. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have a nurse draw the bloodwork before you go. We’ll review the results when they come back and discuss next steps. Do you have any difficulty with transportation to the lab?
PATIENT: Transportation… hmm. My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, she’s real nice. She usually takes me to the grocery store. Maybe she could take me to the lab, too. I haven't asked yet, but... I'm sure she wouldn't mind. She's a good woman. I'd have to ask her about the time, though. I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: Okay. Then we’ll get the nurse to draw your blood. Please try to drink some water beforehand to make it easier. I’ll have them call you when your results are back, which should be within a few days. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – particularly any new chest pain or difficulty breathing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. Just… a lot to take in. I’ll ask Mrs. Henderson about the lab. And I'll try to drink more water. Thank you. I… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Pavlovic.
