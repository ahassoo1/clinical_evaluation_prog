DOCTOR: Hi Brad, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, I guess. Look, it’s…well, it's pretty gross, honestly. I’ve been, uh…throwing up blood. Not a ton, but enough to worry a fella. It started a couple days ago, and it ain’t stoppin’. It’s…disgusting, really. I haven’t been feelin’ great either, just kinda weak and tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. That does sound concerning, and you're right to get it checked out. Vomiting blood is definitely something we need to take seriously. When you say a couple of days ago, can you recall anything specific that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Triggered it? What kinda question is that? Like somethin’ happened? No. Not really. I just…woke up feelin’ a bit off, and then, well, there it was. I ain’t been eatin’ nothin’ weird, and I haven’t hurt myself or nothin’. It just…started. Honestly, I've been stressin' a bit lately, but that’s just life, ya know? My wife…passed last year. Still gets to me, if you gotta know.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Brad. That's a huge loss, and stress certainly can manifest in physical ways. So, to clarify, it started spontaneously, without any obvious cause like a change in diet or injury?
PATIENT: Yeah, spontaneously. That’s the word. Just…happened. Look, I ain't a doctor, alright? I just know somethin’ ain’t right. And it ain’t like I’m makin’ this up. It’s…dark, ya know? Not a little bit, either. Enough to make a grown man queasy. And it’s…bright red. Is that…bad? Should it be bright red?
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood is…something we need to investigate. It usually suggests bleeding closer to the esophagus or stomach. And you said it's been happening for a couple of days?
PATIENT: Two days. Maybe three. I lose track, honestly. Everything kinda blurs together these days. It’s not constant, see? It comes and goes. Yesterday, it was…worse. Threw up a couple times, both times with…you know. Today, just once, so far. But I ain’t feelin’ any better, just weaker. And kinda…dizzy.
DOCTOR: Dizziness is concerning, Brad. Okay, let's run through a few other things. Have you noticed any dark, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Tarry…what now? Look, I ain’t spendin’ a lotta time lookin’ at what comes out the other end, alright? If it’s solid, I’m good. I ain’t been checkin’ the color of my…business. You expectin’ me to analyze everything that goes through me now? It's just…normal, I guess. Darkish brown, usually. I eat plenty of fiber, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, darkish brown is good to know. No change there. Let’s try this a different way. Have you felt any pain in your abdomen, or any bloating?
PATIENT: Pain…well, kinda. Not sharp, nothin’ like a broken bone or somethin’. More like…a dull ache. Sorta in the middle, higher up. And yeah, I’ve been a bit bloated, actually. Like I ate too much, but I haven’t. Just…uncomfortable. It comes and goes too, like everything else. It's probably nothin', honestly. Old age, maybe? I’m not exactly a spring chicken anymore, ya know.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache and bloating... that's helpful. Brad, I need to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…hmm. Not really. I mean, I’ve had the usual colds and flus, nothing major. Back problems, a bit, from liftin’ heavy stuff at work. But nothin’ a little ibuprofen couldn’t fix. Never been to the hospital for anything serious, if that's what you're askin'. And I ain't on any medications. Just…toughin’ it out, ya know? That's how we do things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major medical history or medications. Have you ever had any surgeries, Brad?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Nope. Never needed 'em. Always been pretty lucky, actually. Avoided all that. No cuts, no stitches, nothin'. Except maybe when I was a kid, fell outta a tree, but that was nothin’ serious. Just a scrape, my mom patched me up. This is gettin’ ridiculous, ya know? You’re askin’ me about my childhood now? I’m bleedin’ internally, and you wanna know about tree scrapes?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Brad, and I apologize if it feels like I’m asking irrelevant questions. It's just important to get a complete picture. Okay, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I eat everything. Spicy food, shellfish, peanuts…never had a problem. Used to be able to eat a whole habanero pepper, no sweat. I'm pretty robust, see? Never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to worry about me eatin' too much, but I always bounced back. This ain’t an allergy, I’m tellin’ ya. This is somethin’ different.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, a bit of a sensitive question, but it's important: do you drink alcohol, or do you use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Look, I used to enjoy a beer now and then, especially with dinner. But nothin’ crazy. Just a couple, maybe three, on a weekend. And I smoked for a while, when I was younger. Maybe a pack a day, back in my twenties. But I quit, oh, twenty years ago. Haven't touched one since. Used to get on my wife's nerves, but I stopped for her.
DOCTOR: Okay, former smoker, occasional alcohol use. And you mentioned your wife… how was her health?
PATIENT: She… she was good. Real good. Always took care of herself. Ate healthy, exercised, always went to the doctor. Never smoked, never drank much. Strong woman. She… she had cancer, though. Lung cancer. That's… that's why she… passed. It was quick. Too quick. She fought hard, but… it just took her.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear that, Brad. That must have been incredibly difficult. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness when you stand up?
PATIENT: Yeah, I did mention the dizziness. It's not constant, but it comes and goes. And no, no chest pain. Not yet. But yeah, standin' up sometimes makes it worse. Like the room’s spinnin’ for a second. It ain't terrible, but it's there. It makes me nervous, ya know? I don't wanna fall and break somethin'. Especially not on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness with standing. Brad, I think it's important to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I ain't got all day. But I'm tellin' ya, I'm probably just stressed. Worryin’ about bills, the house…everything. This is probably just somethin' old folks get. But go ahead, do your thing. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Brad. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds a little fast, Brad, but otherwise regular. Lungs are clear, but I’m detecting a slight weakness in your overall breathing pattern. Okay, your abdomen is tender in the upper middle section, as you described, and slightly distended. No masses that I can feel at this time. Your reflexes are normal, and your pulses are slightly weak but present. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Okay, Brad. Based on this brief exam, your vital signs are somewhat concerning, and there are enough red flags here that I think we need to do some further testing.
PATIENT: Testing? What kinda testing? Look, I ain't got insurance, remember? I can't afford a bunch of fancy tests. I just need somethin’ to settle my stomach, maybe some pills or somethin’. I can’t be runnin’ around spendin’ money I don’t have. What are you thinkin' exactly? You gonna take blood? Stick me with needles? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Brad, and I’ll do everything I can to keep it as affordable as possible. We absolutely need to figure out what's causing this bleeding. I'm thinking we need to start with a complete blood count to see if you’re anemic, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. We'll also need to check your blood clotting factors. Yes, that does involve a blood draw. And to be thorough, considering the vomiting blood, I’d like to order an endoscopy, where we use a small camera to look inside your esophagus and stomach to find the source of the bleeding. That's the most important test, but also the most expensive. I understand your hesitation about the costs, and we can discuss alternatives, but I'm genuinely concerned about the possibility of a serious underlying issue. We need to rule out things like ulcers, gastritis, or even more serious conditions. I can also provide you with resources to explore financial assistance options for medical care. Would you be open to discussing that?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… Look, I'm a proud man. I don't like askin' for handouts. My wife… she always said I was too stubborn for my own good. But… I guess I don't have much of a choice, do I? If it's serious, I need to know. Endoscopy... that sounds awful. Stickin' a camera down my throat? What if somethin' goes wrong? I don't trust hospitals. My wife… she had a bad experience. Fine. Do the blood work. But I'm not makin' any promises about the endoscopy until I know how much it's gonna cost. And if I gotta go to the hospital, I want someone to explain everything to me first. Everythin'. No fancy medical jargon. Just plain English. And I want a second opinion, if possible. Before you stick anythin’ down my throat.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Brad. I completely understand your concerns, and I’m happy to work with you. We will absolutely get you a detailed breakdown of the endoscopy costs before you make any decisions. And you are absolutely entitled to a second opinion – I encourage it. I’ll provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist specializing in endoscopy, and we can schedule a consultation for you to discuss it further. Regarding the blood work, I’ll order it immediately, and we should have the results back within 24-48 hours. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as we receive them to discuss the findings and next steps. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor to help reduce the acid in your stomach and hopefully minimize any further bleeding. It’s a relatively mild medication, and it can provide some temporary relief. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Proton pump… what now? Look, I ain't a pharmacist, alright? Just tell me what it does. And are there any side effects? I don't need somethin' that's gonna make me feel worse. And… what if it is serious? What kinda things are we talkin' about here? Ulcers… is that life-threatenin'? I don't wanna die, Doc. My wife… I barely got over losin' her. I can't… I just can't.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, take a deep breath. The proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, helps reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. Think of it like calming down the irritation in your stomach. It can help with the nausea and hopefully slow down the bleeding. Common side effects are usually mild – maybe some diarrhea or a headache, but nothing serious. As for what we’re looking at… ulcers can be serious, yes. If left untreated, they can cause bleeding, which we’re already seeing, and in rare cases, they can lead to a perforation, meaning a hole in the stomach lining. That is life-threatening, but it’s not common. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, and we'll address it accordingly. Other possibilities could include gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining – or less commonly, something more serious like esophageal varices – enlarged veins in your esophagus. That’s why the endoscopy is so important – it allows us to see exactly what’s going on and make an accurate diagnosis. I understand your anxiety, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. We'll take things one step at a time. First, let's get those blood tests done, and then we'll discuss the endoscopy options and financial assistance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yeah. That’s… that’s better. Just… don't scare me, alright? I’ve had enough scares lately. Okay. Blood tests. Fine. Where do I go? And how long will it take? I got things to do, ya know? I can’t be spendin’ all day in a lab. And… is there anythin’ I should do before I go? Fastin’ or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Of course, Brad. No scaring, I promise. We'll keep everything straightforward. The lab is just across the street, at the medical building. You’ll need to go to the reception desk and tell them Dr. Polczynski ordered blood work for you. They’ll take care of the rest. It shouldn't take more than an hour, including the wait time. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. It’s important for the accuracy of the results. You can drink water, but that’s it. It’s best to schedule the appointment for first thing in the morning, if possible. Do you have any questions about the fasting requirements?
PATIENT: Eight hours… alright. That's… doable. I guess I can skip breakfast. And lunch. And… probably dinner tonight, just to be safe. Okay. No food. Just water. Got it. And you said somethin’ about a gastroenterologist? What’s that? Is that like… a stomach doctor? I never even heard of that before. And… will they want more tests? I’m already dreadin’ this.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Brad. A gastroenterologist is a specialist who focuses on the digestive system – basically, a stomach doctor. They’re the experts in diagnosing and treating conditions like ulcers, gastritis, and other problems with your esophagus, stomach, and intestines. Yes, they’ll likely want to do some more tests, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. The endoscopy is the most important test right now, to get a clear view of what’s going on. They may also want to do a biopsy – taking a small sample of tissue – to check for any abnormalities. I understand it's a lot, and it's probably scary, but we're going to take things slowly and methodically. The goal is to figure out what's causing the bleeding and get you the treatment you need to feel better. Do you want me to write down the name of a good gastroenterologist for you, and their contact information?
PATIENT: Yeah. Write it down. And… write down what a biopsy is too. Just… in plain English. No medical terms. I hate all this fancy speak. I just want to understand what’s goin’ on, ya know? Look, I appreciate you explainin’ things. You’re… better than most doctors I’ve met. Less rushin’ around, more talkin’. It makes a difference. But… if it’s bad, tell me straight. Don’t sugarcoat it. I can handle it. I just… need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I’m glad I can help. That’s the least I can do. Here you go. “Biopsy: Taking a very small sample of tissue from your stomach or esophagus during the endoscopy. It's used to look for any signs of inflammation, infection, or abnormalities. It doesn’t usually cause any pain, and it helps the doctor make an accurate diagnosis.” And you have my word, Brad, I will always be honest with you. I won’t sugarcoat anything. If the news is bad, I will tell you straight, and we will discuss your options together. I believe in shared decision-making, and I want you to feel empowered and informed every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. For now. Just… gotta remember no food. And the gastroenterologist's name. And what a biopsy is. Look, thanks, Doc. Really. I appreciate you takin' the time. And… I’ll try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, though. I guess I'll go home and try to get some rest. And skip dinner. Ugh.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. You take care of yourself, and try to relax as much as possible. Remember, I'm here if you need anything. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, don't stress too much about skipping dinner. Your health is the most important thing right now. Get some rest, and I'll see you soon.
