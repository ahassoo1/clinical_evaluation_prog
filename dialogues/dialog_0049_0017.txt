DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well... it's about this... team. A baseball team. I need... a check-up. For the tryout. It’s very important, you see. I haven’t... done this in a while. A long while.
DOCTOR: A tryout, you say. For a baseball team. Right. And you haven't participated in athletic activities for some time?
PATIENT: That is... correct. Not recently, no. A long time. Back when... well, it doesn't matter now. Things were different then. I used to be… quite good. But now... I just need to make sure I'm... allowed to try. The paperwork said something about a doctor needing to say I'm okay. That’s you, I guess. Is that right? You saying I'm okay?
DOCTOR: The paperwork requires a medical evaluation to assess your current health status and determine if you’re fit to participate in strenuous activity. It doesn't simply involve me saying "you're okay." We need to gather some information first. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions—heart problems, diabetes, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: Conditions? Hmm... That's a... a good question. I had... something once. Years ago. My back… it bothered me. A lot. But it went away. Or maybe it didn't. I don't really remember the name of it. It just... hurt. And then it stopped. I think. Maybe it flares up sometimes. I take… something for it when it does. A little pill. But honestly, Doctor, I don't keep track of these things. My ex-wife... she used to handle all of that.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries... let me think. Oh! Yes. My knee. A long time ago. I was... younger. Playing ball, you see. It… popped. It needed fixing. But it was a long time ago. It feels fine now. Mostly. It gets… stiff sometimes. But that’s just… old age, I suppose. Doctor, are you writing all this down? It feels like a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bartok, I am documenting everything. It’s important for a complete medical picture. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. She wasn’t very healthy, to be honest. Spent a lot of time… resting. And my father… he smoked a lot. Terrible habit. I think that caused… something. But details… they're a little hazy. It was a long time ago, and we weren't very close. I mostly just remember a lot of coughing. And… well, they're both gone now. Is that helpful? I don’t know what you want me to say.
DOCTOR: It’s… helpful, to a degree. Alright. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Doctor, I am a respectable man! No, absolutely not. I used to… enjoy a beer now and then. After a game. But not anymore. Not for… years. And smoking? Never touched the stuff. My father… he was enough of a smoker for all of us. No, Doctor. I live a… quiet life. Mostly. A lot of resting. Like my mother. Though I'm hoping this baseball thing will change that. A little, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. That little pill, for my back. When it hurts. I think it's… white. Small. I get it… from the pharmacy. Sometimes. And… maybe some vitamins. My neighbor gave me some. They're… colorful. I think they’re for… energy? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to these things. I just take what people give me. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. My ex-wife... she handled all of this. Is it important what kind they are? Because I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Bartok. Knowing what you’re taking—even vitamins—can affect your health and potential risks. Do you have the bottles with you, or can you recall the names of the medication and vitamins?
PATIENT: Bottles? No. I… never bring those with me. I don’t even know where they are. And names? No. I’m sorry, Doctor. I told you, I don't keep track of these things. It's… just how I am. A little forgetful, you see. My neighbor… she’s the one who gave me the vitamins. Maybe you could ask her? She lives down the street. Number 12. Mrs. Rodriguez. She’s very good with… health things. Honestly, I just want to know if I can play baseball. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let's move on to a physical exam, then. Perhaps that will give us a better understanding of your current condition. I’ll need to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and assess your range of motion. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please. My back… it's a little sensitive sometimes. And I haven’t had anyone poke and prod at me in… a long time. But yes. Do what you need to do. I'm ready. I think. As ready as I'll be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are… somewhat regular, but a bit muffled. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but breath sounds are diminished at the bases. Blood pressure is 140/90… a little elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but slightly obese. Now, let’s check your range of motion… Can you raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Ouch. That’s… a little difficult, Doctor. My shoulders… they’re a bit stiff. Like everything else. Not as easy as it used to be, you see. I used to be very flexible. Very athletic. But… age happens, I suppose. Is that bad? It feels… tight. And it doesn’t go very high. Like I'm… rusty. Very rusty. Maybe I need some oil.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion in both shoulders, with discomfort. Now, let's check your back. There’s tenderness along the lumbar spine, with some muscle guarding. And your reflexes are… somewhat diminished in the lower extremities. It appears you have some reduced sensation in your feet as well. Do you feel this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… faint, Doctor. Very faint. Like… a tingling. Not a strong sensation, you see? It's… difficult to explain. Like wearing socks that are a little too tight. Or maybe… not feeling anything at all? It’s hard to tell. My feet… they don’t feel the same as they used to. Like they’re… numb. Sometimes. Especially in the cold. Do you feel that? I’m trying to wiggle them. Are they moving?
DOCTOR: Reduced sensation in both feet, with diminished reflexes. There is some slight edema in the ankles. Mr. Bartok, based on this preliminary examination, you have some concerning findings. Your elevated blood pressure, limited range of motion, back tenderness, reduced sensation in your feet, and diminished reflexes are all red flags. I strongly advise against participating in any strenuous activity, including a baseball tryout, until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on. I recommend a full work-up, including blood tests, an EKG, and possibly an MRI of your spine. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before you put any stress on your body.
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? Doctor… that sounds… serious. And expensive. I… I don’t know if I can afford all of that. And I really want to play baseball. It’s been a long time… a dream, you see. Are you saying I absolutely cannot try out? Not even a little bit? Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe just… take some vitamins? Or stretch more? I don’t want to be a burden. I just want to know if I can play.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your disappointment, and I appreciate your concerns about the cost and burden. However, ignoring these findings could have serious consequences for your health. Simply taking vitamins or stretching won't address the underlying issues. We need to determine the cause of your symptoms—whether it’s a circulatory problem, nerve damage, or something else entirely—before we can make any informed decisions. I will write you a referral to a cardiologist and a neurologist. They can perform the necessary tests and provide you with a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Medicare should cover a significant portion of the costs, but we will need to verify your coverage and discuss any potential out-of-pocket expenses with the billing department. In the meantime, I strongly advise against any strenuous activity. Perhaps light walking would be permissible, but please consult with the cardiologist before starting any exercise program. Here are the referrals. Please schedule appointments with these specialists as soon as possible. We need to prioritize your health, Mr. Bartok. It’s not worth risking serious injury or complications just to play baseball. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cardiologist… neurologist… It sounds… complicated, Doctor. And expensive. Medicare… yes, I have Medicare. But… it's always a hassle. Forms, approvals… I just want to play baseball. It's all I've been thinking about. Are you sure there's no other way? Just… a quick check? Maybe a different doctor? I don't want to go through all of this… unless I absolutely have to. I just... I just want to know if I can play baseball. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration and your desire to play. But I am ethically obligated to prioritize your well-being. A "quick check" won't be sufficient. We need a comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Ignoring these findings could lead to serious consequences – heart attack, stroke, nerve damage. I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for strenuous activity without a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. That would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I will have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results of your tests and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, please refrain from any strenuous activity. And Mr. Bartok, please understand that sometimes, the best thing we can do for our health is to listen to our bodies and prioritize our well-being. .
