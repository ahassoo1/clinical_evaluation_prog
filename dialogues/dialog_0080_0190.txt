DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Rosanova. It’s difficult to explain, precisely. I’ve been… unsteady, I suppose. A bit off balance. It's been happening for a little while now, and it’s… concerning. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so pinpointing when it started is difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, “unsteady” and “off balance” – that's a good starting point. And don't worry about the memory piece, it's common! We'll figure it out together. When you say "a little while now," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: A rough estimate… hmm. Perhaps… three or four months? It feels like around then. It started gradually, I think. Not suddenly, thankfully. Just… noticing I stumble a little more often, or feel a bit wobbly when I stand for too long. I work… well, I did work on a rig, so perhaps it was just that at first. But it hasn't gone away, even when I'm not working.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, gradual onset, and it persists even when you’re not at work. That’s helpful. You mentioned working on a rig – what kind of work did you do there, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: I was a Rotary Drill Operator. It involved… a lot of physical activity, obviously. Standing, moving around, controlling the drill. It was demanding work. My husband… he worked alongside me, for many years. But that's… neither here nor there, I suppose. It's been some time now. I believe it involved a good deal of balance, though. And… coordination.
DOCTOR: Okay, Rotary Drill Operator, a lot of physical activity, balance, and coordination. That gives me a better picture. And thank you for sharing that with me, it is relevant. Now, let's talk about the unsteadiness itself. Can you describe how you feel unsteady?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a dizzying feeling, precisely. Not like the room is spinning. It’s more… a lack of solidness, perhaps? Like my feet aren’t quite under me. Sometimes I feel like I’m going to drift to one side, or stumble forward. It’s… unsettling. And sometimes it feels like my vision… wavers, just a little. Not blurred, but… like it’s not perfectly still. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. "Lack of solidness" and vision wavering – those are very helpful descriptions. It sounds like it’s not a classic spinning dizziness. Have you noticed if anything specific makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… standing for long periods, definitely. And… quick movements. Like if I turn my head too quickly, or reach for something high up. I’ve also noticed it’s worse when I’m tired. It’s… difficult to explain, but the feeling is more pronounced when I haven’t had enough rest. I don't recall if anything makes it better, though. Just… avoiding those things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse with prolonged standing, quick movements, and fatigue. Avoiding those things helps, which is good to know. Now, I'm going to ask some general questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you had any headaches recently?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. I mean, I get the occasional tension headache, like anyone else, but nothing… significant. Nothing different than usual. They're infrequent, and mild. I wouldn’t say they're related to this unsteadiness, though. No, not at all. They come and go, and are usually relieved with a little rest or some water.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your hearing?
PATIENT: My hearing… I believe it's alright. I haven’t noticed any changes, truthfully. Working on the rig was… loud, of course. Very loud. But I always wore ear protection. I did have some ringing in my ears occasionally after a particularly noisy shift, but that usually subsided quickly. I haven’t experienced any persistent ringing, or difficulty hearing, as of late.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes to your hearing. Let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… not exactly. I mean, I feel tired, generally. But I wouldn’t describe it as weakness. My arms and legs feel… heavy sometimes, particularly after a long day. But I can still perform my usual activities. Lifting things, walking, standing… I haven't had any difficulty with those. It’s hard to explain the difference, perhaps. Just… fatigue, I think. Not weakness.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, not weakness. Let’s move on to past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. My memory, as I mentioned, isn’t the best. I had… a bout of pneumonia, some years ago. But that was treated, and resolved. And… the usual things, I suppose. Childhood illnesses. Nothing significant, or ongoing. I do take medication for my blood pressure, though. A small dose, prescribed by my previous doctor. But other than that… I don’t recall any major medical conditions.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past, blood pressure medication. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I wish I did. I’ve been taking it for a while now, and I’ve always just renewed the prescription. I don't recall the name, unfortunately. I can… bring a list of my medications with me next time, if that would be helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be very helpful, thank you. Okay, any past surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just… a few minor injuries here and there, working on the rig. But nothing requiring a hospital visit or surgery. Scrapes, bruises… the usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family… we weren’t very good at keeping records. My parents… they are both gone now. And I don't recall any… specific illnesses that ran in the family. My mother had… arthritis, I believe, in her later years. And my father… he had some heart trouble, towards the end. But nothing… dramatic, or passed down genetically, as far as I know. I don’t believe there was any history of neurological issues, or balance problems, in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. Moderation is key, I always say.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing all of that with me, Lilyanna. That gives me a very good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your balance, coordination, reflexes, and blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, as much as you do. I apologize for my… vagueness, at times.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Lilyanna. It's perfectly understandable. Okay, your ears look clear. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90, but that’s not terribly concerning given you mentioned taking medication for it, and it could be a bit high due to being in a clinical setting. Pulse is 72 and regular. Okay, walking seems steady, but I’m going to have you do a few more tests to check your balance. Now, can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly. There… I can feel myself wavering a bit, Doctor. Is that what you expected?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a bit of swaying, which is what I suspected. Now, I’m going to ask you to walk in a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Heel-to-toe… yes. Oh… that’s… not as easy as it looks, Doctor. I’m… a bit wobbly, I’m afraid. Is that what you expected?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that. And thank you for letting me know. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap a small hammer on your knees and ankles. This won’t hurt, but please let me know if you feel any pain. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Your neck feels clear. Alright, Lilyanna. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some form of balance disturbance. Given your history and the symptoms, there could be several possibilities, ranging from medication side effects, to a mild inner ear issue, or even something neurological. It’s too early to say definitively. However, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. I want to understand what’s happening, and if tests can help determine that, then please, proceed. I’m… eager to get to the bottom of this. What kind of tests are you thinking of, Doctor? And… will they be painful?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I was thinking of a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I also want to check your vitamin D levels, as deficiencies can sometimes cause balance problems. The blood work is just a simple prick of a finger or arm, so it shouldn't be too painful. The MRI is a bit more involved – you’ll lie in a scanner for about 30-40 minutes, and it can be a little loud, but it’s completely painless. You'll need to remove any metal jewelry before the scan, though. Do those tests sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… a bit daunting, truthfully. But if it’s necessary to understand what’s going on, then yes, I’m willing. Loud, you say? I suppose I can manage that. And the blood work sounds… straightforward enough. Yes, Doctor. Please proceed with all the tests. I’d like to know what’s causing this, as quickly as possible. And… will I need a referral for the MRI?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need a referral for the MRI. I’ll go ahead and write that now, and also send the orders for the blood work to the lab. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be able to take the samples whenever you’re ready. Here you go. This is your referral for the MRI, and these are the orders for the blood work. The MRI center will call you to schedule an appointment. They're located at [MRI Center Address]. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a medication to help manage your blood pressure. It's a different medication than you are currently taking, and hopefully will have fewer side effects. It’s important to take it as directed, and let me know if you experience any adverse reactions. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: [MRI Center Address]… Thank you. And a different blood pressure medication… that sounds… prudent. I suppose any changes are worth exploring, at this point. Yes, I do have a question. If it is something neurological, as you mentioned… what would that mean, precisely? And… how serious could that be?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Lilyanna. If it is something neurological, it could range from something relatively benign, like a mild inner ear problem affecting your balance, to something more serious, like a small stroke or a lesion on the brain. However, it’s important to remember that we haven’t confirmed anything yet, and most neurological causes of balance problems are treatable. The MRI will give us a much clearer picture, and allow us to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. I understand that this is unsettling, but try not to worry too much until we have the results. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have a diagnosis. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as weakness, numbness, vision changes, or severe headaches – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Weakness, numbness, vision changes… I’ll remember that. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at this moment, Doctor. I suppose I’ll… wait for the results of the tests, and hope for the best. Thank you for your time, and your thoroughness. I appreciate your honesty, and your compassion. I’ll… schedule the MRI as soon as possible. I believe that’s all. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. And you're doing the right thing by getting this checked out. Remember, we'll figure this out together. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI appointment. My staff are excellent and can always help. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again once we have the results. Please, schedule the MRI as soon as you can.
