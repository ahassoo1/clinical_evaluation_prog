DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Uh, well, I’m trying out for a team. A sports team. Need a check-up to make sure I'm good to go, you know? I don’t want to fall apart during practice.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. That’s perfectly sensible. A pre-participation physical is a good idea. Just to get a good overview, can you tell me what sport you’re trying out for, and how strenuous the training is likely to be?
PATIENT: Mongolian wrestling. It's… pretty tough. Lots of grappling, throwing, and well, just… strength and endurance. It's not like running a marathon, but it’s a constant push and pull, you get what I mean? It's full contact, too. I've been doing it a long time, but… better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, better safe than sorry. Mongolian wrestling sounds… intense. Okay, so full-contact grappling and throwing – that gives me a good starting point. Have you had any injuries related to wrestling in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A few sprained ankles over the years, nothing serious. Once twisted a knee pretty bad, but I rehabbed it. And… oh, a couple of shoulder aches, but those usually work themselves out. Nothing that’s kept me off the mat for long, anyway. It's a rough sport, you know? Little bumps and bruises are just part of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, sprained ankles, a past knee injury that was rehabbed, and occasional shoulder aches. And those shoulder aches are… current, or more historical?
PATIENT: More historical, I guess. They flare up now and then if I really overdo it, but usually just a bit of soreness. Nothing I haven’t been able to push through. It’s been a while since they really bothered me. I’m not a delicate flower, Doctor. Just want to make sure everything's still working okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any other significant medical issues in the past – anything that’s required hospitalization or ongoing treatment?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. A few colds here and there, but… that's about it. I eat okay, try to get enough sleep when I can, you know. I’m not the most careful person, but I haven't broken anything major or anything like that. Is this taking long? I got practice later.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, we’re making good progress. And no, nothing major. That's good to hear. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s about it. Nothing regular. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I figure if I’m eating alright, I should get what I need from food, you know? Don't need to pump my body full of stuff it doesn't need.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. And how about allergies?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies as far as I know. I can eat anything, breathe anything… I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Well, maybe dust makes me sneeze a little sometimes, but that’s it. Not a serious allergy, just… a sneeze. This is all pretty standard stuff, right? Are we getting closer to the actual check-up?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are almost there. Just a few more questions, then we'll move onto the physical exam. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father had a bit of a weak heart towards the end, but he smoked a lot. My mother was pretty healthy, actually. No cancer that I know of. Nothing major on either side, I guess. My family isn’t exactly… known for living to a hundred, but no major diseases, if that makes sense. Just… normal wear and tear, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. One last question before we start the exam. Do you currently use tobacco, alcohol, or any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched them. Not my thing at all. Always been pretty straight-laced, I guess. I need to keep my body in good shape for wrestling, can't be messing with that stuff. So, can we get this over with? I’m starting to feel a little impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfect. No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Excellent. That completes the initial questionnaire. Now we’ll move on to a physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic musculoskeletal assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Sounds good. Just… let’s get it done quickly, if you don’t mind. I’ve got a team to make.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale. And again… deep breath in… and exhale. Your heart rate is a little elevated, which isn't uncommon if you're a bit anxious. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could I see your arms, please?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Here. Go ahead. Just… try not to hit any nerves, okay? I need these arms for wrestling.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes in both arms. Now, let's check your range of motion. Can you rotate your shoulders forward and backward for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Like this? It feels a little stiff, honestly. Haven’t really been stretching as much lately. Gotta focus on the technique, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some mild restriction in your shoulder range of motion. Nothing too concerning, but it’s something to be aware of. Now, let's check your knees. Could you sit on the examination table and let me assess them?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Be gentle, okay? This knee’s been through a few wars. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild crepitus in your right knee when you extend it, and slight tenderness along the joint line. It doesn’t appear to be acutely inflamed. Do you experience any pain or swelling in your knee regularly?
PATIENT: Nah, not really regularly. It gets a bit sore after a hard practice, but ice usually takes care of it. Old injury, you know? Just… a bit of wear and tear. It's never really stopped me from wrestling, though. It’s just… a bit grumpy sometimes, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, I'm going to quickly check your pulse and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/85, and your pulse is 88. A little elevated, but probably from your nerves and activity level. Overall, your physical exam is fairly normal. We did find some mild crepitus and tenderness in your right knee, and limited range of motion in your shoulders. But there are no acute findings that would prevent you from participating in wrestling.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So, I’m good to go? That's all I needed to hear. I got a team to make. No time to waste. Do I need to fill out any forms, or…?
DOCTOR: You are generally good to go, yes. However, I would recommend a few things. First, consistent stretching and strengthening exercises for your shoulders. And for your right knee, continue using ice after practice and consider a knee brace if you feel any instability. We should also monitor the knee for any worsening symptoms. I’m going to recommend you see a physical therapist for a more thorough evaluation and personalized exercise plan. They can help address the limitations in your shoulder and knee. Here’s a referral to a local physical therapy clinic. I will also provide you with a summary of our visit to take with you. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… Hmm. Okay. I guess. It'll take up time, but… if it keeps me on the mat, I guess it's worth it. No, I don't think so. Just… thanks, Doctor. I appreciate it. Gotta go. Wish me luck!
DOCTOR: Good luck, Mr. Kingan! And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. And remember to follow up with the physical therapist. .
