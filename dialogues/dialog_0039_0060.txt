DOCTOR: Hello, Blain. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, thank you. It’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. My family… we have a history. A bad one. Lots of heart trouble, you know? My grandfather, my uncle… even my father, too young. And I just… I want to make sure I’m okay. I don’t want to end up like them. I guess I just want… reassurance, if that makes sense? I've been trying to eat right and exercise, but... it's always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Blain. Family history is very important, and it's good you're being proactive about your health. It’s never embarrassing to want reassurance, especially with a family background like that. We can definitely look into things and try to get you some peace of mind. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit more about what's been going on specifically with you?
PATIENT: Well, nothing specific, really. That’s the frustrating part. I don’t feel sick. No chest pain, no shortness of breath… I just get… anxious. Especially when I’m stressed. My heart races a little, but honestly, doesn’t everyone’s when they’re stressed? I just… I overthink it, I think. But then I remember my dad… and then I start checking my pulse constantly. It’s a bit of a cycle, really. I probably sound ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t sound ridiculous at all, Blain. It’s very common to experience anxiety and have those physical symptoms, especially with a strong family history of heart problems. It's good you're aware of the cycle. And it’s smart to get it checked out when you're concerned. Okay. So, no chest pain or shortness of breath. Just the racing heart, especially with stress. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the racing heart?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I get a little lightheaded, but that could just be from not eating enough, honestly. I skip breakfast sometimes. And… I guess I sweat a little more than usual, but again, it’s been really hot lately. It’s hard to tell what’s normal and what isn’t, you know? I really don’t want to waste your time with nothing. I just... I'd rather be safe than sorry. And my ex-wife always said I was a hypochondriac, so… maybe she was right.
DOCTOR: Ex-wives often have opinions! It's good you're being mindful of your symptoms, and it’s definitely not wasting my time. It's my job to help sort through things. Lightheadedness and increased sweating can both be related to anxiety, but we want to rule out anything else. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with anxiety, or have you ever taken any medication for it?
PATIENT: No, never diagnosed. And no medication. I just… try to deal with it. Deep breathing, mostly. And avoiding stressful situations, which isn’t always easy. My job is… demanding, to say the least. Engineering students, you know? They’re… a lot. I’ve considered talking to someone, a therapist maybe, but… I don't really do feelings. It’s silly, I know. My father was the same way. Stoic. We just… pushed through it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Blain. Many people prefer to manage things on their own, and it sounds like you've been doing a good job of that. And it’s common for engineers to be stoic – I’ve seen it before. It’s good to be aware of your coping mechanisms. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, then. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, but that’s about it. No allergies, no asthma, nothing like that. I get a yearly physical through my insurance – Medicare, thankfully – but they just do the usual stuff. Blood pressure, cholesterol, you know? Everything always comes back normal, which is… frustrating, honestly. Because then I start thinking, "What am I worrying about?" But then my uncle… he had perfectly normal checkups right up until… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Blain. It's unsettling when things seem normal, but you still have those concerns. And your uncle's experience is understandably weighing on your mind. Okay, so no allergies, no asthma, no other medical conditions. Everything comes back normal on your yearly physicals. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I'm remarkably… intact, if that makes sense. I’ve always been pretty careful. I avoid risk whenever possible. Which, ironically, is probably why I’m so anxious about everything. It's a bit of a paradox, really. My ex-wife would have a field day with that one. She always said I was overthinking things.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've lived a very healthy life so far, Blain. And it's not uncommon for careful people to experience anxiety. Alright, so no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family history a little more specifically, beyond just the heart trouble. Did your father or grandfather have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father… he developed high blood pressure later in life, I think. And he was borderline diabetic, but he managed it with diet for a long time before it got… bad. My grandfather… I don't really know, honestly. He didn't really talk about his health, and my grandmother passed away before I was old enough to ask. They were… old-fashioned, you know? Didn’t really share that sort of information. I know there was something with his lungs, but I don’t know what.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had high blood pressure and borderline diabetes, and your grandfather had some sort of lung condition, but you're not sure of the details. That’s helpful to know. Now, just to cover all bases, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. None of the above. I don't even like the smell of cigarette smoke. And alcohol… I had a brief phase in college, but I quickly realized it didn't agree with me. And recreational drugs? Definitely not. I have a reputation to maintain, you know? Plus, as I said, I’m pretty careful. It just wouldn’t be… sensible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Blain. Sensible is good. Alright, so no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. And finally, let's talk about your weight and height. I see you're 6'0" and 160lbs. Are those accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, those are accurate. I… I know I’m a bit thin. I’ve always been that way. I have a fast metabolism, I guess. It's just… hard for me to gain weight. I try to eat healthy, but… it doesn’t seem to make much difference. And my ex-wife… well, she always said I needed to “bulk up,” but… that was one of many things we disagreed about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so 6'0" and 160lbs. It's good you're maintaining a healthy diet. Alright, Blain, that gives me a good overview. Considering your family history and your symptoms, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and Professor Armitage gets… testy if you’re late. And honestly, the thought of being poked and prodded isn’t particularly appealing, but… if it will give me some peace of mind, then yes, let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: It won’t take long, Blain. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your overall health. It's a pretty standard exam. If you could just sit up there for me, please. I'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 118/72, which is excellent. Heart rate is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs… just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or irregularities. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Reflexes are normal. Everything sounds and feels normal, Blain. But, given your anxiety and family history, I would like to order a few tests, just to be sure. I’d like to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and thyroid function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible. I suppose it’s better to be thorough. An EKG and a blood panel… will that take long? I really don’t want to miss that faculty meeting. And… will it be expensive? My Medicare only covers so much, you know.
DOCTOR: The EKG will only take a few minutes, and the blood panel shouldn't take much longer. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. As for the cost, let me check your Medicare coverage. Okay, it looks like the EKG is fully covered, and the blood panel has a small co-pay. I can have our billing department give you a precise estimate before we proceed, if you'd like. Would you like to go ahead and get those tests done now?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s just get it over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can stop worrying. And… please, just let me know the co-pay amount before you draw any blood. I don’t want any surprises. And… if everything comes back normal, can you… tell me that it’s probably just anxiety? That would be… helpful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain. I understand. Let me just confirm the co-pay amount for the blood panel… it will be $35. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… acceptable. $35 is… manageable. Let’s do it. The sooner this is over, the better. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It’s… appreciated.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Blain. It’s my job to listen and take your concerns seriously. Okay, Sarah is going to draw your blood now. It'll just be a quick prick, and then we’ll get the results back to you as soon as possible. I'll also schedule an EKG right after, it only takes a few minutes. While we're waiting for the tests to be processed, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… the tests, and hopefully some reassurance. And… thank you again. You’ve been… surprisingly patient with me. Most doctors just tell me I’m overthinking things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Blain. It's important to me that you feel heard and understood. And I’m happy to provide reassurance whenever possible. While we wait for the results, I'm going to document everything we've discussed today. I'll also order a referral to a therapist specializing in anxiety, just as an option. No obligation, of course, but it's good to have resources available. Sarah will be with you momentarily to draw your blood, and then we’ll get the EKG done. I’ll be just outside if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Alright. That… sounds sensible. A therapist referral is… thoughtful. I’ll… consider it. Thank you. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Blain. Please don't hesitate to let me know if anything changes or if you have any questions. I'll check on you after the tests are done. I’ll be right outside if you need anything.
PATIENT: .
