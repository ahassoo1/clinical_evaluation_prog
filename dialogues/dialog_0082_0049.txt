DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty. Or... is it Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It's... Betty, yes. Though folks used to call me Sch-nee-er, with a bit of a roll to the 'r'. Doesn't matter much these days, I suppose. Just glad to be here. My hearing's been... well, not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. It's no trouble at all. And yes, I see here you've mentioned some hearing difficulties. That’s perfectly alright, we can speak up. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's just... things sound muffled, you know? Like someone’s got a pillow over the speaker. And sometimes... sometimes I don't hear things at all. Especially women's voices, funny enough. My daughter keeps saying I need to get it checked, and she's probably right. I worked in a shoe factory for years, lots of noise, clatterin’ machines... could be from that, I reckon. Though it's been a while since I worked there. A long while. I don't rightly remember when I stopped.
DOCTOR: Alright, muffled hearing, worse with women's voices, and a history of noise exposure at the shoe factory. That's all helpful information. You said you don’t recall when you left the factory, do you remember roughly how long you worked there?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… that’s a tough one. Seems like… a lifetime ago. Maybe… forty years? Or was it thirty? I think it was more than thirty. It was a good job, though. Steady work, you know? Lots of folks liked workin’ there. We made boots, mostly. And shoes, of course. But the noise… oh, the noise was somethin’ awful. It always rang in my ears when I got home. Though now… now it's just… quiet. Too quiet, maybe. I don't know. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, more than thirty years at the shoe factory. It’s perfectly alright that the details are fuzzy, Betty. Memory can be tricky. Besides the muffled hearing, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Ringing… sometimes, yes. Not all the time, just… a sort of high-pitched whine. Comes and goes. And dizziness… not really. I get a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I put that down to my age, mostly. I'm 83, you know. Things start creakin' and groanin’ at that age! Balance… well, I wouldn’t say I’m nimble as I used to be, but I haven't fallen or anything. My daughter worries too much, if you ask me. She's a good girl, though. Always lookin' out for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent ringing, occasional unsteadiness, but no falls. That’s good to know. Now, aside from your hearing, are there any other health concerns that brought you in today, or that we should discuss?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, I suppose. Just the usual aches and pains for an old fella. My knees bother me sometimes, and my back… well, my back always complains. But I manage. I take a little somethin’ for the knees when they’re particularly bad. Doctor gave it to me a while back. And… oh, I get tired easily, but that’s probably just age, too. Nothing major, really. Mostly just want to hear better, so I don’t have to keep askin’ folks to repeat themselves! It’s embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Betty. It is frustrating. So, just to confirm, you have some knee pain, general fatigue, and have been taking medication for your knees prescribed previously by another doctor. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I just take the little white pills. My daughter fills the bottles for me, you see. I don’t rightly remember what she calls them. Something with a "co"... or maybe a "pro"? It's all a blur, I tell ya. She keeps a list, I suppose. She's very organized, that one. I just know they help my knees, and that's all that matters to me. I wouldn't want to bother her now, she's busy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright, Betty. We can look it up in your records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Never had a problem with penicillin or anything like that. Bees, maybe? I think I got stung once when I was a little boy, but it wasn’t too bad. Just a bit of swelling. Nothing serious, though. I wouldn't say I'm allergic to anything, really. I eat my vegetables, you know. My daughter makes sure of that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Now, Betty, I’m going to do a quick examination of your ears, just to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not as spry as I used to be, you see. And try to speak up, my hearing isn't what it was.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Betty. I'll be as gentle as possible, and I'll be sure to speak clearly. I'm just going to take a quick look in each ear. It might be a little chilly for a moment. Alright, let's start with your right ear… Okay, I see some wax buildup in the ear canal. The eardrum looks a little… dull, but I don’t see any obvious signs of infection or fluid. Now, let’s take a look at your left ear… Hmm, similar situation here – wax buildup, and a slightly dull eardrum. Nothing alarming, but the wax is definitely obstructing the view. The wax buildup could be contributing to your muffled hearing. It’s very common, especially as we get older.
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is it? My daughter always tells me I shouldn't stick anything in my ears. She says I'll just push it further in. She's probably right, I suppose. So, you think that’s what’s makin’ it hard to hear? The wax? I always thought it was just… old age creepin’ in. Is it something you can get rid of? I don't want to have to shout at folks all the time! It's embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: It very well could be the wax, Betty. And your daughter is absolutely right, you shouldn’t stick anything in your ears! It can push the wax further in and cause more problems. It’s a very common issue. We can remove the wax safely here in the office. There are a couple of ways we can do it. We can use a special tool to gently scoop it out, or we can use ear drops to soften it up and let it come out on its own. The drops are usually the gentler option. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, the gentler option sounds… well, gentler! I don't fancy any scooping, if you don't mind. My ears are a bit sensitive, you see. Just the thought of it… makes me wince. Drops sound much nicer. And will they… burn? Or sting? I’m a bit of a worrywart, you see. My daughter says so.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Betty. We'll do the drops. They shouldn’t burn or sting at all. They’re just a mineral oil based solution, very gentle. You might feel a slight coolness or tingling sensation, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. We'll put a few drops in each ear, you'll lie on your side for about 5-10 minutes to let them soak in, and then we’ll see if we can gently flush out the wax. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds perfectly alright, dear. Just lie on my side for a bit, and let the drops do their work. Easy enough. I've been lyin' on my side for years, if you catch my drift. And you said it won’t burn or sting? Promise? My ears are a bit precious, you see. Old ears, gotta be careful with 'em.
DOCTOR: I promise, Betty. No burning or stinging. We’ll take things very slowly and gently. Now, let’s get you comfortable on your side here. We'll start with your right ear. I’ll let you know exactly what I’m doing every step of the way. And if you feel any discomfort at all, just let me know, and we’ll stop immediately.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Thank you. That's very kind of you. I appreciate you being so careful. My daughter will be pleased. She worries so much. Just let me know when you’re ready. And please, speak up. It’s a bit muffled in here, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright Betty, I'm just putting a few drops in your right ear now. It might feel a little chilly for a moment. Now, if you could just lie comfortably on your right side for about five minutes. This will allow the drops to soften the wax. I’ll stay right here with you, and we can chat while we wait. How was your week so far?
PATIENT: Oh, my week… well, it's been quiet. Very quiet. Mostly just stayin’ in, watchin’ the television. They had a nice program on about birds yesterday. Bluebirds, I think it was. Beautiful little things. My daughter brought me over some soup on Tuesday. Chicken noodle. Very good soup. She's a good girl, that one. Always lookin' after me. This ear… feels a bit tingly now. Not painful, just… different. Five minutes, you say? Seems like a long time lyin' on one side. But I suppose I can manage. Anything's better than not bein' able to hear, right?
DOCTOR: It does feel like a long time, doesn't it?
PATIENT: It does. Still, better than yellin' at folks all the time. Though my daughter says I yell at the television more than at people. She's probably right, if I'm honest. It's just… when they don't speak up! Hard to hear these days, you know. What about you, Doctor? Busy week? You have a nice, calm voice, by the way. Easy to hear. Easier than the television, anyway.
DOCTOR: Well, it's been a fairly typical week. Lots of check-ups, a few colds going around. It’s nice to hear a compliment about my voice though, thank you! It's important to be clear when communicating with patients. Almost time to turn you over. Just a minute more. Do you feel any pain at all in your ear now?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Just the tingly feeling. It's not unpleasant, really. Just… noticeable. I haven't had much done to my ears in my life, you see. Aside from my daughter tryin' to clean 'em with those little cotton swabs, which she shouldn't do, mind you. She knows that now. Always listenin' to her, I do. Good girl. She's learnin' to be a good mother, too, now. Got a little one herself. Five minutes, you say? Almost there?
DOCTOR: Yes, almost there, Betty. Just about five minutes have passed. Alright, let's gently turn you over onto your left side now. We'll repeat the process on this ear, and then we can see if the wax has softened enough to remove. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s alright, that's alright. Just a bit creaky, but I’m used to that. This side feels the same as the other. Tingly. Not painful, just… different. Do I need to keep my head still? I don't want to make a mess. Always worryin', I am. It's just… old age, you know. Everything gets a bit… fragile. Let me know when those five minutes are up. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: You don't need to worry about making a mess, Betty. Just relax. And yes, keep your head still if you can, but don’t strain yourself. Just about five minutes now. Let's see… Alright, five minutes are up. Let's gently sit up now, and we can take a look. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s alright. Just a bit dizzy, but that’ll pass. Always get a bit dizzy when I move too fast. Now, what are you going to do? Look in my ears? With those little… tools? I don’t want you pokin’ around too much, mind you. I’m a bit sensitive, you see. And please speak up, it’s still a bit muffled in here. What did you see? Is it all wax? Or something worse?
DOCTOR: Alright Betty, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears now with the otoscope. It won’t be painful, I promise. I'm just checking to see how much wax softened up. It looks like we have quite a bit of wax buildup in both ears, but no signs of anything else concerning. No redness, swelling, or fluid. The wax is quite impacted, meaning it’s packed in pretty tightly. We’ll need to gently remove it to improve your hearing. I'm going to use a small, curved instrument to carefully scoop out the wax. It might feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Do you want me to tell you exactly what I'm doing as I go?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear it's just wax. No redness or swelling... that's a relief. Scooping, you say? A little pressure... alright. Tell me exactly what you're doin', please. I like to know what's happenin'. Keeps me calm, you see. And be gentle, mind you. My ears are a bit precious. Start slow, please. And speak up. It’s still a bit muffled. What are you doin’ now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. I'm just gently inserting this small instrument into your right ear canal now. It’s curved, and it's designed to carefully loosen the wax. I'm going to move it around a little bit to break up the wax, and then I’ll gently remove it. You might feel a little bit of pressure, or a slight tickling sensation. Let me know if you feel any pain at all. See, just a little bit of wax coming out. How are you feeling so far?
PATIENT: Oh, that feels… a little ticklish, yes. And a bit of pressure, but not painful. Just… odd. Like somethin' movin' around in there. Is it gettin' out? You gettin' a lot? I can't see, you see. I can feel a bit of air movin' around now, which is nice. But it’s still a bit muffled. You sure you're gettin' it all? Don't want to have to come back again, you see. Old age, hard to keep things workin' properly. Is it gettin' closer?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm getting quite a bit out now, Betty. You're right, it's good to feel some air movement, that means we're clearing the canal. It takes a little time and patience. It’s important to take it slow to avoid irritating the ear canal. We don’t want to push the wax further in. I'm just working around the edges now to loosen the remaining wax. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s gettin' a bit easier now, yes. Not as ticklish. And I can feel a bit of air movin' around. Still a bit muffled, but maybe… maybe a little better? Hard to tell, you see. Old ears, everything sounds the same. You gettin' a lot out? Is it all gone yet? Don’t want you pokin' around in there too long, mind you. Just tell me when you’re done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty, I think I’ve gotten most of the wax out of your right ear now. The canal looks much clearer. Let’s move on to your left ear now. We’ll do the same thing. Just gently insert this instrument and carefully loosen the wax. It might feel a little bit similar to what you felt in your right ear. Just let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Let's get this over with then. Left ear now, you say? It feels… similar, yes. A bit of pressure, a bit of ticklish. Just gettin' it out, gettin' it all out. Don't want to come back again, you see. Just tell me when you’re done. And speak up, it’s still a bit muffled. It's hard to hear these days, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright Betty, I think I’ve gotten most of the wax out of your left ear now as well. Both canals look much clearer. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… well… that feels… lighter, yes. Not as stuffy. And… is it just me, or… is it a bit clearer? I can hear you a bit better, I think. It's hard to tell, you see. Old age, everything sounds the same. Can you… can you say something? Something a bit… quiet? Let me see if I can hear it.
DOCTOR: Alright Betty, let's see… "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… well, now… that is better! I can hear the… the fox! And the… the dog! It's not perfect, mind you. Still a bit muffled. But… it’s definitely better. You've done a good job, Doctor. A good job. I think… I think I can hear you a bit clearer now. Thank you. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I'm glad I could help. It sounds like removing the wax has made a noticeable difference. Now, there's still a chance that some wax may remain deeper in the canals. I recommend we avoid using any cotton swabs or other objects in your ears. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a few months to check your hearing and ensure there's no further buildup. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. A follow-up appointment. Yes, that’s a good idea. No cotton swabs. I remember my daughter telling me that. No pokin' around in there. Alright. A few months, you say? I’ll have to check with my daughter, see what she thinks. She’s good at rememberin’ these things. Thank you again, Doctor. You've made an old woman very happy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. I'm glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you experience any further changes in your hearing, or if you have any concerns. Here’s a note with instructions about avoiding cotton swabs and keeping your ears dry. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that's all, Doctor. You've been very thorough. Very kind. Keep 'em dry… no cotton swabs… alright. My daughter will be pleased. She'll make sure I follow those instructions. Thank you again. You've been a great help. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go home and have a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Betty. Enjoy your tea, and have a good day. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. It was a pleasure meeting you.
