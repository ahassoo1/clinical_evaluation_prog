DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Stilaire. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to put it simply, I'm still awfully tired during the day, even with the machine. I’ve been using a CPAP for… oh, goodness, must be close to five years now, and it helps with the snoring, my wife is very grateful for that, but the sleepiness just hasn’t gone away. It’s frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It’s good that the CPAP is addressing the snoring, and I appreciate your wife's perspective being shared. It is frustrating when a treatment isn’t fully resolving the issue. So, you’ve been using the CPAP for approximately five years, and while it’s helpful for snoring, you continue to experience daytime fatigue. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I fall asleep standing up, Doctor. It's more… a constant dragging feeling. Like I haven’t quite woken up, even after eight hours. I find myself dozing off in the armchair while reading, sometimes even during a lecture I’m giving – terribly embarrassing, that. And concentrating is difficult. I used to be able to grade papers for hours, now I have to take breaks every twenty minutes or so. It’s interfering with things, you see. I still teach a couple of classes, and I don’t want to… well, I don’t want to lose my edge.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Paske. That sounds very disruptive to your daily life, and it’s good you’re being proactive about addressing it. It’s concerning that you’re experiencing difficulty with concentration and finding yourself dozing even while engaged in activities. It's admirable that you continue to teach, and I certainly appreciate your desire to maintain your abilities. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let's see... I usually wake up around 7:00, though sometimes it’s earlier, and I need a good cup of coffee to get going. I have a light breakfast – toast, usually – and then I’ll check my emails and prepare for any classes I have that day. I usually teach two mornings a week, and then spend the afternoons doing research or grading papers. I try to get a walk in most days, keeps the old bones moving. Dinner is around 7:00, then a bit of reading, and I’m usually in bed by 10:00. I always use the CPAP, religiously. My wife makes sure of that! It's just... even with all that, I'm still tired. And I don't nap during the day, I find that just makes things worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed overview, Mr. Paske. It sounds like you have a fairly consistent routine, which is excellent. The fact that you consistently use the CPAP is also very positive. And you're right to avoid naps, as they can sometimes disrupt nighttime sleep further. Now, let’s delve a little deeper into your sleep itself. Do you have any difficulty falling asleep, or staying asleep once you’re down?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. I don’t lie awake for hours, and I don’t wake up repeatedly during the night. Once I get going with the machine, I sleep pretty soundly, as far as I know. My wife doesn't complain about my snoring, so I assume it’s doing its job. It's not the quality of sleep, I don’t think, it’s just… insufficient, somehow. Like I’m not getting the restorative rest I need, even though I’m getting enough hours. Does that make sense? It’s a hard thing to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Paske. You’re describing feeling unrefreshed despite adequate sleep duration, and that’s a crucial piece of information. It suggests we need to explore factors beyond just airway obstruction. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions – perhaps high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not particularly, Doctor. I had my share of aches and pains as I’ve gotten older, but nothing serious. My blood pressure is a little high, but it’s managed with a small dose of medication – lisinopril, I believe. And my cholesterol is slightly elevated, but I watch my diet and it’s usually under control. No diabetes, no heart problems. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that’s not really relevant, is it? I see a cardiologist annually, just for a check-up, given my age and family history, but he hasn’t expressed any major concerns.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That’s very helpful. Lisinopril for blood pressure and monitored cholesterol are good to know. The history of pneumonia is noted, and it’s reassuring to hear your cardiologist hasn’t raised any red flags. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including the lisinopril, and any over-the-counter medications or supplements you use regularly?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, I take lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily, for my blood pressure. That’s it for prescription medications. I do take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things topped up, and occasionally some ibuprofen for aches and pains – maybe once or twice a month, if that. I also have a small glass of red wine with dinner most nights – my wife says it’s good for the heart, but I don’t overdo it. Just one glass, usually. And that’s it, I think. Nothing else. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That’s very clear. Lisinopril, a multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen, and a glass of red wine – all noted. Now, regarding allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions. No food allergies, no reactions to medications. I’ve had the usual hay fever as a kid, but that’s long gone. Nothing that requires me to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I’m quite fortunate, really. I seem to be able to eat and take most things without any trouble. I once had a bit of a rash after using a new laundry detergent, but that wasn’t a serious allergy, just a bit of irritation.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Paske. No known allergies are good to know. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, sleep apnea, or any neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart disease, he passed away from a heart attack in his early seventies. My mother lived to be ninety-two, but she had some dementia in her later years. My brother has high blood pressure, like me, and also takes medication for it. As for sleep apnea… that’s a good question. No one was ever diagnosed with it, but my wife says my father snored terribly, and I believe my brother also snores quite loudly. It wasn’t something we talked about much, to be honest. No one had any neurological disorders that I’m aware of. That’s about it, I think. A bit of the usual aging stuff, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That’s helpful information. A family history of heart disease and dementia is noted, as well as the possible family history of snoring. Finally, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife smokes, she’s been trying to quit for years, but it’s a difficult habit to break. I’ve always been strongly opposed to smoking, and I’m glad I never started. It’s a terrible thing for your health, and I try to encourage my wife to quit whenever I can. It's been a long battle, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. And thank you for sharing that about your wife. Alright, Mr. Paske, thank you for providing such a thorough history. It sounds like you've been experiencing persistent fatigue despite consistent CPAP use, and we've ruled out a number of common causes. Given your age, your history of controlled blood pressure, and the family history, there are a few possibilities we need to explore further. I would like to start with a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perform a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam is a good idea, I think. I’ve always believed in a good check-up, and I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. It's good to know we're trying to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your heart rate is regular, and I’m not hearing any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Your blood pressure is currently 138/82, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range given your usual medication. Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength appears to be good. Your coordination is also intact. However, I notice some very mild tremor in your hands when you extend your arms. It's subtle, but worth noting. Alright, Mr. Paske. The physical exam didn't reveal any immediate concerns, but the mild tremor in your hands is something we should investigate further. Given your persistent fatigue, the tremor, and your age, I would like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. I would also like to order a sleep study to re-evaluate the effectiveness of your CPAP therapy, as sometimes settings need to be adjusted over time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and another sleep study seem like a logical next step. I’m happy to go ahead with whatever you recommend. The tremor… well, I hadn’t really noticed it myself, but if you think it’s worth investigating, I trust your judgment. I just want to feel like myself again, you see. I miss having the energy I used to have. So, yes, please, let's proceed with the tests. When can I schedule the sleep study? And where would I go for that?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Paske. Feeling like yourself again is the most important thing, and we will work towards that. The sleep study can be scheduled at the Sleep Center located at St. Jude’s Hospital, which is about a 20-minute drive from here. They have comfortable private rooms and experienced technicians. I will have my assistant schedule that for you. She’ll call you tomorrow to find a convenient date and time. You’ll need to bring your usual CPAP machine with you. As for the blood tests, you can have those done at the lab in the same building, right down the hall. They don’t require an appointment, and you can go any time during their business hours. I’ll send the order to them electronically, so they’ll be expecting you. While we wait for the results, I would also like you to keep a sleep diary for the next week. Record the time you go to bed, the time you wake up, how many times you wake up during the night, and how you feel upon waking. This will give us a more detailed picture of your sleep patterns. I'll have my assistant provide you with a template. Finally, I want to be cautious. The tremor, combined with the fatigue, warrants a thorough evaluation. I'm not suggesting anything specific at this point, but I would like to have a referral to a neurologist available, just in case. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds perfectly reasonable. Scheduling the sleep study and having my assistant arrange the sleep diary are both fine. A referral to a neurologist, just to be on the safe side, is a very good idea. I appreciate your thoroughness and your cautious approach. I’m happy to keep the sleep diary and bring my CPAP machine to the sleep center. You're right to want to rule everything out. I’m quite a pragmatic person, myself, and I understand the importance of getting all the information. Thank you, Doctor Stilaire. I feel much more reassured after speaking with you. I'm grateful for your help. I’ll wait for my assistant to call tomorrow about scheduling the sleep study, and I’ll get started on the sleep diary right away. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Your pragmatic approach is excellent, and I appreciate your cooperation. No, there’s nothing else you need to do for now. Just focus on getting a good night’s rest and keeping the sleep diary. We’ll go from there once we have the results of the blood tests and the sleep study. I'll also provide you with a written summary of our discussion today, including the instructions for the sleep diary, the contact information for the Sleep Center, and a list of the medications you’re currently taking. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime – such as dizziness, weakness, or changes in your vision – please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. I don’t have any further questions at the moment. Thank you again for your time and your attention. I really appreciate it. I’ll wait for my assistant to call tomorrow about scheduling the sleep study. I suppose there's nothing more to do for now but get a good night’s sleep – or at least, try to. I’ll see you again when we have the results of the tests. Have a good day, Doctor Stilaire. And thank you, once again.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you a good night’s rest as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
