DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here, if I understand correctly, for… a certification? Regarding care at home. My daughter, she believes it is necessary, and she arranged this appointment. I confess, I am not entirely sure of the details myself.
DOCTOR: I see. It appears your daughter scheduled this appointment as part of an evaluation for home healthcare services. That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. We can certainly clarify everything. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on that led your daughter to think home healthcare might be helpful?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, as you likely see in my file, I am a surgeon. Or was a surgeon. I retired six months ago. It has been… difficult. Not physically, not precisely. But my energy is… less. And I find keeping up with things – the house, meals, even remembering appointments – is more challenging than it used to be. My daughter, bless her heart, worries I am not looking after myself as well as I should be. She fears I might fall, for instance. Or simply forget something important.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Bahta. Retirement is a significant life change, and it’s not uncommon to experience some adjustment, as you’ve described. A decrease in energy and some difficulty with daily tasks can have many causes. So, let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you say "less energy," could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is not… weakness, precisely. More like… a constant feeling of being tired, even after a full night’s sleep. And it isn’t simply a desire not to do things. I want to maintain the garden, for instance, but by the afternoon, I find myself needing to rest. I used to work long hours, of course, very demanding work, and I always recovered quickly. This is… different. It lingers. And I find myself… forgetting things. Small things, mostly. Names, where I put my glasses… although I do seem to remember details very clearly. Dates, events... it is a peculiar thing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so thoroughly, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like the fatigue is persistent and doesn’t improve with rest, and you’re experiencing some memory difficulties. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: It began, I believe, approximately three months ago. Shortly after I officially retired. At first, I attributed it to the change in routine. A period of adjustment, I thought. But it has not improved. If anything, it has become… more pronounced. I recall precisely the date I handed in my resignation – June 12th, 2025 – but I struggle to remember what I had for breakfast this morning. It is rather frustrating, to be honest. I have always prided myself on my mental acuity.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bahta. It’s certainly concerning when changes occur that affect your cognitive function and daily life, especially given your history. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep patterns besides the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm. My sleep… is generally undisturbed. I sleep soundly, although perhaps not as deeply as before. As for my mood… I would say I am… quieter. Less inclined to socialize. Not sad, precisely, but… less enthusiastic. It is difficult to explain. My wife and I divorced five years ago, and I suppose some of that… loneliness has returned. But I do not believe it is the sole cause. The feeling is… separate, somehow. And I do worry about being a burden to my daughter. She is very kind, but she has a family of her own.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Bahta. It’s helpful to understand the broader context. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see. I had my appendix removed as a boy, and I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. Nothing significant. I have high blood pressure, which is controlled with medication – Lisinopril, I believe it is called. And I was diagnosed with mild arthritis in my knees several years ago, but it is well-managed with over-the-counter pain relievers and occasional physical therapy. Otherwise, I have generally been quite healthy. I was always very active, even up until my retirement. I used to swim regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for high blood pressure and mild arthritis. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin. And occasionally, when my knees are particularly troublesome, I take Ibuprofen. But that is infrequent, perhaps once or twice a month. I believe that is all. I do not care for taking many pills, if I can avoid it. My wife, she was the one who always remembered everything regarding medications. It is another thing I seem to be… less adept at since the divorce.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and occasional Ibuprofen. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think. My mother suffered from… dementia, I believe it was. Alzheimer's, perhaps. She was diagnosed in her late seventies. My father had heart disease, and he passed away at the age of 82. And my sister has diabetes, but she is well-managed with diet and medication. Aside from that, nothing particularly noteworthy, as far as I am aware. We weren't a particularly close family, you see. I rarely spoke with them about such matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. That’s important information. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, I retired six months ago from surgery. Before that, my life was… very structured. Long hours at the hospital, on-call duties… very demanding. Now, I live alone in the house my wife and I purchased many years ago. It is too large for me, perhaps, but I am reluctant to move. I enjoy gardening when the weather permits, and I occasionally read. I try to stay active, but, as we have discussed, my energy levels are lower. I do not drink alcohol, and I do not smoke. I try to eat a healthy diet, although I confess my daughter often worries I am not getting enough nutrients. She sends me pre-prepared meals occasionally. She is very solicitous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. That gives me a good overview of your lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your current health status. We'll check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature—and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and memory. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment entirely. I confess, I am not particularly fond of doctors’ visits, but I understand it is necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will keep everything as quick and comfortable as possible. First, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 76 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but not significantly concerning at this moment. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I will check your reflexes and do a few simple memory exercises. Could you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Certainly. Today is August 2nd, 2025. I pride myself on remembering dates. As I mentioned earlier, I recall the precise date of my resignation from the hospital. June 12th, 2025. It’s a peculiar thing, some memories are remarkably vivid, while others… not so much.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words back to me. Please listen carefully: Apple, Table, Penny. Remember those three words, and I will ask you to recall them later. Now, let’s test your short-term memory. What did I ask you to do just a moment ago?
PATIENT: You asked me to repeat three words back to you. Apple, Table, and Penny, I believe they were.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And you remembered them correctly. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions to assess your cognitive function. Can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: That would be President Eleanor Vance. She was elected in 2020. Although, now that I mention it, I seem to recall a great deal of political upheaval around the time of the election. Various… challenges to the results, I believe. A rather turbulent period.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Bahta. You are remembering things accurately. Now, let's do a simple calculation. If you have 15 apples, and you give 7 away, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. Fifteen minus seven… that would be eight. I have eight apples left. A rather simple calculation, I confess. My daughter, she is far better at such matters. She is an accountant.
DOCTOR: That is correct. Now, I will ask you to draw a clock, showing the time as 10 minutes after 11. Please use this paper and pen. This isn't a test of your artistic ability, just to see how easily you can process and represent visual information. Take your time.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I confess, I have not drawn a clock in many years. My skills are… somewhat rusty.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. Alright, Mr. Bahta. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination I've conducted, you’re experiencing some cognitive changes including fatigue and some difficulty with recall. Your physical exam was largely normal, but the drawing shows some minor challenges with visual-spatial processing. Your ability to recall facts is generally good, you correctly named the president and solved the math problem, and you correctly remembered the three words. It's difficult to say definitively what is going on at this stage. These symptoms could be related to several factors, including stress, medication side effects, normal age-related changes, or an underlying medical condition. Given your family history of dementia, it is prudent to investigate further. I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical issues. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. Indeed, I would expect you to conduct such tests. Given my mother’s condition, it would be… irresponsible not to investigate thoroughly. I trust your judgment entirely. An MRI… is that a painful procedure? And what about the blood tests? Will they require multiple visits? I confess, I am not particularly fond of needles.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Mr. Bahta. The MRI is not a painful procedure. You’ll lie inside a large machine that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It's a bit noisy, and you'll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. We can provide headphones if you'd like to listen to music. The blood tests will require one visit to the lab. They’ll draw a small amount of blood to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and other potential causes of cognitive changes. It will be a quick procedure, but if you’re concerned about needles, please let the phlebotomist know—they can take steps to make you more comfortable. I'll write the orders for the tests now and provide you with a requisition form. You can schedule the MRI and blood tests at your convenience. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to maintain a healthy lifestyle, getting regular exercise, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities. Would you like me to provide you with any resources regarding cognitive health and support groups?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be most appreciated. Any resources you can provide regarding cognitive health and support groups would be very helpful. And thank you for explaining the procedures so clearly. It has alleviated much of my anxiety. I confess, I was rather apprehensive at first. The thought of an MRI… it is a daunting prospect. But I understand it is necessary. I will schedule the tests as soon as possible. And please, let me know if any further information is required from my side. You have been most thorough and reassuring, Doctor Soodeen. I am grateful for your attention to this matter.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you we’ll proceed at your pace. Here is the handout with information about cognitive health, warning signs of dementia, and lifestyle modifications you can implement. And here is a list of local support groups and online resources. Feel free to browse through them. I'll also have my nurse give you a copy of your visit summary and instructions for scheduling the tests. Once you have the results, you can schedule another appointment with me, or if you prefer, we can discuss them over the phone. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have addressed all of my concerns thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and attention to detail. I will schedule the tests as soon as possible and contact your office once I have a date. Thank you again for your kind assistance, Doctor Soodeen. It has been a pleasure meeting you.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure meeting you as well, Mr. Bahta. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and have a good day. .
