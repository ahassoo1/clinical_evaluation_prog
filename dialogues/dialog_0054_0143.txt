DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in... yes. Well, it's about... starting a family, I think. My daughter, she thinks it’s a good idea, and I... well, I want to be sure everything is okay first. I’m getting older, you see. I want to be... prepared. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I don't really know where to start.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s very responsible of you to consider your health before starting a family at any age, and especially as you mentioned, with some time having passed. So, to clarify, your daughter is encouraging you to consider having children, and you'd like a general health assessment to see if you're fit for that?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. My daughter... she’s a good girl. Very sensible. And yes, a health check... that sounds good. I don’t remember the last time I saw a doctor, to be honest. A long time ago, I think. Is it… is it going to be a lot of tests? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Mr. Verrall. We'll certainly take that into consideration. We’ll start with a thorough discussion of your medical history, and a physical exam. Based on what we find, we can then decide if any blood tests are necessary. We’ll only do what’s truly needed. First, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... chronic conditions... let me think. High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that, years ago. Maybe. I don't really recall. I eat a lot of salt, I'm afraid. Diabetes... no, I don’t think so. My mother had something with her sugar, but not me. Heart problems... I get a bit breathless sometimes when I climb the stairs, but I think that’s just age. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s common for details to be a little fuzzy over time. The important thing is we're getting a better understanding now. So, a possible history of high blood pressure, and some breathlessness with exertion. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing football. They put a cast on it. That was… a long time ago. Other than that… I don't think so. Maybe a tonsillectomy when I was young? I really can’t remember. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I've never been seriously ill. Hospitalized… perhaps for the arm, but it wasn't a long stay. It was just… a quick fix, I think. I’m sorry I’m not much help with this. It's like trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Mr. Verrall. You’re doing just fine. A broken arm as a child, potentially a tonsillectomy, and no major hospitalizations. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or any other illnesses that have affected your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had something with his heart, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t remember much detail. My mother lived a long life, but she had problems with her… sugar, like I said before. Not diabetes, exactly, but something similar. My sister is still alive, thankfully. She's healthy as far as I know. We don't see each other much, though. She lives far away. I’m afraid that’s all I really know. It wasn’t something we talked about much, illness. It’s… unlucky to talk about such things, we thought.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verrall. That's helpful. So, a family history of heart issues in your father, and some form of sugar problem in your mother. And you mentioned it wasn't common to discuss illness in your family. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... hmm. Well, I live alone, you see. I used to work as a Sales Engineer, travelling a lot, but I retired a few years ago. Now, I mostly stay at home. I enjoy reading and watching television. I go for walks sometimes, when the weather is nice. I don't really… exercise, if you can call it that. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I gave that up when my daughter was born. I enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, but not too much. I eat… well, I eat whatever I fancy, really. Not very healthy, I suppose. It’s all a bit boring, really. Just me and the television.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verrall. That gives me a good overview. Retired, enjoys reading, walking, and used to smoke, but quit many years ago. Fairly sedentary lifestyle. And enjoying a glass of wine with dinner. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications… no, I don’t take anything regularly. Nothing at all. I used to take something for my… indigestion, years ago, but I stopped taking that. Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I get a bit itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just the dust. I’m not sure. Honestly, I can’t really remember. I’ve never been one for taking pills, if I can avoid it. It’s probably best to be careful, though. Just in case. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly okay, Mr. Verrall. No current medications and no known allergies – that’s good to know. Now, to get a clearer picture of your current health, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. A physical exam… alright. I suppose it’s necessary. Just… try to be gentle, if you can. I'm not very strong these days. And please, don’t take off my shoes. I get cold feet, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verrall. I will be as gentle as possible, and I promise not to remove your shoes. We’ll start with checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a quick look at your throat and ears, and briefly examine your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long. Could you please extend your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Be careful with the cuff, please. It always feels a bit tight. My daughter says I complain too much, but… well, it does feel tight. It’s alright, though. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verrall, just breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 148 over 88. That’s a little elevated. We'll want to monitor that. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s a soft murmur, but we’ll need to investigate that further. I’ll also listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: A slight murmur… oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? My father had something with his heart, you know. Is it… serious? I'm starting to feel a bit anxious now. Perhaps I shouldn’t be doing this, starting a family at my age. It's probably too late, anyway.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, please try not to worry. A murmur doesn't automatically mean there’s something seriously wrong. Many murmurs are harmless – often referred to as "innocent murmurs." However, it is something we need to investigate to be certain. Your lungs sound clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Your throat looks normal, and your ears are clear. Now, I'll just gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness. Everything feels normal here.
PATIENT: Alright... that’s… good to hear, about my lungs and ears. And my abdomen. But the murmur… you said it needs investigating? What does that involve? More needles? More tests? I’m not very good with tests, Doctor. And I’ve got an appointment with my daughter later. I don't want to worry her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Verrall. Investigating the murmur will likely involve an electrocardiogram, or ECG, which is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It's non-invasive – we just place some stickers on your chest. And we may also need to do an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. It's also non-invasive, and doesn’t involve any needles. We’ll take things one step at a time. Let's start with the ECG, and then we can discuss whether an echocardiogram is necessary. The purpose of these tests is simply to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your heart. As for worrying your daughter, we can discuss the results together before you speak with her. We can also talk about what the findings mean and what the best course of action is. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An ECG… no needles? That’s… good. Stickers, you say? I can manage stickers. And an echocardiogram… also no needles? Alright. That’s a relief. Talking to my daughter together… yes, that would be good. She worries about me, you see. She’s a good girl. Alright, Doctor. Let's do the ECG, then. And we’ll see what it says. But please, be gentle. And try not to take too long. I've got a roast in the oven.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. I will be as gentle as possible, and we'll try not to take too long. Let's get you set up for the ECG. If you don't mind, I'll just excuse myself for a moment to prepare the equipment and explain the procedure to the technician. I’ll be right back. And don’t worry about the roast – we'll be as quick as we can.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I’ll be here. Just let me know when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verrall, this is Sarah, our technician. She’s going to attach a few stickers to your chest. It won't be uncomfortable at all. She’ll explain everything as she goes. Sarah, if you could take it from here?
PATIENT: Alright, yes. Stickers, you said? Just… be gentle, please. My skin is a bit sensitive, you know. And I get cold easily. I don’t like surprises. Just let me know what you're doing before you do it.
DOCTOR: .
