DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly. And… I seem to be getting these water infections quite a bit now. It’s been happening for a while, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, pain in your side and frequent water infections. Okay. Let's start with the side pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, low down on my back, on my right side mostly. Sometimes it goes around to my tummy. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening more often lately, and it seems to last longer each time. It doesn’t always stop with just a bit of rest, either.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, right side, radiating to the abdomen… and lasting longer. Hmm. And you said it's been happening more frequently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It used to be… maybe once or twice a year. Now, it feels like every few weeks. And with it, these infections… the water infections, I mean. They’re very uncomfortable, naturally. I have to go to the bathroom constantly.
DOCTOR: Frequent UTIs… and coinciding with the side pain. Alright. Just to clarify, when you say "water infections," are you referring to urinary tract infections, or UTIs?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s what I mean. Urinary tract infections. My daughter, she’s a nurse, she explained it to me. It’s just easier for me to say “water infections.” I’m sorry if that’s not… proper.
DOCTOR: No, no, perfectly alright, Mr. Espinueva. It's more important I understand what's going on. So, these UTIs… have you been getting any fever, chills, or nausea with them?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes I feel a bit… shaky, like a little chill. Not a proper fever, I don't think. And no, no nausea. Just the burning when I go to the bathroom, and the constant need to go. It's very… disruptive, if you understand.
DOCTOR: No fever, just chills and the typical UTI symptoms. Okay. Let's go over your medical history quickly. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, the doctors told me years ago I have… what was it now? Polycystic kidney disease. That’s what they said. They did lots of tests, scans and such. It’s… it’s something to do with little bubbles on my kidneys, my daughter explained it. I’ve been seeing a specialist for that, but he mostly just monitors things. That’s why I usually go to him.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… okay. And are you still seeing that specialist regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. I see Dr. Abernathy, over at the city hospital. I had an appointment with him just last month, actually. He did a scan, said things hadn’t changed much. He just wants me to keep an eye on it, drink plenty of water, and call if anything… worsens.
DOCTOR: Dr. Abernathy… alright. And you mentioned you’ve been having these UTIs more frequently. Have you had any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything unusual?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. It sometimes smells… stronger, I suppose. Not terribly bad, but different. And sometimes it’s a little cloudy. Not always, but when the pain is bad, it seems to be cloudier.
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine, stronger smell, coinciding with the side pain and frequent UTIs… Okay, Mr. Espinueva. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check a few things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. It's getting rather tiring, all this going back and forth.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table for me, we’ll start with listening to your abdomen. I’ll need you to point to exactly where you’re feeling the pain, too, when you can. Just breathe normally for me, please. Can you tell me on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain right now?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. . I’d say… about a four, maybe a five on a bad day. Right now, it’s more of a dull ache, like a weight pressing down. It’s mostly here, on my right side, low down. Sometimes it feels like it radiates around to my back, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness on your right side, as you pointed out. Not acutely painful, but definitely sensitive. Your bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. No tenderness along the spine. Alright. I’d also like to check your temperature and blood pressure, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I’m just a bit worried, naturally. It’s this pain, mostly. It just keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Alright, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your blood pressure is 135 over 80. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial examination, it’s likely we're dealing with a combination of factors. The recurrent UTIs could be related to the polycystic kidney disease, and the pain could be stemming from that as well, or possibly a kidney infection. We need to rule out a kidney infection first. I’m going to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to check for bacteria. I will also order a blood test to check your kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I trust your judgement completely. I just want to know what’s causing this pain, and what can be done about it. A kidney infection… that sounds serious.
DOCTOR: It's good to be thorough. A kidney infection can be serious if left untreated, which is why we need to rule it out. The blood tests will also give us a clearer picture of how well your kidneys are functioning. I’m sending the orders to the lab now. They'll need a sample of your urine, and a quick blood draw. The nurse will be in shortly to collect those for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, it’s important to drink plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out your system. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. My daughter always asks, and I've never had any reaction to anything they’ve given me. She's very thorough, that one. I just hope these tests don’t take too long. This pain is quite bothersome, and I’d like to get it sorted out as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. The lab should be able to process these relatively quickly, I’ll call as soon as I have the results, hopefully within 24-48 hours. If you experience a high fever, chills, or severe pain in your back or side before then, please go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you very much for listening and taking the time to explain things so clearly. I feel a bit better just knowing what’s being done. I’ll drink plenty of water, and I’ll be sure to call if anything gets worse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. That's what I’m here for. The nurse will be in shortly. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results.
