DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. But after I eat fava beans… I just feel awful. And I get really yellow. Like, my skin and eyes get yellow. It’s happened a couple of times now, and I’m starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It is good you're getting it checked out. Yellowing of the skin and eyes – that's what we call jaundice – can be a sign of a few different things. And the connection to fava beans is… interesting. Let’s start with some more details. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. The first time it happened, it was maybe… five years ago? I didn't really think much of it then, I just figured it was something I ate. But it’s happened a few times since, always after I have fava beans. It doesn’t happen every time, but enough that I’m avoiding them now. It usually starts within a few hours of eating them.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few times over five years, with a few hours delay after eating fava beans. And it's prompted you to avoid them. Good. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the yellowing?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When it happens, I feel really tired, just completely drained. And my stomach… it doesn’t feel good. Kind of nauseous, and sometimes a little crampy. Not terrible, but uncomfortable enough to notice. And I feel weak, like I could barely get out of bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, nausea, cramping, and weakness along with the jaundice after fava bean consumption. Do you notice any dark urine or pale stools when this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, I think so. My urine does seem darker, and… yes, the stools are paler than usual. I hadn’t really put two and two together, but now that you ask, I remember noticing that. It’s not something I usually pay attention to, if I'm being honest. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re remembering these details. Dark urine and pale stools along with the jaundice are definitely things we need to investigate further. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your skin more closely. It’ll just take a few minutes. Then we can discuss some possible tests. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and I appreciate you taking the time to look into it. I’m a little nervous, but I’m glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let’s feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's just… normal stomach feelings, I guess? A little soft, but nothing painful. I mean, I’m a little sensitive, but I always am. I don’t think that’s anything new. Oh, wait… maybe there. Just a little. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And I do notice some mild yellowing of your sclera – the whites of your eyes – and your skin. Based on what you’ve told me, and this brief exam, it’s starting to sound like a possible issue with your gallbladder or liver. However, we need to do some tests to confirm. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – that includes liver function tests – and a bilirubin level. We may also need to consider an ultrasound of your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Ultrasound sounds a bit scary, but if that's what you think is best, then yes, let’s do it. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What exactly will those tests show? I mean, what are we looking for? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to have some idea of what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The complete blood count will give us a general overview of your health. The comprehensive metabolic panel will specifically look at your liver function, things like enzymes and proteins. And the bilirubin level will tell us how much of that yellow pigment is in your blood. The ultrasound will give us a picture of your gallbladder and liver, to see if there are any stones, blockages, or other abnormalities. The connection to fava beans is highly suggestive of a condition called G6PD deficiency. It’s a genetic condition where you don’t have enough of an enzyme needed to protect your red blood cells. Fava beans and certain medications can trigger a breakdown of your red blood cells, leading to jaundice and other symptoms. These tests will help us confirm or rule that out. The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have them, I’ll call you to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, I would advise avoiding fava beans and any new medications without checking with me first. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot more sense, actually. G6PD deficiency… so it's something I was born with? And fava beans trigger it? That explains a lot. Avoiding them and new medications sounds… manageable. So, no fava beans, and I’ll call before taking anything new. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease, even though it’s a little scary to think about. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. What happens if it is G6PD deficiency? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. It’s good to know what you’re dealing with. Yes, G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition, so it’s something you’re born with. It’s more common in people of Mediterranean, African, and Asian descent. Generally, it's not serious in and of itself, as long as you avoid triggers. Most people with G6PD deficiency live normal, healthy lives. The biggest concern is hemolytic anemia – the breakdown of red blood cells – which can be triggered by things like fava beans, certain infections, and some medications. If we confirm the diagnosis, we’ll create a list of medications to avoid and advise you on other potential triggers. In most cases, all you need to do is avoid those triggers. In rare cases, if you experience a severe hemolytic anemia, you may need a blood transfusion. But that's uncommon. I'll call as soon as the results are in. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your patience. I feel much better knowing what's going on, and I’ll definitely avoid fava beans and check with you before taking any new medications. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. Glad I could help. If anything changes or you have any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day.
