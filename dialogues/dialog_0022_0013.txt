DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well… it’s my water. I’m havin’ trouble… gettin’ it all out, you see. It just… stays in there. It’s uncomfortable, mostly. Been happenin’ for a little while now, but it’s gettin’ worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder, and it’s causing you some discomfort. And you said this has been happening for a little while, but is worsening recently. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this problem?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six, seven months ago? Not too bad at first. Just a little bit left behind, you know? I figured it was just… old age, maybe. But like I said, it’s gotten harder to ignore now. It feels like… a fullness, even after I go.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven months ago, starting gradually and now becoming more noticeable. A feeling of fullness even after urinating. That’s helpful. Now, when you do urinate, would you describe the stream as strong and steady, or is it weak or interrupted?
PATIENT: It’s… not as strong as it used to be, that’s for sure. It starts okay, but it kinda… sputters out near the end. Not a powerful stream, like when I was younger. It takes me a little longer to finish, too. I have to… push a little bit sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a weaker stream that sputters at the end, taking longer to finish, and sometimes requiring you to strain. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in how often you need to urinate?
PATIENT: Well… I seem to be goin’ more often, yes. Especially at night. I wake up a couple of times now to go. Didn't used to do that. It’s… bothersome, bein’ woken up like that. Makes me tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency, particularly at night – waking you up. That’s nocturia. Now, have you experienced any pain or burning while you urinate, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burnin’. Not at all. And no blood, either. Just the trouble gettin’ it all out and havin' to go more often. It’s just… uncomfortable and inconvenient, mostly.
DOCTOR: Good. No pain or blood is good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but they gave me some pills for it. I take them every day. Other than that… nothin’ much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Lived a good life up in Alaska, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which you manage with medication. That's good you're taking care of that. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you ask, I don't rightly remember the name of the pill. It's a little white one, I think. Comes in a orange bottle. I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street. I just take it every mornin’ like the doctor told me. I’m sorry I don't know the name, Doc. I’m not good with rememberin’ things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. We can look it up in your records. Okay, it looks like you’re taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that’s it. That’s the one. And surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… I had a little somethin' on my knee a few years back, but it wasn't really a big surgery. Just a scope, they said. They didn’t cut me open or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an appendectomy in your childhood and a knee scope. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like prostate problems, kidney disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had some trouble with his… water, when he got older. Similar to what I’m havin’ now, I think. The doctor said somethin’ about his prostate bein’ big. And my mother, she had diabetes, but she didn’t take care of herself too well. Other than that, nothin' I can rightly recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of prostate problems in your father and diabetes in your mother. That's helpful information. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a bad habit. My wife… she tried it once or twice, but didn't like it. She was a good woman.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I used to have a beer or two with dinner sometimes, but I don't drink much anymore. Not since… well, not since my wife passed. Just doesn’t seem right, you know? A little glass of wine on special occasions, maybe, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. My condolences again for your loss. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much whatever's put in front of me. Always been a lucky man, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Hilber, that gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a prostate exam to see what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. It's just… the prostate exam, if you don’t mind me askin’, is that gonna be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It can be a little uncomfortable, Mr. Hilber, I won’t lie. It's a quick exam, and we can take it slowly. Just let me know if you're feeling any significant discomfort, and we can stop at any time. If you could lie down on your side with your knees bent, that would be great. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright. Take your time, Doc. No rush. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Mr. Hilber. Good, regular rhythm, no unusual sounds. Now I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Now, for the prostate exam. I’m going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. Again, this may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you’re feeling any discomfort. Okay… I’m feeling your prostate now. It’s… somewhat enlarged, and it feels a little firm. There are no obvious nodules or hard areas. Alright. That's all for the physical exam. I'll be right back to discuss the findings and next steps.
PATIENT: Alright. That wasn't… too bad, I suppose. A little awkward, but not painful like I feared. Thank you for bein' gentle, Doctor. I appreciate that. I’ll just lie here for a moment while you look at the results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I always try to be as gentle as possible. Okay, so based on your symptoms – difficulty starting and stopping urination, a weak stream, increased frequency, especially at night, and the physical exam finding of an enlarged prostate – it's highly likely you have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s a common condition in men as they get older, where the prostate gland enlarges, which can cause urinary symptoms like the ones you're experiencing. It’s important to rule out other causes, though, so I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection and a PSA blood test to screen for prostate cancer. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: BPH… that’s a mouthful. An enlarged prostate, you say? That explains a lot, I reckon. My father had somethin' similar. Yes, a urine test and a blood test sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for them.
DOCTOR: Great. For the urine test, I’ll give you a cup and ask you to provide a sample. It’s best to try and get a “midstream” sample – that means you start urinating, then collect the sample about halfway through. I’ll give you instructions on how to do that. The blood test is just a standard draw, you’ll need to be fasting for at least eight hours beforehand, so probably best to schedule that for tomorrow morning. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw the blood, and we can get the urine sample right now. We’ll review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss treatment options. In the meantime, try to avoid drinking a lot of fluids before bed to minimize the nighttime urination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. No fluids before bed, I can do that. And a midstream sample… I think I understand. Start, then catch it halfway through. Thank you for explainin’ it all so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. It’s good to know what we’re dealin’ with.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. Here are the instructions and the cup. Please let me know if you have any trouble collecting the sample, and I’ll have the lab technician come back when you’re ready. Once we have the sample and the blood work results, we can discuss a plan to manage your BPH. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, options could include lifestyle changes, medication, or, in some cases, more advanced procedures. We’ll go over everything in detail when we have the results. For now, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doc. You’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I’ll collect the sample now, and I’ll see you tomorrow for the blood work. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. Just take your time, and let me know if you need anything at all. I’ll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good rest of your day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too.
