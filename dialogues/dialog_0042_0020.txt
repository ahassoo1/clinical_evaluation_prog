DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Vodzak, yes? Nice to meet you too. I am here for… the talk on the computer? The one they said to do. My back… it is not so good these days, you see. But I do not know… where to begin.
DOCTOR: Yes, Vodzak is correct. And please, call me Gara. Ah, yes, I see you’ve completed some initial questionnaires online. That’s very helpful. It sounds like your back pain is the primary concern today. “Not so good” can mean a lot of different things, so let’s try to get a clearer picture. Could you tell me when the back pain started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… That is… a good question. It was… not sudden. It came slowly, over maybe… six months, I think? Before that, just a little ache after working. I work on cars, you see. Lots of bending and lifting. Now… it is almost always there. Even when I sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over about six months, and it’s become more constant, even with sitting. That helps. And you mentioned you work on cars, which involves bending and lifting – that’s important information. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Describe… yes. It is… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not like a… a stabbing. But heavy. Like something is… sitting on my lower back. Sometimes, when I bend… it feels like it will lock up. And after I have been working… it is worse, of course. A little bit of… burning too, sometimes. But mostly just… heavy and achey.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, heavy ache with some burning sensations, especially after work, and a feeling like it might lock up when bending. That gives me a better idea. Does the pain radiate, or stay localized to your lower back?
PATIENT: Radiate… you mean… go somewhere else? Sometimes, yes. Down my… legs a little. Not all the way to my feet, but in the back of my thighs. And… sometimes a little bit in my hips. It is not constant, this… going somewhere else. Just when it is very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain sometimes radiates down the backs of your thighs and into your hips, but not consistently. That’s good to know. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… Hmm. Right now… it is not so bad. Maybe… a four? It is always there, like I said. But I am sitting now, and not working. When I am working… it could be seven or eight, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four currently, and it can escalate to a seven or eight when you're working. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Better… yes. When I lie down, mostly. Flat on my back. And… if I take a hot bath, it helps a little. But not for long. And… if I do not move too much. Sitting still helps, but… I have a job, you see. I cannot just sit still all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat and a hot bath provide some temporary relief. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a bit more about your medical history. Have you ever had any back injuries, like a strain, sprain, or fracture?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Not that I remember, no. Nothing serious. I have… pulled muscles before, working. But nothing broken, I don't think. I went to the doctor a long time ago, for my shoulder… but nothing for my back. I am… a strong woman. I have always been careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of significant back injury. And you’ve had some shoulder issues in the past. Have you ever had any surgery?
PATIENT: Surgery… yes. My gallbladder, many years ago. And… a small thing on my knee, when I was young. A sports injury. But that was a very long time ago. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder surgery and a knee surgery, both in the past. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… high blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me a few years ago. I take… a little white pill for it. And… my cholesterol is a little high, he said. But that is all. I try to eat good. But… it is hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and slightly elevated cholesterol. You’re taking medication for the blood pressure, that’s good. And you’re trying to maintain a healthy diet. What medications are you currently taking, besides the white pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the white pill. And… sometimes, for my arthritis, a little brown one. When it is very cold, my fingers ache. But not always. And… sometimes, a little something for my sleep. But only when I really cannot sleep. It is a small blue one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a white pill for blood pressure, a small blue one for sleep occasionally, and a small brown one for arthritis when your fingers ache. We'll get the exact names of those medications in a moment. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. And I have tried many different medicines over the years. No problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do any of your close family members have back problems, arthritis, or any other medical conditions that run in the family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she had bad arthritis in her hands. Very bad. She could not… do much with them. And… my brother, he had problems with his back. He worked very hard, lifting heavy things. But that is all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had severe arthritis in her hands, and your brother had back problems related to heavy lifting. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I live alone, since my husband passed away. I try to stay busy. I work on cars, of course. I have a small garden. I like to read. I walk a little, when the weather is nice. I do not… go out much. But I am not lonely.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, enjoy gardening and reading, and try to stay active. I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. I do not smoke. Never have. And… I do not drink much alcohol. Maybe a small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But not every day. And… no, no drugs. Never. I am… a simple woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no drug use. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Ms. Benites. It gives me a very good understanding of your situation. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your back to assess your range of motion, posture, and any areas of tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want… to feel better, you see. It is getting hard to do my work.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Benites. And we'll do our best to figure out what's going on. If you could lie down on your stomach, please. I’ll start by checking your posture and range of motion. Okay, can you tell me if this is tender?
PATIENT: Yes… that is… a little tender. Right… there. And… when you push like that. It is not… sharp pain, but… a dull ache. Like a bruise, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And what about when I ask you to bend backwards?
PATIENT: Ooh… that is… difficult. It feels… tight. And… a little bit of pain on both sides of my back. Not too bad, but… I cannot go very far. It feels like it will… lock up.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And how about bending forwards?
PATIENT: That is… easier. But still… tight. And… a little bit of pain in my… thighs. Like a pulling sensation. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you lie on your back for me?
PATIENT: Yes… that is… better. Lying flat is good, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Benites, I'm going to test your reflexes now. Just relax your legs. Okay, the examination reveals tenderness in your lower back, particularly on both sides. Your range of motion is limited in both bending forwards and backwards. I also noted some tightness in the muscles along your spine. Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength appears to be within normal limits. I also noted some radiating pain down the backs of your thighs. Based on your history and the examination, it appears you have lower back pain, likely due to muscle strain or sprain, possibly exacerbated by your work. There is also the possibility of some nerve involvement causing the radiating pain in your thighs. However, to rule out any other potential causes, I would like to order some X-rays of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays… yes, that is alright. If it will help, then yes. I want to know… what is wrong. And I want to feel better. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just… hope it is not too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Benites, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. X-rays are a good first step to rule out any structural issues. The radiology department is just down the hall. They will let you know when they are ready. While you’re waiting, I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for a routine blood workup. This will help us assess for any inflammation or other underlying conditions. Once we have the results of the X-rays and blood work, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity and continue to use heat packs to manage your pain. I will also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the discomfort. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No… no allergies, like I said. Nothing. Just the white pill for my blood pressure, and sometimes the little blue and brown ones. But I do not take them every day. No, no allergies. Thank you, Doctor. That is… very helpful. I will avoid the lifting. It is hard, but… I will try.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies, and you will try to avoid lifting. Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the next steps. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to get you feeling better. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You have answered everything. Thank you, Doctor Vodzak. You are very kind. And… I appreciate your help. I hope… I hope it is not too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I understand your concern, and we'll do everything we can to determine the cause of your pain and get you back to your normal activities. We will take it one step at a time. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Take care now, and try to rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. . I will. Goodbye.
