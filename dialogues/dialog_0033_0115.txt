DOCTOR: Right. Annelle Durig, 77. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Dechêne, is it? Yes. Well, it’s… my skin. It's gotten quite yellow, you see. It started a little while ago, but now… well, it's hard to miss. My… my daughter brought me in. She was very insistent. I don’t remember everything, truthfully. Something about my… liver? Is that right? It's just… unsettling to look at, and I get tired so easily now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a note here about possible jaundice, flagged by your daughter. And fatigue. “Vague recollections” it states. Right. Well, jaundice can indicate a liver issue, as you’ve heard. But it can be other things as well. Before we jump to conclusions… can you describe this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Describe it… Well, it's not like a sudden collapse, you understand. It's… everything takes more effort. Getting out of the chair, even. And I sleep… oh, I sleep a good deal, but I don't feel rested. It's… like a weight, always there. And… is that all terribly important? I mean, I just want to know what’s wrong, if anything is. It’s rather frightening, all this talk of livers and… and yellow skin.
DOCTOR: It's important to be thorough, Mrs. Durig. Fatigue is significant, and it's good you’re noticing it. And yes, the yellowing of your skin – the jaundice – is concerning. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Symptoms… Let me think. My… appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don't really feel hungry, not like before. And… sometimes, my stomach feels a bit… upset. Not pain, exactly. More like… a dull ache. And… Oh! My urine. It’s… darker than usual. A sort of tea color, my daughter said. She notices these things. I… I mostly just want to lie down, if I'm honest. Does that help? I feel terribly confused, trying to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Dark urine, decreased appetite, abdominal discomfort… alright. And the jaundice, of course. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, nausea… No, I don't believe so. Not recently. I had a bit of… sickness, perhaps, a long time ago, but nothing in… well, I can’t recall precisely when. It wasn’t related to this, I don’t think. Vomiting… no. No, I haven’t been sick, not that I remember. My daughter would have noticed, she's very attentive. Is this… serious, Doctor? You’re making me quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Durig, it's difficult to say definitively at this point. These symptoms can be indicative of a number of issues, some more serious than others. We need to do some tests to get a clearer picture. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with hepatitis, or any other liver condition?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hepatitis… I… I honestly don't recall. I've had so many doctors over the years, and I don't keep very good track of these things. I think… I might have had something like that, a long time ago, when I was traveling. But it was so long ago, and I was feeling unwell for so many reasons then. I don’t remember specific diagnoses. I apologize. Would my daughter know? She handles all my paperwork. This is terribly frustrating, isn’t it? I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll make a note to verify with your daughter. Now, any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Surgeries… Yes. A gallbladder removal, many years ago. And… a hysterectomy, I believe. That was… quite a while ago. And… a small operation on my knee, after I fell. That’s all I can recall, truthfully. It was all so long ago, and I was under… under something. It makes remembering things difficult, you see. Is it important which hospital it was at? I really don’t keep track of these details.
DOCTOR: No, the specific hospital isn't critical at this moment. We'll focus on the current situation. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Allergies… Let me think… I think I had a reaction to penicillin once, a very long time ago. A rash, I believe. But I'm not entirely certain. It was so long ago, and I've taken so many medications over the years. It's difficult to recall. My daughter would know for certain, she keeps a very detailed list. I apologize for my… confusion. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see. This yellow skin is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll need to do a physical exam. And we'll draw some blood work to check your liver function and rule out other possibilities. Now, if you could just lie down on the examination table… We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Blood work… I suppose that’s necessary. I do wish… well, never mind. Just tell me if it will be painful, Doctor. I don’t have a very high tolerance for discomfort. And please, just be quick. I have… things to do. And I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It won’t be painful, Mrs. Durig. Just a little prick. And I assure you, we'll be as efficient as possible. Take a deep breath… and exhale… Good. Normal bowel sounds, but slightly diminished. Tenderness… a little discomfort in the right upper quadrant. Does that hurt?
PATIENT: Oh… Yes. A little. Not sharp, exactly. More like… a dull ache. Like a heavy weight pressing down. It’s… uncomfortable. Is that bad, Doctor? You're making me quite anxious again. I don’t like being touched, truthfully. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Just… just tell me what’s wrong. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed with the blood work. It will give us a clearer picture. I also want to check your sclera – the whites of your eyes – to assess the degree of jaundice. Significant jaundice present. Moderate yellowing of the sclera… and skin. Now, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We’ll also include a bilirubin level, to assess the severity of the jaundice. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… All those words… Bilirubin… is that bad? And what will the tests do? Will they hurt? I just… I just want to know if I’m going to be alright. And I really must get home. My daughter is expecting me. Are these tests going to take very long, Doctor? I don’t have much energy, you see. This is all very… overwhelming. Perhaps you could just tell me what you think is wrong? A simple explanation, please.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Durig, I understand your anxiety. It’s difficult to say definitively without the test results. These tests will help us determine the cause of your jaundice and fatigue. They involve a simple blood draw, which will cause minimal discomfort – a brief pinch. As for a simple explanation… your symptoms could be indicative of a liver issue, potentially related to a blockage of the bile ducts, or inflammation of the liver itself. However, it could also be other things. I don’t want to alarm you, but these symptoms require investigation. Now, I’m going to call the lab technician to draw the blood. Please remain seated. It will be a few hours before we have the results.
PATIENT: Oh… A blockage… Inflammation… That sounds… terrible. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? You’re not telling me something, are you? My daughter… she always worries. She said I shouldn’t ignore this, that it could be something… grave. Just… just be honest with me. Please. I’d rather know the worst, than be left in the dark. And… and I really must get home. I have… important things to do. .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Durig, I assure you, I'm being as straightforward as possible with the limited information I have. Saying it could be "grave" is not helpful speculation at this point. There are many possibilities, some more serious than others. We need the test results before we can draw any firm conclusions. Frankly, your vague recollections and insistence on leaving are hindering my ability to properly assess your condition. I've ordered the blood work. We'll review the results as soon as they're available. Until then, please try to remain calm. I'll call you with the results. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
