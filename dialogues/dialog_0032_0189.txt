DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. It’s about my… well, my bathroom habits, really. Not something a man likes to talk about, but here we are. I noticed some… red in the stool. A bit alarming, to be frank. Didn’t expect this at my age, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s certainly wise to get these things checked out, regardless of age. And you are right to be proactive. Could you describe this redness in more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail do you want? It’s red, doctor. Like… well, like blood. Not a little bit, mind you, but not a Niagara Falls either. More like… streaks. Streaks of red. And it happened… oh, I'd say two mornings now. After a perfectly good breakfast, I might add. Mostly oatmeal, these days. Gotta watch the cholesterol, you know.
DOCTOR: Streaks of red, you say. And occurring after breakfast, specifically with oatmeal. Hmm. Has this been accompanied by any changes in your bowel movements otherwise?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, now that you mention it… it’s been a bit… looser, maybe? Not solid, like it used to be. A bit more… urgent, if you catch my drift. Old man’s problems, I expect. Everything’s slowing down, naturally. Though I always thought my digestion was fairly robust, to be honest. Flew a lot of dodgy airline food back in the day, and never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Looser stools and a sense of urgency accompanying the redness. And a history of robust digestion despite previous dietary…challenges. Alright. And have you noticed any abdominal pain, cramping, or nausea along with this?
PATIENT: Nausea? No, not a bit. I haven’t been sick to my stomach. Abdominal pain… a little bit of rumbling, now and then. Nothing to write home about. Just the usual old man grumbles, I reckon. It’s more the…surprise of the red, really. That’s what got me worried. A man isn't meant to see that, you know? Not at my age.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s always unsettling to notice a change like that. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions currently being treated?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well, I had a bit of trouble with my prostate a few years back. Nothing serious, a bit of swelling, the usual. Had some treatment for it, a few years ago now. And my knees are shot, naturally. Flying took its toll. Other than that… fairly healthy for an old timer, I'd say. Never smoked, rarely drink. Oatmeal and sensible living, that’s my motto.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh, yes. Appendicitis when I was a young man, back when the world was a simpler place. And they took out some shrapnel after the war. A minor thing, really. A bit of metal, nothing to worry about. A souvenir, you could say. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. A few bumps and bruises from landing rough, but nothing that required a doctor’s attention.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my knees, now and then. Ibuprofen, when they’re particularly bothersome. Nothing regularly, mind you. Just when the weather’s bad. And a multi-vitamin, of course. Sensible living, remember? Can’t rely on oatmeal alone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had any history of colon cancer, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Family history… hmph. Now that’s a tricky one. My mother died young, influenza, they said. Never really knew much about her side of the family. My father was a fisherman, a stoic sort. Didn’t talk much about ailments. I had a sister, but we lost touch after the war. And no children, never married properly, you see. So… not really. I don't think so. No one ever mentioned anything. A rather solitary life, all told.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Given your symptoms – the redness in the stool, the looser bowel movements – and your age, it’s important we investigate this further. I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, and then I'll order some laboratory tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Tests, of course. Always tests. Fine, go ahead. Just… try to be quick about it, will you? I haven't got all day. And please, be gentle. An old man's bones aren’t what they used to be. A quick in and out, that’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. We'll start with listening to your abdomen and then a brief digital rectal exam. I’ll explain everything as I go along.
PATIENT: Digital… what now? Oh, very well. But don't expect any lengthy explanations. Just get it over with. And please, keep it professional, doctor. A man has his dignity, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. Everything will be conducted with the utmost professionalism and respect. This is standard procedure to assess the rectum and lower portion of the colon for any abnormalities. I am simply listening for any unusual sounds and checking for any tenderness. Now, if you could lie on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest…
PATIENT: Get on with it, then. The sooner this unpleasantness is over, the better. And no poking, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm just going to gently insert a gloved finger into the rectum now. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm noting some mild tenderness on the left side… and the stool is dark and guaiac-positive. Alright, that’s all for now. Please turn onto your back.
PATIENT: Guaiac… what? Is that good or bad? Don’t tell me it’s something terrible. I knew I shouldn’t have come here. All this poking and prodding for… guaiac-whatever. Just tell me straight, doctor. Is it cancer?
DOCTOR: Guaiac-positive simply means there is blood present in the stool, which we already observed. It doesn't confirm cancer, Mr. Rowbottom, but it is certainly a concerning finding that requires further investigation. Given your age, your symptoms, and the results of the examination, I believe the most prudent course of action is a colonoscopy. This will allow us to visualize the entire colon and identify the source of the bleeding. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to check for anemia.
PATIENT: Colonoscopy? A colonoscopy?! You want to put a… a camera up there? Absolutely not! That sounds… barbaric! I've heard stories, doctor. Stories about… unpleasant preparations and… discomfort. No, thank you. I’ll manage on my own. Perhaps it's just a touch of indigestion. A bit of oatmeal, maybe. I don’t need any cameras or… barbaric procedures. I'm a hardy old man, I tell you!
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your apprehension, but a colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing the cause of bleeding in the colon. It's a relatively safe procedure, and it allows us to rule out serious conditions like cancer, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease. The preparation is not pleasant, I won't deny that, but it is necessary to ensure a clear visualization. Avoiding a colonoscopy will not make the problem go away, and it could potentially delay a diagnosis that requires immediate treatment. I strongly recommend it, for your own health and peace of mind. We can discuss the preparation process in detail and make arrangements to ensure you are as comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: Hmph. Comfortable? You call emptying your bowels for a day “comfortable”? No, thank you. I’ve lived a long life, doctor. I’ve faced worse than a bit of red in the stool. I’d rather just… monitor it. Take some extra fiber. Eat more oatmeal. I’m not going to subject myself to a camera and… and all that poking around. It's undignified. Absolutely undignified. I’m leaving now. You can send me the bill.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I respect your decision, but I must strongly advise against refusing a colonoscopy. Ignoring this symptom could have serious consequences. While I understand your concerns about the preparation and the procedure itself, I can assure you that we take every precaution to ensure your comfort and dignity. However, if you are absolutely opposed to a colonoscopy, I can offer a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test. It’s a less invasive stool test that can detect the presence of blood. It's not as accurate as a colonoscopy, but it can be a starting point. If the FIT test is positive, I will strongly urge you to reconsider the colonoscopy. Regardless of your choice, I recommend increasing your fiber intake and maintaining a healthy diet. I will write a referral for the FIT test, and I urge you to schedule it as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A FIT test… hmph. That sounds… tolerable. Less poking around, you say? Very well. Write your referral. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And if it comes back negative, that's it. No cameras. No… barbaric procedures. I'm an old man, doctor. I deserve a bit of peace and quiet in my final years. Now, where's that bill?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. I will write a detailed note on the referral explaining your preferences. The test can be done at any lab, and the results will be sent to my office. If the results are positive, my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss further options. Here is the bill. I strongly encourage you to schedule the test as soon as possible. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Rowbottom.
