DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’d like to talk about losing some weight. It’s… becoming a bit of a struggle, you see. I was hoping maybe there’s something… a medication perhaps… that could help. It’s harder now than it used to be, and I’d like to get back to feeling a little more myself.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weight loss can be…multifaceted. And you say it’s harder now than it used to be?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Much harder. I used to be very active, always working with my hands… building things. But after my wife… well, it’s just not the same. I don’t have the same… drive. And it’s affected my appetite, but not in a good way, if you understand. I eat when I’m not hungry, and I don't move around as much. It’s a bad cycle. I used to weigh, oh, maybe 70 kilos, and now… well, I don't even want to look.
DOCTOR: 80 kilos… yes, I see that. And you mentioned a loss of drive after your wife passed. That's…understandable. It's important to acknowledge those things. So, just to clarify, are you saying you're eating more than usual, even when you aren’t feeling hungry, and experiencing a decreased level of activity?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's right. Exactly. It's not like I'm having huge meals, you understand. It’s more… snacking. Comfort eating, I suppose. And I used to walk every day, go to the market, work in the garden… now I just… sit. I worry about it, you see. It’s not just the weight, it’s… feeling useless. I want to get back to my work, but I just don’t have the energy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Changes in my sleep…? Let me think. Well, I used to sleep like a rock, Doctor. Now… I wake up a lot. Not every night, but often. I lie awake thinking… about things. It’s not a bad sleep, just… restless. I get up sometimes, have a little water, and then try to go back to sleep. It's not a full-blown insomnia or anything, but it's not restful like it used to be. It feels… lighter when I do get some sleep.
DOCTOR: And any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my knees ache a little more than they used to, Doctor. Probably just old age, you know? And I get a little winded when I climb the stairs. Nothing serious, I don't think. I used to be able to climb anything. Just little things, really. I haven’t been to see a doctor regularly since… well, since my wife was sick. I try to take care of myself, but it's hard when you're alone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Osumi. Before we discuss potential medications, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just standard things – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and a quick look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I understand. It's good to get it checked, you know? I haven't had a proper check-up in… too long. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: If you could just sit up on the table for me, please. I’ll start with your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. My wife always said I was a good patient. She was a nurse, you see. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: A little crepitus on both knees, as you might expect, but no significant swelling or acute tenderness. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no sharp pain with movement. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78 and regular. Everything seems… within normal limits, for your age and history. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can monitor that. Now, let’s talk about the weight and your energy levels. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor, that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to know it’s not something serious. I suppose getting older comes with a few aches and pains, doesn’t it? The blood pressure… is that something to be worried about? I try to watch my salt intake, but it's hard. My wife used to make everything… perfect. Now, it's just… easier to grab something quick.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t had any allergies. And you’re right, some aches and pains are part of getting older. The blood pressure is slightly elevated, and something we should address. It's not an immediate emergency, but uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to problems down the line. We can start with some lifestyle modifications – a low-sodium diet, regular exercise when you feel up to it, and I can discuss a medication if needed. But before we get to medication, Mr. Osumi, I'm concerned about your loss of appetite and energy, especially following your wife's passing. It’s important to rule out other causes for these symptoms. We should check some blood work, just to be sure everything is okay. Basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, thyroid function… and a vitamin D level. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If you think it's best, then I trust your judgment. My wife always said you have to get everything checked properly. I'd be happy to get the blood work done. Whatever it takes to get back to feeling like myself again. It’s just… hard. But if you think it will help, then yes, please. When can we do it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can get those labs drawn today at the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition. It’s just a standard blood draw, should take about 15-20 minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate a little more activity into your daily routine, even if it’s just a short walk each day. And we can talk about strategies for a healthier diet. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Osumi?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. And you've put my mind at ease, honestly. Getting the blood work done sounds like a good plan. Thank you. I just… want to feel like myself again, you know? I appreciate you listening. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Should I fast or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Osumi. It's my job. And yes, for the most accurate results, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is okay. Can you manage that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Eight hours. I can do that. I'll make sure of it. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your time, and your kindness. I'll see you when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Osumi. It was a pleasure meeting you. Yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in. The receptionist will take care of that for you. Just let her know you saw me today, and we’ll get something scheduled. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that's everything. Thank you again for your time and patience. I'll see you soon, then. Have a good day, Doctor Murtic.
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Osumi. And remember, small steps. Take care of yourself. The receptionist is right over there; she’ll get you squared away with the lab requisition. .
