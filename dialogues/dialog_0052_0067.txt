DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh, Ruocco, yes. It’s… it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. Been happening for… a little while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Everything's a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain with deep breaths can be concerning. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s… sharp. Not always, but sometimes. Feels like… right here. Mostly when I really try to fill my lungs, you know? Like when I'm lifting something heavy. Or… walking up a hill, maybe. It doesn't happen all the time though. It comes and goes. Is that… helpful? I don't remember doing anything to cause it.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It’s good to know it’s sharp and related to deep breathing or exertion. And the fact that it comes and goes is important. Could you describe the location of the pain a little more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely… oh dear. It's… in my chest, like I said. But… is it more to the left? Or the right? It's hard to tell. It feels… all over. Maybe a little more on this side. But I could be wrong. Old age, you know. Things get mixed up.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact location. Focusing on the left side is a good starting point. Does the pain radiate anywhere – does it travel to your shoulder, back, neck, or arm?
PATIENT: Radiate… does it… go anywhere else? Sometimes… my shoulder feels a little tight. On this side, again. Not always with the pain, though. Just… sometimes tight. And… maybe a little in my back, but that could just be my old back. It’s always bothering me. Honestly, it’s hard to tell what’s connected to what anymore.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Ruocco. It is often difficult to sort through multiple aches and pains. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk a little more about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as heart problems, lung disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… That's a long time ago. I… I don't really remember. I was a construction manager for a long time, lots of lifting and bending. I think I had something with my back, years ago. And… something with my shoulder, maybe? I saw doctors, of course, but… it was a long time ago. I don’t recall the names of things. I'm sorry. It's just… faded. I never thought much of it then. Things happen when you work hard.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. It’s common for details to become less clear over time. We can work with what you do remember. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was young. That’s the only thing I’m sure of. And… maybe something with my knee? A long time ago. A sports injury, I think. But it wasn't anything major. Nothing recent. I’ve mostly just… toughed things out. Is that helpful? I'm really not good with remembering these things. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. And don't apologize – it's perfectly understandable. Now, regarding your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, lung problems, cancer, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My wife… she had some problems with her stomach, later in life. But that was… years ago. And… my father, he worked hard like me, construction. I think he had some trouble breathing when he got older, but I don't really know what it was. Nobody really talked about these things back then. It wasn't like it is today. So, I'm not really sure. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… a lot of years gone by.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to recall family medical history. Let's move on to some current things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. And I haven't taken much medicine, really. A little for headaches, maybe. But nothing regularly. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Not much bothers me. Except this pain. That's new.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy on my own. Just… eat good food, get a little exercise when I can. But this pain… it's getting harder to ignore. I wish I knew what was causing it. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, smoking… No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she used to smoke a little, but I always told her to quit. She did eventually. Bad habit, you know. A very bad habit. I always preferred fresh air. That’s why I liked working outdoors.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes. A little wine on special occasions. But not much, really. I never was much of a drinker. A glass here and there, that’s all. Haven’t had anything in… a long time, actually. Not since… well, not since my wife passed. It just didn’t seem right.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your chest for tenderness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination? Well… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but… I want to figure out what’s going on. Just… be gentle, please. And… try to be quick. It makes me a little nervous, you know? Old man’s bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. And now your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. I'm hearing a faint murmur with your heart. It’s not necessarily concerning, but it's something we should keep an eye on. And your breath sounds are a little diminished on the lower left side. Do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Tenderness…? Ooh, yes. A little. Right… there. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It's been there for… well, since this pain started, I guess. Is that bad? It’s just… everything hurts a little these days. It’s hard to tell what’s important.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know where the tenderness is located. There doesn’t seem to be any swelling or masses, which is good. Given your history of pain with deep breaths, the tenderness on your chest, the diminished breath sounds, and the murmur, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be musculoskeletal pain – pain in your chest wall – or it could be something affecting your lungs or heart. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. This will help us see if there’s anything going on in your lungs, like pneumonia or fluid buildup. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray…? Oh dear. Is it serious? I don't like being exposed to… whatever those rays are. I’ve always been a bit nervous about that. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. If it will help figure out what's wrong, then I suppose I should do it. But… will it take long? And… will it hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low, and the benefits of finding out what’s causing your pain far outweigh the risks. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. You’ll simply stand or sit in front of the machine, and a technician will take a picture of your chest. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. I’ll write the order for the X-ray now. The technician will call you when they're ready for you. After we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… Emergency room… yes. I remember that. My wife… she went to the emergency room a few times. A very scary place. But… yes. If the pain gets worse, I’ll go. An X-ray… and then we'll see. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you trying to figure out what's wrong. It’s just… getting old is hard. Everything aches, and nothing works like it used to. I just want to be comfortable again. I suppose… I’ll go wait for the technician then. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. Please don't hesitate to let the staff know if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting. Take care, and I’ll see you after the X-ray.
