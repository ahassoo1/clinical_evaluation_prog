DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts. Like, in my… breasts. It’s strange, I know.
DOCTOR: Breast pain in a male… yes, that is unusual. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not… sharp. More like… a dull ache? Sometimes it feels like… fullness? I don't know if that makes sense. It’s mostly on this side. <points to left chest> Not always there, though. Comes and goes.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, with a sensation of fullness… and it's localized to the left side, intermittent. Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… a month? I think so. It started small, and I just thought it was… muscle pain from work, you know? I do a lot of climbing on roofs. But it hasn’t gone away. It’s… bothering me more now.
DOCTOR: A month of intermittent left-sided chest discomfort… climbing on roofs. Do you notice if it's worse after exertion, or at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s worse after work. Like, when I come home, I feel it more. And sometimes when I lie down. Not every time, but… yeah. When I’m resting, it feels… heavier, maybe? Does that make sense? I don't know what “exertion” means. Is that like… hard work?
DOCTOR: Yes, exertion means hard work. That’s a perfectly good way to put it. So, it’s aggravated by physical activity and when lying down. And you said it started gradually. Any associated symptoms?
PATIENT: Associated… symptoms? Like… other things that happen with it? Uh… no, not really. No fever, no… lumps that I can feel. Nothing like that. Just the pain. Sometimes… I feel a little tired, but I always feel tired after work, so I don't know if that’s related. My wife hasn't noticed anything different.
DOCTOR: No fever, no palpable masses, no change noticed by your wife. Fatigue, but attributed to work. Alright. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. I try to stay healthy. I eat okay, I guess. I haven’t had any… big sicknesses or anything. No broken bones, no… I don’t know. Nothing I remember. <pauses> Does high blood pressure count? My father had that.
DOCTOR: Family history of hypertension is relevant. We’ll get to that. Let’s stick with your medical history for now. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. I… I don’t like hospitals. I try to avoid them. My wife says I’m stubborn. <chuckles quietly> She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. And what about medications?
PATIENT: No medications. I don't take anything. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, but that's it. Like, ibuprofen or something. Nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Good. No regular medications. And allergies?
PATIENT: Uh… no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. I haven't had a reaction to anything… ever. My wife tries new foods all the time. I think she likes to test me. <laughs softly>
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family. Any significant medical problems in your family besides your father’s hypertension?
PATIENT: Um… my mother… she had diabetes, I think. And… my brother, he had… something with his heart, a long time ago. He’s okay now, I think. He lives far away, so I don’t hear from him much. <pauses> Does that help? I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Details unknown is… unhelpful, but noted. Alright. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife doesn’t like it. She says it smells bad and it’s bad for you. <shrugs> She’s right, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I drink sometimes. With dinner. Maybe a beer or a glass of wine. Not every night. Just… when we’re celebrating something, or if we have friends over. I don’t drink a lot. My wife drinks more than me. <chuckles> She likes her wine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your chest. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I need to get back to work. But I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the table. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are… regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yeah… that’s… a little sore. Right there. <points to the left side of his chest, near the nipple> Not a lot, but… yeah. It feels… different when you press on it. Like a dull ache. It's not sharp, just… uncomfortable. <grimaces slightly>
DOCTOR: I don’t feel any obvious masses, but there is some mild tenderness to palpation in the left breast area. Mild tenderness to palpation, left breast. No palpable masses. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on. It could be musculoskeletal pain, related to your work. However, because of the location and your age, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a complete blood count and metabolic panel. We'll also check your cardiac enzymes just to be safe.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… serious. Cardiac enzymes? Is something wrong with my heart? I don’t feel any chest pain, just the… ache in my breast. And blood work… I don’t like needles. <looks worried> How long will it take to get the results? And how much will all this cost? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Cardiac enzymes are a precaution, Mr. Bulaong. It’s always best to rule out serious conditions first, even if you’re not experiencing classic heart attack symptoms. The ache in your breast is unusual for a man, and we need to investigate. As for the blood work, it will be quick. And regarding the cost… I’m aware you don’t have insurance. Let me see what the clinic's financial assistance options are. We can discuss a payment plan, and I'll see if we can minimize the costs where possible. The X-ray and blood work should take about 24-48 hours to come back. I'll have the results sent directly to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – especially severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating – go to the nearest emergency room immediately, do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… 24-48 hours. That’s… good, I guess. And a payment plan would be great. I really appreciate that, Doctor. <pauses> Emergency room… okay, I understand. No severe chest pain… just the ache. <looks worried again> So, you think it could be something serious? My wife is going to worry so much if I tell her. She’s always telling me to go to the doctor. <sighs> This is… stressful. Is there anything I should do right now? Like, avoid work? Or… anything?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be stressed, Mr. Bulaong. We're not jumping to conclusions, but we need to be thorough. I recommend avoiding strenuous activity – particularly climbing on roofs – until we have the results back. It's better to be safe. And while we investigate, avoid any lifting of heavy objects. It's not necessarily a restriction, just a precaution. I’ll write a note for your employer explaining you need to temporarily avoid strenuous activity for medical evaluation. I wouldn't say avoid work altogether, if your job allows for lighter tasks. Just avoid anything that exacerbates the discomfort. We’ll know more once we have the results. Here's the note for your employer. I’ll also give you a list of signs and symptoms to watch for, just in case. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment. Are there any other questions I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: Okay… I understand. No heavy lifting, no climbing… and I’ll show this note to my boss. Thank you, Doctor. <takes the note and symptom list> That makes me feel a little better. <pauses> No, I think that’s all for now. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you for listening and for helping me. I appreciate it a lot. I’ll see you in a few days. <stands up slowly>
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll see you in a few days. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Take care, and try not to worry too much.
