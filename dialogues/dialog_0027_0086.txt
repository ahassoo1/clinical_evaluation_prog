DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if that’s alright. I’m really trying to get through a busy day, so… the quicker we can go over them, the better.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I understand. Busy days…right. Let me pull up your results here…Kovtun…yes. Okay. So, I see you had some bloodwork done on… July 26th, was it?
PATIENT: Yep, July 26th. That sounds right. Is everything…okay? You can just tell me straight, I don’t need a long explanation or anything.
DOCTOR: Well… the results did show a slightly elevated white blood cell count. And your iron levels are a bit low. It’s…not immediately alarming, but it does warrant some further discussion. I apologize, I'm having a little trouble recalling the specifics right away... Do you feel tired often?
PATIENT: Tired? Yeah, constantly. But honestly, who isn’t these days? I work a lot with shipping schedules, it’s… stressful trying to keep everything moving. Does that have something to do with it? The iron thing, I mean.
DOCTOR: It could be related to stress, certainly. Stress can affect a lot of things. And yes, low iron can absolutely cause fatigue. But we need to figure out why your iron is low. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really. Maybe a little…shorter of breath than usual when I’m walking uphill, but I figured that was just…being out of shape. I haven’t been to the gym in ages. Is the white blood cell thing serious? That sounds scary.
DOCTOR: It can be concerning, but again, not necessarily a cause for panic. Elevated white blood cells can indicate a lot of things – infection, inflammation… even stress. To get a better picture, could you tell me about any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses? Let me think… I had a really bad cold back in…April, I think? Knocked me out for a week, but I haven’t been sick since. Just the usual seasonal allergies. I don't think I've had anything major, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any unusual bleeding recently?
PATIENT: Unusual bleeding? No, not that I can think of. Just…normal stuff. I don't… I'm not sure what you mean by unusual. Is that a symptom of…the low iron? Because I really don’t have time for anything serious right now.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. It can be a symptom. Sometimes low iron presents with fatigue and…well, I apologize, I’m having trouble focusing. I’m going to ask some general questions, just to be thorough. Do you have any family history of anemia or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Anemia… my grandmother on my mother’s side… she was always tired. I think she had something like that. She was always going to the doctor. That’s about all I know. And no, no bleeding disorders as far as I’m aware. Seriously, is this going to take much longer? I have a shipment leaving at four.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a few more quick things. Any changes in your diet lately?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat…pretty much the same stuff every day. Lots of fish, some vegetables… I try to eat healthy, but honestly, there’s not a lot of time for cooking. Takeout a lot. Does that matter? Is that why my iron’s low?
DOCTOR: It could contribute, yes. A diet lacking in iron-rich foods can certainly cause that. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry it up, please. I'm trying to stay on schedule here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your skin looks…a little pale, but that's not definitive. I’m also noting some mild conjunctival pallor. It's subtle. Do you experience dizziness or headaches often?
PATIENT: Dizziness, sometimes. When I stand up too fast, maybe? And headaches… yeah, I get those. Stress headaches, I think. Everyone gets those, right? I really don’t see how this is going to help me figure out why my shipment is delayed, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam… it’s most likely iron deficiency anemia. The fatigue, pallor, and occasional dizziness fit. We’ll need to confirm this with further blood tests to rule out other causes. I’m going to order a complete blood count with differential, iron studies, and a reticulocyte count.
PATIENT: Okay. So…more bloodwork. Great. And how long will that take? I'm really trying to avoid another trip back here if I can. Can’t you just give me something for the iron? A pill or something?
DOCTOR: We can definitely start you on an iron supplement while we wait for the results. Ferrous sulfate, 325mg, once daily with vitamin C to help with absorption. I’ll write you a prescription for that. But we need to find out the underlying cause of the deficiency. It could be a dietary issue, but it’s important to rule out more serious things, like internal bleeding. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Okay, iron pills…fine. As long as they don’t make me sick. And I can get this prescription filled at the pharmacy on Main Street? I really don’t have time to go all over town.
DOCTOR: Yes, any pharmacy should be able to fill it. And to be safe, I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to re-check your bloodwork and see how the supplement is working. If you experience any stomach upset or constipation with the iron pills, let me know. And if you notice any blood in your stool, please seek immediate medical attention. I’m also giving you a handout with information about iron-rich foods. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Look, thanks for getting me something quick. I really appreciate it. I need to get going now. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re very welcome, Kahrin. Get some rest, and try to eat some spinach. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and hopefully we can get this sorted out quickly. .
