DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this…patch on my skin. It’s just not right. It’s been…well, I’d say about three weeks now, maybe a little longer. I noticed it after our trip to the coast, but I doubt it's related. People get things, don’t they?
DOCTOR: “People get things,” yes, they do. Three weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Exactly. Three weeks, give or take. It hasn’t gotten bigger, thankfully. It’s just…different. A sort of…mottled coloring. Not painful, not itchy, just…noticeable. And I do pay attention to these things, you understand. It’s on my left forearm, just below the elbow. You’ll see. It's quite…unflattering.
DOCTOR: Right. Mottled coloring, not painful or itchy. And you’re concerned about its appearance. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, please do. And honestly, Doctor, don’t bother with telling me it’s “nothing to worry about.” I’ve heard that before. I just want to know what it is. And if it’s something I should be…attentive to. It’s just…disconcerting, you know? I keep a very tidy life, and this…doesn't fit.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. It is…irregular. No significant tenderness to palpation. The texture is…slightly raised, but not dramatically so. Okay. Has anything like this appeared before?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always had very good skin, actually. My grandmother swore by cold cream, and I’ve kept up with it. This is…new. And frankly, a bit upsetting. I haven't changed anything in my routine, no new soaps, no new lotions, nothing. Are you certain it’s not some sort of…fungus? I read about those. Horrible things.
DOCTOR: Fungal infections are rarely this…subtle, Ms. Bartock. Though, of course, we can’t rule anything out without further investigation. Do you recall any insect bites in the area around the time you noticed this?
PATIENT: Insect bites? Goodness, no. We were at the coast, yes, but I always use repellent. A very good one, imported from France, actually. I’m very careful about those things. Mosquitoes are dreadful carriers, you know. No, I'm quite certain it wasn't a bite. Honestly, Doctor, I think it’s just…appeared. It's the only logical explanation. Perhaps it’s a reaction to the sun, even with repellent? Although I was very diligent.
DOCTOR: Diligent or not, the sun can cause unusual reactions. However, this presentation isn’t typical for a simple sunburn. Let's go through some other questions. Any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Perfectly stable, thank you. I eat a very sensible diet, I get plenty of sleep, I don’t smoke, I rarely drink…a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. I maintain a very consistent lifestyle. It’s really quite…remarkable, actually. I pride myself on that. So, no, nothing has changed. It's baffling. And honestly, a little concerning. It’s just…sitting there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of skin conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had…something. I believe it was eczema, but she didn’t talk about it much. She was a very private woman. My father…nothing that I recall. He was a farmer, very outdoorsy, but he had remarkably tough skin. Didn't seem to bother him much. I doubt it's related, though. My complexion is quite different from my mother’s, much fairer. I always burn easily. So, probably not. Though, you never know, do you?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, to be thorough, I think we should take a closer look. I’m going to use a dermatoscope to get a better view of the pigmentation. It won't hurt, just a little cool gel. And then, I think a small biopsy would be prudent, just to rule out anything concerning. It’s a simple procedure.
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh. Goodness. Is that really necessary? It sounds…dramatic. I mean, it's just a patch, isn't it? Are you certain it's not something…less invasive? I've always been rather squeamish, you see. And I have a luncheon appointment next week…a rather important one. Would that…interfere? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. Perhaps it is just a reaction to the sun, after all?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I understand your apprehension, but a small biopsy is the most responsible course of action. It allows us to get a definitive diagnosis and ensure it's nothing serious. It’s a very small procedure, a local anesthetic is used, and the disruption is minimal. As for your luncheon, it shouldn't interfere significantly, though a small bandage will be present. Frankly, I find your dismissal of a potentially important medical investigation rather…unsettling. We are being proactive here. Do you consent to the biopsy?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, when you put it that way… Honestly, I just don’t like unnecessary fuss. But proactive…yes, I suppose that’s sensible. Fine. Yes, alright. Do what you have to do. But please be gentle. And I expect a very thorough explanation afterwards. What exactly will you be looking for? And how long will it take? And will it…scar? I really must be presentable for this luncheon. It's with the garden club president. You understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed with the biopsy. It will take approximately 20 minutes, including the local anesthetic and the sample collection. I will be looking for atypical cells, which could indicate a more serious skin condition, though I assure you, that is not what I expect. As for scarring, there will likely be a small, faint mark, but it will fade over time. We'll ensure proper wound care to minimize any visible trace. Now, if you could just relax and let me prepare the area…
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Very well. Just…please be quick about it. And do tell me if it will sting. I do have a rather low tolerance for discomfort, you see. And perhaps you could distract me? Tell me about your garden? Do you grow roses? I have a particularly lovely hybrid tea variety... .
DOCTOR: Yes, I grow a few roses, though I confess, I'm more of a vegetable gardener. Now, this may feel like a slight pinch… just a pinch. It’s important to remain still.
