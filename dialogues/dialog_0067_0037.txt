DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. It started a few days ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, wheezing and shortness of breath. And you said it started a few days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days. Maybe three? I not so good at remembering the dates, you see. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it is not pleasant. Like a small whistle in my chest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Three days is helpful enough. And you describe it as a whistling sound in your chest when it’s happening. Does anything seem to trigger it – like exercise, being in cold air, or perhaps dust or smells?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. I have not noticed cold air. I do not do much exercise these days, so not that either. Maybe… dust? My daughter came to visit, and she was cleaning a lot. Lots of moving things around. Perhaps that made it worse? I do not know for sure. It just… started after she left.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to have started around the time your daughter was visiting and doing some cleaning. That’s a useful piece of information. Now, besides the wheezing and shortness of breath, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel… tired, a little. But I am old, Doctor! So, maybe that is just old age. No cough, no fever, no chest pain. Just… the whistling and the trouble breathing. It worries me a little, you see. It is not normal for me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Feeling tired along with this new breathing difficulty is worth noting. Let’s do a quick examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. If you think it will help, please do. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you see. It is a little scary when you cannot breathe properly.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit up here for me, that would be great. Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… and out. Hmm. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, as you described. It's more prominent on both sides, but a little worse on the right. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Your heart rate is 88 and regular, and your blood pressure is 130/80. I'm also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you normally have swelling in your ankles, Margret?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. My ankles are usually… thin. I did not even notice the swelling until you said something. I wear slippers most of the time, so maybe I just never looked. But no, normally they are not swollen like that. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you haven't noticed it before, and we're checking it now. It could be related to the breathing difficulties, or it could be something separate. Given your symptoms – the wheezing, shortness of breath, and now the ankle swelling – it sounds like you might be experiencing some early signs of heart failure or a flare-up of COPD, although we need to do some further testing to confirm. Do you have any history of heart problems or lung disease, Margret?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never been told I have problems with my heart. And my lungs… I smoked a few cigarettes when I was young, a very long time ago, but I stopped when I got married. The doctor then told me it was best. He never said anything about lung disease. I have always been quite healthy, actually. Until now, you see. This is all very new to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior history of heart or lung problems, and you quit smoking many years ago. That’s helpful information. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to order a few tests. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and a blood test to check your heart function and rule out any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what is happening, so yes, please do the tests. When will I get the results? And… will they be painful? I do not like needles very much.
DOCTOR: They shouldn't be painful, Margret. The blood draw is quick, and the phlebotomist is very good. You might feel a little pinch, but it's usually over before you know it. As for the results, the X-ray should be available within a few hours, and the blood test results usually take a day or two. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're back. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. I’m also going to recommend you limit your salt intake and keep track of any swelling in your ankles. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. An inhaler… I have seen those on television. Limiting salt… that should be easy. I do not eat much salt anyway. And I will watch my ankles, very carefully. Will the nurse tell me what the results mean, or will I have to come back to see you? I worry about understanding everything, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Margret. The nurse can explain the basics of the results to you, but I definitely want to discuss them with you in person. I’ll want to review the X-ray images myself, and we can talk about the best course of action together. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a few days, once the results are back. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you have explained everything very clearly. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not making me feel silly about worrying. I feel a little better already, just knowing what might be happening. I will watch my ankles, and I will take the inhaler. And I will wait for the nurse to call. Thank you again.
