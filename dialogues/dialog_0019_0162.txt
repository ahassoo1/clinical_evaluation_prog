DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really do small talk. Just...bloating, alright? It’s been happening. Makes me feel…full. Uncomfortable. Can we just get to figuring out what’s wrong so I can go?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kristofik. Bloating it is. No problem at all. We’ll get right to it. Can you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Ugh, when did it start? Honestly…I don’t really remember. A while ago. Maybe…last few months? It comes and goes. Look, it's not like it’s a crisis, you know? It just…is. I eat, and then I feel puffy. Simple as that. I don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a few months” of intermittent bloating. That’s helpful to know. And you say it happens after you eat?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. Not every time. Sometimes it just...happens. And it’s not like I'm eating anything crazy. Regular food. I don’t know…burgers, pasta, you know. Normal stuff. It's just…annoying. Is that what you need to know? Because frankly, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good information, Mr. Kristofik. And I understand your time is valuable. We’ll try to be efficient. When it happens, would you say it’s a specific type of food that triggers it, or does it seem random?
PATIENT: Random, I think. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to what I eat enough to even notice a pattern. I eat when I’m hungry. I’m a pile driver operator, alright? I need fuel. I don’t have time to analyze every bite. Look, is it something serious? Because if it's not, I really need to get going. My crew is waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, bloating itself isn't always serious, but it's good you’re getting it checked out. Besides the fullness, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don't know... I get tired, obviously. It’s a hard job. Does that count? I haven’t been…sick or anything. No pain. Just…full. And uncomfortable. It doesn't…stop me from doing things, alright? I’m still working. Still doing my job. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No pain or illness is helpful. When you say tired, is this just general tiredness from work, or something…different?
PATIENT: Different. Yeah, different. It’s like…dragging. I sleep, but I don't feel rested. It’s hard to explain. I’m not a doctor, alright? I just know how I feel. It’s been worse lately, maybe. Along with…the puffiness. Look, I’m starting to get a headache just talking about this. Can we just run some tests or something? Get this over with?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kristofik. We can certainly run some tests. Let me pull up your chart... Ah, here we are. You’ve had a check-up with Dr. Albright last year. No major concerns noted then. Just to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, listen to your abdomen, and then order some blood work. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…make it quick, alright? I have a schedule to keep. Don’t want my whole crew waiting around because I’m here describing how I feel. Let's just get it done. I guess. Blood work…fine. Just…no needles if possible. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. We’ll do our best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. And we can discuss options for the blood work if you’re particularly uncomfortable with needles – sometimes we can draw less blood at a time, or try different techniques. But first, let’s just listen to your abdomen. If you could lie down on the table, that would be great.
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. Fine. Just… don’t poke around too much. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities, and listen for any unusual sounds. This won’t take long. Breathe normally. Alright. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any obvious masses or tenderness. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, but they are a little… sluggish. Not overly concerning, but worth noting. It could be related to the fullness you’re experiencing. Now, let's talk about those blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and a few other things to get a better picture of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to latex or any issues with blood draws in the past?
PATIENT: Latex? No. Blood draws…I don’t like them. Makes me nervous. I get shaky. That’s it. No allergies. Just… don’t like needles. Don’t make me sit there for hours, alright? I have things to do. Is it going to take long? Can I at least have a coffee afterwards? I need caffeine. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no latex allergies, just needle anxiety. That’s perfectly understandable. We’ll do our best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I'll tell the phlebotomist to be extra gentle. It shouldn't take long, maybe 10-15 minutes for the blood work itself. And yes, absolutely, you can have a coffee afterwards. There’s a coffee shop just down the street, or we have some here in the clinic. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, liver function tests, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. Those should give us a good starting point. While we're waiting for the lab results, I’d like you to keep a food diary for a few days, just to see if we can identify any patterns with your bloating. Write down everything you eat and drink, and note when your symptoms occur. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A food diary? Seriously? Look, I barely have time to eat, let alone write down everything I consume. It's ridiculous. But… fine. I’ll try. But no promises. I’m a pile driver operator, remember? I eat when I can. Don't expect a detailed log. Just… the basics. Alright? Can we get this over with, then? The blood work? I need to get back to work. My crew is probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, "the basics" is perfectly fine, Mr. Kristofik. Just enough to give us a starting point. We won't hold you to a strict diet or meticulous logging. Nurse Davies, could you please draw Mr. Kristofik’s blood?
PATIENT: Just…make sure she’s gentle. And quick. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Nurse Davies, please be gentle with Mr. Kristofik, he's a bit anxious about needles. And let me know if you encounter any difficulties.
PATIENT: .
