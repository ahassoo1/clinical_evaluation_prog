DOCTOR: Good morning, Lucia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, I keep… belching. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not all the time, but… a lot. It’s kinda embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be embarrassing, but you’ve come to the right place, and we'll figure out what's going on. “A little while now” – could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe, like, two months? I don’t really keep track of days, sorry. It started after… after I ate a lot of beans at a party. But it hasn’t stopped since, even though I don’t eat beans every day now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it began about two months ago, following a meal with a high bean content, and continues despite reducing your bean intake. Has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Let me think… Um… I started a new job, actually. At the factory. It’s… more standing than my last job. And… it's a little bit stressful, learning everything. But I like it, mostly. Does… does stress make you belch more? I don't know if that's a thing.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Lucia. Stress can absolutely contribute to digestive issues, including increased belching. Standing more could also play a role. Before we go further, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Sometimes my stomach feels a little… full? Even when I haven’t eaten much. And… a little bit of gas, of course, with all the belching. But nothing else, really. No pain, no… throwing up, nothing like that. Just… full and bubbly, I guess. Is that weird to say?
DOCTOR: No, that's not weird at all. “Full and bubbly” is a very helpful description. And no pain or nausea is good. Let’s talk about your diet a bit more generally. Besides the beans, what does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, breakfast is usually just coffee and a little bit of toast. Sometimes an egg if I have time. Lunch, I usually pack something… a sandwich, maybe some fruit. Not always healthy, I admit. And dinner… depends. Sometimes I cook, usually rice and chicken or fish. Other times I get takeout. I drink a lot of soda, too. I know, it’s bad. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Lucia. It’s helpful for me to have an accurate picture of your habits. The soda is certainly something we can discuss. Now, regarding your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like irritable bowel syndrome, GERD, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. I haven’t really been to the doctor much. I had a bad flu once, a long time ago, but that’s it. No… nothing else that I know of. My mother had high blood pressure, if that matters. And my grandmother had… something with her stomach, but I don’t remember what. Sorry, I’m not very good with this stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Family history is good to know, and we'll make a note of your mother's blood pressure and your grandmother's stomach issue. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital visits. I've been pretty lucky, I think. I try to stay healthy. I walk a lot, since my new job is on my feet all day. And I eat… well, I eat. Maybe not always the best things, but I eat. Is there anything else you need to know? I feel like I’m just rambling now.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Lucia. This is all very helpful. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. Just… coffee. Does coffee count as a medication? I know it’s a drug, kinda. But I don’t take anything else. Not even when I have a headache, I just try to rest. I really don't like going to the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, so no medications. Finally, do you have any allergies to foods or medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, as far as I know. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the heat. Is that all the questions? I'm getting a little nervous, I think. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lucia, that’s a very thorough overview. Thank you. It doesn't sound like anything immediately serious. Given your history, the timing of the symptoms, and your dietary habits, it's likely this is related to digestion – potentially some increased gas production. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and make sure everything sounds normal. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that’s alright. If you think it’s a good idea. I’m a little scared, but… I trust you. What will you do? Will it hurt? I’m just… nervous. It's silly, I know.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to be nervous, Lucia. It's perfectly normal. I'll just be listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope – it doesn't hurt at all. I'll also gently press on your stomach to feel for any tenderness. It will take just a few minutes. Okay, everything sounds normal. I don't feel any tenderness or masses. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no guarding. That’s reassuring. I also notice you appear slightly dehydrated, but nothing alarming.
PATIENT: Okay… good. That’s good to hear. I’m glad it doesn't sound serious. So… what does that mean? What do I do now? Do I need… tests? I really don’t like hospitals. Is there something I can just… eat differently or something?
DOCTOR: Given the exam findings and your history, I don’t think extensive testing is necessary at this time. It’s likely we can manage this with some dietary adjustments and lifestyle changes. The most common culprit for increased belching is excess gas production, often from certain foods. We’ve already touched on the beans, but other common triggers include carbonated beverages – like soda – and foods high in fiber, especially if you're not used to them. I'd recommend a trial of a low-FODMAP diet for a couple of weeks. FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols – it’s a bit of a mouthful, but essentially, it's a diet that temporarily reduces certain types of carbohydrates that can cause gas. I can give you a handout with a list of foods to avoid and foods you can eat freely. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, please! A handout would be great. I don't even know what any of those words mean, honestly. So… less soda and… what else? And what does “low” mean? Do I have to stop eating everything tasty? I’m really worried about this already. I like my food.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be worried, Lucia. It’s not about stopping eating everything tasty, but about temporarily reducing some foods to see if it makes a difference. This handout lists the high-FODMAP foods – things like onions, garlic, apples, pears, and wheat. "Low" means simply reducing those foods, not eliminating them completely. You can still have small portions. We'll start with a trial of reducing those foods for two weeks. You should also focus on drinking plenty of water – it helps with digestion. And try to eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly – this can also reduce gas production. We can also discuss over-the-counter remedies if the diet changes aren’t enough. Simethicone, for example, can help break up gas bubbles. But let’s try the diet first and see how you feel. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay… two weeks. Less beans, less soda, less… other things. And more water. I can do that, I think. It sounds… hard, but I can try. So, if I eat less of the bad things, maybe the belching will stop? And then I can slowly add them back in? And what if it doesn’t work? What if I still belch after two weeks? Then what happens? I just… I don’t want this to last forever. I’m embarrassed to go to parties and everything.
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right, Lucia. Two weeks of reducing those high-FODMAP foods, and then we can slowly add them back in one at a time to see which ones trigger your symptoms. It's a process of elimination. And if it doesn’t work, don’t worry. If the belching persists after two weeks, we can consider other possibilities. It could be a sign of something else, such as a mild form of irritable bowel syndrome or a problem with your gallbladder. In that case, we might consider some blood tests or a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive issues. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. For now, let’s focus on the diet. I’ll also give you a handout with some tips for managing stress, as that can also contribute to digestive issues. And if you're still concerned, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I’m still a little scared, but… I feel a little bit better now. Knowing what to do is… helpful. So, diet changes and less stress. And call if it doesn't get better. Okay. I'll try my best. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it’s a process, and it may take some time to figure things out. Don’t be too hard on yourself. I'll see you back in two weeks to check on your progress. If anything changes before then, please don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, and try to relax. .
