DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get on with it. It's my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. Is that what this is about? I just want to know if I'm dying or not, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hatchard, and I assure you we will get to the bottom of this. It's good you mentioned the pain pills right away. Black stool can have several causes, and it’s important to investigate. It can be related to medications, but we need to rule out other possibilities. To start, can you describe the stool a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Describe it? It's… black! Like tar, almost. Not shiny tar, more like… well, you know, the stuff on the road. And it doesn't smell right, either. A bit… metallic, I think. Honestly, I don't spend my days examining my… waste products. Is this really necessary? I just want a yes or no answer - am I in trouble or not? It's slowing me down, all this fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize if my questions seem tedious. It's important to gather as much information as possible to ensure I can provide you with the best care. While black, tarry stools can sometimes be caused by medications, they can also indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which would be a serious concern. To clarify, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this change in stool?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Oh, goodness. No, no bleeding. I haven't seen any blood. Just the… the color. And a bit of tiredness, maybe. But I'm 73! I'm supposed to be tired. My husband keeps telling me I need to slow down, but I have things to do. Things! I don't have time for… well, for whatever it is you're thinking about. Could it just be the pills? Please tell me it's just the pills. I don't want any… procedures.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. It’s good to know there’s no visible blood. Fatigue can certainly be a symptom of many things, and your age is a factor to consider. While the pain pills could be the cause, we can’t rule out other possibilities without doing a little more investigation. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, where do I even begin? Arthritis, obviously. Bad knees, bad back, bad everything, really. High blood pressure, but it's managed with… with a little blue pill, I think. And my cholesterol is a bit high, but the doctor says it's “acceptable” for my age. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago. Does that matter? Honestly, I’ve had so many things over the years, I can barely remember them all. My husband keeps track of all that. He's the organized one. Is any of this important?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hatchard, all of this is important information, thank you for sharing. Knowing about your arthritis, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and gallbladder removal helps me understand your overall health picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the pain pill and the little blue pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. There's a white one for my knees, a little tiny one. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, the doctor gives me a shot. And I take something for my stomach, because the pain pills upset it. A pink one, I think. And… oh, and a vitamin D supplement. My husband says I don't get enough sun. Honestly, it's a whole handful of pills every morning. I just take whatever he gives me. He's a retired pharmacist, you know. He knows best. Is that enough? Do you need a list? He has a whole chart in the kitchen.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Hatchard. It sounds like you’re taking several medications, which is perfectly alright, but it's important to have a complete list. If it's not too much trouble, perhaps we could take a moment to jot down everything you can remember, and your husband’s chart would be wonderful if it’s accessible. While we’re waiting, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Have any close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – had any problems with stomach ulcers, bleeding disorders, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Goodness. My mother… she had something with her stomach, I think. Always complaining about indigestion. And my father… he died of heart problems. Very suddenly. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see him much. He lives in California. And I had a daughter, but she passed away a few years ago. She had… well, it was a long illness. Nothing to do with the stomach, I don't think. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I just want to get this sorted and go home. Is there anything else you need to know? Because I really don’t want to spend all day here.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize for asking so many questions. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Knowing about your mother's stomach issues is helpful. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to gently palpate your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Palpate? What does that even mean? Oh, alright, fine. But be gentle, please. I bruise easily. And don't take too long, alright? I have things to do. Honestly, doctors these days… all poking and prodding. My mother always said… never mind. Just get on with it, please. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. “Palpate” simply means I’m going to gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I will be very careful, and I assure you I’ll be as quick as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I do notice some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but no masses or significant distention. Your abdomen is soft to the touch. Now, I recommend we order a stool test to check for blood. And a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool test? More tests? Honestly. Alright, fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. But I don't want any… invasive procedures. Absolutely no colonoscopies or anything like that. I’m too old for that sort of thing. Can we just do the tests and get the results? I have a luncheon with my friends next week, and I don't want to miss it. Just get it done, please. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. We will start with the stool test and complete blood count. We will absolutely respect your wishes regarding invasive procedures. We will review the results of these tests first and discuss the best course of action based on those findings. A colonoscopy would only be considered if absolutely necessary, and we would discuss it thoroughly with you beforehand. Here is a requisition form for the stool test and blood work. The lab is just down the hall. Please take this to the lab technician, and they will assist you. The results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or notice any bright red blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… get it over with. And please, no surprises. I just want to know if I'm going to be alright. And I want to make my luncheon. Honestly, doctors these days… all tests and no answers. Alright. Thank you for your time, Dr. Quicksey. I think I’ll just… go and get this over with.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to provide you with answers as quickly as possible. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I hope you enjoy your luncheon next week.
