DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. Cough... I cough a lot. Long time already. And... tired also. Very tired. I keep getting sick in my nose too, like… stuffy, then runny. Happens often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and fatigue, and congestion… a long-time issue, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Long time. Maybe… one year? Or more? I dunno exactly. It comes and goes, but mostly it's there. Makes it hard to work, you know? Changing tires is… hard when you cough all the time.
DOCTOR: Right, a chronic cough… and this is affecting your work. Okay. Do you remember anything that specifically seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... specific? Not really. Maybe… when it's cold? But also sometimes when it’s hot. I dunno. I work outside, so… lots of weather. Doesn't feel like anything special makes it worse, just… always there. Sorry. I not very good at remembering.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tati. We'll figure it out. Let’s talk about the fatigue. Is it just feeling tired, or is it… more than that?
PATIENT: More than that, I think. Like… really, really sleepy. Even after sleep. And... sometimes hard to think straight. Like my brain is slow. Makes me worry about messing up at work, you know? It's scary.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… Not much. Work same. Wife same. House same. Oh! We… we fixed the roof last month. Maybe… the dust from that? But it’s been a while now. I dunno. It’s hard to say. Everything feels… same, but tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check a few things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Whatever you think, Doctor. I trust you. Just... quick, please? I got work later.
DOCTOR: Of course. If you could just sit up there for me, please. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first. Okay… I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs. Not anything major, but it’s there. And your heart sounds normal. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 135/85. Ears look clear, throat a little red, but nothing significant.
PATIENT: Wheezing? What’s that mean? Is that bad? And… 135? Is that the number high? I don't understand numbers so good. My wife does all the remembering about doctor things.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a breath. Wheezing means your airways are a little narrowed, like when you blow up a balloon and the opening gets smaller. It explains the cough and shortness of breath. 135/85 is a little higher than ideal blood pressure, but not alarmingly so. We'll want to keep an eye on it. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? I don't think so. I eat everything my wife cooks. She makes good food. Maybe... dust? Sometimes I sneeze when cleaning the tires. But everyone sneezes from dust, right? I not sure that's an allergy. I never went to doctor about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, no medicine. I don't like taking pills. Make me sleepy. My wife sometimes gives me ginger when I cough bad, but that's it. Just ginger tea. And lots of rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Alright, Mr. Tati. Given your symptoms and what I've heard, it sounds like you might be dealing with a combination of things: possible mild asthma, potentially aggravated by environmental factors like dust, and slightly elevated blood pressure. I'm going to order a chest X-ray, just to get a better look at your lungs. And I'd like to do some blood work to rule out anything else. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Oh… that sounds… serious. Is everything okay? I just got a cough and I’m tired. My wife... she's going to worry so much. Can't we just get some medicine for the cough? Please? I really don't like going to hospital and getting poked.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati, it's understandable to be worried. The X-ray and blood work aren't necessarily because I think it's serious, it’s to be thorough and rule out anything unexpected. The cough and fatigue could be something simple, but it’s been going on for a long time, and the wheezing I heard needs further investigation. I want to make sure we get to the bottom of this. I can start you on an inhaler to help with the wheezing and cough, but without knowing the cause, we’re just treating the symptoms. If we rule out anything serious, then we can focus on managing the cough and fatigue with simpler solutions. Would you be willing to consider the tests?
PATIENT: Inhaler sounds good… I like the sound of that. Help me breathe. But… the tests… My wife… she's working today. I don't want to worry her. Can't we wait? See if the inhaler helps? I promise I'll come back if it gets worse. Please? I really don't like hospitals. And I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. I understand. We can start with the inhaler. It’s a bronchodilator – it'll help open up your airways and ease your breathing. I'll write you a prescription for Albuterol. Use it as directed, and if you don't see improvement within a week, or if your symptoms get worse, please come back immediately. I strongly recommend the X-ray and blood work, but I respect your decision. However, I need you to understand that without those tests, we're working in the dark. If you develop a fever, chest pain, or severe shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Albuterol… I can remember that. And... no fever, no pain, no… what did you say? Emergency room. Yes. I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. How much does the inhaler cost? I… we don't have much money right now. My wife… she's paying for the house.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me see what I can do. Albuterol itself isn't terribly expensive, usually around $20-$30 with a prescription. However, since you’re uninsured, the price at the pharmacy might be higher. I can write you a prescription for a generic brand, which should be cheaper. There are also some patient assistance programs we can look into, or local pharmacies that offer discounts. I can have my nurse give you some information about those options before you leave. Don’t worry about it right now. Let's focus on getting you the inhaler and seeing if it helps. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Okay… generic is good. Yes, generic sounds good. And… the nurse, yes? She can help with the money stuff? That would be… very helpful. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you very much, Doctor Gorga. You’ve been… very kind. I go now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. You take care, and don't hesitate to come back if anything changes. My nurse will be right with you to discuss the options. Take care now. .
