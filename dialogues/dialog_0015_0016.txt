DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about my bruising. It’s… well, it’s getting ridiculous. I bump into things normally, you know, like everyone does, but now I’m covered in these dark spots. It's embarrassing, frankly. And it's been happening more and more lately. I’m on that blood thinner, Warfarin, I think it’s called. My wife… well, she used to handle all this, so I’m a bit lost without her.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you are on Warfarin, prescribed by Dr. Ramirez. And I understand you’re experiencing increased bruising. It’s good you brought it to my attention. “Ridiculous” is a bit vague, Mr. Farson. Can you tell me specifically where you're bruising, and how often this has been happening over the last, say, month?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. It’s mostly on my arms, you see? Like, if I just… brush against the furniture, I get a mark. And my legs too. A couple on my shins, I think from just walking around. It used to be… just occasionally. Now? It feels like every other day. Honestly, I don't even remember bumping into everything. Maybe I am clumsier now, I don't know. It's just… a lot more than it used to be. And they’re bigger bruises, darker. It's worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, increased frequency and size of bruising, primarily on your arms and legs. And you're not certain if you're actually experiencing more trauma, or if the bruising is simply easier to occur. That’s important information. Now, have you noticed any bleeding elsewhere?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Like… from where? No, not really. My gums don’t bleed when I brush, nothing like that. No nosebleeds. I did have a small cut on my finger a few days ago, and it seemed to take a bit longer to stop than usual, but I didn’t pay much attention to it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at noticing these things. My wife… she always kept track of everything. I just want to make sure it’s not… serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Prolonged bleeding from a minor cut is worth noting, Mr. Farson. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Besides being on Warfarin, do you have any other conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate removed a few years back, that was… unpleasant. And I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it's usually well-controlled with medication. Otherwise… I was always fairly healthy, I suppose. A bit of arthritis, but who doesn't have that at my age? I don’t go to doctors much, usually. It's all just a waste of time, if you ask me. Although, clearly, I'm here now.
DOCTOR: I see here you underwent a radical prostatectomy in 2021, and you are prescribed Lisinopril for hypertension. Now, are you taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin, that's about it. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. Just the normal kind, over-the-counter. Nothing else, I assure you. I don't really believe in all those fancy supplements, to be honest. My wife used to try to get me to take all sorts of things, but I never bothered. It all seemed like nonsense to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen use is… not ideal given your Warfarin. Now, family history. Has anyone in your family had problems with bleeding or bruising?
PATIENT: Bleeding problems… hmm. Not that I know of, no. My mother had… well, she had a lot of health issues when she was older, but nothing specifically about bleeding. My father was perfectly healthy, lived to be 85. And my sister… she's fine, as far as I know. We don’t really talk much anymore. It’s just… not something that comes up in conversation, you know? This is all very… tedious, Doctor. Are you sure all this is necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Farson. We need to determine the cause of your increased bruising. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll examine the areas where you’re experiencing bruising. It won’t take long. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect anything exciting, Doctor. I’m a very boring patient. And please be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Blood pressure first. 142 over 88. A bit elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at these bruises. Hmm. Bruising appears to be at various stages of healing, consistent with your report. No signs of acute trauma. The bruising is… somewhat extensive, especially given your description of minimal impact. I'm going to order some blood work, Mr. Farson. A complete blood count, a PT/INR to check your Warfarin levels, and a basic metabolic panel. That should give us a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Blood work, of course. More poking and prodding. Well, I suppose it's necessary. When will I get the results, Doctor? And what exactly are you looking for? Is it something serious? My wife… she always knew what was going on. I feel so lost without her explaining everything. Honestly, I just want to know if I'm going to be okay.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours, Mr. Farson. I'll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they're in. As for what we're looking for… the PT/INR will tell us if your Warfarin dose is too high, which would explain the increased bruising. The complete blood count will check for any underlying bleeding disorders or other abnormalities. And the basic metabolic panel will assess your kidney function, as that can also affect bleeding. It's possible this is simply a matter of adjusting your Warfarin dosage. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Farson, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. I’ll explain everything clearly once we have the results. In the meantime, avoid any activities that could cause injury, and let me know immediately if you experience any unusual bleeding, such as blood in your stool or urine, or any excessive nosebleeds. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results, Doctor. This uncertainty is… unsettling. And tell your nurse to speak clearly, please. I'm a bit hard of hearing, you know. I suppose that’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Farson. I'll ensure the nurse contacts you promptly and speaks clearly. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
