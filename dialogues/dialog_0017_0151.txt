DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s my hands, mostly. They’ve been… tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, and honestly, it’s just getting more annoying. I need to get back to my route, so if we can just figure out what’s going on… that would be great.
DOCTOR: “A little while now.” Vague. Very vague. And a route?
PATIENT: Oh! Sorry, Doctor. Yes, my mail route. I’m a postal carrier. Been doing it for… oh, goodness, almost 30 years now. It’s a lot of walking, a lot of sorting. And the tingling… maybe a month? It comes and goes, but it's definitely more often lately. Especially after a long day. It’s mostly in my fingers, but sometimes it goes up my arms a bit. Does that make more sense?
DOCTOR: Better. Though “comes and goes” is still not particularly helpful. And 30 years… one accumulates a great many issues over three decades of repetitive stress. Let’s get a proper history. Aside from the tingling, are you experiencing any weakness in your hands?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not exactly. I can still grip things, still sort the mail, still drive. It's just… sometimes my hands feel a little clumsy, like I might drop something. Especially small things. But I haven't dropped anything yet, if that makes sense. It’s not like I can't do things, it just feels… off. And it’s worse at the end of the day, like I said. Is that weakness? I don’t know what weakness feels like, really.
DOCTOR: "Subjective clumsiness." Remarkable. Now, Ms. Uzarski, let's move beyond the hands. Any pain associated with this tingling?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… no. It’s not a painful tingling, it’s just… irritating. Like when your foot falls asleep, you know? Just a weird sensation. Sometimes if I’ve been holding something tight for a long time, my hands might ache a little, but that's more from the gripping, I think. Not like a sharp pain or anything. Mostly just… annoying. Honestly, I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Annoying is not a diagnosis, Ms. Uzarski. Now, do you have any numbness besides the tingling?
PATIENT: Numbness… hmm. That's a good question. Sometimes, yeah, maybe a little bit. Not all the time, but when the tingling is really bad, my fingers feel… well, kind of thick? Like I can’t feel things as well. It goes away when the tingling calms down. It's hard to explain. I can still feel things, just… not as sharply. Is that numbness? I don’t know medical words, Doctor. I just know what feels wrong.
DOCTOR: “Feels wrong” is not helpful. Very well. Have you noticed this occurring in any other parts of your body?
PATIENT: No, just my hands. Not my feet, not my arms, not anywhere else. Just… the hands. That's why I came, you know? It's the mail route. I thought maybe I was holding things too tight or something. But it’s just getting worse, and I’m worried I won’t be able to… well, do my job. I need to know if it's something serious. I don't have insurance, so I’m trying to get this sorted quickly, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a brief examination. Please extend your arms, palms up. Now, squeeze my hands. Not particularly strong. And now, I will test your reflexes. Slightly diminished. Now, let me examine your hands more closely. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Tender… hmm. Not really. Maybe a little bit on the inside of my wrists, but that could be from years of sorting mail. It's hard to say. I don't usually notice pain unless something's really wrong. Ooh, a little bit there, yes. That feels… a little sensitive. But I don't know if that's new. It's always felt a little bit like that, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if I need to stop working. That's what I'm worried about. I don’t have a lot of savings.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on this preliminary examination, and your… imprecise description of symptoms, it is likely you are experiencing the early stages of carpal tunnel syndrome, exacerbated by repetitive stress. We can confirm this with a nerve conduction study, but that will require a referral to a neurologist, and, of course, incur a cost. However, I recommend immediate modification of your work activities. Avoid prolonged gripping and repetitive hand movements. I can provide a wrist brace, which may offer some temporary relief. Is this satisfactory, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: Carpal… what now? That sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine? A brace, okay. Will that really help? I mean, I need to sort mail. That's my job. Avoiding gripping… that’s… hard. Is there anything else? Any medicine or something? I just… I need to keep working, Doctor. I really do. If the brace doesn’t help, what then? And what about the cost of seeing this… neurologist? I don’t know if I can afford that right now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I am a physician, not a miracle worker. A wrist brace is a conservative measure. Medication may provide some temporary relief of discomfort, but does not address the underlying cause. As for the neurologist, that is your prerogative. I can write a referral, but I cannot control the cost of their services. I will prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory, to be taken as directed. If symptoms persist, or worsen despite these measures, you will need to seek further evaluation. I must see other patients. Do you have any further questions, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. So, wear the brace, take the pills… and see if it gets better? And if it doesn't? That neurologist… how much does a visit usually cost, roughly? I know it's a silly question, but I need to know if I can even start down that road. I really appreciate you seeing me, Doctor. It's just… this is all a bit much. I just want to be able to do my job. And not be in pain. Is there anything else I can do at home? Any stretches or anything? Just… anything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I reiterate: I am a physician, not a financial advisor. The cost of a neurologist visit varies considerably. I can provide you with a list of neurologists in the area, and you may contact their offices directly for pricing information. As for stretches, basic wrist and finger exercises may offer some limited benefit. I will print you a handout with some recommended exercises. However, these are merely adjunctive measures. I have other patients waiting. Please follow these instructions, and schedule a follow-up appointment in one month if symptoms have not improved. Good day, Ms. Uzarski.
PATIENT: Okay… thank you, Doctor. One month… I’ll see what happens. One month. I hope I can still work. .
