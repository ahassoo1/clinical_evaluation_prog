DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste time. You’re 83, if I’m reading this correctly… Yes. So, tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Concise, you say? Hmph. Well, it's about these… suggestions you people keep making. I don’t need any of it. I've lived a long life, thank you very much, and I know what my body can handle. It's just… fussing, really. A waste of good money, if you ask me. And Medicare doesn't stretch as far as it used to.
DOCTOR: “Suggestions,” you say. Very well. Perhaps if you could clarify which suggestions you are referring to?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. It was… a young man, I think? He wanted me to have… something done to my feet. Some kind of… procedure. Said I was a candidate. Honestly, it all sounded rather… invasive. And unnecessary! My feet aren’t that bad. A little ache here and there, that’s all. It’s what happens when you get older. I just want to be left alone to manage it myself. I’ve always been perfectly capable.
DOCTOR: So, you were advised about a potential podiatric procedure… for foot pain. And you declined. Can you describe the pain, Ms. Gunasekara?
PATIENT: Pain? It’s… a dull ache, mostly. In the arch, I suppose. And sometimes in my heel. It’s worse when I’ve been standing a lot, or… well, walking. Not that I do much of that anymore. It’s just… bothersome. I get by. I’ve always been one to tough things out. Honestly, you young people are so quick to cut and poke. Back in my day, we used liniment and sensible shoes!
DOCTOR: "Sensible shoes" are, of course, commendable. But it’s important to determine the cause of the pain, not simply mask it. Has this pain been getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Progressively? Oh, goodness. I don’t know about progressively. It comes and goes, you know? Some days it's barely noticeable, other days... well, it reminds me I’m not twenty anymore. It’s probably just the arthritis, if you ask me. My mother had it something awful. I figured it was just my turn. No need to go digging around in there with scalpels and such.
DOCTOR: While arthritis is certainly a possibility, Ms. Gunasekara, it’s vital to rule out other potential causes. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Tingling? Heavens, no. Nothing like that. Just… discomfort. A general ache. I wouldn’t be here if it was anything serious, you know. I’ve always had a good sense of my body. And honestly, I don’t have time for all this fuss. I have a book club meeting this afternoon, and Millie makes the most delicious guava pastries…
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s at least have a brief look. It will take only a moment. Please, have a seat on the examination table. I need to assess your feet, and check your circulation. It's standard procedure, Ms. Gunasekara.
PATIENT: Assess? Check my circulation? Honestly. I suppose I haven't got much choice, have I? But don’t go poking and prodding too much. And please, have a clean sheet on that table. I don’t want to catch anything.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, lie down. I will begin with a simple visual inspection. Circulation appears… adequate. However, I do note some mild swelling and a slight discoloration of the skin on your left heel. Do you recall any injury to that area?
PATIENT: Injury? Hmm… not that I recall. I might have stubbed it, perhaps? Years ago. It's hard to say. I do a lot of gardening, you know. And I used to wear rather… fashionable sandals. Not the most practical things, perhaps. But they looked lovely with my floral dresses. Honestly, a little bump or bruise is nothing to get excited about. I've had worse. It's probably just age. Everything starts to ache eventually, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: While a minor injury is possible, the discoloration and swelling warrants further investigation. I'm also concerned about the limited range of motion in your left ankle. Have you experienced any difficulty walking or bearing weight on that foot recently?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Well, I don't sprint anymore, if that’s what you mean. And I do prefer a nice, leisurely stroll. But I manage perfectly well. I get around, you know? I go to church every Sunday, and Millie and I go to the market on Tuesdays. I haven’t been confined to a chair, if that's what you’re hinting at. But I do admit, it feels a little… stiff sometimes. Especially in the mornings. Like an old gate, creaking and groaning.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, with all due respect, "stiff like an old gate" is not a medical diagnosis. I am concerned about the possibility of a stress fracture, or potentially early signs of peripheral neuropathy. To rule these out, I recommend an X-ray and a nerve conduction study. These are simple tests, and will provide a clearer picture of what's going on with your foot.
PATIENT: X-ray? Nerve conduction study? Heavens to Betsy! Are you trying to turn me into a science experiment? I told you, I just have a little ache. No need for all this… drama. I’ve lived a long life without X-rays, and I intend to keep it that way. Honestly, I think I’ll just stick to liniment and sensible shoes. And perhaps a nice warm foot soak. That always does the trick. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I respect your decision. However, I must document that I strongly recommended further investigation, and that you declined. Should your condition worsen, or if you experience any numbness, tingling, or increased pain, please seek immediate medical attention. .
