DOCTOR: Hi Rayshon, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Uh… cough. I cough a lot. And tired. Very tired, yeah? Been going on… a while now. I forget how long exactly. Feels long. Sometimes my nose… blocked up. Like… sinus, I think they call it? I get it often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. “Feels long,” you said – can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh… specific… hard. Maybe… six months? Or more? I really don’t know. I work a lot. Tire shop, you know? Lots of dust. Maybe started then? Before that… I don’t remember so good. It comes and goes, but it always comes back. Worse in the cold, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more, worse with cold weather, and related to dust at work. That’s helpful. Is the cough productive – meaning, do you cough anything up?
PATIENT: Cough up… yeah, sometimes. Like… stuff. Not blood, okay? Just… green stuff. Sometimes yellow. When it’s really bad. Mostly in the morning. Then it’s… easier. Not so much during the day. Sorry, is that… helpful? I don’t know what you want to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. Green or yellow mucus suggests an infection. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches along with the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high, I think. Just… warm. Like I’m hot. Not always though. Body ache… yeah, sometimes my body hurt. Like… all over. But I work hard, you know? Maybe that? Hard to tell. Chills… maybe a little when the fever is there. But not much. I don’t take temperature, sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent low-grade fever, body aches, and chills with the cough. And you said you work in a tire shop?
PATIENT: Yeah, tire shop. Lots of dust. And sometimes… oil, and stuff. I change tires, fix flats… all of it. It's hard work. My wife… she worries about the dust, always telling me to wear a mask. I try, but… sometimes I forget. Or it's too hot. It's hard to breathe with the mask, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, so we’ve got a chronic cough with mucus, fatigue, intermittent low-grade fever and body aches, and potential exposure to dust and oil at your workplace. Do you have any history of asthma, allergies, or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma… no. Not that I know of. Allergies… maybe a little to… flowers? Sometimes my nose itchy, but not bad. Bronchitis… I think I had it once, a long time ago? When I was young. But I don't remember much about it. It was a long time ago, Doctor. I forget things easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. My wife… she gives me some herbal tea sometimes. For the cough. But it doesn't really help much. Just makes me… thirsty. And I don't take anything regularly. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Do you have any pain anywhere – chest pain, headache, sinus pain?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes my head hurts. Like… pressure. Especially when my nose is blocked. And… sometimes my chest feels tight when I cough a lot. Not sharp pain, you know? Just… uncomfortable. Like someone is sitting on it. But it goes away. Usually. Sinus… yeah, my face hurts sometimes. Around my nose and eyes. Like… a lot of pressure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Okay, so we've got headache with nasal congestion, chest tightness with coughing, and sinus pain. Now, I'm going to need to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… uh… once. Long time ago. When I was a kid. Broke my arm. Fell from a tree. But that was a long, long time ago. Nothing else. No serious sickness or anything. Just the arm. It healed okay. Sorry, is that important? I don’t remember much about being sick.
DOCTOR: No, that’s okay. Just trying to get a complete picture. Have any close family members – parents, siblings – have any chronic illnesses, like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh… family… My mother… she had… high blood pressure, I think. She's passed away now. And my father… he had… diabetes. He was sick for a long time. Also passed away. I have a brother, he’s healthy. As far as I know. We don’t see each other much. Sorry, I don’t know much about their health. We don't talk about it. It's… hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don't like smoking. My wife doesn't like it either. It smells bad. And… it's bad for you, right? Never touched it. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Okay, so to summarize, you're a 35-year-old male presenting with a six-month history of chronic cough with green or yellow mucus, fatigue, intermittent low-grade fever, body aches, and nasal congestion. You work in a tire shop with dust and oil exposure. No history of asthma, allergies, or regular medication use. Past medical history includes a broken arm as a child. Family history of hypertension and diabetes. And you don't smoke. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that’s okay. You listen. Whatever you need to do. I just want to feel better. Sometimes it’s hard to breathe, you know? Especially when I’m tired. So… yeah, listen. Just be gentle, okay? I don’t like being poked and prodded. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth… and out. Good. Now another one… and out. Okay. I hear some wheezing in your lungs, especially on the right side. That explains some of the difficulty breathing and the chest tightness. Your sinuses are also quite tender to the touch, especially around your forehead and cheeks. It sounds like you likely have a combination of bronchitis and a sinus infection. The wheezing suggests inflammation of your airways, likely aggravated by the dust exposure at work. The sinus tenderness confirms an infection. It's not an emergency, but we need to treat it.
PATIENT: Bronchitis… and sinus… okay. So it’s not… serious? I have to stop working? My wife… she will be happy if I stop working. But… we need the money. Can I still work? If I wear a mask? And… what do I have to do to get better? Pills? I don’t like pills. Is there… anything else?
DOCTOR: It's not immediately life-threatening, no, but it’s important to address it before it gets worse. Stopping work completely isn’t necessarily required right now, but significantly reducing your exposure to dust is crucial. Wearing a high-quality mask – an N95 if possible – is essential. As for treatment, I would recommend a course of antibiotics to clear the sinus infection, and an inhaler to help open up your airways and reduce the wheezing. Unfortunately, antibiotics are usually necessary for a bacterial sinus infection. I understand you don’t like pills, but this is a limited course, and it will help you feel much better. We can also try a nasal saline rinse to help clear congestion, and I'll recommend an over-the-counter decongestant. We can discuss options for pain relief as well. Would you be willing to try the antibiotics and inhaler?
PATIENT: Ugh… pills. Okay. But just a few? And… the inhaler… that’s not a pill, right? I can try. If it helps. I don't want to be sick all the time. My wife will be happy. She always tells me to go to the doctor. And… the saline rinse… is that hard? I don’t want to do anything too complicated. Sorry, I’m just… worried. I don't like being sick. And I need to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. The antibiotics are for 7 days, so a limited course. And the inhaler isn’t a pill – you puff it into your mouth a few times a day. The saline rinse is very simple. You can buy a pre-mixed solution at the pharmacy, or make your own with salt and distilled water. There are neti pots and squeeze bottles available; the pharmacist can show you how to use them. It just helps clear the mucus from your nasal passages. Let’s write a prescription for the antibiotics and inhaler. I’ll also give you instructions on the saline rinse and recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever if needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Ugh… allergies… no. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Sorry, I don’t remember. I don’t take much medicine, you know? Just herbal tea. And sometimes… paracetamol for the headache. But that was a long time ago. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything. But if you need to know something specific, just tell me. I’ll try to remember. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Alright, here’s your prescription. You can take this to the pharmacy, and they’ll dispense the medication. This includes a 7-day course of amoxicillin to treat the sinus infection, and an albuterol inhaler to help with your breathing. I’ve also written down some instructions on how to use the inhaler and perform the saline rinse. If you experience any side effects from the antibiotics – like nausea, diarrhea, or a rash – stop taking them and contact me immediately. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to see how you're doing. If your symptoms worsen before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay. Seven days… inhaler… saline… side effects… Okay. Follow-up… in one week. Um… how much does it cost? The medicine, I mean. I don’t have much money. And… if I still feel sick after seven days… what then? Another pill? Sorry, I’m just… worried. And I need to go to work tomorrow. Is it okay if I go to work tomorrow? If I wear the mask?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The cost will vary depending on the pharmacy, but I can write a prescription for a generic version of the amoxicillin, which is generally more affordable. I can also give you a list of pharmacies in the area that offer discount programs. If you’re still feeling sick after seven days, we’ll need to re-evaluate. It could be that you need a different antibiotic, or we may need to investigate other potential causes. As for going to work tomorrow, I recommend reducing your workload as much as possible and wearing a high-quality N95 mask at all times. If you experience any shortness of breath or worsening symptoms, you need to stop working immediately and rest. It’s important to prioritize your health, Rayshon. Pushing yourself too hard could make things worse. Do you have any further questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Okay. Generic… discount… N95… prioritize… Um… I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. You were very helpful. And patient. I ask a lot of questions. Sorry. I will go to the pharmacy now. And try to rest. And wear the mask. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshon. It’s my job to answer your questions, and I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes, or if you have any concerns. Get some rest, and feel better soon. .
