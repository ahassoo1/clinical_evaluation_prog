DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. Is nice to meet you. Well, lately I just… I does be so thirsty, all the time. And hungry too! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need more. It not making sense, you know?
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry, despite eating… Hmm. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… maybe about a month now? Maybe a little longer. It start slow, just feeling a bit dry, but now… now it real bad. I does be drinking a lot of water, but it not helping much. My husband, Leroy, he does tell me I need to slow down, but I just can't seem to.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And are you noticing any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… I does be going to the bathroom more often too. Especially at night! It waking me up, you know? Leroy not happy about that, he needs his sleep. And I feel… tired. Just tired all the time, even if I sleep enough. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Increased urination, nocturia, and fatigue… Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: My vision? Let me see… No, not really. I wear glasses already, you know? For reading mostly. But it not getting worse, if that is what you asking. The world still look blurry when I don’t have them on, like always. I don’t think my sight change. Is just… the thirst and hunger is what bothering me most.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had the high blood pressure a few years back. The doctor put me on some pills, but I stop taking them after a while. I didn’t like the way they made me feel. I does try to watch my salt intake now, but sometimes it hard, you know? Leroy loves his cookin', and it always have a little bit of salt. I never had anything else, not that I know of. Just the blood pressure. And I never been in the hospital, thank God.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, previously treated but discontinued… And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never any surgeries. Everything is original, thank you very much! Just a few aches and pains like any old woman, you know? But nothing serious enough to need a doctor to cut me open. My Leroy always say I strong like a horse.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, Leroy is the only family I really have close by now. My mother and father, they gone a long time ago. And I have a sister, but she live in America, we don’t talk much. She always been… independent, you know? She don’t like talking about feelings or sickness. As for family history… I don’t know much about it, really. My mother never talk about her side of the family, and my father… he mostly keep to himself. I think my mother’s father had the diabetes, but I not sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I try to take it easy, Doctor. I does help Leroy with his garden, we grow some vegetables. I like to cook, like I say, but I mostly eat what he cookin'. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol, just a little wine sometimes with dinner. I try to walk a little bit when the weather nice, but it get hot so fast these days. I spend a lot of time inside, mostly reading or watching TV. It not a very exciting life, but it’s a peaceful one.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I never really had any bad reactions to anything. I take some over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes for my aches and pains, but never anything serious. I try to stay away from pills if I can, you know? Leroy always say I sensitive, and pills always make me feel strange. I don't think I have any allergies, no. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your current medications, even though you say you don’t take much. Are you taking anything regularly, even vitamins or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh! Well… now that you mention it… Leroy, he bring home some bush tea from his friend. He say it good for everything, you know? I does drink a cup in the mornings, sometimes. It have some funny taste, but I try to be a good wife. He say it good for my blood pressure. And… I does take a little iron sometimes, for my tiredness. The pharmacist say it good for women my age. But that's all, Doctor. Just the bush tea and the iron. I swear!
DOCTOR: Right. And do you know the names or dosages of either of those?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, Doctor. I don’t know. Leroy just give me the tea in a cup, and he buy the iron from the shop. I never ask. He does all the shopping, you know? He say I need to relax and not worry about things. I just drink the tea and take the iron when he tell me to. I don't know nothing about dosages or names.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to get that information. But first, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Anything you need. The scale is over there, yes? I hope my weight not too much, Leroy been giving me some good cookin' lately.
DOCTOR: Please, step on. And don’t worry about the number, it's just information. 78 kilograms… Alright. Blood pressure is 145/90. Elevated, not surprising given the history. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Throat is clear as well. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and test your feet for sensation.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. Is everything alright? My blood pressure, is it bad? Leroy always say I get nervous at the doctor, and that make it go up.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. Your blood pressure is elevated, yes. It's not immediately life-threatening, but it needs to be addressed. Given your symptoms - the thirst, hunger, frequent urination - combined with the elevated blood pressure, I suspect we need to rule out diabetes. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. We'll also need to do a urinalysis.
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear… My mother… she had the sugar sickness, yes? Is that what you thinking? Is it serious, Doctor? What does this mean? Leroy going to be so worried… He always tell me to watch my sweets, but I just can't resist a good slice of cake sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s possible, yes. Your mother’s history is relevant. It can be serious if left untreated, but it's manageable with lifestyle changes and medication, if necessary. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. And frankly, Ms. Zicarelli, reducing your sugar intake would be a good first step, regardless of the test results. We need to take this seriously. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and collect a urine sample. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I… I think I understand. Just… when will I get the results? And will the nurse help me with the… the sample? I always have trouble with those things. And… will I need to see a specialist if… if it is the sugar sickness?
DOCTOR: The results should be back within a few days. The nurse will assist you with the urine sample, yes. And if it is diabetes, you may need to see an endocrinologist for further management. I'll write a referral, should it be necessary. For now, focus on reducing your sugar intake and trying to get your blood pressure under control. And please, try to be more forthcoming about any medications or supplements you’re taking. It makes my job much easier. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I… I think that’s all. Thank you for your time. And I'll try to remember everything… about the tea and the iron. I suppose I'll go and see the nurse now.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be right with you. .
