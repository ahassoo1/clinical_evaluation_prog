DOCTOR: Good morning, Tierney. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I… I requested a test for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to get done for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, HIV testing. Certainly. That's a very responsible thing to do, Tierney. It's good you're being proactive about your health. Just to be clear, is there a specific reason you're wanting to get tested now, or is this more of a general check-up, wanting peace of mind?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little of both, I suppose. My husband and I… we haven’t been as careful as we should have been lately, and I just want to be sure. It's been a long time since either of us had a test, and frankly, with everything going on in the world, I’d just like to know where we stand. It would put my mind at ease, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Tierney. That's a very valid reason, and it's always better to be safe and know. It's good you're talking openly about this. Now, when you say "not as careful," could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… we haven’t been using protection consistently, Doctor. It’s been… a while. I’m a bit embarrassed to say it, but life gets in the way, you know? And we both thought we were healthy… but one can never be too sure, can one? It’s probably best to just get it checked, even if it's nothing.
DOCTOR: No need to be embarrassed at all, Tierney. These things happen, and it’s very common. It's good you're recognizing the risk and wanting to take care of it. Now, have either of you had any symptoms that have concerned you – things like fever, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, or any skin rashes?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. My husband has been a bit tired lately, but he works very long hours, so we just put it down to that. I myself feel perfectly fine, Doctor. No fever, no rashes, nothing at all out of the ordinary. That's why I’m hoping it’s nothing, but… you know how these things are. It’s best to be certain.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It’s always best to be thorough. Now, have either of you ever been tested for HIV before, and if so, do you recall the results?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I believe so, many years ago. Perhaps… twenty years ago? It was before I met my husband, when I was… being more careful, let’s say. I think the result was negative, but honestly, Doctor, I can’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago, and I didn’t keep the records. My husband… I don’t believe he’s ever had a test before. He wasn’t the sort to worry much about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And just to be complete, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't take any regular medications. Just over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches occasionally. And no allergies, thankfully. Never had any reactions to anything. My husband… he takes something for his blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. I don’t know the name of it, I’m afraid. He handles all of that himself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tierney. Well, based on what you've told me, getting an HIV test is absolutely the right course of action. We can do a blood draw right here in the office. It's a standard test, and we'll send it to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Would you like me to go ahead and order that for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do. That would be wonderful. A few days is perfectly fine. I just want to get this done and know where we stand. Thank you. And… what will happen after the test? Will I need to come back for a follow-up?
DOCTOR: Certainly. After the test, we’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. If the results are negative, that’s excellent, and we can discuss preventative measures to keep it that way. If the results are positive, we’ll discuss the next steps, which would involve further testing to determine the viral load and CD4 count, and then discuss treatment options. We would also need to discuss partner notification and safe sex practices. We would definitely want to see you again for a follow-up, regardless of the results, to discuss everything in detail and answer any questions you might have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. And very sensible, Doctor. It's a little daunting, thinking about a positive result, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I suppose it's better to be prepared. So, just the blood draw today then? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, just the blood draw today. And no, you don't need to fast beforehand. You can eat and drink as normal. I'll have my nurse, Agnes, come in and draw your blood. She's very good, and it shouldn't take long. She’ll also go over some information about HIV prevention with you while she's at it. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I’m just… anxious to get it over with, I suppose. Thank you for being so kind and patient with me. Let's get it done then, shall we?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Tierney. I'll let Agnes know you're ready. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, and I assure you, we'll take good care of you. I'll be right here if you need anything at all. Agnes, could you please come in and draw blood for Tierney Shaub?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I'll just wait here then.
DOCTOR: Yes, just relax and I’ll be right here. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you feel faint or unwell at any point. Agnes will be with you momentarily. .
