DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my sister... she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mother, she... she had something bad too, a long time ago. I just... I want to make sure I'm okay. You know? It makes me worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It’s very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history like that. We’ll definitely do a thorough check-up. To start, can you tell me a little more about your sister’s illness?
PATIENT: She got... lung cancer, I think. It was a while ago now. She had to have... treatments. Lots of them. Made her very tired. And Mom... Mom had something with her stomach. They did surgery. A long time ago, like when I was a little boy. I don't remember much about it, just... she was sick for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, lung cancer in your sister and a history of stomach issues in your mother. That gives us a good starting point. Now, let’s focus on you, Mr. Schwer. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: No… not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but… I’m 73! I think that’s just getting old, right? My knees ache a little, too. But everyone my age has bad knees. I haven't been sick sick. No cough, no… nothing like that. Just… worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, no acute symptoms, just general fatigue and some knee pain, which you attribute to age. That’s good to know. Let's go through a quick review of your general health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um... let me think. The doctor, a few years back, said my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a pill. I took it for a while, then… I stopped. It seemed okay after that. And… I think I had a bad back once. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else, really. I haven’t been to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, managed with medication that you discontinued, and a previous back issue. And you haven’t been a regular visitor to the doctor’s office. I see. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. I'm lucky, I guess. Always been pretty healthy... until this worry started.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, that’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. It's… glucosamine, I think? It helps a little with the pain. And sometimes I take something for… gas. You know, indigestion. But that's not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine for your knees and something as needed for indigestion. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything. I like spicy food, actually! Makes my stomach a little upset sometimes, but not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Mr. Schwer, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks okay. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don’t mind, please go ahead and get comfortable on the table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Everything sounds clear so far. Normal heart rhythm, no unusual sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I'll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature now.
PATIENT: Okay... deep breath... It feels... okay. Everything feels normal, I guess. I'm still worried, but... I don't know what I'm expecting. Just tell me if anything is wrong, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148 over 88. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen now. Any tenderness or pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No… that doesn't hurt. A little… sensitive sometimes, but not pain. It's just… my stomach. It gets upset easily. Like after I eat spicy food.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness to palpation, but no acute guarding or rebound tenderness. I’m going to listen to your stomach sounds now. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, but a little… hyperactive. Do you have any regular bowel movements?
PATIENT: Yes... usually. Sometimes… a little loose. Especially if I eat something… rich. Or spicy. It's just my stomach, Doctor. Always been that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, your vital signs show slightly elevated blood pressure, and your abdomen is a little tender and hyperactive, possibly related to your dietary habits. Given your family history, it’s good you came in. I’d like to order a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. Also, a stool sample to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds... good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's going on. Blood tests and... stool sample? Okay. Whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the lab orders printed for you, and the nurse will explain how to collect the stool sample. The blood tests can be done right here in the clinic. We should have the results back in about a week. In the meantime, I recommend trying to lower your sodium intake, avoiding spicy foods for a bit, and increasing your fiber intake. We can also discuss some options for managing your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that makes sense. Less salt, no spicy food... more fiber. Okay. I can try that. A week for the results? That seems long... but okay. No… I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It’s my job. And yes, a week can seem long, but it’s necessary to get a clear picture of what’s going on. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and go over the stool sample instructions. If you develop any concerning symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool, or significant weight loss – please don’t hesitate to call us. I'll see you back in a week to discuss the results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay... thank you, Doctor. You too.
