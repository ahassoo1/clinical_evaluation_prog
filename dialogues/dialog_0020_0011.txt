DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, you say? Hmm. Well, look, I ain’t got all day. I need somethin’ signed. Some…procedure. A cosmetic one. A fella at the place said I needed a doctor to say I'm alright to do it. That's all. I don’t recall much about it, to be honest. Been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, a procedure authorization…I see. It's alright if you don’t recall all the details, we can try to piece things together. Could you tell me what kind of procedure it was, if you remember?
PATIENT: Piece things together? Honestly, Doctor, I got better things to do than play detective with my own body. I just…it had somethin' to do with…lookin’ better. That's it. They showed me pictures, and it looked…acceptable. Some kinda lift, I think? Face lift? I don't know! It was a while back. Why do you need to know all this anyway? Shouldn’t you just look at me and see?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. I apologize if my questions seem tedious. It's important for me to have a complete picture of your medical history and the specifics of the procedure before authorizing anything, just to ensure your safety. It's standard practice, and it helps me avoid any potential complications. Do you remember the name of the place where you saw the pictures and discussed this procedure?
PATIENT: Complications? Look, I ain’t had complications with nothin’ in my life. And “standard practice?” Sounds like a whole lotta nothin’ to me. I told ya, I don't recall the name of the place. Some…establishment. Downtown, maybe? It was brightly lit. Lots of folks in there. Young people. That’s all I remember, Doctor. Bright lights and young faces. I just want the paper signed. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask, Mr. Honcoop. It’s just…without knowing more about the procedure, I can't responsibly authorize it. I'm concerned about potential risks, especially since I don't have your medical records from that establishment. Would you mind if I took a quick look at you?
PATIENT: Look at me? What for? You already are lookin' at me! I'm a perfectly presentable gentleman. This is…insultin’. I ain't sick! I just want a signature. You checkin’ for somethin’ wrong? Because there ain't nothin' wrong. I work with towers, you know. Radio towers. Requires a certain…physical resilience. And I’m plenty resilient. Just sign the paper, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I assure you I’m not implying anything is wrong. A quick examination isn't to find something wrong, but to understand what procedure might have been discussed. It helps me determine if authorizing it would be safe, given your current health. It's a standard part of my practice, even for cosmetic procedures. Just a quick look at your face, your neck…no invasive tests, I promise. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t go pokin’ and proddin’. I don’t like bein’ touched. Just…glance. A quick glance. And then sign the paper. This is takin’ way too long. Honestly, I’ve got…appointments. Important ones. With…people. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. Just a quick look. Please, have a seat. Alright. I see some… slight asymmetry in your facial features, and a few areas of discoloration. It's subtle, but present. Do you have any history of skin cancer or other skin conditions?
PATIENT: Skin cancer? Goodness gracious. No! Never. I work outdoors, yes, but I wear a hat. A good hat! And sunscreen when it’s real bright. I ain't spendin’ my time worryin’ about somethin’ like that. Discoloration? Maybe a little sun spot here and there. Happens to everyone. Look, are you gonna sign the paper or are you just gonna keep askin' questions? I’m startin’ to feel like I’m at a police interrogation. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, truly. However, authorizing a procedure without knowing its specifics and your complete medical history could be detrimental to your health. Given your lack of recall and my observations, I am hesitant to authorize anything at this time. I can offer you a referral to a dermatologist for a thorough skin evaluation and a consultation to discuss your cosmetic concerns. They would be best equipped to assess your needs and determine if a procedure is safe and appropriate for you. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: A dermatologist? Look, I came here for a signature, not a whole new doctor! This is…outrageous. You're sendin' me around in circles. I just want the paper signed! It's a simple request. I’m perfectly capable of makin’ my own decisions. And I don’t need some fancy skin doctor tellin’ me what to do with my face. Honestly, I think you’re tryin’ to waste my time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're upset, but I cannot ethically authorize a procedure without adequate information. My primary responsibility is to ensure your safety. Given your refusal of a referral and your inability to recall details about the procedure, I am unable to fulfill your request. I apologize for the inconvenience. Here's some information on dermatologists in the area, should you change your mind. .
