DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Farson, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nicky Farson. And frankly, I don’t have all day. I took time off work for this, you know. It's about my bruising. It’s gotten…noticeable.
DOCTOR: Bruising, yes. Well, it is rather common. How long have you been noticing this…noticeable bruising, exactly?
PATIENT: Common? Common for who? I’m a very careful man. Always have been. Anyway, it’s been…oh, maybe three weeks now? It started with just a little bump on my arm after I bumped the doorframe, but now it seems like any little thing causes a big, ugly mark. It's worrying.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. Right. And you say any little thing?
PATIENT: Well, not literally any little thing. But it’s far more than it used to be. I mean, I used to be able to knock my shin against the coffee table and it wouldn’t even leave a mark. Now? It looks like I’ve been in a fight. And it's…discomforting. Are you even listening to me, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Of course, I'm listening. It's just…you're describing a relatively normal response to minor trauma. Have you been taking any…supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Good heavens, no. I don't believe in all that…nonsense. I take my prescribed medication, that’s it. The blood thinner, of course. Warfarin, I believe it's called. That's what the other doctor put me on after…well, never you mind. The point is, that’s what I think is causing this, and I wanted to get it checked. Is it the dosage? Are you going to adjust it?
DOCTOR: Warfarin, yes. I see it in your chart. Well, your INR is slightly elevated from last month. Though, honestly, it’s not terribly concerning. Are you meticulously following the dietary restrictions with that medication?
PATIENT: Dietary restrictions? Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting I'm not following instructions? I’ve always been a very disciplined person. I know I need to watch my greens. A little spinach with my dinner, maybe. Nothing excessive. It's not like I'm out there eating a whole salad bar. It feels like you're implying I'm doing something wrong!
DOCTOR: I’m simply asking a clarifying question. A lot of patients underestimate how much vitamin K is in certain foods. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to…rule things out. Roll up your sleeves. And please, try to remain still.
PATIENT: Fine. But I assure you, this is a waste of my time. I've lived a very careful life. It's likely just the medication, and I’d prefer to just adjust the dosage rather than have you poking around. I have important things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see some ecchymoses…varying degrees of discoloration. And a few petechiae on your forearm. Any pain with palpation?
PATIENT: A little, yes. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. But honestly, Doctor, anything hurts when you poke at a bruise. It’s a bruise! What exactly are you looking for? Are you even considering it might be the Warfarin? It seems you're avoiding the obvious.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Farson. I've been practicing medicine for…a while. And while the Warfarin is a possible factor, we need to rule out other things. It's called due diligence. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel. And…perhaps a metabolic panel, just to be thorough. We'll see what the results say. In the meantime, continue your medication as prescribed. And try…not to bump into things.
PATIENT: "Try not to bump into things?" Really, Doctor? Is that the best you can offer? I'm a cautious man! And I suppose I’ll have to come back again after you run more tests? This is incredibly inconvenient. And frankly, a bit insulting. I’d appreciate it if you’d just adjust the dosage and be done with it. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I understand your frustration, but I assure you, I am acting in your best interest. We'll have the results in a few days. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
