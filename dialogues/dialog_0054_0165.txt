DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Honestly? This fever keeps comin' back. It's been buggin' me for a while now, on and off. I'd like to get it figured out, if you don't mind. I haven't got all day, ya know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Clide. I understand wanting to get to the bottom of this quickly. “On and off” is helpful, but could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts with just feelin' kinda warm, then chills, you know? Like I got a little cold. Then the fever really kicks in – usually around 101, 102 maybe. Lasts a day, sometimes two, then just…goes away. For a few weeks, maybe a month. Then it comes back again. It happened again just last week, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it seems to be a recurring fever with chills. And you said it was around 101-102 Fahrenheit when it's at its highest. Have you been taking anything for it when it comes on – like Tylenol or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Yeah, I usually take some Tylenol. Seems to knock it down a bit, but it doesn't make it go away, just…less bad. And it always comes back, even when I'm takin' it regular. I don’t really like takin’ pills unless I have to, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you're trying to manage it, and I appreciate you letting me know you’ve been using Tylenol. Besides the fever and chills, have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Sometimes I get a headache, kinda dull. And I feel tired, really tired. Not just normal tired, but like I could sleep for a week. No cough, no sore throat, nothin' like that. Just the fever, chills, headache, and bein’ wiped out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so recurring fever, chills, headache, and significant fatigue. No respiratory symptoms, which is good to know. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I had a bad back a few years back, that's why I see a chiropractor. Still go regular for that. Other than that…I'm pretty healthy, for my age. I eat okay, try to walk a little bit, you know. Nothing major, Doc.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And the chiropractor visits are helpful for your back. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Always tried to avoid it, if I could. I figure if you can fix somethin’ without cuttin’ it open, that's the way to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family…are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father…he had some kinda arthritis when he got older. Mostly, everyone just…gets old, ya know? Not much serious stuff, if I remember right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother and arthritis in your father. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to nothin', as far as I know. I eat pretty much anything. I've always been lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter, besides the Tylenol for the fever?
PATIENT: Just the Tylenol when the fever hits. No regular pills or nothin'. I try to stay away from 'em, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. Just…try to be quick, Doc. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is currently 100.2 Fahrenheit. A little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me…and another one… Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m not hearing anything concerning there. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or pain with palpation. Blood pressure is 140/90.
PATIENT: 140/90? Is that bad? My mother had high blood pressure, you said...
DOCTOR: It's a little elevated, yes. It’s considered Stage 1 hypertension. Given your family history of high blood pressure, it’s something we need to keep an eye on. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need medication right away, but we’ll want to monitor it. Given your recurring fevers, chills, headache, and fatigue, combined with the slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it's important to run some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'd like to order a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel , and a comprehensive metabolic panel . We’ll also check your thyroid function with a TSH test, and run a CRP and ESR to see if there’s any inflammation in your body. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… Inflammation, you say? Look, Doc, I'm not a fan of all these tests. Is it somethin' serious? Could it be somethin' simple, like a virus or somethin'? I just wanna feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clide. It's completely reasonable to want a simple answer and to avoid unnecessary tests. However, the recurring nature of your fevers and the fatigue, combined with the slightly elevated blood pressure, makes it important to rule out some underlying causes. While it could be a virus, we need to rule out things like a possible infection, thyroid issues, or autoimmune conditions. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on and ensure we don’t miss anything serious. We're not necessarily looking for something bad, we’re looking for answers. If the tests come back normal, then we can discuss other possibilities, like a prolonged viral illness or stress-related fatigue. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Autoimmune…that sounds scary. Alright, fine. Do the tests. But I want the results quick, Doc. And I want you to explain 'em to me in plain English, none of that doctor talk. I got other things on my mind, ya know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clide. I completely understand. We will get the tests done as quickly as possible – I'll put in a rush order. And I promise to explain the results to you in plain English, no medical jargon. I want you to understand everything that’s going on and be comfortable with the plan. The lab will draw blood from your arm – it shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Follow-up appointment…fine. Just…let me know when. And try to be quick about it, Doc. I really appreciate you rushin' things.
DOCTOR: .
