DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but... yeah, it hurts sometimes. It's... in my breast.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. I understand. And you said it's in your breast… just to clarify, is that the chest area or are you specifically feeling it in your breast tissue?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I think... in the breast. Like, here. Not like, inside my chest, more on the... the outside part. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Thank you for clarifying. So, the pain is located more in the pectoral muscle area, rather than a deeper, internal chest pain. How long have you been experiencing this pain, Mr. Bulaong?
PATIENT: Maybe... a month? I don't really keep track of days, but... around a month, I think. It comes and goes. Some days I don't feel it at all. Other days... it's a little bit sore. Not bad bad, just... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly a month, coming and going, and you describe it as uncomfortable rather than severely painful. Can you describe the sensation itself?
PATIENT: Um... it's hard to say. Like... a dull ache? And sometimes... feels like a little bit of a burning feeling. Not a hot burn, just... warm and kinda sore. It's not sharp. Definitely not sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache with occasional warmth and soreness, no sharp pain. Does anything specifically trigger the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... I think... when I'm working. I'm a roofer, you know? Lots of lifting and... moving around. When I use my arms a lot, it feels worse. Maybe not every time, but usually. I don't know if that makes sense. It just... feels more sore after a long day.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Bulaong. Physical exertion seems to be a contributing factor. And does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Yeah... when I rest. When I'm not working, it goes away. Or... if I just sit down and don't move my arm too much. Sometimes my wife rubs it... that helps a little bit. It's not a cure, but it feels better for a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, rest and gentle massage seem to provide some relief. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or any changes in the skin around the area where you’re experiencing the pain?
PATIENT: No, no swelling or redness. Everything looks the same, I think. I haven't really... looked closely, to be honest. My wife would probably notice if something was different. I don’t think anything looks different.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And... no weight loss. Maybe I lost a little bit because it's been so hot, but nothing big. I eat pretty much the same. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. Just... this chest pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no systemic symptoms like fever, chills, or weight loss. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like heart problems, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven't really been to the doctor much. I usually just try to tough things out. I think I had the flu once, a long time ago. But nothing serious. No heart problems or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I try to be careful on the roof, so I haven't needed to. My wife worries about me, but I'm okay. Mostly. Just this pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, I'll ask about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—who have had heart disease, cancer, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm... My mom had... high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather... he had something with his heart, but I don't remember exactly what. He passed away a long time ago. My wife knows more about that stuff. She's good with remembering things like that. But no cancer, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of high blood pressure and a grandfather with a heart condition. And finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never tried it. I drink... sometimes, with dinner. Just a little bit of beer. And no, no drugs. Nothing like that. I just work hard and try to take care of my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Mr. Bulaong. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel around the area where you're experiencing the pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your chest muscles. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. There is mild tenderness to palpation in the right pectoral muscle. No palpable masses detected. No skin changes noted. Okay, Mr. Bulaong. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing musculoskeletal chest pain, likely related to the physical demands of your job as a roofer. This means the pain is originating from your muscles, ligaments, or tendons in your chest wall. However, given your family history and the nature of chest pain, it’s important to rule out any cardiac involvement, even if it seems less likely.
PATIENT: Okay... so it's my muscles? From the work? That makes sense, I guess. But... what does that mean? Do I need... tests? Or medicine? What should I do? I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. It likely is muscle-related, given your description and the exam findings. However, to be absolutely certain and rule out any heart-related issues, I would like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart's electrical activity. It's a quick, painless test. I would also recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any other potential causes of chest pain, such as lung issues. In the meantime, for symptomatic relief, I can recommend an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help reduce pain and inflammation. You can also apply ice packs to the area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. However, if you experience any of the following symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, nausea, or pain radiating to your arm, jaw, or back. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay... so an EKG and an X-ray. And the medicine... ibuprofen? I think I've heard of that. And if it gets worse, go to the hospital. I understand. But... how much ibuprofen should I take? And... is it okay to keep working? I need to make money, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, you've understood everything correctly. For the ibuprofen, I recommend taking 200-400 milligrams every 4-6 hours as needed, but do not exceed 1200 milligrams in a 24-hour period. It's best to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. Regarding work, that’s a more complicated question. While I don’t want to completely discourage you from working, I strongly advise you to modify your activities. Avoid heavy lifting, repetitive movements, and any activities that exacerbate your pain. If possible, try to take breaks more frequently and alternate tasks. It’s important to listen to your body. If the pain worsens despite these modifications, or if you experience any new symptoms, you should stop working and consult a medical professional. I'll write you a prescription for the ibuprofen just in case, and I'll order the EKG and chest X-ray. The clinic can schedule those for you. I also have a handout here with information about musculoskeletal chest pain and how to manage it. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay... so 200 to 400 milligrams. And listen to my body. A handout... that would be good. Um... no, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. We're here to support you. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule your tests and provide you with the prescription. Take care, and please prioritize your health. .
