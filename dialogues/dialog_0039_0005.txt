DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here today… let me see… yes, to get myself cleared for a stay at the Meadowbrook Senior Living Facility. My daughter thought it was time, and she’s usually right about these things. I bake, you see, and it’s getting a little… difficult to manage the oven and everything on my own these days.
DOCTOR: Ah, Meadowbrook! A lovely place. Getting settled into a new place is always a bit of a process. So, just to be clear, your daughter suggested this move, and it’s mainly about being able to continue your baking safely, is that right?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. My daughter, bless her heart, is very practical. And yes, the baking is… important to me. It’s more than just a hobby, you understand. It’s… well, it’s a way of life, I suppose. A way to remember things. And I wouldn’t want to burn the place down with a forgotten loaf, now would I?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s wonderful that you have something you’re so passionate about. And your daughter is right to be cautious; safety is always the priority. So, to get a better picture of things for the facility, and to make sure you’re healthy enough for the transition, I’d like to ask a few questions, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Ask away. I’ve got nothing to hide and I’m happy to answer whatever you need to know. I always did believe in being upfront about things. It makes life easier, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. Alright, let’s start with your general health. Have you been seeing a primary care doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Dr. Evans. Been with him for… oh, goodness, nearly twenty years now. Good man. We see each other twice a year for check-ups. He keeps a close eye on my blood pressure, mostly. And my knees. They ache a bit, you see. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I see Dr. Evans’ notes here. Good to know you’ve been well-cared for. He does mention your blood pressure and knee pain. Any other medical conditions he’s noted, or anything else that’s been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Let me think… he did mention my cholesterol a while back. Said it was a little high, but nothing that a bit of walking couldn’t help with. Though my knees don’t always agree with that suggestion. Oh, and I’ve been a bit forgetful lately. Not anything serious, mind you, just… misplacing things, forgetting names… things like that. It’s frustrating, but Dr. Evans said it’s probably just a normal part of getting older. He didn't seem too concerned.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, as a young man, I had my appendix removed. That was… oh, goodness, nearly sixty years ago now! And… and I had a bit of work done on my shoulder after I fell off a ladder while fixing the roof. That was… maybe thirty years ago? Nothing major, mind you. Both times I recovered well.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything put in front of me, though I’ve always preferred simple foods. My mother used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. I suppose that might be why I’ve lived to be eighty-one.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. A small tablet for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And… oh, sometimes I take a little ibuprofen for my knees when they’re really bothering me. But that’s only when I absolutely need to. Not every day, mind you. Oh, and I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, Dr. Evans recommended it. Keeps my bones strong, he said.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him. Not a good habit. Always told my daughter to stay away from them as well.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, Doctor. Nothing heavy. A bit of red wine, usually. My daughter and I will share a bottle when she visits. It’s… a nice tradition. Nothing more than that, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That sounds perfectly reasonable. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had a bit of trouble with her heart in her later years. And my father… he had diabetes. But that was a long time ago. My sister, she had some trouble with arthritis. Nothing too serious on my mother’s side, as far as I can recall. My grandparents… well, I don’t really know much about their medical history. They didn’t talk about such things much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I've got nothing to hide. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit here for me. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, though a slight murmur is audible. Nothing concerning at this time. Lungs are clear. Now, I'll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148 over 82. As expected, given Dr. Evans’ notes. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Could you bend them for me, slowly and gently?
PATIENT: Alright, here we go. Ooh, that’s a bit stiff. They're not what they used to be, I tell you that. It's mostly on the inside, feels like a grating sort of pain. And they click a bit. Does that help you see something?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some swelling and hear the crepitus as you bend them. There’s tenderness along the inner joint line of both knees. Range of motion is limited, but not severely. This is consistent with osteoarthritis. I’m also going to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological assessment, just to get a complete picture. Reflexes are normal. And can you tell me your name and the date, just to assess your memory?
PATIENT: My name is Lennie Tkac, and today is… let me see… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I remember it clearly. My daughter always reminds me to write it down on the calendar. Keeps me on track, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Tkac. Everything seems to be in good order for your age. The osteoarthritis in your knees is the most significant finding, and the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we can monitor. Now, based on this exam and your medical history, and keeping in mind your desire to move to Meadowbrook, I don’t see any immediate medical contraindications. However, I would like to run a few simple blood tests just to get a baseline and check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and Vitamin D levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Blood tests are no trouble at all. Anything to make sure I’m fit enough for Meadowbrook. My daughter will be very pleased to hear this. What do I need to do? Where do I go for those tests?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to send the order to the lab just across the street – the one in the Meadowbrook Plaza. They take walk-ins, so you shouldn’t have to wait too long. I'll also give you a slip with the specific tests listed. You don’t need to fast for this particular set of tests, but it is best to stay hydrated. Once the results come back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan for managing your blood pressure and knee pain. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly agreeable, Doctor. Right across the street, you say? Easy enough. And no fasting? Even better. My daughter will be glad to know all this. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease. Now, is there anything else I need to do before I go?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t think so. Just head over to the lab when you have a moment. I’ll have the results sent to me electronically, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Here's a brochure with our contact information. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything. You've been very thorough and kind. Thank you again for your time and attention. I'm feeling much more confident about this move to Meadowbrook now. I'll be sure to get those tests done right away. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
