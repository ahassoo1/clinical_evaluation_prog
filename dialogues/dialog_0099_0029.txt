DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Obarr. Norval, is it?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. Norval Obarr. And please, call me Norval. Mr. Obarr makes me feel… old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. Let’s not dwell on feelings, shall we?
PATIENT: Fair enough, Doc. Just gettin’ old is what I mean. But, yeah, that’s me. I came in 'cause… well, I don’t eat much before I feel full. It’s been happenin’ for a while now, and my wife, bless her heart, she's worried.
DOCTOR: “Not much before feeling full.” Right. So, you’re experiencing early satiety?
PATIENT: Early… what now? Sorry, Doc. You lost me a little. I just feel full really quick when I eat. Is that what you mean? I don't really know all those big words.
DOCTOR: It means you get full very quickly. Yes. How long has this been happening, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, I’d say maybe six, seven months ago? It wasn't sudden, just kinda crept up on me. At first, I just figured I wasn’t as hungry as I used to be. Now it’s… well, it's a bother. I used to enjoy a good meal, but… not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: And what exactly do you typically eat in a day now, Norval?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast is usually just a piece of toast and some tea. Sometimes a little oatmeal if I’m feelin’ ambitious. Lunch… usually a small sandwich. Ham and cheese, maybe. And dinner… oh, I don’t know. A bit of fish, or some chicken. Small portions, though. Real small. Honestly, my wife does most of the cookin’ so I can't tell you exact amounts. She’s a good cook, always has been. I just… don’t eat as much of it anymore, ‘cause I get full so fast.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Not really… well, I've lost a bit of weight, I guess. But I figured that was just gettin' older too. And… sometimes I feel a little tired, but who doesn't, eh? My stomach feels… kinda full even before I eat sometimes, which is weird. Like, bloated. But it doesn't last long. Just comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Bloated, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just a little. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. Like I've eaten too much, even when I haven’t. It happens maybe a couple of times a week. It usually goes away after an hour or so. It's hard to explain. It's not a constant thing, just pops up now and then. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… vague. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Never any vomiting. And I haven't felt sick to my stomach, not even once. It's just… the fullness, and the little bit of bloat sometimes. That’s all. I just wish I could enjoy a good meal again. My wife makes a lovely roast, but I can only manage a few bites now. It’s a shame, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, Doc. Whatever you need. Just tell me what you’re lookin’ for. And be gentle, alright? Old bones and all that. Ouch, that’s a bit tender there, on the left side.
DOCTOR: Tenderness… interesting. No masses palpable. Bowel sounds are… present, albeit a little diminished. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… well, let me think. Not really, not major ones. It's been pretty regular, all things considered. Maybe a little… softer sometimes, but nothing to write home about. And I’ve been goin’ less often, if anything. But I figured that was just gettin' older too, you know? Things slow down. It’s a delicate subject, Doc.
DOCTOR: Of course. Given your age and symptoms – early satiety, unintentional weight loss, bloating, and altered bowel habits – there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. While it could be something benign, we can’t rule out more serious conditions. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test. We should also consider imaging - a CT scan of your abdomen would give us a better look.
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on there, Doc. A CT scan? Sounds… serious. What kind of “serious conditions” are we talkin’ about? I just thought I was eatin’ less. I don't want to go gettin' poked and prodded if it's just my old stomach acting up. Is that really necessary? And a stool test? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, with respect, "just your old stomach" isn't a diagnosis. These tests are necessary to rule out things like gastric cancer, or other serious digestive issues. While it's likely nothing that alarming, we need to investigate. The CT scan is standard procedure given your symptoms, and the stool test will check for any abnormalities. I understand your concerns, but delaying investigation could have consequences. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any family history of cancer, particularly stomach or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Cancer… oh dear. My mother… she had stomach trouble for years, but they never really figured out what it was. She passed away when I was young. And my uncle, on my wife's side, he had colon cancer. But that was years ago. Nobody talks about it much. Look, Doc, I don’t like the sound of any of this. I just wanted to know why I'm not hungry anymore, not… not have all these tests. Can't we just… try something else first? Maybe some medicine? Or a change in diet? I really don't want to go through all that poking and prodding. It's a bit frightening, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, I understand your anxiety. However, simply prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible. We need to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. While I appreciate your concerns about the tests, they are crucial. Delaying them could allow a potential issue to progress. I will, of course, explain the procedures thoroughly and ensure you are as comfortable as possible. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled. I will arrange the referrals for you, and my nurse will contact you to coordinate the appointments. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Alright, alright. You're right. Gotta get it checked out, I suppose. Just… please, Doc, explain everything real good before you do anything. And try not to poke too much, eh? My wife will have my hide if I come home bruised. So, what's the first step? Which test do I gotta do first? And how long will it all take? I’m not a fan of hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright. The first step is the blood work and stool test. These can be done at the lab just across the street. I’m giving you a referral form; they will need your insurance information, though you mentioned you aren't insured, we can work with them. That’ll take about an hour. Then, we'll schedule the CT scan. I’ll have my nurse book that for you; it usually takes a couple of days to get an appointment. The CT scan itself is relatively quick, about 20-30 minutes, and you’ll need to drink a contrast dye beforehand. My nurse, Sarah, is very good at explaining things, and she’ll answer any questions you have. She'll contact you tomorrow. For now, focus on getting the blood work and stool test done. Any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? What’s that for? Is it… dangerous? And will it hurt? I always get nervous with needles. Oh dear, this is a lot to take in. I think… I think that’s all for now. Just… let me get this done, and I'll let Sarah explain the rest. Thank you, Doc. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: The contrast dye helps us visualize your internal organs more clearly on the CT scan. It’s generally very safe, though some people experience a mild metallic taste or a warm sensation. As for the needle, it's a routine blood draw. Nothing to worry about. Alright. Get the tests done, and we’ll go from there. Sarah will be in touch. And try not to stress yourself too much. .
