DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh. Dr... Duplichan, you say? Fine name. Well, I been... feelin' kinda winded. Like I climbed a lot of stairs, even when I ain't. And my mouth... always feels like the desert. Eyes too, scratchy. It's been goin' on... a while now, I guess. Don't remember exactly when it started. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: "Old age, probably" isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Guilds. We'll get to the bottom of this. Let's start with the shortness of breath – the feeling of being winded. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: When it happens…? Hmm. Not when… more like where. It happens when I… walk to the mailbox, maybe. Or tryin’ to help my neighbor with his car. Little things, you know? It ain’t like I’m runnin’ a marathon. I used to be able to do all that stuff without thinkin’ about it. Now… not so much. Honestly, Doc, everything’s harder now.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's exertion-related shortness of breath. And you've noticed a change in your ability to perform everyday activities. How about the dry mouth and eyes?
PATIENT: Dry mouth… and eyes. Yeah. It's… always there. Like cotton. I drink water, sure, but it doesn't stay gone for long. And my eyes… I gotta blink a lot. Especially when I’m lookin’ at the TV. Everything’s just… dry. It’s annoying, that’s what it is. Real annoying. I don’t know what’s causin’ it, but it's not pleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any chest pain with this shortness of breath, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Nah. Not really. Maybe a little… ache sometimes, but it’s nothin’ to write home about. Swelling? I look down at my feet sometimes, but they look pretty normal to me. I used to be a pretty good dancer, you know. Always lookin’ at my feet. They ain't puffy now, if that's what you mean. They just... old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, the doctor back in Havana, he said somethin’ about my pressure bein’ a little high once. Years ago, that was. Gave me some pills, I think. But I stopped takin’ ‘em after a while. Didn't feel like I needed ‘em. Heart problems… not that I know of. I smoked a few cigars back in the day, but who didn't? Don’t see the point in worryin’ about things you can’t change.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… like I said, nothin’ really. Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis now and then. Some kinda cream, I rub on my hands. And sometimes a pain pill if it's real bad. But that's it. I don't like takin' pills, Doc. They make me feel… sluggish. I prefer to just tough it out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to family history. Does anyone in your family have a history of heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmmm. My mama, she lived a long life. But she had… somethin’ with her breathin' when she got older. Not sure what it was. Just… coughed a lot. My papa, he was strong as an ox. Never got sick a day in his life, as far as I know. A lot of my cousins smoked, though. Back in Cuba, everybody smoked! Honestly, Doc, keepin' track of all that is like tryin' to count the stars.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to recall. Okay, and finally, how about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? What's that even mean? I live alone, if that's what you're askin'. Always been a bit of a loner, I guess. Used to go to the dance hall back in Havana, but that was a long time ago. Now I mostly stay home, watch TV, maybe help out the neighbor with his car. Not much excitement in my life these days. And I did quit smokin’ years ago, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I think we have enough information to start. Now, Mr. Guilds, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your oxygen saturation. Can you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Oxygen… saturation…? Sounds complicated. Relax, you say? Always been a bit of a worrier, Doc. But alright. Just get it over with quick, if you don't mind. And try not to poke too much. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's listen to your heart. Please take a deep breath... and exhale. Heart sounds are somewhat diminished, but regular rhythm. No murmurs detected. Now, lungs. Take a deep breath in... and out... again... Slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, with some mild wheezing. Blood pressure is elevated – 150 over 90. And your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. So, based on this preliminary exam, it seems you have some shortness of breath, dry mouth, and elevated blood pressure. Your oxygen levels are slightly low, and your lungs have some wheezing. I’m going to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies...? Hmmm. Not that I know of. I haven't had much trouble with pills, but I don’t go seekin' 'em out, either. Used to be a fella, back in Havana, he gave me somethin' for a rash once, but that was ages ago. I don’t think I reacted to it or nothin'. Honestly, Doc, I'm a pretty tough old bird. I’ve survived a lot worse than a few pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, regardless, we’ll proceed cautiously. I'm writing up the orders for the blood work and X-ray now. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician will be expecting you. Once those results are back, we’ll discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. I also recommend you try to increase your fluid intake, and I will prescribe an over-the-counter artificial saliva to help with the dry mouth. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Artificial… saliva…? Sounds… strange. Increase fluids, you say? I drink water. Sometimes. Doc, are you sure all these tests are necessary? Sounds expensive. And frankly, I ain't got much time to be runnin’ around to labs and… technicians. Just tell me what's wrong, if you can.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concerns. However, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. Your symptoms—shortness of breath, low oxygen saturation, elevated blood pressure—are concerning and require proper evaluation. It's essential to rule out any serious underlying conditions, such as heart failure, pneumonia, or COPD. The tests I’ve ordered will help me determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Delaying diagnosis could lead to further complications. I understand cost is a concern, and we can discuss potential financial assistance programs if needed. But your health is paramount. Are you willing to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You win. I don’t like all this fuss, but… I don't want to end up… worse. Financial assistance… you say? Maybe. I got a little somethin’ saved up, but it don’t go far. Just… get it over with quick, Doc. And don’t poke too much, alright? I’m an old man.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab technician come and get you when they’re ready. After the lab work, you’ll proceed to the X-ray department. I will review the results as soon as they are available, and we will discuss them then. In the meantime, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Here’s some information about managing your symptoms while we await the results. And if your shortness of breath worsens significantly, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Emergency room…? Sounds… serious. I think I got the gist of it, Doc. Rest, drink water… avoid emergency rooms. Honestly, Doc, you’re makin’ me nervous. But alright. I’ll go do the tests. Just… try not to take too long, alright? I got things to do. .
DOCTOR: I will do my best, Mr. Guilds. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you experience any changes in your condition. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. .
