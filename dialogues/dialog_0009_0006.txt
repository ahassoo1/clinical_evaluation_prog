DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up… some blood. It scared me a little, so I thought I should come see someone. It’s not a lot of blood, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe… a week ago? At first, it was just a little bit, like… streaks in the mucus when I cough. But yesterday, it was more. Still not a huge amount, but… more noticeable. I did not feel any pain, though. Just… surprised. And worried, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jeannemarie. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. And it’s helpful to know there hasn’t been any pain. Now, could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it’s a dry cough, mostly. Not much… phlegm usually. Sometimes, when I lie down, it feels worse. Like something is… tickling my throat. It doesn’t hurt, just… irritating. I have not been sick, not with a cold or anything, for a long time. Maybe a little tired lately, but I thought that was just… getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough that’s worse when lying down, and no recent illness. And you’ve noticed some fatigue. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I don’t think I have had chills. I haven’t felt cold, anyway. And… night sweats? I… I don’t know what those feel like, exactly. I sleep with a blanket, usually, because I sometimes get cold at night, but… is that the same thing?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jeannemarie. Night sweats are when you wake up drenched in sweat, even if the room isn’t hot. So, it sounds like you haven’t experienced those. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had pneumonia… a long time ago. When I was maybe… twenty? I was in the hospital for a little while. And… no, I don’t think so, nothing else. I have always been… pretty healthy, usually. Just… the pneumonia, a very long time ago. And… my husband… he had heart problems, but that was him, not me.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband, Jeannemarie. It’s good to know you haven’t had any other significant medical issues. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I have not had any surgeries. I… I don't like hospitals very much, so I try to avoid them if I can. Just the pneumonia when I was young… that was bad enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes, if I have a headache, I take… ibuprofen, maybe? But that is very rare. I try to just… rest if I feel unwell. Oh! I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes in the winter, because the doctor told me I was a little low. But that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just occasional ibuprofen and a vitamin D supplement. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I have never had a reaction to any medicine. My husband was allergic to shellfish, but… I am fine.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I have never smoked. My husband smoked for a long time, but I… I always told him it was bad for him. I did not like the smell. I am very careful about my health, usually.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that information, Jeannemarie. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll also take your temperature and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your lungs sound relatively clear, although I do hear a very subtle wheeze on the right side. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your temperature is 98.6°F. Your lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling detected. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam, the blood you're coughing up, even a small amount, needs further investigation. The subtle wheeze I heard is also something to look into. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum culture to help determine the cause of your cough and bleeding. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think that is best, Doctor, then please do. A chest X-ray and… a sputum culture. I don’t know what that is, exactly, but… if it will help, then yes. What does it involve?
DOCTOR: A sputum culture involves collecting a sample of the mucus you cough up from your lungs. A respiratory therapist will guide you on how to do a deep, controlled cough to bring up a sample. It might feel a little strange, but it’s not painful. We'll send the sample to the lab to see if any bacteria or other organisms are present. The chest X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart to look for any abnormalities like pneumonia, bronchitis, or other potential causes of your bleeding. It's a quick and painless procedure. I'll write the orders for both tests now. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the X-ray. And the nurse will give you instructions on how to collect the sputum sample before you leave. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and staying well-hydrated. If the bleeding worsens or you develop a fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Okay. That… doesn’t sound too bad. A little strange, maybe, but not too bad. I understand. Avoid strenuous activity and stay hydrated. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I think I can remember that. Um… will the tests… will they tell me what’s wrong? I am very worried, you see. It's just… scary coughing up blood.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Jeannemarie. It is scary coughing up blood, and it’s perfectly natural to be anxious. These tests will give us valuable information to help determine the cause of your symptoms. The chest X-ray can show us if there are any obvious problems with your lungs, like an infection or a blockage. The sputum culture will tell us if any bacteria are causing an infection, and if so, what type. Based on the results, we can then decide on the best course of treatment, whether that’s antibiotics, further testing, or other interventions. It's possible the cause is something relatively minor, like a mild bronchitis, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. We'll discuss the results as soon as they're available, and I'll explain everything clearly. I will be following up with you after the results come back, in about 2-3 business days. Is there a preferred phone number where I can reach you?
PATIENT: That… that makes me feel a little better, thank you. Knowing we are trying to find out what’s wrong. And that it might be something… not too serious. My phone number is 555-123-4567. 555-123-4567. I think I understand everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. And your kindness.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I have your number noted as 555-123-4567. You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. The nurse will come in shortly to give you instructions for collecting the sputum sample, and she'll also provide a prescription for a cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms until we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms, please go to the emergency room. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You have answered everything I was worried about. I will wait for the nurse, and I will try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor Petrimoulx. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I’m glad I could help. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
