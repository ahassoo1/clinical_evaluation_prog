DOCTOR: Hello Jahaad, welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It's August 2nd, and I see you’re 25 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve noticed some swelling, mostly in my… I think it’s my face, but perhaps other places too. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. I don’t quite recall when it started, or what might have caused it.
DOCTOR: Okay, "vague" is alright, we can definitely work with that. So, swelling… primarily in the face, you said, but potentially elsewhere?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. The face is where I notice it most, certainly. But… sometimes I feel it in my hands, perhaps? Or my feet? It’s hard to be certain, honestly. It comes and goes, and I don’t pay close enough attention, I suppose. It doesn’t hurt, which is good, but it’s… concerning, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right, no pain, that’s good to know. And it's intermittent, comes and goes. Just to be clear, when you say swelling, is it like puffiness, or more like… a firm feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I would say… puffiness, yes. Not hard, definitely not firm. More like… when you haven’t slept enough? A sort of soft… fullness? Is that making sense? It’s difficult to describe, Doctor. I apologize for being so unclear.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, you're describing it just fine. "Soft fullness" is helpful. And how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: That’s… the hardest part, truly. I wish I could give you a better answer. I believe… several weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month or two? It’s difficult to pinpoint. It comes and goes in waves, so there were times I didn't notice it at all. It hasn’t been a constant thing, thankfully. I really wish I could be more precise. I just… don’t remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, several weeks to a couple of months, intermittent. Have you noticed anything else happening around the same time this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Nothing that immediately comes to mind, no. No fever, no rash, no… change in appetite, I don't believe. I've been sleeping alright, generally. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to work. It’s… honestly, I haven’t been paying very close attention to anything else. Is there anything specific I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, rash, appetite changes, just a little more fatigue. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve always been… quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I had a check-up last year, and everything was normal, as far as I recall. But… again, my memory isn't what it used to be. I don't readily remember the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No prior medical conditions, normal check-up last year. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat most things without issue. I’ve taken antibiotics before, for… a sore throat, I think, and I didn’t have any problems with those. I don’t think I’ve ever had an allergic reaction to anything, but I can’t be absolutely certain, I suppose. It’s just… not something I’ve ever had to consider before.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible, honestly. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps, but I don't take anything regularly. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I'm generally quite… careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we don't really discuss medical history much, truthfully. My mother is healthy, as far as I know. She’s quite private. My father… he passed away several years ago. He had… heart problems, I believe, but I wasn't very close to him, and I don't know the specifics. Nothing else immediately comes to mind. It’s not something we’ve ever really talked about openly. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… not a topic we’ve addressed much in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, father had heart problems, mother is healthy. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but very infrequently. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m very health-conscious, Doctor, and I avoid those things entirely. I lead a fairly… quiet life, truthfully. I work a lot, and I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, very health-conscious. That’s good. Now, can you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm a Speech-Language Pathologist. I work with patients who have difficulty with communication and swallowing. It's… a very rewarding job, but it can be quite demanding. I'm on my feet a lot, and I have to be very focused. It's a good job, though. I enjoy helping people. I work at a clinic, mostly with adults. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a Speech-Language Pathologist. That sounds demanding. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I hope I’m not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to feel around your face and neck. Don’t worry, this won’t hurt. I do notice some mild puffiness around your eyes and cheeks. It’s subtle, but it's there. No significant asymmetry. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no enlargement or tenderness. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, can you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Is everything alright? I sometimes worry unnecessarily, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal in your mouth. No obvious signs of infection or inflammation. Okay, one last thing. Could you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that too tight? I want to be helpful, but I don't want to cause any discomfort.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfect. Your grip strength seems normal. Alright, that completes the quick exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some mild edema – puffiness – primarily in your face. The fact that it comes and goes and isn’t painful is reassuring, but we need to investigate further to determine the cause. Given your history, I suspect it could be related to fluid retention, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work and a urine test. These tests will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and protein levels. It's also worth checking your thyroid function, just to be on the safe side. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and a urine test… I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to figure out what’s going on. Fluid retention… it sounds a bit worrying, but I trust your judgment. I’m grateful for your thoroughness. When can I expect the results? And will I need to schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll order those tests right away. The results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. The lab will contact you directly to schedule the blood draw. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to discuss them and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you notice any significant changes – like difficulty breathing, sudden weight gain, or worsening swelling – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You've explained everything very clearly, and I feel much more reassured. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness and patience. I will be sure to contact the clinic if anything changes. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Thank you for coming in today, Jahaad. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor Roseburrough. Thank you again. .
