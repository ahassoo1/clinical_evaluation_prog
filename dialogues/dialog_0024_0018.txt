DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit… difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be going to the bathroom rather frequently. More than usual, certainly. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. A few weeks, maybe? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s just… a lot of trips.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And is this… just frequency, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… I believe so, yes. It doesn't hurt, exactly. It's just… a lot of liquid. More than I typically drink, I don't think. Or maybe I am drinking more… it’s hard to say. I find myself constantly aware of needing to find a restroom, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Constantly aware… Right. And have you noticed any changes in the appearance of the urine itself?
PATIENT: Appearance? Oh dear… I haven't been paying close attention to that, Doctor. I… truthfully, I don't recall noticing anything different. Is there something I should be looking for? It sounds like a rather… personal examination. Perhaps I’m not the best person to ask about that detail.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, a proper medical assessment requires a certain level of… attentiveness. But very well. Let's move on. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or abdominal pain alongside this increased frequency?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever or chills, thankfully. And no… abdominal pain, not that I’ve noticed. Though, now that you mention it, perhaps a little… discomfort? A vague feeling, not a sharp pain, just… a general sluggishness in my stomach, perhaps? But it could be something I ate. I had some… cabbage yesterday. It sometimes affects me that way.
DOCTOR: Cabbage, yes. Alright. And are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no nausea or vomiting, and my appetite seems normal enough. I still enjoy a good meal, though I haven’t been particularly hungry lately, if that makes sense. It's just… a lack of strong craving, not a disinterest in food. It's a subtle difference, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s review your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see here you have a history of… hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Any recent changes to your medication regimen?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the blood pressure. Yes, I take that little pill every morning. No, Doctor, no changes to the medication. Same dosage, same routine. I’ve been quite diligent about it, I believe. I try to stay on schedule. My wife used to remind me, but… well, never mind. It’s just me now, keeping track of things.
DOCTOR: Right. And any past surgeries or hospitalizations I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, a very long time ago. And I was hospitalized for a bout of pneumonia, perhaps ten years ago? It was a mild case, thankfully. Nothing major, really. Nothing since then that I can recall. I tend to avoid doctors if possible, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding your family history… are there any instances of kidney disease, diabetes, or prostate issues in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My father… he wasn’t a very forthcoming man. And my mother… she passed away when I was young. I don't believe anyone suffered from kidney disease, not that I know of. My uncle, perhaps? He had some sort of ailment, but I don’t recall the details. It was a very long time ago, and we weren’t close.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, regarding your social history… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. I do not smoke. I have never been one for it. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a week. A small glass, nothing excessive, I assure you. And definitely no… recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Verbos, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. We'll start with checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll need a urine sample. Can you please follow me to the examination room?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. A urine sample… right. I suppose I should have anticipated that. Lead the way, please. I do hope it won’t be too… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Follow me. And please, try to relax. It’s a routine procedure. Now, if you’ll just step on the scale… height and weight first, if you don’t mind. I see here you are 182 centimeters and 141 kilograms. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds about right. Perhaps a bit under 141, if I'm being honest, but close enough. I haven’t weighed myself recently, so I'm relying on your instruments, naturally. It’s a bit… sensitive, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is a medical-grade scale, Mr. Verbos. Now, if you’ll just stand still… Now, please, have a seat. I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, if you would.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Deep breaths… like this? It feels a bit… strained. I haven't been very active lately, I'm afraid. Mostly just reading and… thinking.
DOCTOR: Your breathing is somewhat labored, and I detect a slight wheezing. Now, I need a urine sample. There's a cup in the restroom. Please collect a mid-stream sample. Instructions are posted on the wall. I’ll be right outside.
PATIENT: Oh, right. A mid-stream sample… Yes, I believe I recall the instructions. It’s been a while since I’ve had to do this. Mid-stream… yes, that's the important part. Hopefully, I remember correctly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, let’s take a look at this sample. Hmm. We have some protein in the urine, and a slightly elevated specific gravity. This indicates some level of dehydration, and potentially, an issue with your kidneys. I'm going to order a complete urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel to get a clearer picture. It will include kidney function tests.
PATIENT: Oh dear… kidney issues? That doesn't sound very pleasant, Doctor. Dehydration, I can understand, I haven't been drinking as much water lately. But an issue with my kidneys… Is it serious? What does this mean? I'm not a young man anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Mr. Verbos. These are preliminary findings. The tests will give us a more definitive answer. However, the protein in your urine can indicate kidney damage. And the elevated specific gravity suggests your kidneys are working harder than they should to conserve water. I'm also noting your labored breathing and slight wheezing. I recommend you schedule an appointment with a pulmonologist to evaluate that as well. For now, I’m ordering these tests. The lab results should be available in a few days. I’ll contact you as soon as they are in. Increase your fluid intake significantly—at least eight glasses of water a day—and try to reduce your salt consumption. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, my… that’s… a lot to take in, Doctor. A pulmonologist, more tests… It seems my body is rather… failing me. Eight glasses of water… yes, I can manage that. Salt… I do enjoy a bit of salt on my potatoes. Will these tests… will they be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? A few days feels like a very long time when you’re… uncertain.
DOCTOR: The blood work is routine, Mr. Verbos—a simple prick of the finger. The urinalysis is, as you know, a sample. There will be no discomfort. As for the results, I assure you the lab prioritizes these matters. “A few days” is a reasonable estimate. I’m writing you a requisition for the blood work and urinalysis. Take this to the lab at [Lab Name and Address]. They will schedule the appointment for you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Increase your water intake, reduce your salt, and schedule that appointment with the pulmonologist. That is all I can advise you at this time. .
