DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Astore, it's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Batara. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s my legs, mostly. They been getting weaker. Not all at once, you understand. Slow, like. A little harder to walk each day, it feels like. It’s…troubling. I’ve had this…condition for a long time now, the doctors told me. Multiple…something. It’s just getting harder to do things.
DOCTOR: “Multiple something,” you say… Let me just confirm here… Ah, yes. Multiple sclerosis. Diagnosed approximately 15 years ago, according to the record. And you’re right to be concerned about the weakening legs. It’s good you’re paying attention to changes. Now, when you say “each day, it feels like,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, Multiple…sclerosis. Fifteen years…seems long ago now. Um…specific. Let me think. It's not like I wake up completely unable to walk. It’s more…when I stand for a while, my legs feel…heavy. Like they are full of water, maybe? And sometimes, when I walk, my foot…drags a little. Not always, but more and more. It's hard to explain. It's just…less easy. Less strong. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Astore. “Heavy” and “dragging”…those are good descriptions. So it’s primarily noticeable with standing and walking, and it’s been a gradual worsening. Have you noticed it more on one leg than the other?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Gradual, that’s a good word. It hasn't been sudden. And…yes, actually. It’s the left leg, I think. It feels weaker, and the dragging is more on that side. Not a lot, but enough that I notice it. I try not to favor it too much, but sometimes…it’s hard. I used to be quite the swimmer, you know. Now even walking across the room…takes a bit of thought.
DOCTOR: A swimmer…interesting. Well, that's good to know about your previous activity level. It helps me understand where you're starting from. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to assess things. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, I used to swim almost every day. Kept me very fit. Here we go. A little slow, I’m afraid. But I can stand. Just fine for a bit, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap a little hammer on your knees and ankles. Just relax. Hmm… reflexes are a little diminished on the left side, as expected. Now, can you walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. Here you go. A little wobbly, maybe. I try to walk normally, but…it’s hard to say what normal is anymore.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. There is a slight difference in your gait, particularly on the left side, with some mild weakness and a slightly shuffling step. Now, can you stand on your toes, and then on your heels?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here we go. The toes are…harder. And the heels…even harder, I’m afraid. My balance isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I suspected. Weakness in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion on the left, and some balance impairment. Alright, Mr. Astore. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it does seem your multiple sclerosis is experiencing a flare-up. It’s not unexpected, but we need to investigate further. I want to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to get a better look at the lesions and see if there’s any new activity. And I'll also order some blood work to rule out any other possible causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI…yes, I’ve had those before. Not pleasant, but I understand they’re helpful. And blood work…that’s fine too. Anything that can help figure this out, Doctor. A flare-up…is that…serious? Will I…get worse? I just want to understand. And I have my wife, she worries, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Astore, a flare-up simply means your symptoms are worsening, and it indicates increased inflammation in your nervous system. It doesn't necessarily mean you will get significantly worse, but it does mean we need to address it promptly. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of the extent of the activity and help us determine the best course of treatment. We have several options available – medications to reduce inflammation, physical therapy to maintain your strength and mobility, and supportive care to manage your symptoms. It’s a process, and we’ll work through it together. I’ll be honest with you, a proactive approach to managing your MS is key. Now, do you have any allergies to contrast dye, which is often used in MRIs?
PATIENT: That…that sounds reassuring, Doctor. A process. Yes, I like that. And proactive…that's good advice. I do want to be proactive. My wife will be pleased to hear that. Contrast dye…hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve had MRIs before, as I said, and I don’t recall any trouble with dye. But…let me ask my wife. She keeps better track of things like that than I do, I’m afraid. She’ll know for sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please do check with your wife. I'll have the MRI order sent to your preferred facility and the lab requisition for the blood work ready for you. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results, to discuss them in detail and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to avoid overexertion and maintain a healthy diet. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your time, and for explaining things so clearly. I’ll ask my wife about the dye, and we’ll get the tests scheduled as soon as possible. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions before your follow-up. .
