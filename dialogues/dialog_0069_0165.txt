DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. Been gettin' these fevers on and off, and honestly, it’s startin' to worry me. It’s been goin’ on for… well, a bit now. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Just want it to stop, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Clide. I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “A bit now” is okay, we can narrow it down. Can you tell me anything more specific about these fevers?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. They come and go. Usually in the evenin', I think. Not always, but mostly. Makes me feel kinda weak, achy all over. No cough, no nothin' like that. Just… hot, then cold. Like a bad chill even with a blanket. And it goes away, then comes back a few days later. It's just… annoying, more than anything. I haven’t taken my temperature regularly, if that matters. My wife usually does that, and she’s at her sister’s this week.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, fevers, primarily in the evenings, with chills and body aches. No cough or other respiratory symptoms. And they come and go over a few days. It sounds quite bothersome. When you say “achy all over,” can you pinpoint where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Mostly in my back, to be honest. Lower back. That’s why I thought maybe it was somethin' with my spine, you know? I've been seein' a chiropractor for years, but it feels…different this time. Not like the usual stiffness. It’s a deeper ache, harder to shake. And it spreads to my hips sometimes. Makes gettin' out of bed a real chore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower back pain is a significant part of this, and it feels different from your typical chiropractic issues. Does anything specifically make the back pain worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Bendin' over. Definitely bendin' over. And standin' for too long. If I’m on my feet for more than an hour or so, it really flares up. Sittin' is alright, usually. But bendin’…forget about it. Hurts somethin’ awful. I try to take it easy, but I gotta keep movin', you know? Can't just sit around all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're staying active, but we want to be mindful of not making things worse. Okay, so bending and prolonged standing aggravate the pain. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fevers and back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. No, not really. I haven't lost weight. Appetite’s fine, maybe a little less when I got the fever, but nothin’ major. No headaches, no nausea, no… skin rashes, nothin' like that. I mean, I’m 65, Doc, things ache all the time, you know? It’s hard to say what’s new and what’s just…old.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it can be difficult to differentiate, especially at 65. No weight loss, good appetite, no headaches, nausea, or rashes. That’s all good information. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a pill for it, usually keeps it under control. And arthritis, in my knees mostly. That’s why I see the chiropractor, helps with that. Otherwise… not much. Had the usual childhood stuff, but nothin’ serious. No surgeries, no nothin’ like that. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis in your knees. That's helpful to know. Can you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s a little white pill… My wife handles all that stuff. She'll kill me if I get it wrong. Uh… I think it starts with an “A”? Amlodipine, maybe? Is that right? Amlodipine… Yes, I think that’s it. I take one every mornin'.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. That's very good. And you take one tablet every morning. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I can eat anything, take most pills… My wife always checks, but I’ve never had a problem. She’s very careful with that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No known allergies. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your temperature, blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your back and abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just try not to bend me too much. That back of mine is complainin' enough as it is. Let’s get this over with, if you don’t mind. I got things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brege. We'll take it easy. Alright, your temperature is a little elevated at 100.3. Blood pressure is slightly high, but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound good. Your lower back is definitely tender to the touch and feels a bit tight. Do you feel any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. It stays in my back, mostly. Sometimes a little ache in my hips, but nothin' travelin' down my legs. No pins and needles, no numbness, nothin' like that. Just a dull ache, that's all. That tightness you feel… that’s what bothers me the most, I think. Feels like somethin’s pulled, but it doesn’t go away. Been like this for a couple of weeks now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No pain radiating down your legs, just the tightness and dull ache localized to your lower back for a couple of weeks. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you may have a muscle strain complicated by a possible low-grade fever. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood work to check for infection and inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Ugh. Okay, Doc, if you think it’s necessary. Just try to make it quick, alright? I don't like needles, never have. And is it gonna cost me a fortune? I ain't insured, you know. My wife is gonna kill me if I run up a big bill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brege. I’ll keep it as quick and painless as possible. And we’ll discuss the costs upfront. I’ll also see what resources we have available to help with the expense. The blood work will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll be checking a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and some inflammatory markers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Inflammatory... markers? Look, Doc, I'm just a simple man. You can just tell me if I got somethin' bad or not. All these fancy words... Complete blood count, whatever. Just do what you gotta do and let's get this over with. I trust you, I guess. Just promise me it won’t take all day. And tell me how much it's gonna cost before you start stickin' me with needles, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brege. I apologize for the jargon. I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. The blood work will give us information about your overall health, any potential infection, and if there’s any inflammation in your body. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and I'll review the results as soon as they come back. She’ll explain the cost to you before proceeding. It should be relatively quick. It will cost approximately $150, but we can discuss payment options if that’s a concern. Sound good?
PATIENT: $150… That's a bit steep, but alright. Just get it over with. I got stuff to do, remember? And tell the nurse to be gentle, alright? I hate needles. Just… hurry up, Doc. Let's get this done. sigh This is gonna be a long afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brege. I'll speak with the nurse and ensure she's as gentle as possible. I’ll also let you know as soon as the results are available. We’ll get you sorted out as quickly as we can.
