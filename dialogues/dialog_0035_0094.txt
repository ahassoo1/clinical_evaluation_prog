DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Airam. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh... hello. Yes. My husband... he said I should come. Something about... learning things? I don't really remember what he said exactly. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it's good that you're here. It sounds like your husband is concerned about something. No problem at all. We can definitely figure things out. "Learning things" is a little vague – can you tell me anything more specific about why he thought you should come in?
PATIENT: Specific...? No. He just said… the metal. Something about the metal I work with. He thinks it’s… bad? I cut it, bend it, you know. Sheet metal. It’s my job. I don’t know what he wants me to learn about it. It doesn't feel bad. Mostly. Sometimes my hands ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, sheet metal work. And your husband is concerned about that… possibly affecting your health?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds right. He keeps talking about... dust? And... getting sick. He reads too many things online, I think. It's just work. My father did it, and his father before him. We didn't… learn anything special. It just is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this has been a long-standing family profession. And it's good that your husband is being cautious, even if he is reading things online. Sometimes, there are risks associated with certain jobs that are worth being aware of. Just to be thorough, and to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the type of metal you work with?
PATIENT: Type…? Silver-colored stuff. Sometimes shiny, sometimes not. Not gold, definitely not gold. Big sheets of it. We cut it for… buildings? And… things. Air ducts, I think my husband said. Is this important? I don't know what kinds of metal there are. It’s just… metal.
DOCTOR: It is important, but don’t worry, you don’t need to be an expert! Knowing what kind of metal helps me understand potential risks. Silver-colored... building materials and air ducts. Okay. Do you know if it’s aluminum, steel, or something else?
PATIENT: No! I really don’t know. I just… use the tools. Big scissors, and… a bending machine. The boss tells me what to cut. He orders the metal. I don't ask. It's all very heavy. And sometimes, like I said, my hands hurt. But that's just from the work, right?
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's mostly the physical demands of the job causing the hand pain. But we should still check to be sure. And it’s good to rule things out. Let's talk about those hand aches for a moment. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… achey. Like when you've been holding something too tight for too long. Not sharp, not burning. Just… tired. And stiff. Especially in the mornings. And after a long day at work. It comes and goes. Sometimes I use… creams. My mother used them. They smell nice. They don’t really help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, achey, stiff, worse in the mornings and after work. The creams aren't helping much. Do you notice any numbness or tingling in your hands or fingers?
PATIENT: Numbness...? Sometimes. Yes, maybe. When it’s really cold. Or if I’ve been using the scissors for a very long time. It’s hard to… hold things properly then. It doesn’t happen often, though. I just… shake my hands out. And it goes away. It’s probably just the cold. We don’t have good heating in the workshop.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent numbness or tingling, worse with cold. That’s helpful. Now, besides the hand pain and occasional numbness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms...? Like… what kind of symptoms? I get tired, of course. Everyone gets tired. And sometimes I cough. But that’s just… the dust. There’s always dust in the workshop. It’s very annoying. My husband tells me I should wear a mask, but it’s… uncomfortable. And I can't breathe properly in it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and a cough, which you attribute to the dust in the workshop. You’ve mentioned the dust a few times. Is it a lot of dust?
PATIENT: Yes! Lots. Every time I cut the metal, it flies everywhere. White dust, mostly. Sometimes grey. It gets in your hair, your clothes… everything. The boss says it’s normal. It’s just part of the job. He's been doing it for forty years, so he should know. We try to sweep it up, but it's always there. It makes my throat scratchy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, significant dust exposure - white and grey, affecting your throat. Your husband is concerned, and you’re experiencing some symptoms. We need to consider the possibility of metal fume fever or other lung irritations. To get a better picture, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and check your hands and wrists. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam...? Metal… what? Look, I just came because my husband made me. I don’t like doctors. I feel fine. Mostly. And I don't want you poking around. I’ve always been healthy. I don’t need… an exam. Is this going to take long? I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Airam. And I appreciate you coming in despite that. I wouldn’t suggest anything I didn’t think was important. A quick exam just helps me rule things out and make sure everything is alright. It will only take a few minutes. If you're uncomfortable with a full exam, we can skip it, but I strongly recommend at least listening to your lungs, given your dust exposure and cough. Would you be okay with just that?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… the lungs. But make it quick. And don’t touch anything else. My husband will be furious if I’m late. And I don’t want to sit here all day listening to… what do you listen for, anyway? It just feels like dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, just listening to your lungs. And I'll explain what I’m listening for. I'm listening for any unusual sounds – wheezing, crackling, or anything that might indicate irritation or fluid in your lungs. It won't take long at all. If you could just take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth, that would be great. I'll need you to remove your sweater for a moment, if that’s comfortable. Deep breath in… and out… again… and one more deep breath…
PATIENT: This is… cold. And uncomfortable. I don’t hear anything unusual. It just sounds like… breathing. Like everyone else. Are you finished yet? My arms are getting chilly.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I did hear some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, which could be related to the dust exposure. It’s not severe, but it’s something to investigate further. Given your symptoms – the hand aches, occasional numbness, and cough with wheezing – and the significant dust exposure at work, I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any lung irritation or inflammation. It's a quick and simple test. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: X-ray...? Like… the kind you see on TV? With all the… radiation? I don’t like radiation. And I don’t see what good it will do. I feel fine! I've been working with metal my whole life. My father, his father… we never needed X-rays. This is just… a waste of time. And money. Tell me I’m fine and let me go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about radiation, Airam. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low, and the benefits of ruling out potential lung problems outweigh the risks. It’s a standard diagnostic tool. However, I respect your decision. We can skip the X-ray if you're truly uncomfortable. But in that case, I strongly recommend wearing a properly fitted N95 mask at work to minimize dust exposure, and I suggest you discuss this with your employer. Continued dust exposure without protection could lead to long-term respiratory issues. I can also give you a referral to a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – if you want a second opinion. Would you like me to do either of those things?
PATIENT: A mask…? Ugh. I hate masks. They’re uncomfortable. And I can’t breathe properly in them. My boss will laugh. He thinks I’m being silly. Fine. Give me the… the paper for the… lung doctor. But I’m not promising I’ll go. And I’m definitely not wearing a mask. I’ve always been healthy. I’ll be fine. Now, can I please go home? My husband is going to worry. And I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the referral form for a pulmonologist. It includes a list of specialists in the area who accept your insurance – or, in your case, lists specialists who offer a cash rate. You can choose the one that’s most convenient for you. I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision. But please, consider scheduling an appointment. Early detection is always best. Okay. Well, I’ve documented our conversation, including your symptoms and the recommendations. You can go home now. And please, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, severe cough, or shortness of breath – seek immediate medical attention. It was nice meeting you, Airam. Take care.
PATIENT: Fine. Goodbye. And… don't expect me to be back. All this fuss… over a little dust. My father would be rolling in his grave.
