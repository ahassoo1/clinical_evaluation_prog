DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Terasa. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my hearing. It comes and goes, you see. And sometimes… sometimes the room just spins. It’s a bit unsettling. My daughter, Lani, she really insisted I come. She worries, that one. I don't remember exactly when it started, honestly. It feels like it’s been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Terasa. It’s good Lani is looking out for you. Hearing changes and dizziness can be concerning, and we definitely want to figure out what’s going on. So, you said it comes and goes. Could you tell me a little more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when, you say? That’s… tricky. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Sometimes it happens when I’m at the bingo hall… but I go to bingo a lot, so it’s probably just a coincidence. Other times it’s just… random. When I’m resting, maybe? Or walking to the shops. I really can't pinpoint it. And the spinning… that’s even harder to remember when it happens. Everything just feels… off.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when things don't have a clear pattern. So, the dizziness feels like the room is spinning, or is it more of a feeling of being off-balance?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely spinning. Like… like when you’ve had a bit too much juice at a party, but I haven’t had juice like that in years! It's a proper whirl, you see? Everything goes round and round. Makes me grab onto things, just in case. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. Usually just a few minutes. But it’s enough to scare you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few minutes of whirling dizziness. That's helpful to know. And you said it happens when you’re at bingo sometimes, and other times when resting or walking. Does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... worse? Well, loud noises don’t help, I don’t think. The bingo hall is awfully noisy, you know? Lots of shouting when someone gets a win. Maybe that makes it worse, but it's hard to tell. And bending over... yes! Bending over to pick something up sometimes sets it off. But again, not always. It’s just… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so loud noises and bending over can potentially trigger it, but not consistently. Let's talk a bit about your overall health. Have you had any other symptoms along with the hearing changes and dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… other symptoms? Let me think… My knees ache a bit, if I’ve been on them a long time. But that's just old age, I suppose. And I get a bit tired easily, but who doesn’t these days? I… I can’t really think of anything else. Oh! Sometimes my head feels a little… fuzzy. Not a headache, exactly. Just… not quite right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some knee pain, fatigue, and a feeling of fogginess. Thank you. Now, I want to get a better understanding of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Doctor Lani usually handles all that paperwork. I know I had a bit of trouble with my waterworks a few years back, but they gave me some pills for that. And… and my heart, yes! The doctor said my heart was making a bit of a funny noise once, but they said it wasn't anything to worry about. I think… I really can’t remember the specifics. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some issues with your bladder a few years ago, and a heart murmur noted at some point. We’ll need to look into those records. Do you know what the medication was for your bladder issues?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… no, I really don’t. Little white pills, I think? Or maybe they were yellow. It was a long time ago, and I don’t pay much attention to those things. Doctor Lani keeps track of everything. She's a good girl, that one. Always reminding me what to do. I just… I get confused easily, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember specifics. We can certainly access your records to clarify that medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Doctor Lani always checks when she makes me meals. I think I’m alright. I haven’t had a reaction to anything in years, anyway. Though… I did get a bit of a rash once, after using a new soap. But that was ages ago. It wasn't a bad rash, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, though a mild reaction to a new soap in the past. Thank you. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know of any family members who have experienced hearing loss, dizziness, or balance problems?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That’s a good question. My mother… she used to complain about her ears ringing a lot, when she got older. And my brother, he had some trouble with his balance when he was a boy, but that was just a phase, Doctor Lani said. He grew out of it. And… and my grandfather, he was a sailor, and sailors sometimes get dizzy, don’t they? It’s all the rocking boats. I can’t really think of anyone else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had ringing in her ears, your brother had balance issues as a child, and your grandfather was a sailor. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think best, Doctor. Just be gentle, alright? My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds good there. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears. I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the hearing changes. Your balance seems a little unsteady, but not significantly so. And I’ll check your reflexes… Everything seems normal there. Okay, Terasa. Based on the exam, the wax buildup could be a factor in your hearing changes. The unsteady balance could be related to the dizziness, or potentially other things we need to investigate. I think it would be best to order a hearing test, and possibly some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. A hearing test, yes, that makes sense. And the blood work… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? It’s unsettling, this spinning. And I don't want to worry Lani.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s good you want to get this checked out, and we’ll do everything we can to find out what’s going on. Okay, I’m going to order a comprehensive hearing test and a basic metabolic panel blood test. The hearing test will give us a clearer picture of your hearing levels. The blood work will check for things like electrolyte imbalances, kidney function, and thyroid issues – all of which can sometimes cause dizziness or hearing changes. The lab results usually take a few days. I’ll have the receptionist schedule you for the hearing test today, and you can go to the lab for the blood work tomorrow morning, fasting. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Fasting? Oh dear… what does that mean, exactly? I usually have a biscuit with my tea in the mornings. Can’t I have just a little something?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Terasa. Fasting means you shouldn't eat or drink anything except water for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. It's important because food and drinks can affect the test results. Unfortunately, no, even a little biscuit isn't recommended. But it's just for the morning. You can have your tea and your biscuit after the blood draw. The lab technician will give you specific instructions when you arrive. Would you like me to have the receptionist call you to confirm the appointment details and explain the fasting instructions again?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I might forget all about the biscuit business. And… and the time for the appointment, too. Lani always says I need a reminder for everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Terasa. It's my job, and I'm happy to help. I'll make a note for the receptionist to call you with the appointment details and a reminder about the fasting. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like severe dizziness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you again, Doctor. It’s a relief to know someone is looking into this. Hopefully, it’s just the wax. That would be nice.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Terasa. I hope so too. We'll get to the bottom of it. Okay, then. I'll see you back here once we have the test results. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
