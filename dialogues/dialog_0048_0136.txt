DOCTOR: Right. Lucia Fogelstrom, 38 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... hello Doctor. It's... the burping. I burp a lot. It's embarrassing, really. It just... happens.
DOCTOR: Burping. Yes. And how long has this… “a lot” of burping been going on?
PATIENT: Oh... maybe a few months now? It started not so bad, just after I eat. But now... even when I don't eat much, it happens. Sometimes it's... loud.
DOCTOR: A few months. And does anything specific seem to trigger it, or is it completely random?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I think... maybe fizzy drinks? Like soda. And sometimes beans. But not always. It's hard to say for sure. It just… comes up. It doesn’t hurt, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Well, soda and beans are hardly a surprise. A bit of gas is perfectly normal. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like... what do you mean? No pain, no… I don’t know. Just the burping. Do you need me to tell you more? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Let’s try this. Any nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea? Like... feeling sick to my stomach? No, not really. Sometimes after I eat a lot, maybe a little full feeling. But not sick. Definitely not sick. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about… bloating?
PATIENT: Bloating? Like… my stomach getting big? Sometimes, yes. Especially after… well, after I eat a lot. But it goes away pretty quickly. Not all the time, though. It's… it's confusing. I don't know if it's the burping or something else.
DOCTOR: It’s likely just gas, honestly. Are you on any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medicines. Nothing at all. I try to stay healthy. Just… lots of burping. And I don’t have insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: No medications. Alright. Well, it sounds like you may have some mild indigestion. Try avoiding carbonated beverages, beans, and potentially spicy foods. Smaller, more frequent meals. Over-the-counter simethicone might help. We're not going to run any tests.
PATIENT: Simethicone? What is that? Is that... something I can buy at the store? And… is it expensive? I don't want to spend too much money. I just wanted to know why I'm burping so much.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's an over-the-counter gas relief medication. Any drugstore will have it. It's… relatively inexpensive. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, frankly. Just try those adjustments to your diet and see if it improves. If it doesn’t improve after a couple of weeks… then we can talk about other possibilities. But I suspect it’s just trapped gas. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, mostly. Well... I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm in the garden. But I think that’s just plants. Is it bad that I keep saying "I think"? I'm not sure about much, I guess. Will the simethicone help with the noise? That’s what bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: It may help with the noise. It reduces the gas. Look, I have other patients. Try the simethicone, limit the gas-producing foods. If you’re still concerned after a month, come back. But honestly, it sounds like a lifestyle issue, not a medical one. Here's a list of gas-producing foods. Good day.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. A month... Alright. I'll try. It’s just… it's embarrassing. But I guess… thank you. .
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Get some rest. And try to avoid carbonated beverages. Next! .
