DOCTOR: Alright, Helaina, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello doctor. It’s… it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. A friend of mine suggested I come talk to someone about… about staying safe. About HIV, you know? She said there’s a pill you can take before anything happens to keep you from getting it. That’s what I’m here about, I guess. I don’t even know what it’s called.
DOCTOR: Right. “Staying safe,” yes. Well, that's… sensible. Your friend is referring to PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is a good preventative measure. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. Now, before we talk about whether it’s right for you, I need to get a better picture of things. It's not just about taking a pill, you understand. It's about risk. Do you mind if I ask a few questions?
PATIENT: No, no, not at all. Ask away. I understand it’s not that simple. It’s just… I’m single, you see, and… well, let’s just say I have a social life. And I want to keep it that way, if you know what I mean. I’m not looking for trouble, but… things happen.
DOCTOR: “Things happen,” quite. And it's responsible of you to consider this. Okay. Let's start with basics. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. The last time was… hmm… let me think. It was back in… November, I believe. At the free clinic in town. They do testing every month, and I try to go when I can. It was negative, thankfully. I remember because the nurse was very nice, and she explained everything clearly.
DOCTOR: Good, good. That's helpful. Let's see… I'll pull up your records from the free clinic, just to confirm. Alright, I see the negative result from November. Excellent. Now, besides HIV, have you ever been tested for any other sexually transmitted infections – STIs?
PATIENT: Yes, I've had those tests too. I usually get them done at the same time as the HIV test, just to be safe. Syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia… the usual ones. The results were always clear, thank goodness. It’s… it’s a worry, you know? Being careful is important.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is… commendable. So everything has been clear, as you say. Do you have any regular sexual partners, or is it more… casual encounters?
PATIENT: Oh. Um. It’s… mostly casual. I don't really have a regular partner. It's… it varies. Sometimes I meet someone at a dance, sometimes through friends… It's not something I plan, if that makes sense. I just… enjoy being social. And I want to be responsible about it, that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Right. So, multiple partners, not always consistent condom use, I presume?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes. It’s… embarrassing to admit, but sometimes things just happen in the moment. I always intend to use one, but… it doesn’t always work out that way. It's stupid, I know. And that’s why I’m worried, and why I thought this pill might be a good idea.
DOCTOR: “Things happen,” yes. It seems that is a recurring theme. Alright. Now, are you currently experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I feel perfectly fine. No fever, no rash, no… anything. That's what makes it so worrying, you know? You can have something and not even know it. That’s why I thought it was better to be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. No current symptoms. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've taken antibiotics a few times for infections, and I didn’t have any reactions. And I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s all. Nothing serious. The doctor at the pharmacy knows what I take, if you need to check.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get some basic vitals, then we’ll do a quick physical exam. It’s standard procedure. Blood pressure is important to keep an eye on, especially with any new medication. If you'll just step over here…
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Old knees, you know. Gets harder every year.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated, as expected. 150 over 90. We’ll need to monitor that closely. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll quickly palpate your abdomen. Heart sounds are… normal. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything appears normal, but we need blood work to be sure. We’ll check your kidney function, liver function, and, of course, HIV status again.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate that. Is the blood work something I can do here, or do I have to go somewhere else? And how long does it take to get the results? I just want to know what I’m looking at, timeline-wise. I have a dance on Saturday, you see, and I don’t want to worry about anything then.
DOCTOR: We’ll draw the blood here. It will take a few days – usually three to five business days – for the lab results to come back. And frankly, a dance on Saturday is… not a reason to rush medical testing. I’ll send the order to the lab now. They’ll call you directly with the results. If anything is abnormal, they’ll notify me immediately, and then we can discuss it. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to… reconsider your behavior. This isn’t just about taking a pill; it’s about being responsible for your health.
PATIENT: I understand. You're right, of course. It's just… it's hard. And I am trying to be responsible. That's why I came here, isn't it? I just… I don't want to feel like I have to stop living my life. Is that so wrong?
DOCTOR: No, it's not "wrong." It's… unrealistic. And frankly, a bit naive. .
