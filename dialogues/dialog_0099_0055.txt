DOCTOR: Right, Ellan Ranells. 74 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Overgaard, it’s about… this newfangled thing people are doing. Medical marijuana, you see. My niece, she’s been raving about it for her arthritis. Honestly, I thought it was all nonsense, but she seems quite improved. And frankly, a little help wouldn’t go amiss these days. My joints aren’t what they used to be, and the usual remedies… well, they just don’t seem to do as much anymore.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Though I must say, the idea of it… it feels a bit… unconventional. I've always been a very sensible woman, you understand. A pillar of the community, really. But Beatrice – that's my niece – she assured me it’s perfectly legal now, and that a proper doctor can certify you. And she said you were the one to see.
DOCTOR: “Pillar of the community” doesn’t change the fact that it's still… marijuana. Legal or not, it’s not exactly the first line of defense for joint pain. Now, let’s be clear. I’m not saying it doesn’t have… some potential benefits, but we need to explore all other avenues first. Sensible women don't jump to trendy solutions without due diligence. Before we even consider something like that, tell me about this pain. Where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find that a rather condescending attitude. I simply inquired about a potential treatment, and now I'm being lectured on my… sensibility. But very well. The pain is mostly in my hips, and lower back. It’s been creeping up for years, naturally. A woman of my age, you understand. It’s worse in the mornings, makes getting out of bed… a trial. And standing for any length of time is just… out of the question.
DOCTOR: “Creeping up for years.” Right. So, typical age-related wear and tear. It's not surprising, honestly. And what have you been doing to manage it before your niece suggested… this?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual. I’ve been taking ibuprofen, of course. And I had a course of physical therapy a few years back, though it didn’t do a great deal of good. My husband, bless his soul, rubs my back with liniment every evening. It’s… a temporary relief, at best. Honestly, it feels like I’m just… slowing the inevitable. And it’s quite tiresome, always having to ask for help.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen… predictably. And liniment. You’ve tried the basics. Alright. Let's get a bit more specific. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A scale, you say? I’m not terribly good with these… modern things. Hmm. On a bad day… perhaps a six? Sometimes even a seven, if I’ve been on my feet for any length of time. Most days, it’s more of a four or five. It’s just… there. A constant ache. It doesn't prevent me from doing things entirely, but it certainly makes them… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: "Constant ache." Right. And does anything specifically make it worse, besides standing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Damp weather, definitely. It always flares up before a rainstorm. And climbing stairs… well, that’s simply dreadful. I try to avoid it as much as possible, but we have a lovely garden in the back, and getting up those steps to reach it… it's a necessity, really. And frankly, Doctor, bending over is becoming increasingly difficult. Putting on my shoes, gardening… all of it. It’s just… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, damp weather, stairs, bending… all exacerbating the pain. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating? Goodness, no. Not that I’ve noticed. It’s mostly in the hips, and lower back. Occasionally a bit of stiffness in the knees, but nothing… travelling. No, definitely not travelling. I’ve never had anything travelling. That sounds… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. And before we delve any further, let’s be clear about your medical history. Do you have any other conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of bronchitis a few years back, but that cleared up completely. And my blood pressure is… usually a little elevated, but I manage it with diet. Nothing… serious. Oh, and I had a hysterectomy in my late forties, but that was decades ago. Other than that, I’m quite healthy for my age, thank you very much. I've always been very careful about my health.
DOCTOR: A hysterectomy… and managed hypertension. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any… reactions. I can take ibuprofen without issue, as I mentioned. And I’ve taken antibiotics when necessary. I’m not particularly prone to illness, you see. I always get my flu shot, and I eat a very balanced diet. My husband is quite particular about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor, for my heart. And a small tablet for my blood pressure, once a day. That's it. I pride myself on not being overly reliant on pharmaceuticals, you see. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Which is why I’m even considering… this. Though I still find the whole thing rather… unconventional.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look. Can you tell me if this is painful?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That's… a bit tender, yes. Not excruciating, but certainly uncomfortable. It's always been a little sensitive there, but it seems… more aggravated lately. And if you press just a little further to the right… yes, that's quite sore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you bend forward for me?
PATIENT: Ooh, carefully now… That’s… as far as I can manage, Doctor. It's quite stiff, you see. And rather painful. My back… it just won’t allow me to go any further.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you rotate your hips for me?
PATIENT: It’s… a little restricted, Doctor. And not very comfortable. I can’t move them as freely as I used to, you see. They feel… quite stiff. And there’s a bit of a clicking sound, if you listen closely. Honestly, I feel rather foolish, contorting myself like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, carefully now… It’s… a little uncomfortable, you see. And I have to take shorter steps than usual. My hips… they just don’t move as freely as they used to. And my back… it aches with each step.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, please sit down. . It appears you have some stiffness and limited range of motion in your hips and lower back, with some discomfort during movement. This is consistent with age-related wear and tear, and likely some degree of osteoarthritis. Now, about this marijuana… while I understand your niece's enthusiasm, it's not a first-line treatment. Before we even consider that, we need to try more conventional methods.
PATIENT: Well, that’s what I expected, really. My husband will be pleased. He’s always been skeptical of… unconventional remedies. But I thought I should explore all options, you see. Perhaps a stronger pain reliever? Or more physical therapy? I must admit, I'm not terribly keen on more physical therapy. It was quite tiresome the last time.
DOCTOR: Stronger pain relievers are an option, but they come with their own set of risks and side effects. More physical therapy… I understand your hesitation, but it's often the most effective long-term solution. We could explore a different type of therapy, perhaps one that’s less intensive. Before we decide on a course of action, I'd like to order some X-rays to get a better look at your hips and lower back. That will help us rule out any other underlying causes for your pain. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: X-rays… yes, that sounds sensible. My husband always says it's best to be thorough. I suppose if it will help determine the best course of action, then I have no objections. Though I must say, all these tests and procedures… it's all rather a bother. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write you a referral for X-rays. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend taking ibuprofen as needed for pain relief, and continuing to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I suppose I was hoping for a quick fix, but I understand that's not realistic. I'll follow your recommendations and schedule the X-rays. Thank you for your time and attention. Honestly, it's reassuring to have a sensible doctor like yourself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Sensibility is… important. If the pain worsens significantly before your X-ray appointment, don’t hesitate to contact the office. Here's the referral slip. Take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. It's a comfort to know I'm in good hands, even if it means a little bit of bother.
