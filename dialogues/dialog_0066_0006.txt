DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it is… a bit difficult to talk about, but I have been coughing up blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. Just to clarify, when you say coughing up blood, is it bright red, or is it more like a darker color, maybe mixed with mucus?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly bright red, I think. Sometimes there is a little… a little bit of white with it, but it is mostly red. It happens when I cough, of course. Not all the time, but several times a day now. It started… maybe a week ago? I am not very good with dates, I apologize.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about the dates – we’ll figure it out. Bright red blood suggests it's likely coming from your lungs or airways. A week ago, okay. And is the amount consistent each time, or does it vary?
PATIENT: It changes, Doctor. Some times it is just a little… a few streaks, really. Other times, it is… more. Enough to make me concerned, that is why I came. It is not a large amount, but definitely more than just a little bit of… irritation. I hope that makes sense? It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Jeannemarie. You’re describing a varying amount of bright red blood when you cough, and that's concerning enough for us to look into. Okay. Have you had any other symptoms along with the coughing – like fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Let me see… no fever, no chills. I have been a little… tired, perhaps, but I thought that was just from… everything. No chest pain. And I have not noticed any weight loss. I do feel… a little breathless sometimes, when I walk up the stairs, but I am not a very active person, so I thought it was normal. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills, or chest pain. A little tired and some breathlessness with stairs. That breathlessness is something we should pay attention to, especially with the coughing up blood. Now, have you had any previous medical conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I have been… generally healthy, all my life. My husband… he had some problems with his heart, but I have always been well. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing serious. I do not smoke, and I have never smoked. I try to eat healthy food, and I walk when I can, but… as I said, I am not very active. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. No previous lung conditions and no smoking history is good to know. Okay. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young woman, a long time ago. And… my husband, he was in the hospital several times for his heart. But I… no, I have not been hospitalized myself, except for the appendix. No surgeries otherwise. I hope I am not forgetting anything. It has been a long time.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. Appendix removal, and your husband’s hospitalizations. Okay. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like lung disease, heart problems, or any kind of cancer?
PATIENT: My mother… she had heart problems, later in life. She passed away from it, I believe. And my father… he had some kind of stomach cancer, a long time ago. My husband’s side… his father had diabetes, I think. Nothing about lung problems, as far as I know. We… we did not talk much about health, my family. It was not… a common topic. I apologize if I am not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jeannemarie. Knowing about your mother's heart problems and your father's stomach cancer is helpful. Okay. And just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I have taken many kinds of medicine over the years for… minor things, headaches, colds… but never anything serious. I do not have any known allergies. I am quite fortunate, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I do not like taking medicine if I can avoid it. I might take a pain reliever for a headache sometimes, but that is all. Nothing regularly. Just… when I need to. I prefer to rest and drink tea, if possible. I do not trust medicine very much, I am afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Alright Jeannemarie. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen levels, and feel your lymph nodes. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. I trust your judgement. Please, do whatever you need to do. I just want to know what is causing this… blood. I am a little nervous, but I understand it is necessary. Please be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, if you could please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your lungs sound a little… congested, I'm hearing some crackles, particularly in the lower lobes. Your heart sounds regular, but I'll take a closer look at your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is 95%, which is within normal limits, but a little on the lower side. I'm going to gently palpate your lymph nodes in your neck and around your collarbone. Your lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling or tenderness. Overall, your exam findings suggest some congestion in your lungs, which could be causing the coughing and blood you’re experiencing. However, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Congestion… that sounds… worrying. A chest X-ray… will that show what is wrong? And a blood count… will that tell you if I am sick? I… I am a little frightened, Doctor. But yes, please, do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to know what is happening to me. Will the X-ray be… painful? And where will I go to have these tests done?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be frightened, Jeannemarie. I want to assure you, the X-ray itself is not painful at all. You'll simply stand or sit in front of the machine, and it will take a picture of your lungs. It's a very quick procedure. The blood test will help us look for signs of infection, inflammation, or any other underlying issues that might be causing your symptoms. We can have both tests done right here at the clinic. There’s a radiology department just down the hall, and a lab technician will draw your blood. It will take about 15-20 minutes for the X-ray and another 10 minutes for the blood draw. I’ll explain everything in detail before each test is performed. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan to get you feeling better. For now, I want to emphasize that congestion can have many causes, ranging from a simple cold to something more serious. It’s important to rule out anything concerning, which is why we're doing these tests. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. Not painful… that is good. And you said there are many causes… that is… a little reassuring. Fifteen minutes for the X-ray… and ten for the blood… I can manage that. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, let me know what I need to do. And… can you explain the results to me in simple terms? I do not understand much medical language, as you know. I just want to know… what is wrong, and what we can do to fix it. If you do not mind, I would like to sit for a moment before we begin. I am a little… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jeannemarie. I completely understand you're overwhelmed. Please, take all the time you need. I will absolutely explain the results in simple terms, and I won't use any medical jargon you won't understand. My priority is to make sure you feel informed and comfortable throughout this process. Once the tests are done, we'll sit down together, and I'll walk you through everything step-by-step. We'll discuss the findings, and I'll answer any questions you have. For now, just focus on taking a few deep breaths and relaxing. I'll let you know when the radiology technician is ready for you. Do you have any immediate questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… no immediate questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for being patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I am… a little scared, but I trust you to take good care of me. Perhaps… perhaps you could tell me… what are some of the simple things that could cause congestion? Just to… calm my nerves a little. If you do not mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jeannemarie. Absolutely. One of the most common causes of congestion is a simple viral infection, like a cold or the flu. These infections cause inflammation in your airways, which can lead to mucus buildup. Allergies can also cause congestion, especially if you're exposed to allergens like pollen or dust mites. Sometimes, even dry air can irritate your airways and cause them to become congested. And in some cases, congestion can be a sign of something more serious, like bronchitis or pneumonia, but we'll rule those out with the tests. It's important to remember that congestion doesn't always mean something is seriously wrong. Often, it's just your body's way of fighting off an infection or reacting to an irritant. We’ll get a clearer picture once we have the results of the X-ray and blood test. Does that help to calm your nerves a little?
PATIENT: Yes… that does help. A cold… or allergies… that is… not so frightening. I do not have allergies, I think. And I have not been ill with a cold recently. But… that is good to know. It could be something simple. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I… I think I am ready now. Please, let me know when you are ready for me to have the X-ray. I just want to get this over with, and know what is happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jeannemarie. I admire your bravery. Excellent. Let's go ahead and get the X-ray done. I'll walk you down to the radiology department. The technician, Sarah, is wonderful and will explain everything to you before the procedure. It will only take a few minutes. Shall we?
PATIENT: Yes… let us go. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I hope… I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. I understand your anxiety, and I'll be right here with you every step of the way. Remember, we’re just gathering information, and we’ll discuss the results thoroughly. Sarah, this is Jeannemarie. She's here for a chest X-ray. Sarah: “Hi Jeannemarie, nice to meet you! I’ll get you settled in. Just a few quick questions first…” I’ll be just outside if you need anything. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask Sarah any questions you have.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I… I will try to be brave. Please… let me know if you need anything.
