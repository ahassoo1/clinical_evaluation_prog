DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this confusion I’ve been having. It’s not… pleasant, I’ll tell you that much. Happens every now and then. Mostly, I just… forget things. Important things. My wife keeps having to remind me. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It’s certainly concerning when you start noticing changes in your memory. It is good that your wife is helping you keep track of things. It sounds like this has been happening intermittently, you said?
PATIENT: Intermittently is a fancy word for it, yes. It comes and goes. Some days I’m perfectly sharp, can remember everything just fine. Other days… I look at my wife and I just… stare. Like I don’t even know who she is for a moment. It doesn't last long, thankfully, but it’s unsettling. And it's getting worse, I think. It used to be just little things, like where I put my glasses. Now… well, now it’s bigger things.
DOCTOR: Okay, “bigger things” – can you give me some examples of what you mean by that, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Well… last week, I went to the market for her. She gave me a very specific list, you see? Very specific. Three types of vegetables, a certain kind of fish, and… and I just got lost. Not lost lost, but I couldn't remember what I was supposed to buy. Wandered around for nearly an hour before I just… came home empty-handed. She wasn't pleased. And the week before that… I forgot how to get to my son’s house. I’ve been going there for years!
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds very worrisome, Mr. Lason. Forgetting things like that is definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Besides the market and your son's house, have you noticed any other memory difficulties?
PATIENT: Well… dates. I used to be good with dates. Birthdays, anniversaries… Now? Forget about it. I rely on my wife completely. And… sometimes I have trouble following conversations. People say something and I just… blank. Like they’re speaking a different language. Not a foreign language, just… jumbled. It’s frustrating for everyone involved, I suspect. Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I feel like my mind is… slipping away.
DOCTOR: I understand how frightening that must feel, Mr. Lason. It’s good you’re telling me about this. We need to rule out some possibilities. Let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Go ahead. Though, honestly, I don't have much of a medical history. I’ve been a strong, healthy man my whole life. Worked with my hands, tile and stone setting, you know? Very physical work. Never much for doctors. My wife is the one who dragged me in here. She's been worried about these… episodes. Says I need to get checked out, before it gets worse. She's probably right, but it’s not something I enjoy, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: That's good to know you've generally been healthy. But even so, it's important to look at everything. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of. Doctor, I’ve told you, I rarely go to the doctor. I eat mostly Cambodian food, what my wife cooks. Rice, fish, vegetables. A little bit of meat. Nothing fancy. I’ve always been thin, even as a young man. Never had any problems with weight. My wife worries I don’t eat enough, honestly. But I feel fine, most of the time. It’s just… these little slips.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any head injuries – even minor ones – like bumping your head, falling, or being hit during a sport or activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it… when I was a young man, back in Cambodia, I was involved in an accident. A motorbike accident. Not a serious one, thankfully. I mostly just scraped up my knees and elbows. But I did hit my head. It wasn't a hard hit, but… I was knocked unconscious for a few minutes, maybe. But that was… over sixty years ago. I never thought much of it after that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's definitely important to know, Mr. Lason. Even something that happened a long time ago can sometimes have lasting effects. And have you ever had any strokes or any neurological problems, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, never. No strokes, no anything. Look, Doctor, I'm telling you, I've been a simple man, working with my hands. I haven't spent my life in hospitals and doctors' offices. I just... I'm forgetting things. And it scares my wife. She thinks it's something serious, and honestly, I'm starting to worry too. Is it… is it something bad?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're worried, Mr. Lason. And it's good that your wife is looking out for you. It's too early to say definitively what's going on, but these memory issues definitely warrant further investigation. Let's talk about your medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Medicare stuff, what they give me for… well, I don't even know what it's for anymore. Something for my joints, I think. They send it in the mail every month. I take one pill in the morning, one at night. That’s it. No vitamins, no supplements. I’ve always believed in eating good food, that’s enough. Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I think these pills are making things worse. They make me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. We'll definitely look into those medications. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. My wife always asks me that question, whenever I see a doctor, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. I can eat anything, touch anything, without any problems. It's just… my memory is failing. And it’s the one thing I thought I could always rely on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I’d like to do a quick physical exam and a few brief cognitive tests, if you're willing. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do some basic balance and coordination tests. Then I’ll ask you to do a few simple memory exercises. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Go ahead. Though, I don't expect much from these tests. I'm an old man. My body isn't what it used to be. But… if it will help my wife sleep better at night, I'll do it. Just… don't take too long, alright? I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. We’ll keep it as brief as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Just… don't tighten it too much, alright? My arm isn't as strong as it used to be.
DOCTOR: No problem, Mr. Lason. I'll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Never been much for these things. Always thought a good day’s work was the best medicine. But my wife… she insisted. She worries too much, you know? Always has.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'm going to lightly tap on your knees with this small hammer. This might be a little surprising, but it shouldn't be painful. Could you please let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Alright. Just… don’t hit me too hard, alright? I have thin bones.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, let’s do a quick balance test. Could you please stand up slowly and try to stand on one leg for about ten seconds?
PATIENT: Alright… one leg… ten seconds… There! I did it… sort of. My balance isn’t what it used to be, you know. This garden I have… it's not easy getting around anymore.
DOCTOR: That was good, Mr. Lason. It’s understandable that your balance is a little unsteady. Now, for the last part of the exam, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. Try to answer them as best you can. First, what year is it currently?
PATIENT: …The year…? Oh… um… is it… 2024? No, wait… my wife said something about… 2025! Yes, 2025. I think. It’s hard to keep track, you know? Things just… blur together these days.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Lason. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things. Okay, next question. Can you tell me the name of the current president?
PATIENT: …The president…? Oh dear. That… that escapes me. I used to follow politics, when I was younger. But now… it’s all just a muddle. I… I don’t know. Is it… Biden? I think it’s Biden. But I’m not certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It's common for people to forget names sometimes. Let's try one more. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: "Table, Penny, Orange." Now, I’ll ask you to recall those words a little later. Now, I just want to ask you a few simple questions about your daily life. Do you find yourself getting lost in familiar places?
PATIENT: ...Lost? Sometimes. Not like... wandering around for days, but... like, forgetting which way to go to the grocery store. Or getting confused about which exit to take on the highway. Little things, mostly. My wife usually has to guide me. She has a good sense of direction. I... I used to be able to navigate anywhere, you know? But these days... it's like my mind is playing tricks on me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your personality or behavior recently?
PATIENT: ...Hmm. My wife says I've been more... irritable. And forgetful, of course. She says I repeat myself a lot. And I... I don't know. Maybe I get frustrated easier than I used to. I used to be a very patient man. But now... sometimes I just snap at her. I don't mean to, but... it just happens. It's like... something's not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. Thank you for answering my questions so honestly. I appreciate it. I'm going to step out of the room for a moment to review your information and discuss it with the nurse. I’ll be right back to discuss my findings and recommendations with you. Can I get you a glass of water while I'm gone?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A glass of water would be nice. My mouth feels dry. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? And maybe… maybe there’s something we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: .
