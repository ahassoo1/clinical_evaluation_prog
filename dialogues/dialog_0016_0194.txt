DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And… my family. There’s a history, you see. It’s a bit… fuzzy, to be honest. I keep forgetting things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, your ears and some memory concerns, and a family history that's a little unclear. We can definitely sort through all of that. Let's start with your ears. Can you tell me more about what's been going on with them?
PATIENT: It’s hard to explain. Sometimes… sometimes the sound just… goes. Not always both ears, usually just one. And then I get really dizzy. Like the room is spinning. It doesn't last long, maybe a few hours, but it’s… unsettling. It's happened a couple of times now. I can’t quite remember when exactly, though. It feels like it’s been… a while. And then it comes back again. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds concerning. So, episodes of dizziness accompanied by a feeling of fullness or loss of hearing in one ear, lasting a few hours at a time. And it’s happened more than once. Is there anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, no. I don’t think so. It just… happens. I could be doing anything. Sitting, walking… even just lying in bed. It doesn’t seem to matter. It’s very… random, I suppose. I wish I knew why. It’s just… frightening when it happens, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no identifiable triggers. And it’s frightening when it occurs. That’s understandable. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… a tough one. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, of course. But I can’t really recall any diagnoses. Maybe something with my blood pressure, a long time ago? But I'm not sure. My husband used to handle all that paperwork. He… passed away a few years back. It’s all a bit blurry, honestly. I have Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. It's perfectly alright that things are a bit blurry – loss can certainly make remembering details difficult. Medicare does help, thank you. Okay, so potentially some history of blood pressure issues, but nothing definitively diagnosed that you recall. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. Perhaps my tonsils out when I was a child? But it was so long ago, I barely remember it. And nothing since then, I’m quite sure. I’ve always been a healthy woman, mostly. Until… these ear things started happening, of course. Is that important? Whether I've had surgeries?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, yes. No surgeries beyond possibly tonsillectomy as a child. Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… that’s what you asked about before, didn't you? It's… difficult. My mother… she had trouble with her balance, I think. And my brother… he had ringing in his ears, always complaining about it. But I can’t remember if it was the same kind of trouble. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about it much. They’re both… gone now. And my children… they’re busy with their own lives. I don’t want to bother them with my… old lady problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of balance issues in your mother and tinnitus – ringing in the ears – in your brother. That’s useful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it flares up. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? Or maybe naproxen? One of those. And… no allergies, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I really don’t take much, I assure you. I like to stay natural, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, over-the-counter pain medication – ibuprofen or naproxen – as needed for arthritis. No known allergies. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll need to look in your ears, check your balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I really don't want to end up in the hospital. I get so frightened easily these days. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m looking in your ears now. There’s a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, but nothing significant. The ear canals themselves look normal. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes as I move it back and forth?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I'm trying. It’s a little hard to focus, sometimes. And… oh dear, I feel a little dizzy now. Not too bad, but… a bit wobbly. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. That’s helpful to know. It’s okay. It’s not unusual to feel a little dizzy during balance testing, especially if you’re already prone to it. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Alright, Terasa. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found in the exam, I think we need to investigate this dizziness a bit further. The fact that you’re experiencing dizziness during the balance test is concerning.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Investigate? What does that mean? Will I need… tests? And… are you saying it is something serious? I really don’t want to go through a lot of fuss, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but it does mean we need to find out why you’re dizzy. I’d like to order a hearing test – an audiogram – to assess your hearing and inner ear function. And I’d also like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. The MRI will give us a very detailed picture of your brain and help us identify any potential issues. Does that sound alright?
