DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, I’ve been getting this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying, to say the least. I just want it to stop, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ringing in the ears can certainly be disruptive. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not constant, thankfully. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s like a high-pitched whine, other times it’s more of a buzzing sound. It’s hard to describe. It seems worse when it's quiet, you know? Like at night when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So it’s intermittent, varies in pitch, and is more noticeable in quiet environments. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse besides quietness?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. I don’t know if anything specifically triggers it. I used to work pretty loud jobs, serving at different clubs and bars. Maybe that has something to do with it? It started a few months after I left the last one. I don’t know. It’s just… there sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information – the history of working in loud environments. Exposure to loud noises is a common cause of tinnitus, which is the medical term for ringing in the ears. When did you leave your last job?
PATIENT: It was… about six months ago now, I think. Early February, maybe? Everything’s a bit of a blur after the divorce, to be honest. But yeah, six months, give or take a week or two. It’s been getting… more noticeable lately, that’s why I finally came in. It’s starting to worry me a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely reasonable to be concerned when something new starts or changes. And dealing with a divorce on top of that is a lot to handle. We'll try to figure out what's going on with the ringing. Besides the divorce and the work history, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms—like any hearing loss, dizziness, ear pain, or fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My hearing seems okay, I haven’t noticed any trouble hearing people. No dizziness or pain either. Just the ringing. It’s just… frustrating, you know? It makes it hard to concentrate sometimes. And sleeping is becoming a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no hearing loss, dizziness, or ear pain. Just the tinnitus and some difficulty with concentration and sleep. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels recently?
PATIENT: Stress levels? Doctor, I got divorced six months ago. So, yeah, pretty stressed. Still trying to sort things out, to be honest. It’s… a lot. I'm trying to keep busy, but it’s hard. Does that help? I’m really just hoping there’s something you can do about the ringing. It's driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: It absolutely helps to understand the full picture, Jaylyne, and I appreciate you sharing that. Stress can certainly exacerbate tinnitus. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears, and then we can talk about some possible causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted, if possible. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to take a look inside your ears to make sure there isn’t any blockage or inflammation. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay. Your ear canals appear clear, and the eardrums look normal. No signs of infection or fluid. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tinnitus, possibly related to noise exposure and stress. We'll need to rule out some other possibilities, but this is the most common scenario. Have you ever had a hearing test before?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had any problems with my hearing before, so I’ve never needed one. Is that what you recommend? Will it tell us something? I'm just… anxious to find out what’s going on, if that makes sense. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. A hearing test, also called an audiogram, is the next step. It will help us determine if there’s any hearing loss, even mild loss, that might be contributing to the tinnitus. It also helps us rule out other potential causes. It’s a quick and painless test. I’m going to have the audiology department schedule you for a hearing test. They have availability tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow at two sounds… fine. Yeah, that’s good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a shift at six, so I need to be back in town by then. Is there anything I should do before the test? Like, avoid loud noises or anything?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your shift. The only thing I’d recommend is to avoid being exposed to loud noises as much as possible between now and tomorrow's test. Other than that, just come as you are. We'll get this figured out, Jaylyne. The audiogram will give us a clearer picture, and then we can discuss potential management options. I'll also give you some information on tinnitus management techniques you can start looking at. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. I’ve been worrying about this for a while. Six o’clock shift, just so you have it noted. I guess I’ll see you after the test tomorrow?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad you came in. And yes, I have your shift time noted. We’ll review the results tomorrow and go from there. Here’s some information on tinnitus while you wait for your appointment. It includes some relaxation techniques and resources. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and I'll see you tomorrow.
PATIENT: Thanks, Doctor. You too. .
