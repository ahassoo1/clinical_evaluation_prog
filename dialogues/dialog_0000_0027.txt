DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine, good to see you… well, as good as can be expected. Now, you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Reflux. It's… unpleasant. Been happening for a while now. Honestly, I don't have time for this. I’ve got important things to manage, you know. Fires to put out, literally sometimes. So let’s just get this sorted, quickly.
DOCTOR: "Reflux," right. And by 'a while now,' can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. Months. Maybe six? Seven? Hard to say, really. I don't keep track of these things. It's… after I eat, usually. Spicy food makes it worse, naturally. Common sense, isn’t it? And lying down. Don't tell me it's something I'm doing wrong. I run an emergency management office. I know a thing or two about avoiding problems. It's the food, I suspect. Or stress. Lots of stress these days. People are… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to seven months. After eating, worse with spicy foods, and lying down… and you attribute it to stress as well. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the heartburn?
PATIENT: Heartburn is putting it mildly. It feels like… well, a fire. And sometimes, things come back up. Regurgitation, I think the nurse called it. Fancy words. Not pleasant, obviously. And I cough a bit. Just a little tickle, usually after the… incident. I don’t get chest pain, if that’s what you’re asking. I'd know that, I’m fairly observant. Honestly, it's just… inconvenient. Disrupts things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so regurgitation, a bit of a cough afterwards, no chest pain. Have you noticed if it’s worse at a particular time of day?
PATIENT: Time of day? Hmm. Now that’s a good question. Let me think… It's worse at night, I suppose. When I’m trying to sleep. Which, you know, is when you need your sleep. Makes it hard to concentrate the next day. And my wife complains about the noises. Honestly, it’s a whole thing. I really wish people would just let me get on with it.
DOCTOR: Right. Worse at night. And is this interfering with your ability to…function normally, beyond just your sleep and your wife's peace of mind?
PATIENT: Function normally? Of course it is. I’m in charge of keeping this city safe! I need to be sharp. Alert. Can’t be distracted by… internal discomfort. I find myself double-checking work, worried I missed something because I was… preoccupied. It’s inefficient. And I don't tolerate inefficiency. It's a serious problem, really. I don’t need you telling me this is a serious problem.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. I wasn’t planning to. Now, have you tried anything to alleviate the symptoms?
PATIENT: Alleviate? Oh, yes. I tried those antacid tablets. The chalky ones. Didn't do much. Just made my mouth feel dry. And I’ve been trying to eat smaller meals. It doesn’t really help, to be frank. Honestly, I don’t have time for a whole lot of… experimentation. I’m a busy man. I need a solution, not suggestions. Is there a pill for this, or what?
DOCTOR: There are stronger medications we can consider. But before we jump to that, I’d like to quickly examine you, just to rule out anything more… involved. It’s standard procedure. It won't take long. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I'm a robust individual. Always have been. Though, I don’t particularly like cats. Does that count? Look, I'm telling you, it’s stress. And maybe spicy food. Don’t go poking around unnecessarily. I’ve got important meetings this afternoon. Let’s just write a prescription, and be done with it. Really. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, with all due respect, I am a physician and I need to gather information before prescribing medication. I understand you’re busy, but dismissing a proper assessment is… frankly, irresponsible. A simple examination won't take long and will help me determine the best course of action. We’re talking about your health. Now, are you willing to allow me to listen to your heart and lungs and palpate your abdomen?
