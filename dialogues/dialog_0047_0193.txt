DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor Press. It is… a bit embarrassing, truthfully. I have been… passing a lot of gas. More than usual, you understand. It’s causing me some… discomfort. I hope that is enough information to start.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Right. Well, it’s good you came in to get it checked out, even if it is a bit… delicate. “Passing a lot of gas,” you say. And discomfort – can you describe that discomfort for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… a feeling of fullness, mostly. And sometimes, a bit of cramping in my stomach. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. It happens after I eat, usually. Though sometimes it happens even when I haven't eaten for a while. It is quite… irregular, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fullness and occasional cramping, related to eating, but not always… Irregular, you say. Do you notice anything specific that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. I eat quite a simple diet, mostly. Sandwiches, soups… things like that. I work at the diner, you see, so… I am around food all day. I do enjoy a good pickle with my sandwich, perhaps that has something to do with it? I am not certain, though. It seems to happen with many different foods, not just the pickles.
DOCTOR: Right. A fairly standard diet, working in a diner… exposure to various foods all day. Pickles… hmm. It could be something in those, but as you say, it’s not consistently linked. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. Any change in your bowel habits alongside this gas?
PATIENT: Change in… bowel habits? You mean… how often I go to the bathroom? I suppose… not really. It is… regular, you could say. Not more or less than usual. It is the passing of gas that is the trouble, not the other thing. It is just… very frequent. And sometimes, it has… an odor, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: No, no, perfectly alright. We need to get a full picture. So, normal bowel movements, despite the increased gas. And sometimes an odor… Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I have been feeling a little bit tired lately, though I work on my feet all day, so perhaps that is not surprising. And sometimes my stomach… gurgles, you could say. It makes noises. Though I suspect everyone’s stomach makes noises sometimes. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "Gurgling" sounds… and some fatigue. Right. It’s good you're telling me everything, Mr. Goodstein. Now, let's go through some basics. Any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, no changes to my weight. I… remain the same, thankfully. I always have been… slender. One hundred and twenty-nine pounds, give or take. I weigh myself occasionally, just to be sure. It has not changed, no. I do not eat much more than I used to, if that is relevant.
DOCTOR: Alright. No weight change, normal appetite. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing significant, Doctor. I have… Medicare, so I see the doctor for my check-ups regularly. They haven’t mentioned anything concerning. I have a little bit of… ache in my knees sometimes, from standing all day, but that is all. Nothing serious, I assure you. I am a fairly healthy man, despite… this.
DOCTOR: "A little bit of ache…" Right. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Never have, never will, if I can help it. I am… not fond of hospitals. A bit… unsettling, you see. Everything is very clean, which I appreciate, but… I prefer to stay out of them, if possible. I have never needed one, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries. Family history then – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That is a… good question. My mother, God rest her soul, she had a little bit of trouble with her digestion. She was Hungarian, you see, and the food… it was different back then. A lot of rich sauces and things like that. She always complained of a little bit of bloating, but nothing serious, as far as I know. My father, he was healthy as an ox. Never a day of illness in his life.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Digestion issues in your mother… Alright. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. Never have touched a cigarette in my life. I believe they are… quite bad for you. And the smell… unpleasant. I work with people who smoke, of course, but I stay well away from them when they are having one.
DOCTOR: Good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Perhaps a glass of wine with my dinner on a special occasion, but that is all. Very rarely. I prefer a nice glass of water, truthfully. It is much healthier, you see. And I need to be alert at work, so… alcohol is not a good idea.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol. And finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat… most things. Though pickles seem to be causing me trouble now, as we discussed. Otherwise, I am quite… robust, you could say. I do not have to worry about allergies.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Goodstein, based on what you’ve told me, and your overall health picture, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a fair amount of gas, possibly related to your diet and working in a diner environment. It's rarely anything serious, but clearly it's impacting your comfort. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If you think it is necessary, I trust your judgement. A physical exam… yes, go ahead. I would like to know what is causing this, if possible. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your abdomen first. Take a few deep breaths… yes… normal bowel sounds, a bit… active, as expected. No signs of anything immediately concerning. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not particularly. It is… a little bit sensitive, perhaps, all over, but nothing sharply painful. It is… just a general discomfort, you see. Like it is… full of air. It is difficult to explain. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A little distention, yes. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Alright. Based on the exam, it's unlikely to be anything serious. It’s likely a build-up of gas, potentially from certain foods, or your exposure to various smells and foods at the diner. I recommend keeping a food diary for a week, noting what you eat and when you experience gas, and any other symptoms. That will help identify potential triggers.
PATIENT: A food diary… yes, that sounds… manageable. I can do that. Write down everything I eat… and when the gas happens. Yes. And then… what? I bring the diary back to you next week?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Bring the diary back with you next week, and we’ll review it. In the meantime, try over-the-counter remedies for gas relief, like simethicone or activated charcoal, if needed. Avoid carbonated beverages, and foods known to cause gas – beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions. Small, frequent meals can also help. Do you have any questions for me, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Simethicone… and activated charcoal. I will write those down. And avoid… those vegetables. Small meals, yes. That makes sense. Well… no, Doctor. I think you have covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your time and your… clear explanation. It is a relief to know it is… probably nothing serious. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Good. Well, if your symptoms worsen, or you develop fever, severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool, or significant weight loss, contact me immediately. Otherwise, keep the food diary, try those remedies, and we’ll see how you’re doing next week. Here’s a form for the food diary, and a list of common gas-producing foods. Have a good day, Mr. Goodstein.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Press. I will… be sure to follow your instructions carefully. Have a good day to you as well. .
