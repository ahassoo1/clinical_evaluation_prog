DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It's August 2nd. So, to begin, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for having me. Well, it's this itching. It's just… everywhere, really. Been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not like a rash, just… constant itchiness.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant itchiness, you say, for several weeks. That certainly sounds bothersome. To help me understand what might be causing this, could you describe the itchiness a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's not really worse in one spot than another. Arms, legs, back… everywhere feels the same. It's not really bumpy or red, like I said, just… dry and irritated feeling. And it’s… hard to scratch, you know? Like scratching doesn't really help much, it just feels… temporary. I've tried lotion, different kinds, but nothing seems to stick. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, a generalized itchiness without a visible rash, not significantly improved by lotions, and scratching doesn't provide lasting relief. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to gather a bit more information. Have you noticed if anything specific seems to trigger the itching, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific. I mean, I’ve been trying to think… maybe when I get warm? Like after I’ve been doing something around the house, a little bit worse. But honestly, it feels pretty consistent, even when I’m just sitting and reading. I haven't changed my soap or detergent recently, or anything like that. I’m really stumped, Doctor. It’s just… always there.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Ferneding. It’s helpful to know it doesn’t seem related to any recent changes in products or activities, and is somewhat consistent. Let’s explore a little further. Could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Well, I was pretty healthy for most of my life. Had the usual childhood stuff, you know? But… my wife, God rest her soul, she passed away about five years ago. It was… unexpected. And after that… I guess I haven’t been as diligent about keeping up with things. I have Medicare, of course. As for serious illnesses, I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago, and I have… well, I have some high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. Other than that, not much. I don't really have any allergies that I know of. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Ferneding. I appreciate you being so open with me. My condolences again for your loss; that is a significant life event. It's good to know about your high blood pressure being controlled and the gallbladder removal. No known allergies, that's helpful as well. To clarify regarding your blood pressure medication, could you please tell me what you are taking and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… let me see, I have it written down here somewhere… Ah, here it is. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I take it every morning with my breakfast. It seems to keep things under control, my doctor always says. I get it refilled regularly, no problems there. I haven't missed a dose in… well, I can't even remember when.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily, consistently taken. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That's a tricky one. My parents are both gone now. My mother… she had diabetes, I think. Type 2, I believe. She had it for a long time. My father… he had heart problems. Not sure exactly what, it was a long time ago. As for siblings, I have a sister, but we haven't been in touch for years. I don't really know much about her health. I don’t think there was much in the way of skin conditions on either side of the family, if that’s what you’re asking. Mostly heart stuff and diabetes, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That gives me a good starting point. So, some family history of diabetes and heart conditions. No known family history of significant skin issues. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I haven’t had a drink in… oh, goodness, probably thirty years. After my wife… I just didn't have the taste for it anymore. I’m not much of a social drinker anyway, never really was. I prefer a cup of tea, if anything. I try to stay healthy, Doctor. It’s important.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Mr. Ferneding. So, no smoking, no alcohol consumption. That’s positive. Now, let's talk about your social history a bit further. What do you do with your time?
PATIENT: Well, mostly I keep to myself these days. I used to be a dispatcher, for a trucking company. Retired a few years back. Now I mostly read, a lot of history books. And I do a little bit of gardening, mostly vegetables. Just to keep busy, you know? I don't get out much. I live alone, so… it’s mostly quiet. I used to volunteer at the library, but… I haven't been going lately. Just haven't had the energy, with this itching and everything. It’s hard to concentrate when you’re constantly uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you enjoy reading and gardening, and were active with volunteering. It’s understandable that the itching is making it difficult to maintain those activities. To summarize, you've been experiencing generalized itchiness for several weeks, with no visible rash and minimal relief from lotions. You have a history of controlled hypertension, take Lisinopril 20mg daily, and have family history of diabetes and heart conditions. You are a non-smoker, non-drinker, and live a relatively quiet lifestyle. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to assess your skin and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I’m just hoping to get to the bottom of this, honestly. It’s been driving me a little bit crazy. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to start by taking your vital signs, then I’ll examine your skin. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. I’m not seeing any obvious rash, lesions, or areas of significant redness. Your skin is generally dry to the touch, with some very mild excoriation on your forearms – that's likely from scratching. There's no swelling or any other noticeable abnormalities. I also don’t see any signs of jaundice. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Given your history of hypertension, I’m always mindful to listen carefully. Based on this brief exam, there's nothing immediately concerning that jumps out at me. However, the persistent itchiness without a visible cause warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: That's… good to know, I suppose. It's just frustrating, because it feels so real, but it doesn’t look like anything’s wrong. So, what do we do next, Doctor? Are you thinking blood tests? Something else? I trust your judgment, of course, I just want to get this sorted out. It's interfering with everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Ferneding. It’s often more challenging when the physical exam doesn’t reveal an obvious cause. Given the persistent itchiness and lack of visible rash, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out several potential causes. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or inflammation. I also want to check your liver function tests to rule out any liver issues, as those can sometimes cause itching. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can also present with skin symptoms. Finally, I’d like to check your kidney function. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to get any tests done. I just want to know what’s causing this. Tests are good. It's better to know than to just sit here scratching! Where do we go from here? Do I need to make an appointment somewhere else, or can it be done here? And… how long does it usually take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. I’ll write you a lab requisition. The nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to take you to the lab. It usually takes 3-5 business days to get the results back. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin with a fragrance-free lotion, and avoiding any harsh soaps or detergents. Also, try to avoid scratching as much as possible, even though I know that’s difficult. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Moisturize, avoid scratching… easier said than done, but I’ll try. Three to five days… I can manage that. Thank you for taking the time to listen, and for running the tests. It's a relief just to be doing something about it. I appreciate it. Sarah, you said? I'll keep an ear out for her.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I understand it’s frustrating, and I'm glad we’re taking steps to investigate. Yes, Sarah will be along shortly. She’s a very good nurse. In the meantime, I'll get this requisition to the lab so they're prepared when Sarah brings you back. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
