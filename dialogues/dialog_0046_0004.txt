DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Dr. Glowka. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. My husband, Ben, said it was time for some of those… shots, I guess. Routine immunizations, he called ‘em. Keeps me up to date, he says. I don’t always remember what I’ve had, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible of both of you. It's good to stay on top of those things, and it’s perfectly common to not remember every vaccination. We can certainly review what you’ve had and see what’s due. Before we get to the immunizations, though, I’d like to get a little more of a general picture of your health. Have you been feeling well overall?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. I mean, I’m 53, so things creak a little more each year, you know? But nothing major. No big aches or pains, no catching any nasty colds lately. Energy’s been good, I’ve been keeping busy helping Ben with some building projects. He’s a carpenter, and I lend a hand where I can – mostly organizing, not so much lifting anymore!
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, and it's wonderful you’re staying active. “Staying busy” is good for the soul! Just to be thorough, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any changes in your weight recently – either gain or loss?
PATIENT: Hmm, not really. I try to keep pretty steady. Maybe a pound or two here and there, but nothing that’s worried me. Ben makes good food, so it’s easy to keep some weight on! I’m usually around 114, give or take. It fluctuates a bit depending on the season, I think. More in the winter when I’m not out gardening as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Nope, appetite’s been pretty normal. I always enjoyed my food. Still do! Maybe a little less in the really hot weather we’ve been having, but that’s just ‘cause I don’t feel like cooking when it’s sweltering. Ben’s been doing most of the grilling lately, which is fine by me!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good arrangement! Alright, Ms. Fornes, let’s talk a little bit about any medical conditions you might have. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. The doctors always said I had a strong heart. Ben’s side of the family has some trouble with… I think it was diabetes, but I don’t have it, and I’ve never been told I’m close to getting it. I’ve always been pretty active, even before helping Ben. Lots of walking, gardening… just general moving around.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Years ago, when I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. That’s about it, though. Nothing since then, thankfully. It was a long time ago, and I recovered just fine. No problems from that at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, stroke, or anything else that’s been common?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mom, she had some trouble with her heart when she got older, but I don’t know all the details. She didn’t talk about it much. And my dad… he was pretty healthy all his life, actually. Ben’s mom had… something with her lungs, I think. Emphysema, maybe? He’d have to remind me. It wasn't on my side of the family, though. We were mostly just a hardy bunch, to be honest. Not a lot of sick days growing up. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? It's hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It is hard to keep track of! Knowing anything at all is helpful. We'll focus on what you do remember. Now, just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else, like bee stings?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much everything. Ben likes to try new recipes, and I'm usually the guinea pig. Never had a reaction to anything. I've been stung by a bee or two in the garden, but nothing more than a little swelling. Nothing that needed a trip to the doctor, thankfully. I think I’m pretty lucky that way, too. No major allergies to report.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Fornes. Alright, before we move on to the physical exam and vaccinations, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I don’t take any pills, vitamins, nothing. I try to eat a good diet, stay active, and that’s usually enough. Ben always jokes that I’m too stubborn to take medicine. He's probably right. I like to keep things natural, if I can. I just don’t like the idea of relying on pills all the time. So, no medications for me, Dr. Glowka. Not a one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And just one last question before we proceed with the exam. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mom smoked, and I hated it. Just awful. Ben doesn't smoke either. We both believe in keeping our lungs nice and clean. So, no, never have and never will. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Fornes. That's excellent information to have. Alright, it sounds like you're in very good health overall. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything's as it should be. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go right ahead, Dr. Glowka. I don't mind at all. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… odd.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Is that good? I try to breathe deeply when I’m gardening, helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Next, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I always get a little nervous when they take my blood pressure, even though I know it’s probably fine. Old habits, I guess.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute and regular. Now, I’m going to briefly examine your ears, nose and throat. Could you open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Ahhhh. Is that loud enough? I used to sing in a choir, so I’m used to opening my mouth!
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Ears are clear as well. Finally, I'm just going to feel your lymph nodes in your neck.
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. They’ve always felt normal to me, but I’m happy to have you check.
DOCTOR: Your lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. Alright, Ms. Fornes, that completes the physical exam. Everything sounds and looks good. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, you appear to be in excellent health. Are there any specific concerns you have that we haven’t discussed yet?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything. Honestly, I just wanted to make sure I was up to date on my shots, and I wanted a professional to tell me I wasn’t falling apart! You’ve put my mind at ease, Dr. Glowka. I appreciate it. So, what about those immunizations now?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear! Let’s talk about the vaccinations then. Based on your age and health history, I recommend a Tdap booster , an annual influenza vaccine, and a pneumococcal vaccine. Do you have any questions about any of those?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds like a lot of shots! I think I remember getting a tetanus shot when I was younger, but I don’t know about the others. What exactly is pertussis? And is the flu shot the one that doesn’t give you the flu, right? I always worry about catching something from the shot itself.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and a common concern! Let’s go through them one by one. Tdap is a booster to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – whooping cough. Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory infection, and it can be very serious, especially in adults. As for the flu shot, you are correct – it won't give you the flu. It’s made with an inactivated virus, so it can’t cause the infection. You may experience some mild side effects like soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever, but those usually resolve within a day or two. The pneumococcal vaccine protects against a common type of pneumonia. Since you're over 65, it's recommended to help prevent this potentially serious infection. Would you like me to go into more detail about any of those, or do you feel comfortable proceeding with all three today?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a little more sense. Pneumonia… Ben actually had pneumonia last winter, it was pretty bad. So that one sounds like a good idea. I think I’m most nervous about the pertussis one, just because I don’t know much about it. What are the side effects like for that one? And how long do they usually last? I’m okay with getting them, I just like to know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, and I’m happy to answer any questions. The most common side effects of the Tdap vaccine are soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site. Some people experience a mild fever, headache, or fatigue. These side effects are usually mild and resolve within a day or two. Serious side effects are very rare. We can start with the pneumococcal vaccine today, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to administer the Tdap vaccine. Or, if you prefer, we can do both today, if you’re comfortable with that. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think I’d rather just do one today, and then come back for the other one. Less poking all at once, you know? Pneumococcal sounds good for today. Let’s get that one taken care of, and then we can schedule the other one. Is there a good time next week? I’m pretty flexible, as long as it’s not too early in the morning. Ben likes to sleep in!
DOCTOR: Excellent. That sounds like a good plan. Alright, I'm scheduling you for the pneumococcal vaccine now. And I’m booking your follow-up appointment for the Tdap vaccine for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Does that time work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM sounds perfect. Thank you, Dr. Glowka. That wasn’t so bad! I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing I’m taking care of myself. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Like, should I avoid any activities or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes! I’m glad I could help. For the pneumococcal vaccine, you can continue your normal activities. You may experience some mild soreness at the injection site, but that should resolve within a day or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with any discomfort. I'll also send you a discharge summary with details about the vaccine and instructions for follow-up care. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been wonderful, Dr. Glowka. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. I'll see you next Tuesday!
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Fornes. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a wonderful day!
