DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bahta, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Sink. I am here, if I understand correctly, to see if my… situation qualifies for help at home. My daughter, she explained something about… hospice care, but also help before it gets to that point, if possible. It is a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Hospice" is a strong word, Mr. Bahta. We offer a range of services, yes, and preventative care is always best. But let’s start at the beginning. What specific difficulties are you experiencing that led you to seek this help?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I am a surgeon, you see. Pediatric, mostly. But my hands… they are not what they once were. The shaking… it began slowly, perhaps six months ago. Now, it is… difficult to hold the instruments steady. I have had to… reduce my hours. My daughter, she worries, naturally. She says I should not push myself. And… getting around the house is becoming a bit of a challenge, too. Simple things, like preparing meals or… dressing myself. It’s… frustrating. I am not used to needing assistance.
DOCTOR: Six months, you say. And is this shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… more frequent now. In the mornings, it is often quite bad. I need a strong coffee to even attempt to steady them. And… when I am stressed, it worsens significantly. During operations, it became… noticeable to my colleagues. That is when I knew I had to… consider something had to change. It is not constant, no. Sometimes, for a short period, they are… manageable. But it is becoming less predictable.
DOCTOR: Have you seen anyone about this shaking, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I saw a neurologist, Doctor Leclerc, in May. He… ran some tests. Scans, and… things to measure the nerves. He said it was… essential tremor. He prescribed some medication, but it did not… help much. Just made me feel… unwell. I stopped taking it after a week. He suggested… physical therapy, which I have been doing for about a month now. It is… slow progress, at best.
DOCTOR: Essential tremor… right. And what specific symptoms did the medication cause?
PATIENT: Mostly… nausea, Doctor. A great deal of nausea. And dizziness. It made it difficult to concentrate, which, as you can imagine, is not ideal for a surgeon. Even walking felt… unsteady. My daughter, she was very concerned. We decided it was best to stop, even though Doctor Leclerc insisted I persevere. He said it takes time for the body to adjust. But I simply felt… worse. It did not seem worth the discomfort.
DOCTOR: It sounds like the medication wasn't a good fit. Many patients experience side effects. Let's move on. Besides the tremor and difficulty with daily activities, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My appetite has been… diminished, I suppose. I am not eating as much as I used to. And I’ve been… rather tired. More tired than usual. Even after a full night’s sleep. But I assumed that was just… age. And stress, of course. It has been a difficult few months, trying to adjust. Perhaps a bit of… sadness, too. I do miss my work. But I try not to dwell on it. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Diminished appetite, fatigue, some sadness… Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Bahta. It's important to get a complete picture. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My daughter, she pointed it out. I… I have lost some weight. Perhaps five or six kilograms, over the last few months. I haven’t been… diligently weighing myself, but she says my clothes feel… looser. She worries I am not eating enough, naturally. She is a very attentive daughter. I try to reassure her, but… I do feel somewhat weaker than I used to. It is not dramatic, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulty with your balance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is not… falling over, or anything. But I do feel… unsteady on my feet, occasionally. Especially when I turn my head quickly. Or when I am trying to get up from a chair. It requires… more effort than it used to. And I tend to… brace myself against furniture, just in case. It is… embarrassing, to be honest. A surgeon should have steady feet. It is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. Let’s do a quick exam. Blood pressure… 130/80. Pulse… 72, regular. Temperature… 37 degrees Celsius. Respiration… 16. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are… slightly diminished. Now, let’s check your gait and balance. Please stand up and walk a few steps. Gait is somewhat slow and steady, but with a slight tremor. Balance is… slightly impaired, as you mentioned. We’ll need to do some further tests. Blood work, to rule out anything else. And I think a more comprehensive neurological evaluation is warranted.
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. I am happy to do whatever tests are necessary. I simply want to understand what is happening, and… what can be done to improve my situation. The uncertainty is… unsettling. Blood work and another evaluation… yes, that is… acceptable. Will you arrange those appointments, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll arrange the blood work and a referral to Dr. Chen, a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders. He’s quite good. I'll have my nurse schedule those appointments for you before you leave. In the meantime, I’m going to order a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. It's standard procedure to rule out any underlying causes. While we’re waiting for the results, I suggest avoiding any strenuous activity, and focus on getting adequate rest. And I recommend you consider a support group for individuals with neurological conditions. It can be helpful to talk to others who are experiencing similar challenges.
PATIENT: That… sounds very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Dr. Chen, you say? I will certainly look forward to meeting him. And the blood tests, of course. I appreciate your recommendations regarding rest and… the support group. Although, I must admit, the thought of discussing my situation with strangers is… slightly daunting. But I will consider it. Perhaps once I have a clearer understanding of… what is happening. And regarding the strenuous activity, yes, my daughter has already made that quite clear. She is… very protective. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel… somewhat reassured, at least knowing that we are taking steps to investigate this further.
DOCTOR: Good. My nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork and the appointment details. She’ll also give you a list of local support groups. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been… very helpful. I appreciate your time and attention. And I will await my nurse's arrival. Thank you again. I suppose… that concludes our meeting, then.
DOCTOR: Yes. Have a good day, Mr. Bahta. .
