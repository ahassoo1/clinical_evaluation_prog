DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It is nice to meet you. Well, I have been… how you say… making a whistling sound when I breathe. It happens mostly when I walk fast, or go up the stairs. It is a little worrying, you see.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound with exertion… alright. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. It started… maybe two months ago? At first, it was just sometimes, when I was really trying hard. Now, it happens more often. It does not hurt, just… uncomfortable. And a little scary.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable and scary, I understand. And is this whistling sound constant when you're exerting yourself, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. If I stop and rest, it goes away. Then, if I start walking again… it comes back. It is not every time I walk, but more often now than before. I used to be able to walk quite far, you know. I am an athletic trainer. I help people with their exercises. But now… I worry about keeping up with my work.
DOCTOR: An athletic trainer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For many years. I help young athletes with their stretching and strengthening. It is good work, keeps me busy. But this whistling… it makes me feel old, you see? And I worry I cannot do my job properly if I cannot breathe well.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Kilton, whistling sounds with exertion can be a number of things. It's good you’re aware of it. Let's go through some questions to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the whistling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes, my chest feels a little tight. Not pain, exactly. Just… squeezed. And I have been a little more tired than usual, maybe? I thought it was just the summer heat, you know. It has been very warm. But perhaps it is connected to the whistling.
DOCTOR: Chest tightness and fatigue. Alright. Do you have any cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No cough. Nothing like that. Just the whistling and the tightness. And the tiredness, but I sleep well, usually. Eight hours, every night.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not recently. I had a little sniffle in the spring, but nothing serious. It went away very quickly. I am usually very healthy, you see. I take good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have never had any trouble with my lungs before. I was a very active child, and I have always enjoyed exercise. My doctor always said I had a very strong constitution. But my mother… she had some trouble breathing when she was older. I do not know exactly what it was. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: And your mother’s trouble…do you recall if it was ever diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. It was a long time ago, in Bhutan. Things were… different then. She just… got weaker and weaker. She had a cough, sometimes. And she tired easily. But I do not know if it was the same as this whistling sound I am having. It was a very sad time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have taken many medications over the years – for headaches, and small things like that – and I have never had a reaction. I am not allergic to any foods, either. I eat everything. My husband used to say I had a cast iron stomach. He is gone now, though. It has been many years.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just a vitamin D supplement in the winter, sometimes. But I have not taken it for a few months now. The summer sun is enough, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Kilton, given your description, it could be a number of things. The most likely explanation, given your age and activity level, is some degree of airway narrowing. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs and then we can discuss some possible next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very sensible. Listening to my lungs… yes, please do. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what is causing this whistling sound, and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Again… deep breath in… and out. Hmm. I do hear some mild wheezing, particularly when you exhale. It’s not severe, but it's there. And your breathing rate is slightly elevated, but within normal limits. This suggests some degree of airway obstruction. It could be early asthma, or it could be something else. We’ll need to do a few tests to be sure.
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? Will they be painful? I do not like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Kilton, the most helpful test would be a spirometry test – a breathing test. It involves breathing into a machine. No needles involved. It simply measures how much air you can blow in and out, and how fast you can do it. It’s not painful at all. We may also want to do a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything else that could be going on. That does involve some radiation, but it's a very low dose. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A breathing test… that sounds alright. No needles, that is good. And a picture of my chest… hmm. Is the radiation very much, Doctor? I have heard stories… I do not want to get sick from the picture. I just want to be able to breathe properly again.
DOCTOR: The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very minimal, Mrs. Kilton. It’s comparable to the background radiation we’re exposed to every day. The benefit of identifying the cause of your symptoms far outweighs the very small risk. We will, of course, take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. Let's schedule the spirometry test first, and then we can discuss the chest X-ray. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. If you say it is very little radiation, I trust you. A breathing test first, then maybe the picture. When can I have the breathing test? I would like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, you see. I have my students to think of.
DOCTOR: Alright. The earliest we can get you in for spirometry is next Tuesday at 10 AM. Does that work with your schedule?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten… yes, that is fine. That is perfectly alright. Then we will talk about the picture after that? I hope it does not take too long. I have a class in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tuesday at 10 AM it is. After the spirometry, we’ll review the results, and then we can schedule the chest X-ray if necessary. It typically takes about 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity that triggers the whistling sound. And if it worsens or you develop any other symptoms, such as a fever or chest pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. No strenuous activity, and contact you if it gets worse. Thank you for listening to me. I feel much better knowing what is happening, and what we are going to do about it. I will see you on Tuesday, then.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll see you Tuesday. Have a good day, Mrs. Kilton.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
