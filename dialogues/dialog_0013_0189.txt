DOCTOR: Hi Arbie, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not lovely to be here, if you want to know. But… I’ve been, uh… noticing some things. In the, you know… the toilet. Blood. Streaked, like. It’s not right. I haven’t had problems like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Noticing blood in your stool is definitely something we want to look into. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When did you first notice this happening, Arbie?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been… a week, maybe? A little longer? Time just… slips away when you’re older, you know. It wasn’t a lot at first, just a little streak here and there. But it’s been getting… more noticeable. And frankly, a bit worrying. I used to have a strong constitution, you know. Flew those big planes for years. Never sick a day in my life.
DOCTOR: I understand, and it’s completely valid to be worried when you notice a change like this, especially after being so healthy for so long. A week or so is helpful to know. Has there been any change in your bowel habits alongside the blood – like, are you more constipated, have diarrhea, or going more or less often than usual?
PATIENT: Constipated? No, not really. Everything's been… regular, if you get my meaning. Always have been a regular fella. No, it's just the… the color of things, you know? And the amount, creeping up. It's not a pleasant thought, I can tell you that. I eat my prunes, you know. Always have. Thought that would keep things… moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, “regular” is good to know. And you’re being proactive with the prunes, that’s excellent. Has the blood been bright red, dark red, or something else?
PATIENT: Bright, I think. Yes, bright red. Like… well, like you’d expect, I suppose. Not dark and… murky. Bright. And getting… more of it each time, if I'm honest. It’s a bit unnerving, really. Makes a man think.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Arbie. Bright red blood usually indicates bleeding closer to the rectum. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a physical exam? You mean… down there? Oh, goodness. Well, I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? I’ve been poked and prodded enough in my life, I suppose. Used to have to get checked out after every long flight. But… are you sure it's necessary? Can’t you just give me something for it?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to feel a little anxious about an exam, Arbie. I want to be thorough, and a quick exam will help me determine the source of the bleeding and the best course of action. It’s important to rule out anything serious. I'll explain everything as I go, and we can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. I’ll need to take your vital signs first – just your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll do a brief abdominal exam, and finally, a quick rectal exam. It won’t take long, and I'll be as gentle as possible. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Well, “gentle” is good to hear, I suppose. But… a rectal exam? Honestly, sounds dreadful. What exactly are you looking for? And will it… hurt? I have a sensitive… constitution, you know. Still. After all these years…
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Arbie. It's not the most comfortable exam, but it provides valuable information. I'm looking for any abnormalities – like hemorrhoids, fissures, or anything else that could be causing the bleeding. I'll be using lubrication and a gloved, finger to gently examine the rectum. It can be a little uncomfortable, but I'll be as gentle as possible. You might feel a slight pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. If you do feel any sharp pain, please let me know immediately, and we'll stop. I'll explain everything as I go, and I'll try to be as quick as possible. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: “A little” is doing a lot of work there, Doctor. But… alright. I suppose I have no choice. You’ve flown enough miles to know what discomfort is, haven’t you? I’ll try not to… flinch. Just… be quick about it. And explain everything, like you said. Don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. I appreciate your willingness. Let's start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 – perfectly normal. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Everything sounds normal here. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort there. Just… a little sensitive, maybe, if you press hard. But I’m an old man, you know. Everything’s a little sensitive these days. My bones ache, my muscles creak… But no real pain. Just… old age. Hurry on with the other bit, if you don't mind. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. I understand. We’ll get through this quickly. I'm going to ask you to lean forward a bit on the exam table. I'm going to apply some lubricating jelly to my gloved finger. Then, I'll gently insert it into your rectum to feel for any abnormalities. It will only take a moment. Remember, please let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Okay… I’m feeling some… slight tenderness. And I do feel a small internal hemorrhoid. It's not large, but it could be the source of the bleeding. I don’t feel any other masses or abnormalities. Alright. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, not… terrible. A bit undignified, if I’m honest. But not painful. Hemorrhoids, you say? Well, that's… something. I’ve heard of those. My father had those, come to think of it. So, that's it? That's the problem? Hemorrhoids?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear it wasn’t too bad, Arbie. And yes, it appears the most likely cause of the bleeding is a small internal hemorrhoid. It’s very common, especially as we get older. It doesn't always mean anything serious. However, it’s important to rule out other causes, just to be safe. Since you are uninsured, and this is a new symptom, I'd like to order a fecal occult blood test – that checks for blood in your stool that you can't see with the naked eye. It's a simple test you can do at home. I'll give you the kit now and instructions. Also, I recommend over-the-counter treatments for the hemorrhoids. Things like Preparation H or similar creams can help relieve the discomfort and reduce the bleeding. I’ll write down some recommendations for you. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Fecal… what now? Another test? Seems like a lot of fuss over a bit of blood. And Preparation H? My wife used to use that. Oh, goodness. This is… undignified. So, I do this test, use the cream… and then what? Will the bleeding just… stop? And you're sure it's not something worse? I’ve always been a healthy man.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Arbie. It may seem like a lot, but it's important to be thorough, especially since this is a new symptom. The fecal occult blood test helps us make sure there's no other source of bleeding in your digestive tract. It's a simple at-home test – you just collect a few small stool samples over a few days. If the test comes back negative, it's very likely the hemorrhoids are the sole cause of the bleeding. Using the Preparation H or a similar cream should help reduce the discomfort and bleeding. Increasing your fiber intake and staying hydrated can also help prevent future hemorrhoids. However, if the test is positive, or if the bleeding doesn't improve with the over-the-counter treatments, we’ll need to investigate further. In that case, I would refer you to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health. I will provide you with a list of low-cost clinics in the area. Do you have any questions about those options?
PATIENT: A specialist… more tests… This is all so much bother. Alright, alright. I’ll do the test. And I’ll try the cream. And I’ll eat more… fibre. Though I don’t see the point, really. I’ve lived this long without needing to worry about fibre. But thank you, Doctor. I suppose. You've been… patient. Even if I don’t like all this fuss. Now, can I go? I’d like to get home.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbie. And you’re right, you’ve lived a long and healthy life! It’s good you’re proactive about your health, even if it’s a bit of a bother. I understand it's not ideal. Yes, you can absolutely go home now. Here’s the kit for the fecal occult blood test and the list of recommended creams and local clinics. Please call my office if you have any questions or concerns after you’ve done the test, or if the bleeding worsens. And don't hesitate to call if you develop any new symptoms like abdominal pain, fever, or dizziness. Here is a work note for you to be excused from strenuous activity for the next week, while you recover. I’ll make a note in your chart to follow up with you in two weeks to discuss the test results. Take care, Arbie.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. Two weeks. I’ll… try to remember.
