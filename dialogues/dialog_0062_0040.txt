DOCTOR: Hi Clearance, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Well, it's this pain in my side that keeps coming back. And… the waterworks trouble, if you understand me. It’s been happening quite a bit lately. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but it’s very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s no problem at all – these things happen, and it’s important to get them checked out. We'll figure it out together. So, this pain in your side… can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s usually on my right side, lower down. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. Sometimes it’s just a discomfort, other times it's quite noticeable. And it comes and goes, doesn’t seem to have a pattern, not tied to eating or anything like that. It’s been going on for… oh, I suppose a few months now, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of intermittent dull ache on your right side. And you mentioned trouble with your waterworks – could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, well… I have to go to the toilet quite often, you see. More often than I used to, and sometimes it burns when I go. It’s not with every visit, but often enough to be a bother. And sometimes I feel like I haven’t emptied my bladder completely, even after I've just been. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, frequent urination, sometimes with burning, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. I’m going to make some notes here… Okay. Now, has anything changed in your life recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of, Doctor. My routine is pretty much the same as always. I live quietly, mostly at home. I haven’t travelled anywhere, haven’t changed my diet… I'm a simple man with simple habits, you see. I do try to drink plenty of water, though, which I read is good.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you're staying hydrated. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Well, a doctor told me years ago, maybe ten years back now, that my kidneys weren’t quite right. Something about lots of little… pockets in them. He said a name, a long name, but I’ve forgotten it, I’m afraid. He said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much, just to get regular check-ups. I’ve seen doctors, of course, but no one has mentioned it lately. I think it was Polycystic… something. Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does ring a bell. Polycystic Kidney Disease, or PKD. Okay, that's very important information. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never had a surgery in my life. I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to those things, to be honest. I try to avoid hospitals if I can, but when something bothers me enough, I do come in, like now. Mostly just regular check-ups and things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother, she had trouble with her waterworks when she got older, similar to me, I think. And my older brother, he was always a bit sickly, had kidney problems of some sort, but he passed away many years ago. I don't recall the details exactly, it was a long time ago. I don't have much family left, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of kidney issues and urinary problems. And do you have any allergies to medications, or any medications that you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medications, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing specific or ongoing. I prefer to avoid pills if I can, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies and no current medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness. It won't be uncomfortable, I promise. And I’ll check your vitals – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, I'm listening to your abdomen now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me… Good. Now, I'm going to gently press here, and here… any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: A little bit on my right side, yes. Not a sharp pain, like I said, just a… pressure, a dull ache. It’s not terribly bad, but I can feel it when you press there. The rest feels alright, I think. It’s hard for me to tell sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some mild tenderness on your right side. Your blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Okay. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a bit further to figure out what’s going on. The tenderness on your right side, combined with your urinary symptoms and family history of kidney issues, points to a few possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like a urinary tract infection, but given your history of possible PKD, we need to rule out more serious causes, such as a kidney infection or a flare-up of PKD. I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a blood test to assess your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, please go ahead. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgement. A blood test and a urine test, yes, that sounds good. The sooner we know, the better, I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll get the orders sent to the lab. They'll call you to schedule an appointment for the blood draw and urine sample collection. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. In the meantime, if you experience a fever, chills, severe pain in your back or side, or blood in your urine, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Fever, chills, severe pain, or blood in the urine – go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind a little more at ease knowing what to look out for. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clearance. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. We’ll get these tests done and figure out what's going on. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I’m grateful for your time and attention. I’ll wait for the lab to call and schedule the tests. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clearance. Take care, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Have a good day.
