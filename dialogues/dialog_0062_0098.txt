DOCTOR: Hi Demondre, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doc. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I just… kinda wanted to check things out. Been feelin’ alright, mostly. Just thought it was a good idea to see how I’m doin’. You know, before anything is wrong.
DOCTOR: That's a really smart idea, Demondre – preventative care is fantastic. It’s always better to get a baseline when you’re feeling well. “Kinda wanted to check things out” is a little vague, though. Could you tell me a bit more about what made you think it was a good idea to come in?
PATIENT: Hmm… good point. Okay. My… ex-wife, she always went to the doctor. Like, always. Said it was important. And… well, she was usually right about stuff. Plus, I been workin’ on the boats a lot lately, and it’s hard work. Just thought I should make sure everything’s okay with all that. I don’t really have a specific worry, just… general check-up stuff.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. It's great you're taking her advice and prioritizing your health, especially with a physically demanding job. “Working on the boats” – what kind of work are you doing exactly?
PATIENT: I'm a sailor and a marine oiler. Mostly I keep the engines runnin' smooth, check all the fluids, that kinda thing. Sometimes I’m up in the engine room for hours, it gets pretty hot and greasy. Lots of lifting, too. We go out for weeks at a time sometimes, so… yeah. It's good work, but it's work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a much better picture. So, a physically demanding job with potential for heat exposure and heavy lifting. Have you noticed any specific changes or symptoms—anything at all—since starting or continuing that work?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… I get tired, of course. That’s just from the work. And sometimes my back aches a little, but I figured that was just from liftin’ stuff. Oh! And I get pretty thirsty all the time, but I just drink more water. I don’t know if that’s somethin’ or not. Nothing major, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, some back pain with lifting, and increased thirst. Those are all things we should explore a little further. Let's start with the thirst. Has that increased recently, or is it just always been a bit higher than average?
PATIENT: It feels like it’s gotten a little worse lately, yeah. Like, I used to go through a normal-sized water bottle on a shift. Now I go through two, easy. And I still feel kinda thirsty. Not really bad thirsty, just… more thirsty than usual. I thought maybe it was just the heat, but… now that you ask, it does feel like it’s more than that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. Increased thirst, especially recently, is something we should definitely look into. And you mentioned some back pain. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s mostly lower back. Kinda a dull ache. It gets worse if I lift somethin’ heavy, or bend over for too long. It usually goes away after I rest for a bit. I just figured it was a pulled muscle or somethin’. I haven’t done anything about it, really. Just tried to be careful. It ain’t bad bad, just annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, lower back pain that’s aggravated by lifting and bending, and relieved with rest. And the increased thirst. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if anything stands out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I'd like to take a look at your back, and I’ll do some basic neurological tests—just to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Finally, I’ll check your hydration status. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds fine. No problem. Go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart and lungs sound good. Blood pressure and pulse are within normal limits. Now, let's take a look at your back. Could you bend forward for me, and then bend backward?
PATIENT: There we go. It kinda hurts when I bend over like that, yeah. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. There is some tenderness when I press on your lower back, and your range of motion is a bit limited, but your reflexes and muscle strength are normal, which is good. Now, let's quickly check your hydration status. I’m just going to look at the skin on the back of your hand. Your skin turgor seems normal, which suggests you’re adequately hydrated, but with the increased thirst, it's something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to pull up your EHR to see if there’s any past medical history that might be relevant. Do you have any known allergies or medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, no allergies. And I don’t take any meds. Never really been sick enough to need ‘em. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work, I guess. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or medications. That's good. Alright, Demondre. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it doesn't seem like anything is seriously wrong right now. However, the increased thirst and lower back pain are things we should investigate further. It's possible the increased thirst is simply due to working hard in the heat, but it's always best to rule out other potential causes. The back pain could be a muscle strain, but given that it's persistent, we should get an X-ray to rule out any structural issues. I'm going to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. I'm also going to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. If that’s what you think is best. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Blood work and an X-ray, right? When can I get those done?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Blood work and an X-ray. The lab and radiology are both right down the hall. I'll send an order over electronically. You can go whenever you're ready. It shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay well-hydrated, especially at work. If your back pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms – like fever, numbness, or weakness – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers everything, Doc. You explained it all pretty clear. Thanks for takin’ the time to look at me. I appreciate it. Just gotta get those tests done, I guess.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. We’ll get those results back to you as soon as possible and figure out a plan. Take care, and stay safe out there.
