DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, good to see you. Or… good to meet you, I suppose. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. Honestly, Doctor… Gorga, is it? I haven’t much time for this. It’s my skin. It’s… darkening. And I tire easily. A most inconvenient development, really. I’ve been a working man my entire life, always reinforcing iron and rebar… you wouldn't believe the things I've built. But lately… it’s been difficult.
DOCTOR: Darkening skin… and fatigue. Okay. When did you first notice the skin changes, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Honestly? I couldn’t say precisely. Some weeks, perhaps? Months? Time rather… slips away when one is occupied with actual work. It’s not as though I spend my days scrutinizing my complexion, Doctor. A gradual thing, I assure you. Not sudden, not… alarming. Just… undesirable.
DOCTOR: Right, gradual… Okay. And where is this darkening most noticeable?
PATIENT: Everywhere, really. Though, perhaps more… prominent on my arms. And hands, I suppose. The parts that are… exposed, naturally. One doesn’t darken under layers of clothing, does one? It’s simply… not logical. I've been working in the sun all my life, so it is what it is, you see? Though, I don’t understand why it's worse now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said fatigue… can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… weariness, Doctor. Simple exhaustion. I used to be able to work all day, every day. Now? A few hours, and I need to rest. It’s… irritating. I’m not a frail man, you know. Never have been. This simply isn’t… becoming. It hinders things. A great deal. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Right, a change in your usual energy levels… Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… well, my wife keeps saying I’m more… irritable. But honestly, that woman complains about everything. So, I wouldn’t put much stock in that. As for myself… no, not really. Perhaps a bit of thirst, but I live in a hot climate. It is what it is, I say again. Are we finished soon, Doctor? I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I want to take a look at your skin, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just a routine check. Then we’ll see what we’ve got. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. This is likely a waste of both our time, but proceed if you must. Just… be quick about it. I have a rather important matter to attend to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your skin. Hmm. There’s some increased pigmentation here, as you mentioned. And it does seem a bit…thickened in places. No pain with palpation, correct?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Though I fail to see what you are hoping to discover by prodding me. It is skin, Doctor. It has always been thus. A working man’s skin, weathered and… durable. I hardly think it requires such scrutiny. Honestly. Is there any point to this exercise?
DOCTOR: Just routine, Mr. Drahota. Heart sounds are… a little muffled, but within normal limits for your age. Lungs are clear. Do you have any history of liver problems, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Liver problems? Absolutely not! I've lived a clean life, Doctor. A hard life, yes, but clean. No drinking, no… foolishness. I eat well, I work hard, and I mind my own business. Liver problems are for… other people. I assure you, I am perfectly sound in that regard. Are you suggesting… something, Doctor? Because I assure you…
DOCTOR: No, no, not suggesting anything, Mr. Drahota. Just… ruling things out. Sometimes, changes in skin pigmentation can be related to underlying medical conditions. It’s my job to investigate. Do you take any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I don't believe in filling my body with… potions and chemicals. A little rest, a bit of common sense, that’s all a man needs. I've never taken a pill in my life, and I have no intention of starting now. Honestly, Doctor, is this truly necessary? It’s a bit of darkening, a bit of fatigue. It’s not as though I'm on my deathbed. I'm a working man, always have been. What else do you need to know? Let’s finish this. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Given your history and the exam findings, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing these changes. The fatigue and skin darkening could be related to sun exposure over your lifetime, but given the fatigue and the slight thickening of the skin, I'd like to be cautious. I want to order a couple of blood tests, just to rule out anything serious. A complete blood count, a liver panel, and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really, Doctor? All this fuss over a bit of weariness and a slight change in complexion? Fine. Do what you must. But I assure you, it will be a waste of time and money. Just… get it over with. I have commitments, you understand. And I'm still rather irritated about the whole affair. Now, where do I go to have these… tests performed? And how long will this take? I really haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: Here's the requisition. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance, though you mentioned you aren't insured, so you'll need to check with the lab about payment. It should be fairly quick, maybe 20-30 minutes. Once the results are back—usually a few days—we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’ll have my secretary contact you. And Mr. Drahota… If you experience any new symptoms—especially abdominal pain, jaundice, or severe weakness—please go to the emergency room immediately. Okay?
