DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever keeps coming back. It’s been a bit of a bother, honestly. Feels like it goes away for a day or two, then bam, it’s back. I figured I should get it checked out before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A recurring fever, you say. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about this fever?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not super high, you know? Usually around 101, 102 maybe. No chills or anything. Just… warm. And tired. Real tired. It doesn't really seem to come with anything else, no cough, no aches... just the heat and the feeling like I could sleep for a week. Happens mostly in the evenings, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, oh, maybe six weeks ago? Started kinda slow, figured it was just a little something going around. But then it kept reappearing. Like I said, a day or two good, then back it comes. Six weeks, give or take. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Six weeks is a bit long for just "something going around," yes. Have you taken anything for it – over-the-counter medications, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I took some Tylenol a few times. Helped bring the fever down for a bit, but it didn't stop it from coming back. I don't really like taking a lot of pills, so I mostly just try to rest and drink plenty of water. It hasn't really made a difference, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Appetite’s been a little off, maybe. Not much of one to begin with, you know? But nothing major. No rashes, no… well, I haven’t noticed anything else. It's just the fever and feeling worn out. My wife hasn’t said anything about me looking different, so I guess I haven’t been too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical problems – things like diabetes, heart trouble, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I had a bad back for a while, that’s why I see a chiropractor. Old injury. But other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, knock on wood. No diabetes, no heart problems… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Always tried to avoid them if I could. A little chiropractor work, that's it. I'm a pretty simple guy, Doctor. Don’t need a lot of fixing.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Let's see… my mother had high blood pressure when she got older, but that was about it. My father was healthy as an ox, lived to be 85. My wife’s side… well, they all seem pretty healthy too, if I remember right. No major illnesses that I’m aware of, no. Nothing like cancer or heart disease running in the family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, aside from whatever the chiropractor might have you use?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. The chiropractor gives me some stretches and tells me to use a heating pad sometimes. But no pills, no creams, nothing like that. Just trying to keep my back in line, that's all. I don’t like being dependent on stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's do a quick examination, if you don’t mind. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Just need to make sure everything sounds as it should. If you could just lie down on the table for me.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let’s get it over with. The quicker we do this, the quicker I can get back home. Just tell me if anything feels weird, I guess.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… regular. A little faint, but not concerning for someone your age. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Slightly diminished bowel sounds, but that could be normal. Temperature is 101.3. So, temperature confirmed. Pulse is 72, regular. Blood pressure is 130/80. Alright. Overall, your physical exam isn't showing anything dramatic. It’s still puzzling why you're having this recurring fever. Let’s get some blood work done, just to be sure. We’ll check a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a few inflammatory markers. That should give us a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Sounds… involved. Look, is this gonna be expensive? I don’t have insurance, and my wife and I are on a fixed income. I just wanted to figure out why I keep getting this fever, not break the bank.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Brege, I understand your concern about the cost. Unfortunately, determining the cause of a persistent fever often requires laboratory testing. I'll order the most essential tests to begin with, and we can discuss the results and any further testing needed. I can also see if the lab has any financial assistance programs available. But frankly, we need to rule out anything serious. I don't want to dismiss this without a proper investigation. I’m ordering a CBC, CMP, and ESR/CRP. The lab is across the hall. The nurse will give you the requisition form. After you’ve had the blood work done, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Do what you gotta do, Doctor. Just… please keep it as reasonable as possible. And tell me if there’s anything I can do to help keep the cost down. I guess I’ll go talk to the nurse then. Let’s just get this over with. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain the costs. And please, rest and stay hydrated in the meantime. We'll do our best to figure this out. Stop.
