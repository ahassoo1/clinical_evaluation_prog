DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A bad one. It won’t seem to get better.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sore on your foot… and how long has this sore been…troublesome, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it must be… maybe two, three months now? It started small, I think. Like a little cut, but it just… stayed. And got bigger. It hurts to walk, you know? Especially if I wear shoes.
DOCTOR: Two or three months… and it started as a small cut that hasn’t healed. And the pain is worse with shoes. Is it on a particular part of your foot?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my big toe. Right where it bends when I walk. It’s a bit red around it, too. Not…swollen, I don’t think, but red.
DOCTOR: Okay, bottom of the foot near the big toe, red around it… no swelling, you said. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm… let me see… Sometimes, when I change my socks, there’s a little bit of… wetness. Not a lot. Just a little. It’s not… pus-like, if that makes sense. More like… water.
DOCTOR: Alright, some clear drainage… not pus-like. And you mentioned pain with walking and shoes. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been keeping it clean. Washing it with soap and water, every day. And I tried some bandages, but they just… stick to it. It’s hard to keep it covered. My wife, before she passed, she used to put some ointment on it, but I can't remember what kind. Something for cuts, I think.
DOCTOR: Keeping it clean is good. And I understand about forgetting… it happens. Do you have any other medical problems, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh yes. The doctor told me… years ago… I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that's it. I take pills for it, every morning. And I see the eye doctor, too, because of it.
DOCTOR: Diabetes… alright. And you take medication for that, and see the eye doctor regularly. Do you know what kind of medication you’re on for the diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I'm not very good with remembering names. It's a little white pill, I think. Two of them, every morning with breakfast. I get them from the pharmacy, and they always know what I need. I don’t want to mess anything up by saying the wrong thing, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Let me just check your records here… Ah, yes. Metformin. Two 500mg tablets twice a day. Okay. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had a problem with any pills, as far as I can remember. My wife always made sure I didn’t take anything I shouldn’t. She was very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s take a look at this foot. If you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. It's a bit embarrassing, showing an old man's feet, but… I want to get this fixed.
DOCTOR: Hmm… Okay. I see the sore. It’s located on the bottom of your foot, near your big toe, as you said. It's a bit red and swollen. I’m checking your circulation… Your pulse is a little weak, but it's there. It’s important to keep an eye on sores like this, especially with diabetes, because they can be slow to heal.
PATIENT: Yes, my wife always said that too. She was always worried about my feet. So, is it bad, Doctor? Will it heal? I just want to be able to walk without pain again.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad”, Mr. Stoegbauer, but it does require attention. Because of your diabetes, it's important to prevent infection and promote healing. It may take some time, and we'll need to be diligent. I'm going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels and look for any signs of infection. And I want to get an X-ray to rule out any bone involvement. We’ll also need to keep the wound clean and protected. I'm going to recommend a special type of dressing for the wound, and I will have the nurse show you how to change it properly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. And I’m happy to let the nurse show me how to change the bandage. I’m not very good with these things, but I’ll try my best. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Good. We'll take it one step at a time. I’m also going to give you a referral to a podiatrist. They specialize in foot care and can help with ongoing management of the wound. It’s important to have someone who focuses specifically on your feet. I'll also write you a prescription for some antibiotic ointment, just as a precaution. Are you currently experiencing any fever, chills, or increased pain around the wound?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. The pain is just… constant. Like a dull ache. It doesn't get much worse, but it never really goes away either. It's just… there. Especially when I try to walk.
DOCTOR: Constant dull ache, worse with walking. Okay. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, to summarize: we’re going to get some blood work and an X-ray. I’m referring you to a podiatrist, and I’m prescribing antibiotic ointment. The nurse will show you how to change the dressing, and we’ll follow up with you in a week to see how things are progressing. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very well. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I just want to thank you for taking the time to look at my foot. I feel much better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's my job. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the dressing change and answer any questions you might have. Alright, that concludes our visit today.
PATIENT: .
