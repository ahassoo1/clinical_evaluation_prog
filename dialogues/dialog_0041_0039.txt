DOCTOR: Good morning, Lindsey. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Derell. It's nice to meet you as well. The office sent me a letter, said my cholesterol was a bit high. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. Don't really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholesterol… yes, I see the lab results here. It does look like it’s a little elevated. No worries, that’s very common. It's good you came in to get it checked out. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little bit about your health in general?
PATIENT: Well, I'm 88 years old, so things ain’t perfect, you know? I used to be strong as an ox, working all those years, but now I get tired quicker. Mostly just pottering around the house these days. My wife, bless her soul, she passed away five years ago. Been on my own since then. Still cooking for myself though, and I try to keep the house tidy. What sort of things are you wanting to know?
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. That must be difficult. And it's good you’re staying active, even with the pottering around. Okay, just trying to get a general picture. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Doctor said something about my blood pressure being a little high years ago, maybe fifteen years back? Put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. Didn't feel it was doing much, and I didn't like taking pills. Never had diabetes, as far as I know. And my heart... well, it feels alright. Gets a bit fluttery sometimes when I climb the stairs, but nothing too bad. I had a really good doctor back in the city, but he retired years ago and I never really found anyone to replace him.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, stopped medication… and occasional fluttering in your chest. That's helpful to know. Do you remember what the name of that medication was, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. My memory ain't what it used to be, you know? Little white pill, I think. That’s all I remember. Came in a little orange bottle. Honestly, I just stopped when I didn't feel any different. Seemed like a waste of time, if you want to know the truth. Doctor never pushed me on it too hard, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright. It’s common to forget those details. No worries at all. And I understand not wanting to take medication if you weren’t feeling a benefit. Now, aside from the occasional fluttering, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Hmm... Well, my legs get a bit tired when I walk too far, like when I go to the shops. And sometimes I get a bit of a pain in my calf when I’m resting. Nothing awful, just a bit annoying. Oh, and I get a bit short of breath sometimes, but I put that down to my age, really. I get out of breath just walking up the garden path now. I’m not as spry as I used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, leg tiredness, calf pain, and shortness of breath. Those things are worth looking into a bit further. Do you notice if the calf pain is worse at certain times of the day, or when you’re doing specific activities?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… it seems worse when I’ve been sitting for a while. Like if I’m sitting watching television, then get up to go to the kitchen, that’s when it hurts the most. It usually goes away pretty quick, once I’ve been walking around a bit. And it’s always in my right calf, never my left. Funny, isn’t it? Only the right one.
DOCTOR: That is interesting, that it's only in your right calf. We'll definitely want to check a few things. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulses in your legs. Then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead. I always did trust doctors, even if they do talk funny sometimes. I don't understand half of what they say, but they always seem to know what they're doing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 85. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs sound clear, but you do have a slightly reduced breath sound on the right side. Now, I'm going to check the pulses in your legs. The pulses in your right foot are a little weaker than in your left. Also, I notice some slight swelling in your right ankle. Does that feel normal to you?
PATIENT: Oh, my ankle? Well, I hadn’t really noticed. It might be a bit puffy, now that you mention it. I thought it was just my old age making me swell up. I do get a bit of swelling in my feet sometimes, especially in the summer. It usually goes down when I put my feet up. But you're right, it does seem a bit worse on the right side. Is that bad? I hope it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: It's good you pointed that out. Okay, the weakened pulse, the swelling, and the calf pain on one side… those things together raise a possibility of something called peripheral artery disease, or PAD. It means there might be some narrowing of the arteries in your legs, which can reduce blood flow. Now, I'm not saying for certain that's what it is, but we need to investigate further. I'd like to order a simple test called an ankle-brachial index, or ABI. It's non-invasive – we just compare the blood pressure in your arms and ankles. It can give us a good idea of how well the blood is flowing. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Peripheral artery… what did you call it? Sounds serious. Narrowed arteries… Is that… dangerous? And a test… is it painful? I don't like needles, you know. I just want to get this cholesterol sorted, not end up with a whole load of other problems. It's just that I’m not as strong as I used to be, and I don’t want anything complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and it's good you’re asking questions. Peripheral artery disease, or PAD, can be serious if left untreated, but it’s very manageable, and we caught it early, so that’s good. It doesn't have to mean complicated procedures. The ABI test is not painful. It’s just like taking blood pressure, we use a cuff to measure the pressure in your arms and ankles. No needles involved at all. It’s a quick, simple test and will give us a better understanding of what's going on. If the test shows some narrowing, we can talk about lifestyle changes, like walking more, and possibly medication to help improve blood flow. It's all about managing it, and keeping you comfortable and active. Would you be okay with getting that test done today?
PATIENT: No needles… that’s good. And it won’t make me worse? Just measuring blood pressure, like normal? Alright then, yes. I suppose so. If it’s just a quick test and it won’t hurt, then go ahead. But promise me you'll explain everything clearly if it shows something. I don’t like surprises, you know. And I want to get this sorted as quick as possible. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: I promise I will explain everything clearly, step-by-step, no surprises. And we'll take things at your pace. It’s good to be proactive. Okay, just lie back and relax. I’m going to put these cuffs on your arms and ankles. It might feel a little tight, like when we took your blood pressure earlier. We'll start with your right arm…
PATIENT: Alright then. I’ll just close my eyes and try to relax. You just tell me what you're doing. And don't hesitate to stop if I say anything. I always did trust doctors, but I do get a bit nervous with all these tests. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just inflating the cuff on your right arm now… You'll feel it tightening for a few seconds, then it’ll release. Okay, good. Now I’m going to listen to the pulse in your right ankle with this Doppler… There we go, I can hear it. I’m going to record the reading… Okay, good. Now we’ll repeat the same process on your left arm and left ankle… Just breathing normally… This might take a few minutes, so just let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright… just taking it easy. Doppler… feels a bit cold, doesn't it? But not too bad. I always did have poor circulation, my wife used to say. Just let me know when you’re finished. She would have known what all this meant, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve got the results now. It appears you have some reduced blood flow in your right leg, which confirms our suspicion of peripheral artery disease. It's not severe at this stage, but it’s something we need to address. The ABI ratio on your right leg is 0.7, which indicates mild to moderate arterial disease. It explains the fatigue in your leg, the calf pain, and the slightly weaker pulse. Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll be confined to a chair. There are a lot of things we can do to manage this. The first step is lifestyle changes… more walking, stopping smoking if you smoke, and managing any other health conditions you may have. I’d also like to prescribe a medication called clopidogrel, a blood thinner, to help prevent blood clots and improve blood flow. Would you be open to trying that?
PATIENT: Blood thinner… that sounds dangerous. I don’t like the sound of that at all. What if I cut myself? What if I start bleeding? I’m an old man, you know, things don’t heal as quickly. And walking more… my leg gets tired so easily. It’s just… I don’t want to make things worse. Is there anything else I can do? I’ve always been careful, you know. Never smoked, never drank much. I don’t want to end up in hospital.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, and I'm glad you're asking. I understand your worry about bleeding, and it’s important to address that. Clopidogrel does increase your risk of bleeding slightly, but it's a small risk, and we can manage it. We’ll monitor you closely, and I'll give you clear instructions on what to watch out for. The risk of not treating the PAD is actually higher. It can lead to more serious problems, like pain at rest, ulcers, and even amputation in severe cases. We’ll start with a low dose of clopidogrel, and we’ll adjust it as needed. You’ll also need regular check-ups, and you should let me know immediately if you experience any unusual bleeding, like nosebleeds, blood in your urine or stool, or easy bruising. As for walking, we’ll start slowly. We’ll work with a physical therapist who can develop a personalized exercise plan for you. It's about gradually increasing your activity level, and stopping when you feel pain. We'll also discuss some dietary changes that can help improve your circulation. Would you like me to explain the medication in more detail, and we can talk about the potential side effects?
PATIENT: Alright… if you think it’s necessary. But I don't want any surprises, like you said. What sort of side effects are we talking about? And what about my cholesterol? Have you forgotten about that? Is the clopidogrel going to help with that, or do I still need to worry about that as well? I just want everything sorted out, you know. A clear plan, and no complications.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I haven’t forgotten about your cholesterol, and you’re right to ask. Let’s cover everything step-by-step. Clopidogrel is a blood thinner, it helps prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. The most common side effect is bruising, as we’ve discussed. There’s a small risk of bleeding, but it’s manageable. Some people experience mild stomach upset, but that usually goes away on its own. Rare but serious side effects can include allergic reactions and a condition called TTP, but we’ll monitor you closely for any signs of those. As for your cholesterol, the clopidogrel won’t directly lower your cholesterol levels. It addresses the PAD, which is a separate issue. We will still need to address your cholesterol. I’d recommend starting a statin medication, like atorvastatin, to lower your LDL cholesterol. Statins are very effective and generally well-tolerated. We'll discuss the potential side effects of that as well. So, to summarise, our plan is: 1. Clopidogrel: to manage the PAD and improve blood flow. 2. Atorvastatin: to lower your cholesterol levels. 3. Lifestyle changes: more walking, a healthy diet, and regular check-ups. 4. Physical Therapy: To start a safe and gradual exercise plan. Would you like me to explain each medication in more detail, and we can talk about the potential side effects of the statin as well?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds like a lot, but I suppose it’s better than just letting things get worse. I do trust your judgement, you seem to know what you’re doing. But I still don't like the sound of these pills. Tell me about the statin then. What sort of side effects does that have? And will I need to take these pills for the rest of my life? I don’t want to be dependent on medication, you know. I’m just an old man, I want to live out my days in peace, not worrying about all these pills and side effects.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, and you're right to ask all these questions. It’s good you’re being so proactive. It’s true, managing these conditions often involves medication, but we can work together to minimize any side effects and make sure you’re comfortable. Atorvastatin, the statin, helps lower your LDL cholesterol, which is the "bad" cholesterol that contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries. The most common side effect is muscle aches and pains. Some people experience mild stomach upset or nausea. Rare but serious side effects can include liver problems and a condition called rhabdomyolysis, but we’ll monitor your liver function regularly to make sure everything is okay. The good news is, most people tolerate statins very well, and the benefits often outweigh the risks. We’ll start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. As for whether you’ll need to take these pills for the rest of your life… that’s a good question. In most cases, people with PAD and high cholesterol need to stay on these medications long-term to prevent further plaque buildup and reduce their risk of heart attack and stroke. However, we can reassess your situation periodically and see if you’re able to reduce the dosage or even stop the medications at some point. Would you like me to write down all these medications and side effects for you to review at home?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I always forget things, you know. And write down those exercises as well, the ones the physical therapist is going to give me. And… Thank you. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and you haven’t rushed me. That means a lot. I just want to feel safe and comfortable, and I think you’ve given me that. So, write it all down, and then… I suppose we get started? The pills and the exercises and everything. It’s a lot to take in, but… I’ll do my best. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindsey. I'm glad I could help. Here’s your care plan. It includes everything we discussed, and I’ve also included a list of resources where you can find more information. We’ll start you on a low dose of clopidogrel and atorvastatin. I’ll also write a prescription for the physical therapy. You’ll receive a call from the therapist’s office to schedule an appointment. I’d like to see you back in three months for a follow-up appointment. We’ll check your cholesterol levels, monitor your liver function, and see how you’re tolerating the medications. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual side effects or have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call my office. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Hmm… it all looks very thorough. I think… I think I understand it. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Just… thank you. For everything. You’ve put my mind at ease. I suppose I’ll just take it one day at a time. And try to follow your instructions as best I can. Thank you again, Derell. You’re a good doctor. I’ll see you in three months. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindsey. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember to take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. We're here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in three months. .
