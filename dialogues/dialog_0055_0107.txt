DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I am Dr. EADDY. It says here you're 35 years of age. Please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, thirty-five. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but often enough it worries me. It’s hard to explain. Like a bird inside, maybe? It’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: “Flapping,” you say. A rather… colorful description, Mr. Puder. It’s good you’re taking this seriously, though many people dismiss such sensations. To clarify, when you say “funny,” can you describe the sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, not just flapping. It’s like… fast. My chest feels fast, you know? Not pain, not hurt. Just… really fast beating. Sometimes it stops quick, sometimes it takes a little time. It makes me feel tired, mostly. And a little shaky. Does that make more sense? I don't know what’s normal and what's not.
DOCTOR: “Fast beating.” Yes, that’s slightly more… clinical. And it causes fatigue and shakiness. I see. Has this been happening for a long time, Mr. Puder, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: Not long, no. Maybe… three months? It started slow, just a few times. Now it's almost every day. Not all day, but many times. It’s worse when I walk up hills, or when I try to do too much at work. Work is… heavy lifting, lots of moving things. Chemical stuff. It’s not easy work. I try to take breaks, but… you know. Things need to get done.
DOCTOR: “Chemical stuff,” you say. And heavy lifting. It’s… unfortunate you’re experiencing this alongside such physical exertion. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying these episodes, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I feel… a little short of breath. Not like I can’t breathe, but like I need to take a bigger breath. And… sometimes my chest feels tight. Not always, but when the heart is flapping, it’s tight. And a little… sweaty. My hands, mostly. I don’t usually sweat much. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath, chest tightness, and diaphoresis… Yes, that does provide a slightly clearer picture. Now, let’s review some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions previously, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don't think so. I’ve never seen a heart doctor before. I usually just go to the regular doctor for check-ups. He said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he gave me some pills, and it went down. I stopped taking them after a few months, because I felt okay. Maybe that was a mistake? I don't know much about those things.
DOCTOR: “Stopped taking the medication…” Yes, that is… suboptimal, Mr. Puder. It’s crucial to adhere to prescribed treatments, even when feeling well. It seems we have some inconsistencies to address. Do you recall the name of the medication you were prescribed for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: I… hmm. It was a white pill. Small. I think it started with an "A"? Am-lo-di-pine? Something like that. My wife, she remembers things better. She said it made me tired, and I felt dizzy sometimes, so I asked the doctor if I could stop, and he said okay. It was a long time ago, maybe five years? I just… I don’t like taking pills if I don't need them. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: “Amlodipine…” Yes, that is a common medication for hypertension. Discontinuing it without proper monitoring is… unwise. However, we can revisit that later. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination, if you'll permit me. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Then we can discuss potential causes and further investigation. Please, lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I will lie down. Is it going to be cold? I get cold easily.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be cold. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply and steadily, if you would. …Your heart rate is slightly elevated, approximately 98 beats per minute. And I detect a… faint murmur. Not particularly concerning at this stage, but something we will need to investigate further. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142/90. Pulse is irregular, but within normal limits. Let’s take another reading in a few minutes. Your weight is also noted as 119 pounds. That is… below a healthy range for your height.
PATIENT: Okay. So… what does that mean, Doctor? The fast heart and the…murmur? And the low weight? Is it something serious? I’m worried now. I just want to feel normal again. Is it the work? Should I quit? I have a family to feed…
DOCTOR: “Worried,” you say. It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Puder. However, jumping to conclusions is rarely helpful. The elevated heart rate, murmur, and low weight—in conjunction with your reported symptoms—suggest a few possibilities, but a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation. The work could be a contributing factor, but it’s premature to suggest you quit your job. We need to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray. These tests will provide more information about your overall health and help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I also recommend a referral to a cardiologist for a more specialized evaluation. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I can eat anything. And I have… insurance? I think my wife has it. But I don't know if it covers… all this. The tests and the… heart doctor. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: “Insurance…” Yes, that is… often a complicating factor. I will have my staff verify your coverage and provide you with an estimate of the costs. Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee what your insurance will cover, but we will do our best to navigate the process. We can also discuss options for financial assistance if necessary. In the meantime, I will write the orders for the tests and the cardiology referral. I suggest you schedule the tests as soon as possible. I'll also give you a list of instructions on how to prepare for each test. I advise you to limit strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of your condition. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I… I think I understand. Limit the work… tests… insurance… It’s a lot to think about. Just one thing… will I be able to work at all while I’m waiting for the results? My wife… she needs the money.
DOCTOR: “Able to work…” Mr. Puder, I cannot provide definitive medical advice without knowing the results of the tests. However, given your reported symptoms and the preliminary findings, I strongly advise you to avoid any strenuous activity until we have a clearer picture of your condition. Light duties may be permissible, but heavy lifting and physically demanding tasks are absolutely contraindicated. I will provide you with a note outlining these restrictions for your employer. It is crucial that you prioritize your health, Mr. Puder. Continuing to work while experiencing these symptoms could exacerbate your condition and delay proper diagnosis and treatment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Light work only. No heavy lifting. I will tell my boss. It will be… difficult. But I need to take care of myself. And my family. Thank you for the note. I think… I think that’s all. I will call to schedule the tests. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Puder. My staff will assist you with scheduling. Please, do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. .
