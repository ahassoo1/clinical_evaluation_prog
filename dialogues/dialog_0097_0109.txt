DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It's nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not real bad all the time, but… it’s there. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for about three days. That’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it doesn't feel like a regular headache, you know? Not like when I used to get one from working too long in the sun. This… it’s deeper. And it feels… tight. Like a band around my head, but just the back part. I try to rub it, but it doesn't help much.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, describing it as deeper and tight, like a band. And it doesn’t respond to rubbing, okay. Has anything specific seemed to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can tell. Working doesn’t make it worse. Resting doesn’t make it better. Eating… no. Drinking water… no. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe a little trouble getting to sleep sometimes, but that’s been happening for a long time, not just with the headache. It just… is there. Mostly in the afternoons, I think. But sometimes it's there in the morning too.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be pretty consistent, happening in the afternoons but also sometimes in the mornings, and doesn't really have any obvious triggers or things that relieve it. You mentioned some trouble falling asleep – how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Maybe… twenty years? Longer. I get tired, but my mind… it races. Thinking about things. Old things. Work. My wife… She passed away a long time ago now. It just makes it hard to quiet down. I don't take nothing for it. Never have. Just… try to ignore it. The sleep, I mean. Not the headache, not usually.
DOCTOR: I understand. So the difficulty with sleep has been a long-term issue, related to racing thoughts. It’s completely understandable that would make it hard to rest. And you haven't been taking anything to help with that. Now, let's focus on the headache for a moment. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. No… no dizziness. No blurry vision. No… feeling sick to my stomach. No fever. Just the headache. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but I think that’s from… old age, maybe? I don't know. I used to lift a lot of heavy things at work, you know. Rail yard work. Hard on the body.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, vision changes, nausea, or fever. You've noticed some neck stiffness, which you suspect might be related to past work. That's good information. Have you had any recent changes in your vision, even subtle ones?
PATIENT: Recent changes… well, everything’s a little blurry these days, if you know what I mean. But I don’t think it's worse than usual. I got glasses years ago, but I don’t wear them much. They don’t help a lot, and I forget where I put them. It’s just… old age again. Everything's getting harder to see. I mostly just get close to things.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some general difficulty with vision, consistent with age, and you haven't noticed any recent worsening of that. You mentioned not wearing your glasses much, and that's helpful to know. Now, let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… Doctor said my blood pressure was a little high once, years ago. But he just told me to watch my salt. So I did. Mostly. I don't think I ever had diabetes. And my heart… feels okay. Gets a little tired sometimes, but… I'm ninety years old, you know? I haven't been to the doctor much lately. Mostly just for check-ups. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, managed with dietary changes, and no known diabetes or heart problems. You haven’t been to the doctor frequently recently. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia fixed once, too. But that was… a long, long time ago. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major in recent years. I mostly just try to stay out of the hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and hernia repair in the past. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, dementia, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she lived a long life, but she got… confused near the end. I think it was her mind. Maybe like… dementia, you said? My father… he had a heart attack. A long time ago. And… my sister, she got sick with… something bad. Cancer, I think. But she lived far away, so I didn't know much about it. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of dementia in your mother, heart attack in your father, and cancer in your sister. That’s helpful to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. Never have. I just try to get by on my own. Maybe a little aspirin sometimes if I got a bad ache, but not much. I mostly just drink water. And try to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Brum, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your overall health and get a better understanding of what might be causing your headache. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological exam to see how your nerves are functioning. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright. I don't like going to the doctor, but… if you think it's necessary. Just be gentle, okay? My body isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brum. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/82. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. This is common in older adults and doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but I’ll make a note of it. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please sit on the edge of the bed for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright. Be careful now, Doctor. I don't want to fall. My legs aren't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brum. I’ll be right here to steady you. Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Your balance is a little unsteady, as you mentioned, but nothing too concerning. I'm going to check your cranial nerves now – just asking you to follow my finger with your eyes. Cranial nerves are intact. No issues there. Finally, I'm going to gently palpate your head and neck to check for tenderness. There's some mild tenderness in the muscles at the back of your neck, but no significant areas of pain or swelling. Okay, Mr. Brum, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. That wasn’t too bad. So… what do you think it is? Is it something serious? My wife… she always worried about everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, based on everything we’ve discussed and the physical exam, I don't believe it's anything immediately serious. It sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders. The racing thoughts and difficulty sleeping could be contributing to the tension, creating a bit of a cycle. However, given your age and family history, I do want to rule out a few other possibilities. While unlikely, we should get a better look at your brain to make sure there isn’t anything else going on. I’d like to order a brain scan - specifically an MRI. It’s a painless test, and will give us a clear picture of what’s happening inside your head. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… Is that expensive? I don't have much money, you know. And… will it take a long time? I don't like being stuck in places. My wife… she didn’t like hospitals either.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Brum. I understand your worries about the cost and the time commitment. Yes, MRIs can be expensive, and I want to assure you we'll explore all options to make it affordable. We have financial assistance programs available, and I can connect you with a patient advocate who can help you navigate the costs. The scan itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. It's a completely painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table, and the machine makes some loud noises, but you’ll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. If you're uncomfortable with the idea of an MRI, we can discuss other options, although they won't be as detailed. We could try medication to manage the headaches and focus on relaxation techniques. However, given your age and family history, I strongly recommend the MRI to rule out anything serious. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques… That sounds… nice. But my mind… it just won’t quiet down. Medication… I don’t like taking pills. But the scan… it sounds scary. And expensive. Maybe… maybe we could try something else first? Just for a little while? See if the headaches get better on their own? I don’t want to spend a lot of money if I don’t need to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brum. It’s completely reasonable to want to avoid unnecessary tests and medication, especially given your concerns. We can certainly try a conservative approach first. We can focus on managing your headaches with over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or acetaminophen – as needed. I also want to explore some strategies to help with your racing thoughts and improve your sleep. I’m going to recommend some simple relaxation exercises, like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. There are also some helpful resources online and in the community for mindfulness and meditation. I can provide you with a list of those resources. We’ll monitor your symptoms closely over the next four weeks. If your headaches worsen, don't respond to over-the-counter medication, or if you develop any new symptoms – like dizziness, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – we’ll need to reconsider the MRI. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That… sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. Relaxation exercises… I can try that. And the over-the-counter medicine. Maybe that will be enough. I just want to feel better. I miss… doing things. Can you write down the name of those exercises? And the medicine? My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. Here you go. I’ve written down the names of some simple relaxation exercises – deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. You can find guided instructions online by searching for those terms. I’ve also written down the dosage for ibuprofen or acetaminophen – both are available over the counter. Ibuprofen: 200-400 milligrams every 4-6 hours as needed, with food. Acetaminophen: 500-1000 milligrams every 4-6 hours as needed. Please don’t exceed the maximum daily dose listed on the label. I’m also going to give you a handout with a list of resources for mindfulness and meditation. It includes some local classes and websites. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you're doing. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me. You’ve been very kind. I hope the exercises help. It’s just… hard to quiet my mind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was my pleasure. It is hard to quiet the mind, and it takes practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. I’m optimistic that we can find some ways to manage your headaches and improve your overall well-being. Please take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in four weeks. If anything changes before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Brum.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
