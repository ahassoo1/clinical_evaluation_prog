DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen, you see. And... I have a heart thing. Atrial... something. It's been diagnosed, but I forget the full name. It makes my heart beat funny sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Swollen leg and a heart condition... let’s start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm... that would be... maybe two weeks ago now? It started small, just a little puffiness around my ankle, but it's gotten bigger since then. It’s mostly in my calf, now. It feels… tight, and a bit achy if I stand for too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, two weeks, starting in the ankle and now in the calf, tighter and achier with standing. Is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It’s definitely worse at the end of the day, after I've been on my feet teaching. I teach computer science, you see, so I do quite a lot of walking between the computers and the students. It feels a bit better after I sit and rest it for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Worse at the end of the day with activity, better with rest. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg, or any pain when you press on it?
PATIENT: Let me see... No, it doesn’t feel particularly warm, and the colour looks normal, I think. It doesn't hurt much when I press it, just feels... firm. Not really painful though, no. It's more of a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, firm, dull ache, no redness or warmth. And you mentioned teaching computer science. Do you do a lot of travelling for work, or do you mostly stay local?
PATIENT: No, not much travelling. I teach at the local college, so it’s just the commute there and back. I mostly stay in town. I walk quite a bit at the college, but it's not a long journey to get there. Perhaps a twenty-minute walk each way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a consistent 20-minute walk each way. Now, about this “heart thing” you mentioned – Atrial… something. Do you remember what the doctor told you when they diagnosed it?
PATIENT: It was a long time ago, and I'm terrible with remembering names… They said my heart wasn't beating regularly, and that could cause… clots? Something about blood not flowing properly. They put me on some medicine, a small white pill, but I haven't been keeping up with it very well, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Okay, irregular heartbeat, risk of clots, and you're on medication, but haven’t been consistent with taking it. Do you remember the name of the medication, or perhaps what it was for, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no, I don’t. The name escapes me entirely. They said it was to… thin the blood? To stop the clots forming, I think. It didn’t have any side effects, as far as I noticed, which is why I... well, I suppose I just forgot about it a bit. It's silly, really. I know I should be taking it.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication to thin the blood, not taken consistently. That's good to know, and it's alright, it happens. Let’s get a quick look at your leg, just to assess the swelling. Could you sit on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. There you go. Do you need me to take my shoes off?
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you wouldn't mind. That will help me get a better look.
PATIENT: All done. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I don't mean to be a bother, Doctor, but I'm not very good with medical things.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all, Nixon. Just checking for redness, warmth, comparing the size of both legs, and feeling for tenderness. Okay, the swelling is definitely more pronounced on your left leg. No significant redness or warmth, thankfully. And it is firm to the touch, as you said. I'm going to measure the circumference of both calves, just to get an accurate comparison. Alright, your left calf is about 2 centimeters larger than your right. That’s a notable difference.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… worrying. Two centimeters is quite a lot, isn’t it? Is that bad? Should I be concerned about this swelling?
DOCTOR: It's good you're paying attention to it, and it's okay to feel concerned. Two centimeters is enough to investigate. Given your history of the irregular heartbeat and being on medication to thin your blood, we need to rule out a blood clot in your leg, known as a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. We'll also want to check how well your heart is functioning. Are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or coughing up any blood?
PATIENT: Oh dear, a blood clot... That doesn't sound good at all! No, no chest pain, thankfully. And I haven't had any shortness of breath, no. My breathing feels perfectly normal, and I haven't coughed anything up. Just... the swollen leg and the funny heartbeat sometimes. What sort of tests will you need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. We're going to start with a blood test called a D-dimer. This can help rule out a blood clot, but it's not always definitive. If that comes back positive, or if we’re still concerned, we’ll need an ultrasound of your left leg to look for the clot directly. I’m also going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm and see how well your heart is functioning. Would you be able to tell me the name of the cardiologist who diagnosed your irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... His name was... Dr. MacIntyre! Yes, that's it. Dr. MacIntyre. He practices at the city hospital. I haven’t seen him in quite a while, though. Years, I think. He was very good, but... well, I suppose I just kept putting off follow-up appointments. Will the tests be painful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. MacIntyre at City Hospital, good to know. We can reach out to him for your records if needed. And no, the tests won't be painful. The blood test is just a quick prick of the finger or arm, and the EKG involves sticking small, painless stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It measures the electrical activity of your heart. I’m going to have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll get you set up for the EKG. Is there anything else you want to ask me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience with me. I suppose I should have come in sooner, but… well, you know how it is. Let’s get the tests done then, shall we?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's always better to be safe than sorry. And I completely understand. The nurse will be in shortly to get started with the blood work. I'll also get the order for the EKG sent over to the technician. We’ll get some answers for you as quickly as possible. In the meantime, try to elevate your left leg whenever you can, and avoid prolonged standing or sitting. We’ll talk about medication options once we have the test results. Do you have any allergies to any medications, by the way?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’m allergic to penicillin. It gives me a very nasty rash, and makes me feel quite unwell. Apart from that, I don't have any allergies, as far as I know. Thank you for asking, Doctor. It’s easy to forget these things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy noted. Good to know. The nurse should be with you any moment to draw the blood. We’ll take it from there. Nurse Davies, could you please come in here when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Thank you, Doctor. I hope everything will be alright. .
