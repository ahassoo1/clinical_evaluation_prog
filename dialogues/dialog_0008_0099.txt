DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received the results from that… examination of my stomach – the one with the little camera, you see – and the doctor’s office said it showed something wasn't quite right. I was hoping you could explain it to me. It was a bit concerning, and frankly, I haven’t a clue what it all means.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis. I see. An endoscopy result. Yes, those can be a little… technical. Let me pull up the report here… Alright. It says you had an upper endoscopy performed on July 15th. And the report indicates some mild inflammation and a few small polyps were found in the stomach. Now, “inflammation” just means some irritation in the lining of your stomach. Polyps are small growths – most are benign, but we do want to take a look at them. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, July 15th… that’s right. Thank you for confirming the date. Well, I’d been having a bit of discomfort, you see. Not pain, exactly, but a… a queasiness, mostly after I eat. And some bloating. It wasn’t constant, but frequent enough to be worrisome. My regular physician suggested the examination to rule things out. He mentioned something about it being good to check, especially given my age. He was very thorough, that doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasiness and bloating after eating… that’s helpful. And it’s good your regular physician was proactive. Has this discomfort been getting worse, staying the same, or better over the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I believe it’s been… fairly consistent, actually. It hasn’t dramatically worsened, thankfully. But it hasn’t improved either. There are days when it’s barely noticeable, and then others where I feel it quite distinctly after a meal. It’s rather unpredictable, if I’m honest. Mostly, I just try to eat smaller portions.
DOCTOR: Alright, consistent but not worsening is good to know. And adjusting your diet makes sense. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the queasiness and bloating?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No vomiting, no… blood in my stool. My appetite has been normal, although I have been eating less, simply because I don’t want to feel unwell afterwards. And no weight loss, thankfully. I’ve always been rather… slender, but I haven’t noticed any recent changes in that regard. Just the discomfort after eating, primarily. Oh, and occasionally a bit of… gas. But who doesn’t have gas, really?
DOCTOR: You're right, everyone has gas. Okay, no vomiting, no blood in stool, normal appetite, no weight loss... that's all good information. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, Doctor. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, decades ago. That’s about it, really. No diabetes, no heart problems, no… allergies that I know of. I've always been quite healthy, all things considered. Though, as I mentioned to the office, my husband… he had some rather significant heart issues. Passed away a few years back, I’m afraid. It’s… been difficult. But as for my health, I’ve been fortunate.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband, Denis. That must have been very difficult. Alright, appendix removed, no other major medical conditions. Have you ever had any other surgeries or procedures besides your appendix removal?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. Just the appendix, many years ago. And, of course, the endoscopy recently. I try to avoid hospitals and procedures whenever possible. I’ve always been a bit… apprehensive about them. Though, I understand they are sometimes necessary. I suppose this endoscopy was one of those times.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like stomach cancer, ulcers, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky question, Doctor. My family… we weren't terribly forthcoming about health issues, to be honest. It wasn’t something we discussed much. My mother… she had some stomach troubles, I recall, but I never knew the specifics. It was… a long time ago. And my father… he was a strong, silent type. He rarely complained about anything. So, I’m afraid I don’t have much information to offer you. It’s frustrating, I know. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. It’s not uncommon for families to not discuss health history. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not at all, Doctor. I’ve never been one for those things. I was raised in a very… traditional household. Smoking and drinking were simply not done. And I certainly wouldn’t touch recreational drugs. I prefer a quiet life, a good book, and a cup of herbal tea. That’s my vice, if you can call it one.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That’s very good. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication in the past. I’ve taken antibiotics, pain relievers… the usual things, when needed. Nothing significant. And no allergies to foods or anything else either. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. I have a very… simple system, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Denis, thank you for that thorough information. So, we have mild inflammation and a few small polyps found on endoscopy, no significant medical history, no family history of digestive issues, and no allergies. Given your symptoms – the queasiness and bloating after eating – and the findings from the endoscopy, my initial thought is that you may have mild gastritis. That’s inflammation of the stomach lining. The polyps are the thing we need to investigate further. I’d like to order a biopsy of those polyps to determine if they are benign or if further treatment is needed. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A biopsy… yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it helps determine what's causing the issue, then yes, absolutely. I trust your judgment. What does a biopsy entail, exactly? And will it be… uncomfortable? I confess, I do get rather anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Denis, and it’s perfectly reasonable. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the polyps during another endoscopy. It’s usually done with a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached. We’ll pass it through your mouth, down your esophagus, and into your stomach. During the procedure, you'll be sedated, so you shouldn’t feel any pain or discomfort. You might feel a little pressure or fullness, but it shouldn’t be anything significant. The procedure usually takes about 30-60 minutes. After the procedure, you’ll need someone to drive you home, and you should take it easy for the rest of the day. We’ll send the sample to a lab for analysis, and the results should be back in about a week. The biggest risk with the procedure is a small chance of bleeding, but that’s rare. We'll monitor you closely afterwards. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Sedated… that’s… reassuring. A week for the results… that seems manageable. And you’ll monitor me for bleeding… yes, that’s good. It sounds… more straightforward than I anticipated, actually. I still don’t like the idea of having a camera in my stomach, but knowing I won’t be awake for it is a comfort. Yes, Doctor, I think… I think I’m willing to proceed with the biopsy. When would that be scheduled? And is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Denis. I’m glad to hear that. Our scheduling department can get you set up for next week, likely sometime between Tuesday and Thursday. They’ll call you to confirm a specific time that works for you. As for preparation, you'll need to fast for at least six hours before the procedure - no food or liquids. We also ask that you arrange for someone to drive you home afterwards, as you won’t be able to drive yourself. If you take any blood thinners, we’ll need to discuss stopping them a few days before the procedure, but the scheduling department will go over all of that with you in detail. Do you have any questions for me right now about the procedure or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. The scheduling department will contact me with the specifics… and remind me about the fasting and the driver. That’s very helpful. Thank you, Doctor Cumper. You’ve been very thorough and… patient with my anxieties. I feel much more at ease knowing what to expect. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I understand that these things can be unsettling. My priority is ensuring you feel informed and comfortable. If anything comes up before the procedure, or if you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. I’ll make a note to check on your results as soon as they’re available. For now, try not to worry too much. We’ll take it one step at a time. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all. Truly. Thank you again for your kindness and… your expertise. I feel much better prepared now. I shall await the call from the scheduling department, and… try to remain calm. Have a good day, Doctor Cumper. And thank you, once again.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Denis. And remember, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Take care. .
