DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It's my foot. It's been…troubling me for a little while now. Hurts a lot, it does.
DOCTOR: Okay, your foot. And how long have you been having this pain, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. A few months, maybe? It started small, just a little ache. I didn’t think much of it at first. But it’s gotten worse, you see. Now it really bothers me when I walk.
DOCTOR: A few months. And where exactly on your foot is the pain?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. On the bottom. It’s…it’s a sore, I think. And it hurts when I put weight on it. It feels…deep. Not just on the skin, you understand?
DOCTOR: Deep pain, alright. Have you noticed any swelling or redness around that area?
PATIENT: A little bit of redness, yes. Not much, but…it’s there. And sometimes…sometimes it feels warm to the touch. I haven't noticed much swelling, though. Just the redness and the warm feeling. It’s hard to tell sometimes, with my old skin, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s take a look. I'm going to need to examine your foot. Just lie back on the exam table for me, please. We'll start with a quick visual inspection, then I'll feel around to see what we're dealing with. Do you have any open sores or wounds on your feet that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There is a sore. That’s what’s been worrying me the most. It’s…it’s on the bottom of my foot, right where I said. It’s not a big one, but it doesn’t seem to be getting better. I'll lie down now. Is it alright if I take my time? These old bones don’t move so quick anymore.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Stoegbauer. Absolutely. I’ll just get the table adjusted here. And don’t worry, we’ll figure this out. Whenever you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here we go. It’s right there, Doctor. You’ll see it. It’s not very pretty. I try to keep it clean, but…it just doesn’t seem to heal. I worry about my sugar, you know? The doctor always talks about my sugar.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me have a look. Hmm. Yes, I see it. It’s a small ulcer, looks to be about…half a centimeter in diameter. There's some surrounding redness and a bit of…granulation tissue. Does this cause you any pain when I touch it here?
PATIENT: Ooh…yes, that’s tender. Not terrible, but…I can feel it. A little sharp pain, right there. It's worse when you press down like that. It feels…deep, like you said. Not just on the skin. It's good you're looking at it, Doctor. I've been worried about this for a long time now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pulses are present, but a bit diminished, to be honest. And sensation…seems somewhat reduced in your toes. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Hmm…numbness…sometimes, yes. Not all the time, but…especially at night. It feels like my feet are…asleep, you know? And tingling…yes, that too. A little bit. Mostly in my toes. It comes and goes. I thought it was just old age, to be honest. Things stop working when you get old, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given the ulcer, the diminished pulses, reduced sensation, and the numbness and tingling you’re experiencing, I’m concerned about potential peripheral artery disease and a possible diabetic foot ulcer. You mentioned your sugar…do you know what your last A1c was?
PATIENT: A1c…? Oh dear. I…I don't remember, Doctor. I go to the doctor regularly, and they take blood tests, of course. But I don't always pay attention to the numbers. They just tell me to watch my sugar. I try, but it's hard. I’m not good with those things, Doctor. I just know I have to be careful. Is that a bad thing? This…peripheral…what was it? Is that serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Stoegbauer, it can be serious. Peripheral artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that reduces blood flow to your limbs, usually your legs and feet. And when you have reduced blood flow, wounds like this ulcer don't heal well, and they can get infected. We need to get a better handle on your blood sugar and assess the circulation in your legs. I'm going to order some blood work, including an A1c, and a vascular ultrasound to check the arteries in your legs. We also need to keep this ulcer clean and protected. I’ll write you a prescription for some special dressings and refer you to a podiatrist for wound care. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that sounds…frightening. Infection…I don't want an infection. Allergies…no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a problem with medicine before. Just…a little sensitive skin, sometimes. But no allergies. And…what was that other thing? Podiatrist? Is that a foot doctor? Will they be able to help my foot?
DOCTOR: Yes, a podiatrist is a foot doctor. And yes, they specialize in foot care. They can help with the ulcer, make sure it's properly cleaned and dressed, and monitor it for infection. They can also help manage any complications. We're going to take this one step at a time, Mr. Stoegbauer. First, we'll get these tests done so we can see what's going on. Then, we’ll get you scheduled with the podiatrist. And in the meantime, try to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. I’m going to write you a note for a temporary medical leave from work, just to give your foot a chance to rest. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good…very good. Rest…yes, I can do that. Work isn't as important as my foot, you know? Medications…let me see. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. And something for my cholesterol, maybe? The doctor gives me a lot of pills. I can’t always remember the names. They're all little white pills. I have a bag at home, if that helps. Would it be easier if I brought the bag with me next time? I don’t want to forget anything important.
DOCTOR: Bringing the bag next time would be extremely helpful, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's very important that we have a complete list of your medications to avoid any interactions. Alright, I’m printing out the lab orders, a referral to Dr. Nakamura, the podiatrist, and the temporary medical leave note. Here are the instructions for wound care in the meantime: keep the area clean and dry, change the dressing daily, and avoid putting weight on your foot as much as possible. And please, call the office immediately if you notice any signs of infection – redness, swelling, pus, or fever. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Dr. Nakamura…yes, that's good. I will try to remember that name. Pus…what does pus look like? And…how long will it take to see Dr. Nakamura? I don't want to wait too long. And…will this mean I can't walk? I like to walk, you see. I walk to the store, and I walk to church… I don't want to lose that.
DOCTOR: Pus is usually thick, yellowish or greenish fluid that comes from the wound. It's a sign that there’s an infection. We’ll get you an appointment with Dr. Nakamura as quickly as possible – I’ll have the office call you tomorrow with the details. As for walking, it depends on the severity of the condition. We need to assess the blood flow and see how well the wound is healing. The goal is to get you back to walking, but we need to be careful and follow the podiatrist’s recommendations. I understand your concerns, Mr. Stoegbauer. We will do everything we can to get you back on your feet, but it’s going to require some patience and cooperation. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all…for now. Thank you for your help. I’ll bring my bag of pills next time. And I'll call if anything gets worse. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, even if I don't understand it all. Maybe I should just take it easy for a while, like you said. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take it easy, Mr. Stoegbauer. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll see you next time. .
