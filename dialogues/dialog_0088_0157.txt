DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Tasmia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s not that high, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, even if it doesn’t feel high, consistently elevated blood pressure can lead to some serious health problems down the road. The nurse gave me the readings, and we want to investigate it further. To start, can you tell me a bit more about when you first found out your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: Elevated? Look, I went for a check-up with my regular doctor last month because my husband made me. He worries too much. She said something about numbers being a little high, told me to watch my salt and come back in three months. That’s it. I don’t even remember the numbers. Honestly, I have a lot going on.
DOCTOR: I understand. Life gets busy. And it's common to not remember specific numbers. Three months is a bit long to wait if there was concern, though. Okay, so it was detected at a routine check-up last month. Have you been experiencing any symptoms since then – things like headaches, vision changes, shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Headaches? Maybe. I get those sometimes. But that’s just stress, you know? Work is… demanding. And no, nothing else. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I don’t understand why I'm even here wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Headaches can sometimes be associated with high blood pressure, but they can also be caused by many other things, as you said. We'll need to look at the bigger picture. Let's talk about your work a little more. What kind of work do you do, and would you describe it as particularly stressful?
PATIENT: I'm a civil engineering tech. Mostly I'm in the field, checking on construction sites, making sure things are up to code. It’s a lot of running around, dealing with… people. And yes, it’s stressful. Everyone thinks they're an expert, you know? Always questioning things, slowing everything down. It’s irritating. Look, are we getting somewhere with this or what?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. That does sound stressful, and prolonged stress can definitely contribute to elevated blood pressure. Okay, let's move on to some other things that could be playing a role. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: My grandma, on my mother’s side, had something with her heart. She was… older. And my uncle, he smoked a lot. But that was… a long time ago. I don’t really keep track of all that. It doesn’t really concern me. Is this going to take much longer? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Knowing about family history helps us understand your risk. Okay, so grandma had a heart condition and your uncle smoked. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I don’t take anything. I prefer to deal with things myself. I eat mostly healthy, I try to get some exercise when I can, and I don't really believe in all those pills doctors push. They just cause more problems, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I respect your choices. We'll certainly explore all options, and medication isn't always the first step. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy. Look, I'm starting to feel like you're just trying to find something wrong with me. Are you sure these numbers were even right?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I want to assure you that I'm not trying to find something wrong. My goal is to understand what's going on and to help you stay healthy. The nurse is very reliable, but readings can sometimes fluctuate. That's why we want to get a better picture. Let me just quickly check your EHR to see what other information we have... Okay, the nurse documented a blood pressure of 142/92 mmHg today, and your weight is 104 pounds and height 184 cm. To get a more accurate reading and rule out any temporary factors, I'd like to take your blood pressure myself now, if that's alright. We'll also listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick physical exam. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I told you, I have a meeting. The quicker this is, the better. And don't tell me to relax, it doesn't work.
DOCTOR: Okay. I won't ask you to relax. I'll just need you to sit still and keep your arm supported at heart level. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/96 mmHg. And I'm hearing a normal heart rhythm. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. This will just take a moment. Everything seems normal there as well. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. You think I look like someone who would do those things? I have responsibilities. I need to be sharp for work. Honestly, this line of questioning is ridiculous. I'm a professional. My husband would kill me if he knew you were asking me this. It’s insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive or insulting. I ask these questions of all my patients to get a complete picture of their health. It's not a judgment. Alright, let's focus on what we do know. You're experiencing elevated blood pressure, you have a family history of heart conditions, and you lead a busy, stressful life. Based on what we've discussed, I suspect your high blood pressure could be related to stress and lifestyle factors. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I recommend we do some additional blood work to check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and cholesterol. We should also do an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would you be willing to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever tests you need to do, just do them. I want this over with. Can't you just give me something for the stress? A pill, or something? This is ridiculous. I have a job to do. A real job.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Medication is an option, but I prefer to have a complete understanding of your health before prescribing anything. We need to see the results of the tests first to determine the best course of action. I’ll order the blood work and EKG. The lab is just down the hall; you can go anytime today. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying some stress-reduction techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness. I can give you some resources on those if you'd like. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I’m done. Just get me out of here. I have a meeting. Really. A meeting. I don’t need resources. I need to work. Just… tell the nurse I’m leaving. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay. I completely understand. I'll have the nurse give you the lab orders and directions. I hope you have a productive meeting, Tasmia. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Nurse, please see Tasmia out and provide her with the lab orders. .
